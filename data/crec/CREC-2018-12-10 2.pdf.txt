the payment yield that would otherwise be used
in calculating any price loss coverage payment
for each covered commodity on the farm for
which the election is made.
‘‘(2) METHOD OF UPDATING YIELDS FOR COV-
ERED COMMODITIES.—If the owner of a farm
elects to update yields under paragraph (1), the
payment yield for a covered commodity on the
farm, for the purpose of calculating price loss
coverage payments only, shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying—
‘‘(A) 90 percent;
‘‘(B) the average of the yield per planted acre
for the crop of covered commodities on the farm
for the 2013 through 2017 crop years, as deter-
mined by the Secretary, excluding any crop year
in which the acreage planted to the covered
commodity was zero; and

covered commodity, as determined by the Sec-
retary.
‘‘(3) LIMITATION.—In no case shall the ratio
obtained under paragraph (2)(C) be less than 90
percent or greater than 100 percent.

purposes of determining the average yield per
planted acre under paragraph (2)(B), if the
yield per planted acre for a crop of a covered
commodity for a farm for any of the crop years
described in that subparagraph was less than 75
percent of the average of county yields for those
crop years for that commodity, the Secretary
shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to
75 percent of the average of the 2013 through
2017 county yield for the covered commodity.

case of seed cotton, for purposes of determining
the average of the yield per planted acre under
this subsection, the average yield for seed cotton
per planted acre shall be equal to 2.4 times the
average yield for upland cotton per planted
acre.
‘‘(6) TIME FOR ELECTION.—An election under
this subsection shall be made at a time and man-
ner so as to be in effect beginning with the 2020
crop year, as determined by the Secretary.’’.

duction in payment acres is made under this
subsection, the Secretary shall consider such
base acres to be planted, or prevented from

JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE
COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE
The managers on the part of the Senate
and the House at the conference on the dis-
agreeing votes of the two Houses on the
amendment of the Senate to the bill, H.R. 2,
to provide for the reform and continuation of
agricultural and other programs of the De-
partment of Agriculture through fiscal year
2023, and for other purposes, submit the fol-
lowing joint statement to the Senate and the
House in explanation of the effect of the ac-
tion agreed upon by the managers and rec-
ommended in the accompanying conference
report:
The Senate amendment struck all of the
House bill after the enacting clause and in-
serted a substitute text.
The House recedes from its disagreement
to the amendment of the Senate with an
amendment that is a substitute for the
House bill and the Senate amendment.
The differences between the House bill, the
Senate amendment, and the substitute
agreed to in conference are noted below, ex-
cept for clerical corrections, conforming
changes made necessary by agreements
reached by the conferees, and minor drafting
and clarifying changes.
TITLE I—COMMODITIES
(1) Definitions
The House bill proposes a freestanding
version of the farm program statutory
framework, and provides definitions for 24
terms applicable to the commodity program
provisions in subtitles A and B of the Act.
Most are the same as current law, with ex-
ceptions in the following paragraphs of sec-
tion 1111: (4) Base Acres: technical change is
made to cross reference the same definition
in the 2014 Act; (5) Covered Commodities: up-
dated to include seed cotton in the under-
lying definition; (7) Effective Reference
Price: defined to mean the lesser of: (A) An
amount equal to 115% of the reference price
for such covered commodity; or (B) An
amount equal to the greater of—(i) the ref-
erence price for such covered commodity; or
(ii) 85 percent of the average of the mar-
keting year average price of the covered
commodity for the most recent 5 crop years,
excluding each of the crop years with the
highest and lowest marketing year average
price. (9) Marketing Year Average Price: in-
cluded as defined term in lieu of repeated
references to ‘‘national average market price
received by producers during the 12-month
marketing year for a covered commodity’’;
(13) Payment Yield: conforming amendment
is included to reflect reenactment of new
Title I provisions. (21) Temperate Japonica
Rice: the reference to one-time reallocation
of base acres under the Agriculture Act of
2014 is deleted. The House bill also deletes
the current law definitions of ‘‘County Cov-
erage’’ and ‘‘Individual Coverage’’, con-
sistent with the House bill’s proposal to re-
peal the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) in-
dividual program. The definition of ‘‘Generic
Base Acres’’ is also omitted. (Section 1111)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to add a
definition of ‘‘effective reference price’’ to
section 1111 of the Agricultural Act of 2014.
(Section 1101)
(2) Base Acres
The House bill deletes the provisions in
section 1112(a) of the Agricultural Act of 2014
governing the 2009 through 2012 crop year-
based 1-time base reallocation. (Section
1112(a)–(c)(2))
The Senate amendment amends section
1112(c)(2) to make a technical correction to
update the reference to the wetlands reserve
program to wetland reserve easements. (Sec-
tion 1709(a))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 1102(a))
The Managers expect the Farm Service
Agency (FSA) to provide information to pro-
ducers regarding the treatment of base on a
farm prior to a producer making a decision
on whether or not to reenroll the farm in a
CRP contract.
(3) Base Acres-Treatment of Unplanted Base
Acres
The House bill requires that in the case of
a farm on which no covered commodities (in-
cluding seed cotton) were planted during 2009
through 2017, the Secretary shall allocate all
base acres on the farm to unassigned crop
base for which no payment shall be made
under the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) or ARC
programs.
The House bill also requires the Secretary
to ensure that producers do not reconstitute
the farm to void or change the treatment of
base acres section 1112. (Section 1112(c)((3)–
(c)(4))
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to pro-
vide that in the case of a farm on which all
of the cropland was planted to grass or pas-
ture (including cropland that was idle or fal-
low), as determined by the Secretary, during
2009 through 2017, the Secretary shall main-
tain all base acres and payment yields for
the covered commodities on the farm, except
that no payment shall be made with respect
to those base acres under the PLC or ARC
programs for the 2019 through 2023 crop
years. In addition, producers on a farm for
which all the base acres are maintained
under this provision are ineligible for the op-
tion to change their PLC/ARC election under
new section 1115(h) of the Agricultural Act of
2014 as added by section 1105 of the bill. (Sec-
tion 1102(b))
The Managers intend for base acreage on
entire farms planted to grass and pasture to
be limited to include only FSA crop codes for
grass (subcategories of grass and native
grass) and idle (subcategories of fallow and
idle) for the purposes of the provision. The
Managers intend for FSA to electronically
maintain all of the base acres on the farm as
the crop base for the covered commodity,
along with program payment yields for the
farm. The Managers do not intend for the
base acres to be categorized as unassigned
crop base, nor that unassigned crop base will
be affected by this provision.
The Managers do not intend for base acre-
age planted to annual forages, such as sor-
ghum-sudangrass or grazed commodities, to
be considered planted to grass and pasture
for the purposes of the provision. The Man-
agers do not intend for base acreage assigned
to idle crop codes (other than those for the
subcategories of idle and fallow) and for base
acreage under a CRP contract to be consid-
ered planted to grass and pasture for the pur-
poses of the provision.
The Managers expect FSA to consult with
the Committees during the process of identi-
fying the base acreage that they determine
to be subject to new section 1112(d)(3).
(4) Payment Yields—Designated Oilseeds
The House bill provides for the establish-
ment of designated oilseed yields for a farm
that does not have a payment yield under
the Agricultural Act of 2014 (same as current
law).
The House bill also increases the payment
yield for designated oilseeds from 75 percent
to 90 percent of the average yield per planted
acre for the most recent 5 years. (Section
1113)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to clar-
ify that the payment yield for designated oil-
seeds shall be established at 90 percent of the
average yield per planted acre for the most
recent 5 years shall apply only with respect
to oilseed designated after the date of enact-
ment of the Agriculture Improvement Act of
2018. (Section 1103(a))
(5) Payment Yields-Single Opportunity to Up-
date Yields in Counties Affected by Drought
The House bill provides: (1) a single oppor-
tunity for the owner of a farm to update
yields only where the farm is physically lo-
cated in a county that experienced 20 or
more consecutive weeks of exceptional
drought during 2008 through 2012; (2) by cov-
ered-commodity, yields may be updated at
90% of average yield per planted acre for the
2013 through 2017 crop years (excluding any
year in which the acreage planted to the cov-
ered commodity was zero); (3) if the farm-
level yield is less than 75% of the average
county yield for a covered commodity for
any of the years, then the Secretary shall as-
sign 75% of the 2013–2017 average county
yield for the covered commodity for that
crop year; (4) the election must be made in
time for the 2019 crop year; and (5) the aver-
age yield for seed cotton per planted acre
equals 2.4 times the average yield for upland
cotton per planted acre. (Section 1113(c))
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to pro-
vide the owners of all farms in the country a
one-time opportunity to update the payment
yield that would otherwise be used in calcu-
lating any PLC payment for each covered
commodity on the farm, based on a formula
specified in the statute, to be in effect begin-
ning with the 2020 crop year. (Section 1103(b))
(6) Payment Acres
The House bill amends the minimum 10
base acre test for PLC or ARC payments to
provide an exception for producers who col-
lectively have more than 10 base acres across

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9957
December 10, 2018
all farms in which they have an interest.
Section 1114(c)(4) provides that for each crop
year for which fruits, vegetables (other than
mung beans and pulse crops), or wild rice are
planted to base acres on a farm for which a
reduction in payment acres is made, the Sec-
retary shall consider such base acres to be
planted, or prevented from planting, to a
covered commodity for purposes of any ad-
justment or reduction of base acres for the
farm under section 1112 of the Agricultural
Act of 2014. (Section 1114)
The Senate amendment amends current
law section 1114(e) of the Agricultural Act of
2014 to provide that: (A) if the Secretary re-
calculates base acres for a farm while a farm
is engaged in planting and production of
fruits, vegetables, or wild rice on base acres
for which a reduction in payment acres was
made, that planting and production shall be
considered to be the same as the planting
and production of a covered commodity; and
(B) this provision does not authorize the Sec-
retary to recalculate base acres for a farm.
(Section 1101)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to add
beginning and veteran farmers or ranchers to
the current law exception for socially dis-
advantaged farmers and ranchers from the
minimum 10 base acre test for PLC or ARC
payments. (Section 1104)
(7) Producer Election
The House bill deletes references to ARC
Individual coverage, but otherwise is con-
sistent with current law, providing that fail-
ure to make a unanimous election for the
2019 crop year results in no program pay-
ments on the farm for the 2019 crop year, and
that the producers on the farm are deemed
to have elected PLC for all covered commod-
ities on the farm for the 2020–2023 crop years.
(Section 1115)
The Senate amendment makes current law
section 1115(a) applicable for the 2019
through 2023 crop years. The Senate amend-
ment also amends current law 1115(c) to pro-
vide that failure to make a unanimous elec-
tion for the 2019 crop year results in no pro-
gram payments to the farm for the 2019 crop
year, and the producers on the farm are
deemed to have elected ARC county coverage
for all covered commodities on the farm for
the 2020–2023 crop years. (Section 1102)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that fail-
ure to make a unanimous election for the
2019 crop year results in no program pay-
ments to the farm for the 2019 crop year, and
the producers on the farm are deemed to
have elected the same coverage for each cov-
ered commodity on the farm for the 2020
through 2023 crop years as was applicable for
the 2015 through 2018 crop years. (Section
1105)
(8) Option to Change Producer Election
The Senate amendment amends section
1115 by adding a new subsection (h) to pro-
vide that for the 2021 crop year, all of the
producers on a farm may make a one-time,
irrevocable election to change the election
applicable to the producers on the farm to
PLC or ARC, which shall apply to the pro-
ducers on the farm for each of the 2021, 2022,
and 2023 crop years. (Section 1106)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to allow
producers an opportunity to change program
elections annually beginning with crop year
2021. (Section 1105(5))
The Managers intend for eligible producers
to have the opportunity to voluntarily
change program elections annually begin-
ning with crop year 2021 under similar terms
as the crop year 2019 election, including
unanimous elections on a farm-by-farm and
covered commodity-by-covered commodity
basis. However, the Managers do not intend
for FSA to require producers to make a new
election or to reaffirm previous elections in
crop year 2021 or each crop year thereafter.
This is an option to be exercised solely at
the discretion of the producers on the farm.
(9) One time filing for ARC and PLC
The House bill provides the following: (a)
During the first enrollment period an-
nounced by the Farm Service Agency (FSA)
after the date of the enactment, producers
on a farm may file a one-time program con-
tract with the Secretary to enroll in ARC or
PLC through crop year 2023. (b) In the case of
a change in a farming operation for which
producers on a farm have filed a one-time
program contract, the producers must file an
updated program contract with the Sec-
retary not later than one year after such
change in the farming operation occurs. (c)
The Secretary shall provide to each producer
that files a one-time program contract a no-
tice that includes the applicable annual and
other periodic reporting requirements. (d)
The Secretary shall issue regulations nec-
essary to carry out this section; and revise
section 1412.41 of title 7, Code of Federal Reg-
ulations, in accordance with this section.
(Section 1612)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(10) Price Loss Coverage
The House bill, effective for crop years
2019–2023, sets the PLC payment rate as the
difference between (1) the effective reference
price and (2) the effective price.
In order to reflect price premiums, the
House bill provides a reference price for tem-
perate japonica rice in an amount equal to
(1) the effective price established for long
grain rice, multiplied by the ratio obtained
by dividing: (A) the simple average of the
marketing year average price of medium
grain rice from the 2012 through 2016 crop
years; by (B) the simple average of the mar-
keting year average price of all rice from the
2012 through 2016 crop years. (Section 1116)
The Senate amendment amends section
1116 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 to extend
PLC provisions through crop year 2023, with
an amendment to require that within 30 days
after the end of each applicable 12 month
marketing year for each covered commodity,
the Secretary shall publish the payment rate
determined under 1116(c). (Section 1103)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to re-
quire that within 30 days after the end of
each applicable 12-month marketing year for
each covered commodity, the Secretary shall
publish the payment rate determined under
1116(c). (Section 1106)
(11) Agriculture Risk Coverage
The House bill enacts the same provisions
as current law for ARC county coverage ap-
plicable to crop years 2019 through 2023. By
omission ARC individual would expire at the
end of the 2018 crop year.
The House bill also enacts the same provi-
sions as current law, with the following
changes: (1) deletes section 1117(g)(3) provi-
sions to delete the ARC individual provi-
sions; (2) amends section 1117(g)(4) to require
the Secretary to assign an actual or bench-
mark county yield for each planted acre for
the crop year for the covered commodity—
(A) for a county for which county data col-
lected by the Risk Management Agency
(RMA) is sufficient to offer a county-wide in-
surance product using the actual average
county yield determined by RMA; or (B) for
other counties using, as determined by the
Secretary—(i) other sources of yield infor-
mation; or (ii) the yield history of represent-
ative farms in the State, region, or crop re-
porting district; (3) adds a new requirement
that the Secretary make ARC payments to
producers using the payment rate of the
county of the physical location of the base
acres of a farm; and (4) deletes ‘‘to the max-
imum extent practicable’’ from section
1117(g)(2), thus requiring the Secretary to
calculate a separate actual crop revenue and
ARC guarantee for irrigated and nonirri-
gated covered commodities. (Section 1117)
The Senate amendment amends section
1117(a) to: (1) reauthorize the ARC County
and ARC Individual Programs for the 2019
through 2023 crop years; and (2) require ARC
payments to be paid based on the physical
location of the farm.
The Senate amendment also amends sec-
tion 1117(c) to extend ARC coverage guar-
antee provisions though the 2023 crop year;
to increase the transitional (plug) yield from
70 percent to 75 percent of the transitional
yield; and to require the use of a trend ad-
justed yield factor to adjust the yields in de-
termining the actual county yield and the
benchmark county revenue for ARC county
coverage, not to exceed the trend-adjusted
yield factor used to increase yield history
under the endorsement under the Federal
Crop Insurance Act for that crop and county.
The Senate amendment requires the Sec-
retary to publish the county payment rate
for a covered commodity no later than thirty
days after the end of each marketing year
for each covered commodity.
The Senate amendment requires the Sec-
retary to—(1) assign an actual yield for the
covered commodity by giving priority to the
use of actual county yields from a single
source that provides the greatest national
coverage of county-level data; and (2) pro-
rate the base acres and payments in the case
of a farm that has a tract with base acres
that crosses a county boundary.
The Senate amendment also requires the
Secretary, on request of a county FSA State
Committee, to consider a 1-time request to
calculate a separate actual crop revenue and
ARC guarantee for irrigated and nonirri-
gated covered commodities in a county if,
during the 2014 through 2018 crop years—(1)
an average of not less than 5 percent of the
planted and considered planted acreage of a
covered commodity in the county was irri-
gated; and (2) an average of not less than 5
percent of the planted and considered plant-
ed acreage of the covered commodity in the
county was nonirrigated. It also authorizes
the Secretary to use other sources of yield
information, including the yield history of
representative farms in the State, region, or
crop reporting district, when considering or
recalculating separate actual crop revenue
and ARC guarantee. (Section 1104)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provisions with amendments to: (1) make
payments based on the payment rate of the
county where the base acre on the farm is
physically located; (2) increase the transi-
tional yield plug to 80 percent; (3) utilize the
‘‘effective reference price’’ to calculate the
guarantee; (4) calculate a separate irrigated
and nonirrigated yield in each county; and
(5) prioritize RMA data in the calculation of
the guarantee and actual yields. The sub-
stitute deletes a Senate provision regarding
the case of a farm that has a tract with base
acres that crosses a county boundary. (Sec-
tion 1107)
In applying the yield plug, when actual
yields drop below 80% of the transitional
yield for the county, the Managers expect
the FSA Administrator to consult with the
Administrator of the Risk Management
Agency (RMA) to ensure that the transi-
tional yield utilized is current and reflective
of recent yields within the county.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9958 December 10, 2018
In the case of a farm that has a tract with
base acres that crosses a county boundary,
the Managers intend for FSA to prorate the
base acres based on the quantity of cropland
of the tract in each county and calculate any
ARC-County payments to the farm on that
basis.
For determining a separate irrigated and
non-irrigated yield for a covered commodity
within a county with limited data for a prac-
tice, the Managers intend for the Secretary
to utilize other sources of yield information
such as representative farms in adjacent
counties or the crop reporting district to de-
termine a county yield that is representative
of the applicable practice.
The Managers intend for FSA to imple-
ment the trend yield adjustment such that it
has a similar result as the Federal Crop In-
surance endorsement to adjust either the
guarantee or actual yield to account for the
long-term increase in production that is not
accounted for otherwise. The Managers ex-
pect this will include using more than just
the five years of the guarantee to calculate
a trend, which will also help avoid the poten-
tial anomalies from using limited data. The
Managers also expect all trend yield adjust-
ments to be positive or neutral.
(12) Agriculture Risk Coverage—Publication of
Coverage Guarantee, Yield, and Price
The Senate amendment requires the publi-
cation of the county risk coverage guar-
antee, average historical county yield, and
the national average market price for each
covered commodity in each county, not later
than 30 days after the end of the applicable
12-month marketing year; provides an excep-
tion to the reporting deadline in the case of
a covered commodity, such as temperate ja-
ponica rice, for which the Secretary cannot
determine the national average market price
for the most recent 12-month marketing year
for the national average market price due to
insufficient reporting of timely pricing data
by one or more nongovernmental entities,
including a marketing cooperative for the
covered commodity. (Section 1104(6))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with a technical amendment to
clarify the information that the Secretary
shall publish. (Section 1107)
(13) Administrative Units
The Senate amendment adds a new sub-
section to section 1117 of the Agricultural
Act of 2014 providing that, for purposes of
ARC payments in the case of county cov-
erage, a county may be divided into not
greater than two administrative units. Eligi-
ble counties are those that are larger than
1,400 square miles, are in a State that is larg-
er than 140,000 square miles, and contain
more than 190,000 base acres. (Section 12611)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
visions.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to delete
the requirement the county be contained
within a State that is larger than 140,000
square miles. The substitute adds a limit of
25 counties that may be divided into admin-
istrative units, and provides direction for the
preference to the division of counties that
have greater variation in climate, soils, and
expected productivity between the proposed
administrative units. (Section 1107)
(14) Producer Agreements
The House bill restates current law except
that it omits subsection (d), consistent with
the cessation of ARC individual coverage.
(Section 1118)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(15) Repeal of Transition Assistance for Pro-
ducers of Upland Cotton
The Senate amendment repeals section
1119 of the Agricultural Act of 2014. (Section
1105)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 1108)
(16) Availability of Nonrecourse Marketing As-
sistance Loans for Loan Commodities
The House bill restates current law to
make available nonrecourse marketing as-
sistance loans for the 2019 through 2023 crops.
(Section 1201)
The Senate amendment amends section
1201(b)(1) of the 2014 Act to extend current
law for the availability of nonrecourse mar-
keting assistance loans through 2023. (Sec-
tion 1201(a))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 1108)
(17) Loan Rates for Nonrecourse Marketing As-
sistance Loans
The House bill provides that for the 2019
through 2023 crop years the loan rate for
extra long staple cotton is increased to 95
cents per pound; the loan rate formula for
upland cotton is prevented from declining by
more than two percent in any one crop year;
and that seed cotton shall be deemed to have
a loan rate of 25 cents per pound for purposes
of calculating the effective price under PLC
and actual crop revenue under ARC. (Section
1202)
The Senate amendment amends section
1201(b)(1) of the 2014 Act to extend the avail-
ability of nonrecourse marketing assistance
loans through 2023. (Section 1201(b))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to adjust
the loan rates for wheat, corn, grain sor-
ghum, barley, oats, long grain rice, medium
grain rice, soybeans, dry peas, lentils, small
chickpeas, large chickpeas, and raw cane
sugar for the 2019 through 2023 crop years.
(Sections 1202 and 1301(a))
(18) Loan Deficiency Payments
The House bill includes provisions that are
the same as current law, effective for the
2019 through 2023 crop years. (Section 1205)
The Senate amendment extends through
the 2023 crop year the provisions of section
1205(a)(2)(B) of the Agricultural Act of 2014
authorizing the Secretary to make loan defi-
ciency payments for hay and silage derived
from a loan commodity.
The Senate amendment also repeals the
authority of the Secretary to make loan de-
ficiency payments for nongraded wool in the
form of unshorn pelts. (Section 1201(d)(1) &
1202)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to delete
the repeal of the authority of the Secretary
to make loan deficiency payments for non-
graded wool in the form of unshorn pelts.
(Section 1201(c))
(19) Special Marketing Loan Provisions for Up-
land Cotton; Economic Adjustment Assist-
ance to Users of Upland Cotton
The House bill is the same as current law
applicable beginning with the 2019 crop year,
except with regard to the changes to the
Economic Adjustment Assistance to Users of
Upland Cotton, for which the House bill in-
creases the payment rate of economic adjust-
ment assistance 3 cents to 3.15 cents per
pound of cotton used, and renames the pro-
gram as ‘‘Economic Adjustment Assistance
for Textile Mills.’’ (Section 1207)
The Senate bill amends section 1207(c) of
the 2014 Act to extend the Economic Adjust-
ment Assistance to Users of Upland Cotton
at the rate of 3 cents per pound through July
31, 2021. For subsequent years, the program is
extended at the same payment rate, subject
to funding available through annual appro-
priations. (Section 1203(b))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to con-
tinue the payment rate of economic adjust-
ment assistance at 3 cents per pound of cot-
ton used, and to strike a redundant author-
ity to provide economic adjustment assist-
ance under section 1207(c) of the Food, Con-
servation, and Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C.
8737). (Section 1202)
The Managers believe timely shipment and
delivery of cotton to the end-user is essential
to maintain the competitiveness of the U.S.
cotton industry. The Managers urge the Sec-
retary to work with representatives of the
U.S. cotton industry to identify how best to
update and modernize the current Cotton
Storage Agreement for U.S. cotton ware-
houses. The Managers expect any updates to
be based on consensus recommendations of
all segments of the industry. As necessary,
the Secretary should make changes to the
provider agreement between USDA and the
electronic warehouse receipt provider to fa-
cilitate the implementation of those indus-
try recommendations to improve the flow of
cotton.
(20) Special Competitive Provisions for Extra
Long Staple Cotton
The House bill is the same as current law,
except the House bill maintains the value of
assistance available to domestic users of
extra long staple cotton by making a con-
forming change in new section 1208(b) to re-
flect the increase in the extra long staple
cotton loan rate. (Section 1208)
The Senate amendment extends current
law through July 31, 2024. (Section 1201(d)(3)).
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision to make a conforming
change to reflect the increase in the extra
long staple cotton loan rate, and extends the
authority through July 31, 2024. (Section
1204)
(21) Availability of Recourse Loans for High
Moisture Feed Grains and Seed Cotton
The House bill (1) extends current law with
respect to high moisture feed grains and seed
cotton for the 2019 through 2023 crops; and (2)
requires the Secretary to make available re-
course commodity loans at the loan rate for
a marketing assistance loan for a loan com-
modity that is ineligible for 100 percent of
the nonrecourse marketing loan rate in the
county due to a determination that the com-
modity is contaminated yet still merchant-
able. (Section 1209)
The Senate amendment extends current
law with respect to high moisture feed grains
and seed cotton through the 2023 crops. (Sec-
tion 1201(d)(4))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 1205)
(22) Adjustment of Loans
The House bill (1) continues the authoriza-
tion for the Secretary to adjust loan rates
for loan commodities in the same matter as
current law; and (2) adds a requirement that
the Secretary shall consider methods to en-
hance the support, loan, or assistance pro-
vided under this title in a manner that fur-
ther minimizes the potential for forfeitures.
(Section 1210)
The Senate amendment has no comparable
provision.

The Senate amendment amends current
law section 1403(a), to require the Secretary
to administer DRC beginning with the 2019
calendar year.
The Senate amendment also provides that
Subpart A of part 1430 of title 7, Code of Fed-
eral Regulations (as in effect on the date of
enactment), shall remain in effect for DRC
beginning with the 2019 calendar year, except
to the extent that the regulations are incon-
sistent with any provision of this Act. (Sec-
tion 1401(d))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments that specify
that MPP regulations that do not conflict
with the new structure of DMC are to remain
in place and do not need to be reissued. (Sec-
tion 1401(k))
(27) Margin Protection Program for Dairy Pro-
ducers—Registration of Multiproducer
Dairy Operations
The House bill amends section 1404(b) to
allow a multiproducer dairy operation to
elect to exclude from registration under the
DRMP one or more individual owners—(1)
who individually owns less than five percent
of the operation; or (2) who is entitled to less
than five percent of the income, revenue,
profit, or one of other specified financial
measures of the operation.
The House bill also would require a reduc-
tion in DRMP payments to such operations
corresponding to the reduction in ownership
excluded from registration. (Section 1401(d))
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to en-
sure a multiproducer dairy will be treated as
a single operation under the program, and to
clarify that operations are not allowed to re-
duce their production history to impact eli-
gibility for tier I or tier II premiums. (Sec-
tion 1401(d))
The Managers intend for FSA to ensure a
more efficient sign-up process for dairy oper-
ations with multiple owners. The Managers
intend for operations to be allowed to sign-
up for coverage without every owner partici-
pating, and that those participating oper-
ations be treated as a single operation con-
sistent with existing law. After coverage
elections are made, the total premiums due
and payments made may be adjusted down-
ward to reflect the proportion of ownership
participating. Nothing in this section is in-
tended to allow a participating dairy oper-
ation to reduce the production history for
the dairy operation to impact eligibility for
tier I or tier II premiums.
(28) Margin Protection Program for Dairy Pro-
ducers—Catastrophic Coverage
The Senate amendment amends section
1404(b) to provide that a participating dairy
operation may elect to receive catastrophic
coverage instead of paying a premium under
section 1407.
The Senate amendment also amends sec-
tion 1404(c) to provide that, in addition to
the $100 administrative fee under section
1404(c)(1)(A), a participating dairy operation
that elects to receive catastrophic coverage
shall pay an additional administrative fee of
$100. (Section 1401(e))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute allows partici-
pating dairy operations to elect to receive a
$4 coverage level instead of paying a pre-
mium. (Section 1401(h))
(29) Margin Protection Program for Dairy Pro-
ducers—Relation to Livestock Gross Margin
for Dairy Program
The House bill amends section 1404(d) to
allow a dairy operation to participate in
both the DRMP and the Livestock Gross
Margin (LGM) for dairy program. (Section
1401(e))
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with a modification permit-
ting participating dairy operations to par-
ticipate in both programs on the same pro-
duction, and to allow producers who were
locked out of the improved 2018 MPP due to
LGM participation to retroactively partici-
pate in MPP for the months in 2018 in which
they were excluded from participation. (Sec-
tion 1401(e))
Given that Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC)
is a new program option for dairy operations,
the Managers note the importance of USDA-
led outreach and education efforts to oper-
ations that are currently participating in
the Margin Protection Program (MPP),
those that have ceased participation, and
those that have never participated (including
organic dairy farmers that may not be aware
of their eligibility). In advance of 2019 pro-
gram sign-up, the Managers expect FSA to
conduct outreach to eligible operations
through repeated contacts and multiple
modes such as mailings, phone calls and
local meetings, and to collaborate with state
licensing boards, cooperatives, producer
groups, institutions of higher education, and
other stakeholders to thoroughly inform pro-
ducers of their operations’ new affordable op-
tions under DMC, MPP credit or refund val-
ues, and the new safety net options provided
under DMC.
Specifically with regard to the credit or re-
fund under section 1407(f) of the Agricultural
Act of 2014 (7 USC 9057), the Managers recog-
nize the potential complexity of tracing
former owners of operations that have ceased
operation, but expect operations that have
continued operation unabated to be offered
the option of a credit or refund in conjunc-
tion with the 2019 program sign-up. Addition-
ally, this title removes restrictions between
DMC and any Federal Crop Insurance prod-
uct. Therefore the Managers expect FSA and
the Risk Management Agency (RMA) to co-
ordinate to ensure that each agency’s em-
ployees, along with crop insurance compa-
nies, agents and customers, are aware of the
change in rules and additional opportunities
for complementary coverage.
(30) Margin Protection Program for Dairy Pro-
ducers—Production History of Participating
Dairy Operations
The House bill amends current law section
1405 (a)(2) to limit the application of the ad-
justments to the production history of par-
ticipating dairy operations to ‘‘calendar
years ending before January 1, 2019.’’
The House bill also adds a new section
1405(d) to prevent DRMP payments to a par-
ticipating dairy operation if the Secretary
determines that the participating dairy oper-
ation has reorganized the operation solely
for the purpose of qualifying as a new oper-
ation. (Section 1401(f))
The Senate amendment amends current
law section 1405(a)(2) to limit the application
of the adjustments to the production history
of participating dairy operations to ‘‘during
each of the 2014 through 2019 calendar
years.’’ (Section 1401(f))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to pro-
vide equitable treatment to newly-partici-
pating dairies. (Section 1401(f))
(31) Margin Protection Program—Payments
The House bill amends section 1406(a) of
the Agricultural Act of 2014 to provide that,
for purposes of receiving DRMP payments
for a month, a participating dairy operation
shall elect—(1) a coverage level threshold
that is equal to $4.00, $4.50, $5.00, $5.50, $6.00,
$6.50, $7.00, $7.50, or $8.00 ‘‘(and in the case of
production subject to Tier 1 premiums
(under section 1407(b)), also $8.50 or $9.00)’’;
and (2) a percentage of coverage, in 5-percent
increments, but not to exceed 90 percent of
the production history of the participating
dairy operation.
The House bill further amends section 1406
by adding a new subsection (d) requiring
that, within 90 days after the date of enact-
ment, each participating dairy operation
shall elect a coverage level threshold under
subsection (a)(1) and a coverage percentage
under subsection (q) (2) to be used to deter-
mine DRMP payments. This election shall
remain in effect for the participating dairy
operation through December 31, 2023 (for the
duration of the DRMP, as specified in section
1409). (Section 1401(h))
The Senate amendment amends section
1406(a) of the Agricultural Act of 2014 to pro-
vide that, for purposes of receiving margin
protection payments for a month, a partici-
pating dairy operation shall annually elect—
(1) a coverage level threshold that is equal
to—(A) in the case of catastrophic coverage,
$5.00; (B) $5.50, $6.00, $6.50, $7.00, $7.50, $8.00,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9960 December 10, 2018
$8.50, or $9.00; and (2)(A) a percentage of cov-
erage, in 5–percent increments, that does not
exceed 90 percent of the production history
of the participating dairy operation; or (2)(B)
in the case of catastrophic coverage, a cov-
erage level of 40 percent of the production
history of the participating dairy operation.
(Section 1401(g))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to re-
quire the participating dairy operation to
elect a coverage level threshold that is equal
to $4.00, $4.50, $5.00, $5.50, $6.00, $6.50, $7.00,
$7.50, $8.00, $8.50, $9.00, or $9.50 for their first
five million pounds of participating produc-
tion. The amendment allows an operation
that elects coverage on its first five million
pounds of $8.00, $8.50, or $9.50 to make a sec-
ond election of a coverage level threshold
that is equal to $4.00, $4.50, $5.00, $5.50, $6.00,
$6.50, $7.00, $7.50, or $8.00 for production over
five million pounds. The amendment also al-
lows operations to cover between five per-
cent and ninety-five percent of their produc-
tion history. (Section 1401(g))
(32) Margin Protection Program—Premium
Rates
The House bill amends section 1407(b)(2) to
set the Tier 1 premium rates for the first 5
million pounds of milk marketings included
in the production history of a participating
dairy operation, for each coverage level
ranging from $5.50 to $9.00 per hundred-
weight. (Section 1401(h))
The Senate amendment amends section
1407(b)(2) to set the Tier 1 premium rates for
the first 5 million pounds of milk mar-
ketings included in the production history of
a participating dairy operation, the premium
per hundredweight for each coverage level
ranging from $5.50 to $8.00 per hundred-
weight. (Section 1401(h))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to mod-
ify premium rates from the $4.00 to $9.50–cov-
erage options. The amendment also modifies
premium rates for operations covering more
than five million pounds. (Section1401(h))
(33) Margin Protection Program—Small and Me-
dium Farmer Discount
The Senate amendment adds a new sub-
section (f) to section 1407 to require that the
Tier I and Tier II premium per hundred-
weight for each coverage level shall be re-
duced by—(1) 50 percent for a participating
dairy operation with a production history
that is less than 2 million pounds; and (2) 25
percent for a participating dairy operation
with a production history that is less than 2
million pounds and not greater than 1 mil-
lion pounds. (Section 1401(h)(6))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute provides that
any operation that signs up in 2019 and com-
mits to maintaining their coverage deci-
sions, including coverage level and covered
production, through 2023 will receive a 25%
discount on their premiums each year. Any
producer who makes this commitment will
be unable to change that coverage decision
at any time over the life of the bill. Oper-
ations electing not to commit to five-year
decisions may continue to make annual cov-
erage decisions but will be ineligible for this
discount. (Section 1401(j))
(34) Margin Protection Program—Repayment of
Premiums
The Senate amendment adds a new sub-
section (g) to section 1407 to require the Sec-
retary to repay each dairy operation that
participated in the MPP as in effect for each
of calendar years 2014 through 2017, an
amount equal to the difference between—(1)
the premiums paid by the participating dairy
operation for the calendar year; and (2) the
total amount of margin protection payments
made to the participating dairy operation for
the calendar year. (Section 1401(h)(6))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments clarifying
that eligible dairy operations must apply for
the repayment and to establish the percent-
ages for repayments as credit at 75 percent
and direct cash repayment at 50 percent.
(Section 1401(i))
The Managers expect, with regard to the
credit or refund under section 1407(f) of the
Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9057), for
FSA to make the credit or refund available
to the operation that paid the premiums for
coverage during 2014 through 2017. In the
event that the ownership and production his-
tory of an operation has been sold or trans-
ferred, the Managers expect the current op-
eration to receive the credit or refund. In the
case of an operation that participated in
MPP during 2014, 2015, 2016, or 2017 and has
since ceased operating or been dissolved, the
Managers expect FSA to offer the owners of
the operation a credit or refund based on
their respective ownership share.
(35) Margin Protection Program for Dairy Pro-
ducers—Duration
The House bill amends section 1409(k) to
authorize the DRMP through December 31,
2023. (Section 1401(k))
The Senate Amendment amends section
1409 to authorize DRC through December 31,
2023. (Section 1401(j))
The Conference substitute provides an au-
thorization for the DMC program through
December 31, 2023. (Section 1401(l)). The Con-
ference substitute also provides that the ef-
fective date of the amendments made by Sec-
tion 1401 is January 1, 2019. (Section 1401(m))
While DMC is replacing MPP, the Man-
agers expect FSA to continue utilizing any
existing regulations that are not contra-
dicted by the new provisions including the
regulations related to intergenerational
transfer and the regulation that provides the
maximum coverage percentage at a $4 mar-
gin, even if an operation selects a lower per-
centage under buy-up.
(36) Dairy Product Donation Program
The House bill repeals the current law
Dairy Product Donation Program (Section
1431 of the 2014 Act). (Section 1406)
The Senate amendment amends current
law section 1431 in its entirety to establish
and administer a milk donation program to
reimburse eligible dairy organizations’ costs
incurred for donating milk by accounting to
the Federal Milk Marketing Order pool the
difference in the Class I milk value and the
lowest classified price for the applicable
month (either Class III milk or Class IV
milk).
The Senate amendment defines eligible
dairy organization, eligible distributor, eligi-
ble milk, eligible partnership, and partici-
pating partnership for purposes of the pro-
gram. The amendment also establishes the
purposes and administrative provisions gov-
erning the program, donation and distribu-
tion plans, and the reimbursement of quali-
fied expenses. It prohibits the resale of prod-
ucts, and requires the conduct of audits to
insure program integrity.
The amendment provides mandatory fund-
ing for the program in the amount of $8 mil-
lion for fiscal year 2019, and $5 million each
fiscal year thereafter. (Section 1413)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to repeal
the Dairy Product Donation Program in cur-
rent law and establish a new fluid milk dona-
tion program that makes it easier for pro-
ducers, processors, and co-operatives to do-
nate fluid milk to food banks and other feed-
ing organizations. The amendment provides
mandatory funding for the program at $9
million in 2019 and at $5 million in each of
the following years. (Section 1404)
(37) Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assist-
ance
The House bill amends the Livestock In-
demnity Program (LIP) to cover death or
sale loss as a result of diseases that are
‘‘caused or transmitted by a vector and that
is not able to be controlled by vaccination or
other acceptable management practices.
The House bill also eliminates the pay-
ment limitation of $125,000 per crop year for
Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey
Bees, and Farm Raised-Fish (ELAP). The
amendment applies the limitation to any
person or ‘‘qualified pass through entity,’’
and excludes such a person or pass through
entity from the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
limitation if 75 percent or more of the person
or entity’s average AGI comes from farming,
ranching, or silviculture.
The House bill also requires that the
amendments made by this section shall be
effective for losses incurred on or after Janu-
ary 1, 2017. (Section 1501)
The Senate amendment adds an Indian
Tribe or tribal organization (as those terms
are defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-De-
termination and Education Assistance Act
(25 U.S.C. 5304) as an eligible producer for
purposes of supplemental agricultural assist-
ance.
The Senate amendment also allows the
Secretary to provide assistance for coverage
under LIP for the death of unweaned live-
stock due to adverse weather, including
those that have not been vaccinated; and re-
quires the Secretary to seek input annually
from the bison industry to ensure LIP rates
are consistent with market value.
The Senate amendment also provides that
funds made available for emergency assist-
ance include for the purpose of reducing
losses from inspections of cattle tick fever.
The Senate amendment also requires an in-
creased cost reimbursement of 75 percent for
beginning farmers, ranchers and veterans
under the Tree Assistance Program (TAP).
(Sections 1501 & 12610)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provisions with amendments to add
Indian Tribes or tribal organizations as an
eligible producer, provide assistance for cov-
erage under LIP for the death of unweaned
livestock due to adverse weather, make
available ELAP funds for inspections of cat-
tle tick fever, increase the cost share avail-
able under TAP to 75 percent for beginning
farmers, ranchers, and veterans, and to ex-
clude the changes related to ‘‘qualified pass
thru entities’’, AGI, and retroactive applica-
tion. (Section 1501)
The Managers encourage the Secretary to
seek input and data from the bison industry
(including bison producer groups) annually
relating to the market value of bison to en-
sure that Livestock Indemnity Program
(LIP) payments are consistent with the mar-
ket value of bison.
The Managers intend for livestock death
losses that occur due to a cause of loss that
is not eligible for indemnification under LIP
to still be eligible for compensation under
Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey-
bees, and Farm-Raised Fish (ELAP).
The Managers note the ongoing struggle
faced by beekeepers due to the persistence of
Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). In deter-
mining a normal mortality rate for honey-
bees for the purposes of calculating ELAP
assistance for beekeepers, the Managers ex-
pect FSA to use mortality rates known to be
normal prior to the emergence of CCD and
other serious honeybee health declines.

December 10, 2018
(38) Loss of Peach and Blueberry Crops due to
Extreme Cold
The Senate amendment requires the Sec-
retary to provide compensation for expenses
relating to losses of peach and blueberry
crops that occurred during calendar year 2017
due to extreme cold, as determined by the
Secretary. It provides $18 million in manda-
tory funding from CCC. (Section 1502)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate provision.
(39) Administration and Operation of Non-
insured Crop Assistance Program—Eligible
Crops
The House bill amends section 196(a)(2) of
the Federal Agriculture Improvement and
Reform Act to define ‘‘eligible crops’’ for the
purposes of non-insured assistance as com-
mercial crops or other agricultural commod-
ities which are produced for food or fiber (ex-
cept livestock) for which catastrophic risk
protection or certain other additional cov-
erage is not available. (Section 11501)
The Senate amendment amends section
196(a)(1) of the Federal Agriculture Improve-
ment and Reform Act of 1996 to direct the
Secretary to coordinate between the agen-
cies of the Department data collection, eligi-
bility, and reduced paperwork for the Non-
insured Crop Assistance Program (NAP).
The Senate amendment also amends sec-
tion 196(a)(4) to clarify required reductions
in benefits for eligible crops for any 4 years
after native sod acreage has been tilled by
producers in Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Ne-
braska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
The Senate amendment allows a governor of
another State to elect to have the provision
apply to the State. It also requires a pro-
ducer, as a condition of receiving noninsured
crop assistance, to certify to the Secretary if
the producer has tilled native sod for the
production of an insurable crop. The Senate
amendment directs the Secretary to submit
an annual report to the House and Senate
Agriculture Committees describing the tilled
native sod acreage in each country and state.
The Senate amendment also amends sec-
tion 196(b) to add a new paragraph (4) requir-
ing the Secretary to establish a streamlined
process for the submission of records and
acreage reports for small-scale, direct-to-
consumer, and divers urban production sys-
tems.
The amendment also amends section
196(i)(2) to establish separate payment limi-
tations of $125,000 for catastrophic coverage
and $300,000 for additional coverage. (Section
1601)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provisions with amendments to define
‘‘eligible crops’’, clarify that native sod acre-
age that has been tilled would be subject to
a reduction in benefits not more than four
cumulative years during the first ten years
after initial tillage, and exclude the author-
ity for a governor of a state to elect to have
the requirements apply to a state not cur-
rently covered by native sod rules.(Section
1601)
The Managers observe that FSA imple-
ments the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assist-
ance Program (NAP) in a manner that is ap-
propriate for conventional row-crop agri-
culture with entire fields and farms planted
to one, or a small number of crops, that are
harvested in a single crop year. The Man-
agers note that producers who grow a variety
of crops, often on small acreage with mul-
tiple rotations each crop year, have a paper-
work burden under existing NAP that can
act as a barrier to obtaining adequate risk
protection.
The Managers direct FSA to streamline re-
porting requirements through an equivalent
process as described in the regulations for
microloan operating loans under parts 761
and 764 of title 7, Code of Federal Regula-
tions (as in effect on the date of enactment)
and implement any other additional stream-
lining, as determined appropriate. The Man-
agers also encourage FSA to coordinate with
RMA to ensure that participation data are
collected in a form useful to support the de-
velopment and expansion of Federal Crop In-
surance to new crops and counties.
(40) Noninsured Crop Assistance Program—Serv-
ice Fee
The House bill amends section 196(k)(1) to
increase the service fees for eligible crops to
the lesser of—(a) $350 per crop per county; or
(B) $1,050 per producer per county, but not to
exceed a total of $2,100 per producer (Section
11502)
The Senate amendment amends section
196(k)(l) to increase the service fees for eligi-
ble crops to the lesser of—(A) $325 per crop
per county; or (B) $825 per producer per coun-
ty, but not to exceed a total of $1,950 per pro-
ducer. (Section 1601(6))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 1601(6))
(41) Noninsured Crop Assistance Program—Pay-
ment Equivalent to Additional Coverage
The House bill amends section
196(1)(2)(b)(i) to add the producer’s share of
the crop to the list of multipliers used to cal-
culate the service fee or premium required to
be paid by the producer in order to receive
payments under noninsured assistance.
The House bill strikes obsolete current law
section 196(1)(3) that addressed assistance for
losses to certain 2012 annual fruit crops
grown on a bush or tree related to losses due
to a freeze or frost.
The House bill also amends section 196(1)(5)
to extend the availability of additional cov-
erage under subsection (l) through the 2023
crop year. (Section 11503)
The Senate amendment amends section
196(1)(l) to add ‘‘the producer’s share of the
total acres devoted to the crop’’ to the list of
multipliers used to calculate the NAP pay-
ment amount that is equivalent to an indem-
nity for additional coverage under section
508(c) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act.
The Senate amendment amends section
196(1)(1)(C) to clarify the ‘‘market price’’
used to calculate the NAP payment amount
to also include the ‘‘contract price, or other
premium price (such as a local, organic, or
direct market price, as elected by the pro-
ducer.)’’
The Senate amendment strikes the same
obsolete current law section 196(1)(3).
The Senate amendment also strikes sec-
tion 196(1)(5), thus making additional cov-
erage under subsection (1) available perma-
nently. (Section 1601(7))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 1601(7))
The Managers recognize that the expira-
tion of the authority to offer additional cov-
erage (also referred to as NAP buy-up) cre-
ates both an administrative burden on the
agency and can cause uncertainty or even
limited coverage for producers of crops with
fall or winter sign-up periods. The Managers
intend to avoid these issues in the future and
have made permanent the authority for NAP
buy-up. The Managers also removed the 30-
day limit before coverage can attach in order
to provide more flexibility and allow FSA to
restart NAP buy-up immediately following
enactment.
(42) Additional Assistance for Certain Pro-
ducers—Losses Due to Volcanic Activity
The Senate amendment requires the Sec-
retary, as soon as practicable after October
1, 2018, under the section 196 related to NAP
to make available assistance to producers of
an eligible crop that suffered losses in a
county covered by a qualifying natural dis-
aster declaration for production losses due to
volcanic activity. The Secretary shall make
assistance available under in an amount
equal to the amount of assistance deter-
mined under section 196(d), less any service
fees that are owed by producers under sec-
tion 196(k). (Section 1602)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate provision.
(43) Administration Generally
The House bill continues the expedited
rulemaking and other provisions in current
law, with amended section references up-
dated to reflect the House Bill. (Section 1601)
The Senate amendment continues the ex-
pedited rulemaking and other provisions as
current law, with amended section references
updated to reflect the amendments made by
title I (commodities) and section 10109 (mul-
tiple crop and pesticide use survey) of the
Senate Amendment (Section 1701)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 1709)
(44) Suspension of Permanent Price Support Au-
thority
The House bill continues the suspension of
the same permanent price support authori-
ties (and related wheat marketing quotas)
through 2023, with an amendment.
The House bill amends section 201(a) of the
Agricultural Act of 1949 to (1) add eleven ad-
ditional commodities to the current list of
eleven commodities for which the Secretary
would be required to provide price support in
the event that the 1949 Act were to become
effective, including crambe, cottonseed, ses-
ame seed, dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas,
large chickpeas, graded wool, nongraded
wool, mohair and peanuts; and (2) clarify
that if price support were to be required
under section 201, it would be provided at a
level not less than 75 percent and not greater
than 90 percent of the parity price of the
commodity. (Section 1602)
The Senate amendment extends the sus-
pension of permanent price support authori-
ties through 2023. (Section 1702)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 1702)
(45) Payment Limitations
The House bill amends section 1001 of the
Food Security Act of 1985 to limit to $125,000
the total amount of payments a person or a
legal entity can receive from PLC or ARC
payments under Subtitle A—(1) for the sum
of all covered commodities (except peanuts);
and (2) separately, for peanuts.
The House bill amends the definition of
family member to include first cousins,
nieces, and nephews.
The House bill adds a new definition of
‘‘qualified pass through entity’’ to mean ‘‘a
partnership (within the meaning of sub-
chapter K of chapter 2 of the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 and including a limited li-
ability company that does not affirmatively
elect to be treated as a corporation), an S
corporation (as defined in section 1361 of
such Code), or a joint venture.’’
The House bill amends sections 1001(b) and
1001(c) of the Food Security Act of 1985 to re-
move marketing loan gains and loan defi-
ciency payments from the limitations on
payments for peanuts under subsection (c)
and all other covered commodities under
subsection (b).
The House bill also amends section 1001(f)
of the Food Security Act of 1985 to require
the Secretary to apply reductions in PLC or
ARC payments due to a sequester before ap-
plying payment limitations under section
1001.

when a person may be considered to be ac-
tively engaged in farming using active per-
sonal management. (Section 1705)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate provision.
(48) Adjusted Gross Income Limitation
The House bill amends section 1001D(b)(2)
of the Food Security Act of 1985 to exempt
Marketing Loan Gains (MLG) and Loan Defi-
ciency Payments (LDP) from Adjusted Gross
Income (AGI) limitations.
The House bill also amends Section
1001D(b) of the Food Security Act of 1985 to—
(1) provide an exception from the AGI limita-
tion for a qualified pass through entity; and
(2) authorize the Secretary to waive, on a
case-by-case basis, the AGI limitation to
protect environmentally sensitive land of
special significance. (Section 1604)
The Senate amendment amends section
1001D(b)(1) of the Food Security Act of 1985
to reduce the AGI limitation from $900,000 to
$700,000. (Section 1706)
The Conference substitute adopts the

the assignment of payments provisions in
the same manner as current law. (Section
1606)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision—current law continues to
apply.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.

(53) Base Acres Review
The Senate amendment requires the Sec-
retary to review the establishment, calcula-
tion, reallocation, adjustment, and reduction
of base acres under Subtitle A of Title I of
the Agricultural Act of 2014, and to report to
the House and Senate Agriculture Commit-
tees on the results of the review. (Section
1707)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate provision.

retary to establish policies, procedures and
plans to improve program accountability and
integrity through activities including uti-
lizing data mining to identify and reduce er-
rors, waste, fraud, and abuse in Farm Service
Agency programs and to report to the House
and Senate Agriculture Committees. (Sec-
tion 1708)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to delete
some of the prescriptive requirements for the
report. (Section 1705)
The Managers intend the report to include
a summary of the existing USDA efforts to
eliminate errors, waste, fraud, and abuse, in-
cluding existing and planned data sampling
and mining activities of FSA, and efforts
that involve coordination with other depart-
ments or agencies. The report should include
identified weaknesses or program integrity
issues, any plans for action and rec-
ommendations for legislative changes to ad-
dress errors, waste, fraud, and abuse in FSA
programs.
(55) Personal Liability of Producers for Defi-
ciencies
The House bill reenacts and continues pro-
visions regarding the personal liability of
producers for deficiencies in the same man-
ner as current law. (Section 1609)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(56) Technical Corrections
The Senate amendment revises sections
1112(c)(2) and 1614(d) of the Agricultural Act
of 2014 to make 2 technical corrections. (Sec-
tion 1709(b))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to exclude
the modification to section 1614(d). (Section
1102(a))
(57) Implementation
The House bill requires the Secretary to
continue to maintain base acres and pay-
ment yields for each covered commodity in
the same manner as current law.
The House bill also requires the Secretary
to continue to streamline administrative
burdens and costs under the Acreage Crop
Reporting and Streamlining Initiative
(ACRSI).
The House bill adds a new requirement
that the Secretary shall ensure that no
agent, Approved Insurance Provider (AIP), or
employee or contractor of an agency or AIP,
bears responsibility or liability under the
ACRSI for the eligibility of a producer for
programs administered by USDA that are
not policies or plans of insurance offered
under the Federal Crop Insurance Act except
in cases of misrepresentation, fraud, or
scheme and device.
The House bill allows producers an option
to remotely and electronically sign annual
contracts.
The House bill requires the Secretary to
make $25,000,000 available to the FSA to im-
plement this title.
The House bill also amends section 1614(d)
of the Agricultural Act of 2014 to extend the
loan implementation provisions to the provi-
sions of the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of
2018. (Section 1610)
The Senate amendment amends section of
1614(b) of the Agricultural Act of 2014 to up-
date the requirements of ACSRI to make
available more detailed USDA data across
agencies and accessible via a single depart-
ment-wide login.
The Senate amendment also amends sec-
tion 1614 by adding a new requirement that
any USDA commodity program payment ob-
ligations that have not been disbursed or liq-
uidated, and remain outstanding five years
after the date on which the payment was ob-
ligated or made available, shall be
deobligated and revert to the U.S. Treasury.
The Secretary may delay the date of
deobligation in the event of an ongoing ap-
peal or litigation, settlement of an estate, or
where otherwise equitable. (Section 1703)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to allow
crop insurance agents and AIPs access to
records necessary for program delivery held
by FSA, include NRCS in coordination and
data sharing efforts, provide producers an
opportunity to sign a multi-year contract,
reduces the mandatory funding available to
the FSA for implementation to $15.5 million,
and to consolidate required reports on the
tillage of native sod. (Section 1706)
The Managers recognize significant
progress has been made to implement the
Acreage Crop Reporting Streamlining Initia-
tive (ACRSI) to allow for sharing of producer
information across common fields in FSA
and RMA data collection. The Managers
would note that the goal of one-stop report-
ing for producers at either RMA or FSA has
yet to be realized, additionally widespread
acceptance of geospatial data has not been
achieved. The Managers expect the Under-
secretary for Farm Production and Con-
servation (FPAC) to make acceptance of
geospatial data a priority for the next phase
of improvements to ACRSI, as well as begin
the process of integrating data from the Nat-
ural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS)
to allow for the seamless transfer of pro-
ducers’ information across the agencies
within the FPAC mission area.
The Managers encourage FSA to add tem-
porary refrigerated beehive storage facility
to the list of eligible uses for the Farm Stor-
age Facility Loan Program, in order to help
beekeepers more effectively fight mites and
CCD.
The Managers note that the reports on till-
age of native sod and the cropland report
were consolidated in section 1614(f) of the
Agricultural Act of 2014, as added by section

1706(f) in Title 1 of this bill. The Managers
expect FSA and RMA to coordinate on com-
pleting this report, and to provide data simi-
lar to that provided in the previous separate
reports to allow a comparison over time in
addition to any new information.
(58) Exemption from Certain Reporting Require-
ments for Certain Producers
The House bill exempts producers who par-
ticipate in any conservation or commodity
program, or who are eligible for indemnity
or compensation payments, from the same
reporting requirements as under section
1244(m), with respect to assistance received
through NRCS, APHIS, or FSA.
The House bill strikes current law section
1244(m). (Sections 1611 and 2503(1))
The Senate amendment amends current
law section 1244(m) to add producers partici-
pating in commodity programs through FSA
to the exemption from the reporting require-
ments. (Section 2503(d))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to clarify
the term ‘‘exempted producer’’ means an in-
dividual or entity that is eligible to partici-
pate in a conservation program under title II
of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018
or a law amended by title II; an indemnity or
disease control program under the Animal
Health Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.)
or the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7701 et
seq.); or a commodity program under title I
of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9011
et seq.), excluding the assistance provided to
users of cotton under sections 1207(c)and 1208
of that Act (7 U.S.C. 9037(c), 9038). (Section
1707)
TITLE II—CONSERVATION
(1) Extension and enrollment requirements of
conservation reserve program
The House bill amends the Food Security
Act of 1985 (the ‘‘’85 Act’’) to cap Conserva-
tion Reserve Program (‘‘CRP’’) enrollment
at 25 million acres for FY 2019, 26 million
acres for FY 2020, 27 million acres for FY
2021, 28 million acres for FY 2022, and 29 mil-
lion acres for FY 2023. It requires the Sec-
retary of Agriculture (the ‘‘Secretary’’) to
enroll a minimum of 3 million acres of grass-
land by the end of FY 2023 and sets mainte-
nance goals for each of those fiscal years. It
requires the Secretary to reserve remaining
acres for a fiscal year when the grassland 3
million acre or the applicable maintenance
goal is not reached. The bill requires the
Secretary to hold a signup for contracts not
available on a continuous basis at least once
every other year. It also directs the Sec-
retary to enroll and maintain acreage in ac-
cordance with historical State enrollment
rates. It maintains current law regarding the
general contract duration, strikes the spe-
cial rule for certain land (owner specified du-
ration), and sets certain continuous contract
duration at 15 or 30 years. The bill caps land
to one reenrollment if it is devoted to hard-
wood tress. (Section 2201)
The Senate amendment strikes the pre-
vious farm bill reference and inserts the new
2018 short title. It also caps enrollment at 25
million acres for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023. It reauthorizes the 2–million-
acre limitation regarding grassland enroll-
ment through FY 2023. It authorizes a new
clean water initiative and the State Acres
for Wildlife Enhancement Program. (Section
2101)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment. The
overall acreage limit is increased to 27 mil-
lion by FY 2023, including 8.6 million acres to
be devoted to continuous practices, and 2
million for grasslands. Contract lengths will
be between 10 and 15 years, after which the
land is eligible for reenrollment, with some
exceptions. A proportional, historic State
acreage allocation was included for a portion
of the acres available for enrollment. The
Conference substitute adopts the House pro-
vision with amendments to continuous en-
rollment procedure and eligibility, including
making certain water quality practices eligi-
ble. (Section 2201)
The Managers codify the Clean Lakes, Es-
tuaries, and Rivers Initiative (‘‘CLEAR’’) in
order to guarantee that it remains a priority
in CRP. The Managers expect the Farm Serv-
ice Agency (‘‘FSA’’) to target CLEAR prac-
tices in high priority watersheds where they
will maximize environmental benefits. The
Managers expect that at least 40 percent of
continuous CRP acres will be devoted to
CLEAR. The Managers expect USDA to take
greater steps to report on the water quality
benefits from these practices through the an-
nual report.
The Managers recognize the benefits of na-
tive vegetation to improve water and air
quality and enhance soil health. By encour-
aging the adoption of native vegetation seed
blends, USDA programs are supporting habi-
tat restoration for the northern bobwhite,
lesser prairie-chicken, greater sage-grouse,
other upland game birds, songbirds, monarch
butterflies and pollinators. The Managers en-
courage the use of native vegetation where
practicable.
(2) Farmable wetland program
The House bill amends the ’85 Act to strike
the buffer acreage authority for certain land
that enhances a wildlife benefit in terms of
upland to wetland ratios. It caps overall pro-
gram acreage at 500,000 acres. It also directs
the Secretary to also consider the submis-
sion of bids in the method of determination
when looking at these offers and amounts of
rental payments. (Section 2202)
The Senate amendment extends the reau-
thorization through FY 2023. (Section 2102)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 2203)
(3) Duties of owners and operators
The House bill authorizes management to
include the use of grazing for limited purpose
of management. It authorizes thinning and
other practices for certain purposes on land
devoted to hardwood or other trees. It clari-
fies the conservation plan will set forth com-
mercial use of enrolled lands. (Section 2203)
The Senate Amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 2205)
(4) Duties of the Secretary
The House bill authorizes the Secretary to
make rental payments. It expands opportuni-
ties for haying, grazing, and other manage-
ment tools. It limits haying to no more fre-
quently than that once in every three years
with certain parameters. The bill further al-
lows for intermittent or seasonal vegetative
buffer practices incidental to production ac-
tivity on adjacent land, and for program
acres to be eligible for grazing when live-
stock assistance program is engaged because
of drought. The bill gives the Secretary dis-
cretion to waive planned mid-contract man-
agement requirements in response to a nat-
ural disaster or adverse weather it results in
the same effect on the cover as planned man-
agement activity. (Section 2204)
The Senate amendment authorizes cost-
share for fencing and other water distribu-
tion practices. It provides for managed har-
vesting, grazing, and other commercial use,
consistent with the conservation of soil,
water quality and wildlife habitat, manage-
ment, in exchange for a reduction in the an-
nual rental rate of 25 percent. It also pro-
vides certain disaster designation authority
to States. (Section 2103)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments. Con-
servation practices cost-share and soil rental
rate payments are authorized, as well as
haying and grazing, with conditions. Natural
disasters may fulfill contractual land man-
agement requirements imposing conditions
on haying and grazing, including restricting
it to non-primary wildlife nesting season.
(Section 2206)
The Managers provide greater flexibility
for haying and grazing on acres enrolled in
CRP, with appropriate protections to main-
tain the conservation and wildlife value.
The Managers direct the Secretary to
allow for these specified activities on both
general and continuous acres, including on
acres enrolled in practices like CP–25 rare
and declining bird habitat.
Similar to current USDA practice, the
Managers intend to provide flexibility to
allow haying, grazing or other use of forage
under section 1233(b)(1)(B) with appropriate
safeguards under section 1233(b)(1)(A) or sec-
tion 1233(b)(2) of the Food Security Act of
1985. The Managers also recognize that the
impact of haying on some species of wildlife
and habitat quality may be more significant
than grazing (which can be adjusted through
limits on the stocking rate) and therefore in-
tend the FSA to have discretion to set more
stringent limitations on haying and under
what circumstances haying is allowed. Spe-
cifically as part of the authority for the Sec-
retary to allow emergency haying, grazing or
other emergency use of forage outside the
primary nesting season (section
1233(b)(1)(B)(i)(I)(aa)), the Managers intend
for FSA to maintain the current procedures
where the respective county committees
have the ability to request such authoriza-
tion from the respective state FSA com-
mittee when any part of the county is des-
ignated as a level ‘‘D2 Drought—Severe’’ or
worse according to the U.S. Drought Mon-
itor.
(5) Payments
The House bill directs the Secretary to pay
not more than 40 percent cost-share and lim-
its cost share for seed of cover. It caps incen-
tive payments for installing practices and
prohibits a cost share payment for mid-con-
tract management. It authorizes forest man-
agement payments, and limits payments to
not more than 100 percent of the total cost.
It directs the Secretary to consider the im-
pact on local farmland rental markets when
determining annual rental payments. It di-
rects the Secretary to limit rental payments
for initial enrollment to not more than 80
percent of the estimated average county
rental rate. It also directs the Secretary to
limit payments for subsequent re-enroll-
ments. It increases the frequency of the rent-
al rate estimate survey from every other
year to be published by September 15 each
year. The bill directs the Secretary to use es-
timates derived from the survey to deter-
mine these rental rates. It limits CREP rent-
al payments to States to no more than 50
percent of the cost of activities. (Section
2205)
The Senate amendment authorizes incen-
tive payments for continuous enrollment
contracts under certain circumstances based
upon prices for major covered commodities.
It directs the Secretary to prioritize the en-
rollment of marginal and environmentally
sensitive land when considering offers. The
amendment adds a rental rate limitation of
88.5 percent. It strikes paragraph (2) of sub-
section (g) and replaces it with an exemption
for payments received by rural water dis-
tricts or association for lands enrolled for
the purpose of protecting a wellhead and
conforms subsection (g) to the new para-
graph (2). (Section 2104)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9964 December 10, 2018
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments that limit
practice cost-share payments to actual cost
of practice installation, and 50 percent for
the cost of seed. Soil rental rates for general
and continuous enrollment are limited to 85
percent and 90 percent of the county average,
respectively, with secretarial requirement to
account for potential impact on local farm-
land rental market. Incentive payments for
continuous practices and forest management
are also authorized. It amends the rental
rate calculation methods for reenrolled land,
to allow for state and Conservation Reserve
Enhancement Program (‘‘CREP’’) partner
input, and to maintain incentives for specific
practices or areas like wellhead protection
zones. (Section 2207)
The Managers recognize that rental rates
vary significantly across the different pro-
duction regions of the country. The Man-
agers direct USDA to use average rental
rates that are more reflective of local rental
rates, including offering the opportunity for
State FSA and CREP partners to recommend
alternative rates with supporting informa-
tion. The impact of reducing the rental rates
in CRP may be greater on dryland produc-
tion areas where soil conservation is a sig-
nificant resource concern. The Managers en-
courage USDA to work with producers to ad-
dress soil conservation concerns in semi-arid
production regions.
The Managers increased CRP’s annual en-
rollment acreage cap and reduced the soil
rental rate limits in hopes that CRP will
more accurately serve one of its fundamental
purposes: retiring the most sensitive lands
without competing with local farmland rent-
al markets (which may preclude some farm-
ers from having access to prime farmland).
By incorporating changes in the program
that are more market-based, the Managers
are hopeful that highly productive land will
not be taken out of production while remain-
ing affordable for those who wish to utilize it
for production agriculture.
Furthermore, the Managers are concerned
that the complexity and expenses associated
with seed mixes under CRP have led to frus-
tration on the part of landowners, a waste of
taxpayer dollars, and in some cases inferior
cover on the ground if the mix fails to take
root. The Managers hope that USDA will
consider the hardiness and suitability of seed
mixtures when recommending multiple spe-
cies blends, and consider seed mixtures that
contain fewer, hardier species and provide
adequate cover for wildlife and pollinators
on sites where cover is difficult to establish
or maintain.
The Managers maintained continuous en-
rollment and incentives for continuous prac-
tices, including signing incentives, incen-
tives to provide additional cost-share, and
those related to specific practices, such as
buffers, and wellhead areas, for certain high
conservation value practices. These contin-
uous practices are typically smaller, more
targeted, and implemented only on parts of
fields or farms with higher practice estab-
lishment costs, which often require higher
payment rates.
(6) Conservation reserve enhancement program
The Senate amendment authorizes CREP
in the ’85 Act, which applies to not less than
20 percent of continuous acres. The Sec-
retary is required to provide cost share pay-
ments as components are completed. The
Secretary is also required to make incentive
payments for a program that includes ripar-
ian buffers, but not to exceed 100 percent of
the management cost. (Section 2105)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments limiting eli-
gible partners and requiring a 30 percent
minimum contribution from nongovern-
mental organizations. CREP is expressly au-
thorized, including drought and water con-
servation agreements to address regional
drought concerns. (Section 2202)
The Managers encourage USDA to con-
tinue the enrollment of acres in CREP in all
regions of the country. The Managers
incentivize more enrollment of riparian buff-
ers, including forested riparian buffers, in
CREP by authorizing the Secretary to make-
cost share payments for forested riparian
buffer maintenance throughout the length of
the agreement and to cover up to 100 percent
of the cost incurred by the owner or oper-
ator.
The Managers build upon past provisions
that increase flexibility for harvesting and
grazing within CRP by authorizing har-
vesting of products from food-producing
woody plants on forested riparian buffers,
provided that conservation benefits are
maintained and only native plants are plant-
ed within 35 feet of the watercourse. The
Managers expect USDA to make cost-share
payments for installing stream fencing,
crossings, and alternative water develop-
ment on marginal pastureland to reflect the
fair market value of the cost of installation.
(7) Contracts
The House bill amends the authority to
allow a 1-time early termination in fiscal
year 2019. It authorizes a transition option to
beginning farmers and ranchers to prepare
land for crop use, to provide extended time
certification under OFPA, and directs the
Secretary to provide technical and financial
assistance to carry out plan requirements.
(Section 2206)
The Senate amendment strikes early ter-
mination authority. It authorizes a transi-
tion option from contract holders beginning
2 years before termination of the contract,
includes short-term leases in the transition
authority, provides for certain new priorities
and provides for reenrollment for grasslands.
It provides an authority for owner or oper-
ator election relating to easements. (Section
2106)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision, with an amendment to
maintain the current law transition option
into the Conservation Stewardship Program
(‘‘CSP’’). It reauthorizes a transition option
for land that will be prepared for organic
production or enrolled in CSP or the Envi-
ronmental Quality Incentives Program
(‘‘EQIP’’). Land under contract may simulta-
neously be enrolled in the Agricultural Con-
servation Easement Program (‘‘ACEP’’).
(Section 2204)
(8) Conservation reserve easements
The Senate Amendment defines terms,
makes requirements for the agreement be-
tween the owner and the Secretary, sets out
the terms and conditions of the easement,
addresses violations of the easement, and au-
thorizes compatible economic uses in certain
circumstances. (Section 2107)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute accepts the Sen-
ate provision with amendment to change the
easement authority to a pilot program for 30
year contracts for Clean Lakes Estuaries and
Rivers (CLEAR) practices and to include a
Soil Health and Income Protection Pilot
Program. (Section 2204)
The Managers require FSA to carry out a
pilot to incentivize the use of 30–year con-
tracts for the water quality practices au-
thorized through the CLEAR initiative. The
Managers would like producers to be given
the opportunity to enroll in and capitalize
on the benefits of longer-term contracts be-
yond the traditional 10-year contract, while
simultaneously maximizing environmental
benefits associated with the CRP. The Man-
agers intend for this pilot to serve as a tool
for measuring demand for longer-term CRP
contracts and to provide insights into the
conservation benefits associated with long-
term contracts.
(9) Eligible land; State law requirements
The Senate amendment directs the Sec-
retary, in consultation with the State tech-
nical committee, to make certain land eligi-
ble for enrollment through regulation. (Sec-
tion 2108)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute accepts the Sen-
ate amendment with an amendment to limit
the provision to partnerships established be-
fore 2014. (Section 2209)
(10) Definitions
The Senate amendment amends the defini-
tions used in Subchapter B, the Conservation
Stewardship Program, by adding more ‘‘con-
servation activities’’ and amends the defini-
tion of ‘‘stewardship threshold’’ to direct the
Secretary to use certain criteria, tools or
models, data and other methods. (Section
2201)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with technical changes.

The Senate amendment extends the au-
thority through FY 2023 and amends the con-
version provision to precede enactment of
the 2018 farm bill. (Section 2202)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with technical changes.
(Section 2308)
(12) Stewardship contracts
The Senate amendment requires environ-
mental benefits be part of the measurement
concept for types of performance. It author-
izes contract renewals and requires for re-
newals a higher level of performance with re-
spect to 2 existing priority resource concerns
in the initial contract. (Section 2203)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with technical changes.
(Section 2308)
The Managers direct the NRCS to ensure
that existing and future CSP participants
are given the opportunity to renew expiring
contracts before their original 5–year con-
tract is set to expire. Given that expiring
contracts will no longer be eligible for auto-
matic renewals and instead must compete
within the same pool as applicants applying
for a new contract, the Managers direct
NRCS to ensure that the renewal process be-
gins at the beginning of the fifth year of the
original contract so that contracts are re-en-
rolled before they expire. The Managers ex-
pect USDA to rank the renewal offers ac-
cording to the same two primary ranking
criteria used for new contracts, in addition
to including the results from previous con-
tracts.
(13) Duties of Secretary
The Senate amendment changes the an-
nual program enrollment to 8.797 million
acres each fiscal year. It directs the Sec-
retary to manage the program to achieve a
national average payment rate. It authorizes
payments for cover crop activities and ad-
vanced grazing management. It authorizes a
1-time payment to a producer for comprehen-
sive conservation plan. The amendment au-
thorizes the Secretary to allocate State

funding for organic and transition to organic
production. It requires the Secretary, to the
maximum extent feasible, to manage the
program to enhance soil health. (Section
2204)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with an amendment to
strike the annual acreage allocation and the
national average payment rate. (Section
2308)
The Managers removed the acre-based
funding method and the $18 per acre national
average payment rate for CSP. The Man-
agers intend this change to give NRCS great-
er flexibility in administering the program
to maximize the Federal investment to
achieve higher conservation benefits. This
change should allow NRCS to further the lo-
cally-led mission of addressing local con-
cerns by allowing greater investment in
local priorities. The Managers intend for
NRCS to limit contract offers that have an
exceptionally high per-acre or per-unit cost
or that score lower for addressing applicable
priority resource concerns.
The Managers support USDA recognizing
the use of innovative technology such as en-
hanced efficiency fertilizers. Enhanced effi-
ciency fertilizers, which reduce nitrate
losses to the environment, help protect
water quality, and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, include slow- and controlled-re-
lease fertilizers (absorbed, coated, occluded
or reacted) and stabilized nitrogen fertilizers
(nitrification inhibitors and nitrogen stabi-
lizers). These tools are recognized in USDA’s
conservation standards and specifications for
nutrient management and related practices
and by State regulators of fertilizers.
The Managers intend for USDA to provide
program resources for the development of a
comprehensive conservation plan. The Man-
agers intend that payments for these plans
can be prorated over the life of the 5 year
contract or paid in full the year it is com-
pleted. The Managers intend for the plan to
be implemented in a subsequent CSP con-
tract or through a different conservation
program, like EQIP.
When determining State funding alloca-
tions under CSP for organics, the Managers
intend for USDA to take into account the
number of certified organic and
transitioning to organic operations and the
number of acres in certified organic and
transitioning to organic production in a
State. Both criteria are important to ensure
that States with smaller organic operations
can compete fairly for funding with States
with larger organic operations.
The Managers intend for USDA to encour-
age States to give higher consideration to
contracts that include conservation activi-
ties to improve soil health, where this con-
sideration is appropriate and in line with
local conservation priorities. This can take
the form of higher-ranking points or other
similar prioritization of soil health in pro-
ducer applications.
The Managers direct NRCS to report on
the payment rates for conservation activi-
ties offered under CSP in each fiscal year
and analyze whether payment rates can be
reduced for the most expensive conservation
activities. The Managers encourage NRCS to
evaluate payment rates to determine the
most impactful utilization of limited pro-
gram dollars.
(14) Purposes
The Senate amendment adds adaption and
mitigation regarding weather volatility to
the practices that sustain food and fiber pro-
duction in program purposes. It also author-
izes new program purpose authority regard-
ing producer assistance to address new or ex-
pected resource concerns, including crops
and drought resistant measures. (Section
2301)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a modification regard-
ing the program’s purpose of assisting pro-
ducers. (Section 2302)
The Managers added the modifiers ‘‘identi-
fied or expected’’ to resource concerns to
help ensure that animal agriculture pro-
ducers who do not yet have livestock in their
facility, but have a contract for the animals
to be delivered within a reasonable time-
frame, may apply for and be eligible for
EQIP.
(15) Definitions
The House bill adds the following new in-
clusions to the term ‘‘practice’’: conserva-
tion activities, precision conservation, man-
agement planning, and the use of cover crops
and resource conserving crop rotations. It
defines the term ‘‘priority resource concern’’
and the term ‘‘stewardship practice’’. (Sec-
tion 2301)
The Senate amendment defines the term
‘‘conservation planning survey’’. It adds an
inclusion to the definition of ‘‘eligible land’’.
It amends the concept of other agricultural
land in the definition of the term ‘‘eligible
land’’ to include ‘‘identified or expected’’ re-
source concerns. The amendment adds 2 new
inclusions to the term ‘‘practice’’ improve-
ments. It adds new inclusions to the term
‘‘practice’’ conservation activities. It adds a
definition of the term ‘‘producer’’. (Section
2302)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with modifications, defining
the terms conservation planning assessment,
incentive practice, priority resource con-
cern, soil remediation and soil testing and
amending the definition of eligible land.
(Section 2303)
The Managers expand eligible land inclu-
sions for EQIP to environmentally sensitive
areas. The Managers intend for these areas
to be limited to associated agricultural land
with natural resource concerns, such as
road-stream crossings that a producer would
use to access a field. These areas may in-
clude land that producers use as part of their
normal agricultural operation, but is not
limited to land in active agricultural produc-
tion where the natural resource concern ex-
ists. Many of these areas are considered eli-
gible by NRCS today, but by including it in
statute the Managers intend for this to be
implemented uniformly in all States.
The Managers recognize that by providing
assistance to producers to improve soil
health on eligible land it may be necessary
to provide targeted assistance to test not
only the biological and physiological health
of the soil, but also to test for contaminants,
including heavy metals, volatile organic
compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons. Not only should the Secretary pro-
vide funding to cover the cost for this cat-
egory of targeted soil testing covered under
section 1240A, but funding should also be pro-
vided for conducting scientifically based soil
remediation practices to be carried out by
the producer. The Managers do not intend
for the Secretary to provide assistance that
would be covered under services provided
through the Brownfields Program at the En-
vironmental Protection Agency (EPA), but
do intend that the Secretary provide an as-
sessment of soil testing, as well as rec-
ommendations and technical assistance (as
covered under section 1242), to improve over-
all quality and health of soil by removing po-
tential contaminants. In the event that the
expertise for making this assistance is not
available at a local or regional level, the
Secretary may draw upon outside expertise
and/or provide training to agency staff so
that they may provide assistance and cus-
tomer service to producers.
The Managers direct the Secretary to con-
duct education and outreach to producers re-
garding the uses of soil and methods of ad-
dressing soil contamination and soil health
degradation. This outreach may include the
sharing of current information regarding soil
testing protocols made available by the EPA
Administrator. Furthermore, on the request
of a producer, where soil is found to pose an
imminent hazard to human or animal health,
the Secretary may refer the producer to the
EPA for additional assistance for remedi-
ation under section 104(k) of the Comprehen-
sive Environmental Response, Compensa-
tion, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C.
9604(k)).
(16) Establishment and administration
The House bill authorizes a wildlife
carveout at 5 percent for each of FYs 2019
through 2023. It amends the availability of
payments for water conservation or irriga-
tion efficiency practice and the list types of
practices available for water conservation
and irrigation efficiency. It makes amend-
ments to priorities for payments for water
reduction and cost-shared practices. It au-
thorizes a new authority for stewardship
contracts. (Section 2302)
The Senate amendment authorizes addi-
tional term authority for wildlife practices.
It makes amendments to the advance pay-
ment authority. The amendment authorizes
review and guidance for cost share rates,
conservation practice standards. The amend-
ment authorizes an increase payment for
high-priority practices. It decreases the live-
stock carveout from 60 percent to 50 percent,
including for grazing management practices,
and increases the wildlife carveout from 5
percent to 10 percent. The amendment allows
the Secretary to provide water conservation
and system efficiency payments. It amends
organic production payment limits to
$160,000 during FY 2019 through FY 2023. It
authorizes a micro-EQIP pilot program.
(Section 2303)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with several modifications.
The amendment moves section 2303(2) of the
Senate amendment, to section 2304(d) of this
bill. It modifies the Senate provision on ad-
vanced payments for beginning farmers by
striking the opt out concept, amending it to
be an assurance of notification to producers.
It also moves the cost-share provision and
practice standards provisions to section 1241
of the ’85 Act. It also moves high-priority
practices to section 2304 of the substitute.
The amendment includes the Senate provi-
sion on irrigation, livestock carve-out and
wildlife carve-out, and the House authority
on stewardship contracts with a technical
amendment, but modifies the payment limit
provision, and does not include the Micro-
EQIP pilot program. (Section 2304)
The Managers believe that conservation
practices adopted solely for the benefit of
wildlife should be fostered with contracts of
maximum length allowed by law. Wildlife
practices often diminish agronomic value on
working agricultural lands because they
have real implementation costs and increase
operational risks by reducing yield. These
practices are therefore highly unlikely to be
sustained by farmers without longer-term,
incentives-based partnerships with NRCS. In
taking this action to encourage longer-term
contracts, the Managers intend that con-
tracts for the benefit of wildlife should not
be limited by previous agency interpretation
limiting the length or term of these con-
tracts to three years or any other term less
than 10 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9966 December 10, 2018
The Managers authorize the Secretary to
enter into expedited contracting arrange-
ments to deliver EQIP surface and ground-
water cost-share assistance for both on and
off farm conservation measures. The Man-
agers provide that the expedited cost-share
assistance authorized by this drought au-
thority is specifically limited by project
type, and shall only be made available by the
Secretary for a watershed-wide project that
will effectively conserve water, provide fish
or wildlife habitat, or provide for drought-re-
lated environmental mitigation. The Man-
agers further direct the Secretary to
prioritize assistance provided under this au-
thority to producers participating in efforts
to stabilize water resources of state or re-
gional significance, and to prioritize cost-
share practices which improve agricultural
drought resiliency and productivity. In order
to ensure that EQIP cost-share assistance
made available under this provision does not
disadvantage other regions and conservation
concerns, the Managers specifically state
that the Secretary is not authorized to mod-
ify the process for determining the annual
allocation of EQIP funding to States. Rather
these efforts should be addressed within each
State’s locally led priorities with input from
State Technical Committees. Furthermore,
the Managers intend that the AGI waiver au-
thority made available under this provision
apply only to the eligible entity, not to indi-
vidual producers.
The Managers recognize the broad and sig-
nificant role of EQIP in promoting environ-
mental stewardship. In addressing water
quality as a resource concern, the Com-
mittee believes that conservation programs
should prioritize funding for producers im-
plementing fertilizer management practices
that incorporate the use of the right fer-
tilizer source, the right rate (amount of fer-
tilizer), the right placement of fertilizer (in-
cluding precision application) and the right
timing of fertilizer applications (making the
nutrients available when the crop needs
them). These practices are recognized by the
USDA–NRCS Nutrient Management Stand-
ard (590) and have been proven to help pro-
ducers optimize production potential and
protect the environment.
The Managers intend that conservation
programs should recognize the use of innova-
tive technology, such as enhanced efficiency
fertilizers (including slow and controlled-re-
lease fertilizers, stabilized nitrogen fer-
tilizers). This innovative technology can
help producers to protect water quality and
reduce greenhouse emissions. In the case of
EQIP applications involving manure-to-en-
ergy projects, the Managers encourage the
Secretary to consider whether the projects
include an integrative approach to address-
ing nutrient management and water quality
issues.
The Managers make changes to the ad-
vance payment option under EQIP by requir-
ing notification of an advance payment op-
tion to beginning, limited resource, and so-
cially disadvantaged producers. The Man-
agers recognize that the historic low utiliza-
tion rate by these groups is likely due to
challenges with implementation and out-
reach, rather than lack of interest. Advance
payments should be timed so that the 90 day
period to expend all funds commences at the
time practice installation begins. The Man-
agers encourage USDA to explore options to
provide assistance to small-scale and limited
resource agricultural producers to access
EQIP to address natural resource concerns.
The Managers believe that states should
increase EQIP incentives for those practices
which are especially effective at addressing
local or regionalized priority resource con-
cerns. The Managers intend for the increased
incentives to promote further adoption of
these highly beneficial practices by pro-
ducers in high priority watersheds. The Man-
agers intend that increased payments to pro-
ducers under this provision shall not exceed
90 percent of costs, even in the case of pro-
ducers who would otherwise qualify for in-
creased payments.
The Managers direct the Secretary to en-
sure conservation practice standards reflect
the use of integrated irrigation and nutrient
management technologies, such as micro-ir-
rigation systems (e.g., drip irrigation). Such
technology, in addition to providing in-
creased water efficiency, can be used to dis-
tribute fertilizers and other nutrients di-
rectly to plant roots, improve soil health,
both water quantity and quality, and reduce
nutrient runoff. In the case of EQIP applica-
tions involving irrigation projects, the Man-
agers encourage the Secretary to consider
whether the projects include an integrative
approach to addressing nutrient manage-
ment and water efficiency issues.
The Managers intend for the new incentive
contracts to be available to producers for not
less than five years, but no more than 10
years to receive annual and cost-share pay-
ments for adoption, installation, required
management and maintenance of incentive
practices that attain increased natural re-
source levels of conservation on the applica-
ble portion of the farm, ranch or forest as de-
termined by the producer. The Managers an-
ticipate incentive practices with broad re-
source benefits (including, but not limited
to, cover crops, transition to resource con-
serving crop rotations, and incorporation of
precision agriculture technologies into agri-
culture operations) will be available to pro-
ducers within the program. Similarly, a
broad suite of incentive practices relating to
grazing lands and forest lands will be avail-
able to incentivize increased levels of con-
servation around locally-established re-
source priorities.
(17) Evaluation of application
The Senate amendment authorizes applica-
tion priority for the consideration of the
most effective practices to address natural
resource concerns. (Section 2304)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a modification, moving
the priority to section 2503 of the substitute,
as an implementation provision. (Section
2503)
(18) Duties of the Secretary
The Senate amendment authorizes the Sec-
retary, to the maximum extent feasible, to
streamline and coordinate between the EQIP
plan and CSP and manage the program for
soil health. (Section 2305)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment in section 2304 of the Con-
ference substitute. (Section 2308)
(19) Environmental quality incentives program
plan
The Senate amendment amends the re-
quirement for a CAFO plan of operation to
include ‘‘progressive’’ implementation. (Sec-
tion 2306)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 2305)
The Managers intend for the Comprehen-
sive Nutrient Management Plan (‘‘CNMP’’)
to remain a comprehensive and whole farm
plan. However, during a particular EQIP con-
tract period, it is not necessary for an exist-
ing facility with a CNMP to achieve every
aspect of the CNMP all at once if doing so
would be practically or economically infeasi-
ble. In such instances, progressive implemen-
tation should include an appropriate and re-
alistic timeframe for the remaining imple-
mentation factors after the end of the con-
tract period, including, if warranted, with
additional EQIP assistance.
(20) Conservation innovation grants and pay-
ments
The House bill caps conservation innova-
tion grants at not more than $25 million for
each of FYs 2019 through 2023 and increases
air quality funding at $37.5 million for each
of FYs 2019 through 2023. The amendment
also includes new on farm conservation inno-
vation trials. (Section 2304)
The Senate amendment authorizes new
program uses. It reauthorizes the funding
provision through fiscal year 2023. (Section
2308).
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendment. The modi-
fications include a provision specific to com-
munity colleges and an authorization of
partnerships with farmers for certain inno-
vative conservation practices, as well as
edge- of-field, emerging agricultural prac-
tices, and other monitoring practices. The
substitute does not include the House cap on
conservation innovation grant funds. The
amendment includes a soil health dem-
onstration trial within the authority for On-
Farm Conservation Innovation Trials. (Sec-
tion 2307)
The Managers intend for the conservation
innovation grants to promote innovative
conservation approaches that increase green
space, pollinator habitat, stormwater man-
agement, carbon sequestration, and access to
agricultural production sites through land
tenure agreements and other contracts.
The Managers believe that conservation in-
novation and technological advancement
should be farmer-centric and support experi-
mentation by farmers. It should harness
leading-edge technology and data science
while also leveraging private expertise and
capital. Producers are also reluctant to in-
troduce new conservation practices across
the entire farming operation without first
testing how they work in practice. Current
law has focused on innovation of practices
but not enough on testing and adoption at
field scale in partnership with farmers. An
important component of innovation trials is
involving the private sector and the Man-
agers intend commercial entities to work to-
gether with NRCS to test and prove new con-
servation practices.
The Managers intend that innovation
trials take place on a variety of operations
that reflect the diversity of producers and
natural resource concerns present across the
United States, and that payments be made
to producers across a range of operation
sizes. Included in the innovation trials is a
Soil Health Demonstration Trial, which
USDA should implement by drawing upon
the expertise and resources of outside part-
ners (including commodity groups and pro-
ducers) to mirror and build upon existing
soil health projects.
Furthermore, the Managers intend that
the conservation practice database be a pub-
licly available and continuously updated re-
source that informs the public on USDA con-
servation practice standards and contributes
to the conservation efforts of partners and
producers in the agricultural community.
The Managers intend for the Secretary to
ensure all producers in the innovation trials
meet EQIP eligibility requirements before
participation in the program. The explicit
statutory language requiring the Secretary
to enforce adjusted gross income require-
ments for producers shall not preclude or im-
pact enforcement of these requirements in
other conservation programs.

December 10, 2018
(21) Soil health demonstration pilot project
The Senate amendment authorizes a soil
health demonstration pilot project that in-
cludes financial incentives for producers in
appropriate geographic regions, including at
least 1 drought prone region, and establishes
protocols for measuring gains in soil health.
The amendment also authorizes a study on
soil health and economic outcomes, report to
Congress and provides $15 million annually
through fiscal year 2023 to carry out the
pilot. (Section 2309)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with modifications within
the authority for On-Farm Conservation In-
novation Trials. (Section 2307)
(22) Wetland conservation
The House bill requires the Secretary to
identify regulatory categorical exemptions
within 180 days of enactment of the 2018 farm
bill as it relates to the minimal effects ex-
emption. It further provides $10 million in
mandatory funds for wetlands mitigation
banking beginning in FY 2019, which funds
shall remain available until expended. It also
authorizes appropriations of $5 million for
each of FYs 2019 through 2023. (Sections 2101
and 2102)
The Senate amendment requires that the
requisite on-site inspection occur in the
presence of the affected person, as long as
they are available for such inspection. It
clarifies that no person shall become ineli-
gible if the Secretary determines an exemp-
tion under section 1222(b) of the ’85 Act ap-
plies to that person. It directs the Secretary,
within 1 year, to identify categorical mini-
mal effect exemptions in compliance with
certain laws and regulations and in consulta-
tion with particular groups. The amendment
eliminates mandatory funding for mitigation
banking and instead authorizes $5 million in
appropriations for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023. (Sections 2401, 2412, and 2413)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment to section 1221(d) of the ’85
Act with a modification to the authority for
on-site visits without the affected person
present. The substitute also deletes the
House and Senate provisions on minimal ef-
fects under 1222(d). (Sections 2101 and 2102)
(23) Conservation security program
The House bill repeals the conservation se-
curity program and conservation steward-
ship program authorities. It clarifies that
the amendment does not have an impact on
existing contracts. It also prohibits the Sec-
retary from renewing existing contracts.
(Section 2801)
The Senate amendment repeals subchapter
A of chapter 2 of subtitle D of the ’85 Act.
(Section 2402)
The Conference substitute repeals both
conservation programs and establishes the
subchapter B of chapter 2 authority in sub-
chapter B of chapter 4 of the ’85 Act. It also
provides transition authority, monetizes the
acreage cap, and establishes the Grasslands
Incentive Program. (Sections 2301 and 2308)
With the combination of CSP and EQIP
under Chapter 4, the Managers intend for the
Secretary to implement the programs in co-
ordination with each other while also main-
taining each subchapter as a separate and
distinguishable program with a distinct pur-
pose. The Managers intend for USDA to con-
tinue to seek applications and enroll pro-
ducers in both EQIP and CSP each year, and
to promote both programs equally among
producers.
This reorganization of programs provides
an opportunity to streamline procedures for
both programs so that they complement
each other and provide a better customer
service experience for producers, while maxi-
mizing the conservation potential of this
chapter. Streamlining efforts for these pro-
grams should include applications, con-
tracting, conservation planning, conserva-
tion practices, and related administrative
procedures. The Managers encourage USDA
to provide outreach and technical assistance
to producers to assist them in resolving pri-
ority resource concerns through adaptive
management and continual improvement
through both programs.
The Managers intend for CSP and EQIP
under Chapter 4 to provide flexibility at the
local level to address issues for all produc-
tion systems, especially those in semi-arid
areas where there is a need for practices to
increase water savings and climate resil-
iency. For example, wheat growers need to
be able to access the program through con-
servation practices that are specific to local
production needs and that includes areas
with lower rainfall. The Managers believe
USDA should provide appropriate conserva-
tion practice and enhancement options for
producers that focus on drought mitigation
and dryland agriculture. The Managers also
believe USDA should also provide assistance
at varying levels of conservation perform-
ance, to enable all producers to access con-
servation assistance.
The Conference substitute establishes a
new Grassland Conservation Initiative with-
in Subchapter B of the Conservation Stew-
ardship Program. The Managers require
USDA to establish this initiative beginning
in fiscal year 2019 and intend the first oppor-
tunity to enroll be provided in fiscal year
2019 to eligible land on a voluntary basis.
The Managers expect that additional enroll-
ments also be offered in each subsequent fis-
cal year at a time determined appropriate by
the Department. Regardless of the fiscal
year, eligible land, as defined, shall be en-
rolled only once in the program. The Man-
agers expect FSA and NRCS to work concur-
rently to identify and provide program infor-
mation to producers who have eligible acres
to enroll in the program. The Grassland Con-
servation Initiative establishes a statutory
$18 per acre payment rate and payments
shall be made on an annual basis. The Man-
agers do not intend for the Grassland Con-
servation Initiative to be administered in
the same exact manner as CSP and have es-
tablished separate program requirements.
The Managers do not intend to require that
the eligible land enrolled has to be in grass
at the time of enrollment or maintained as
grass for the life of the contract for purposes
of addressing a resource concern. The Man-
agers do not intend for the grassland con-
tracts to be subject to CSP payment limits.
The Managers provide an early termination
of the contract at any time without penalty
to the producer, and all land enrolled during
a crop year shall be planted or considered
planted to an agricultural commodity during
that crop year.
(24) Conservation of private grazing land
The Senate amendment adds authority for
partnerships. (Section 2403)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 2404)
(25) Soil health and income protection program
The Senate amendment authorizes the soil
health and income protection program to as-
sist landowners with conserving and improv-
ing soil, water and wildlife resources. It al-
lows agreements entered under this program
to be for 3, 4, or 5 years. Provides an author-
ization of appropriations to carry out this
program. (Section 2404)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a modification author-
izing a pilot program in the Conservation
Reserve Program. (Section 2204)
(26) Grassroots source water protection program
The House bill extends this authority
through FY 2023. It authorizes $5 million in
mandatory funding beginning in FY 2019, to
remain available until expended. (Section
2402)
The Senate amendment authorizes $25 mil-
lion in appropriations for each of fiscal years

House provision. (Section 2405)
(27) Soil testing and remediation assistance
The Senate amendment authorizes soil
testing and remediation assistance. It re-
quires the Secretary to work with producers
to mitigate the presence of contaminants in
soil, including by establishing a soil testing
protocol, providing technical assistance for
testing and remediation, education, out-
reach. It also authorizes a referral to the En-
vironmental Protection Agency if necessary
for additional remediation assistance. (Sec-
tion 2406)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with modifications, includ-
ing to the definition of ‘‘practice’’ under
EQIP authorities. (Section 2303)
(28) Voluntary public access and habitat incen-
tive program
The House bill authorizes $50 million in
mandatory funding for the period of FY 2019
through 2023. (Section 2403)
The Senate amendment merges the con-
servation innovation grant authority with
the voluntary public access and habitat in-
centive program authority. It authorizes $40
million of mandatory funding from Chapter 5
of the ’85 Act for the period of FY 2019
through 2023 towards the voluntary public
access and habitat incentive program. (Sec-
tion 2407)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. It simplifies the current
grant application process, increases funding
in response to increased popularity, and in-
cludes additional incentives intended to en-
courage owners of private land to allow pub-
lic recreation on land containing wetland re-
serve easements. (Section 2406)
The Managers intend the $3 million for en-
hancing access to Wetland Reserve Ease-
ments (‘‘WRE’’) to be utilized to determine
the level of interest among States in pro-
viding public access for hunting, fishing, and
other recreational activities on WRP/WRE
acreage. Because there are legitimate con-
cerns about the scarcity of public access and
the quality of wildlife habitat on wetland
easements, landowners who are not utilizing
or underutilizing enrolled land for personal
use could potentially be incentivized to open
their enrolled land to public use. After mak-
ing a reasonable effort to conduct landowner
outreach, if the Secretary determines that
exchanging incentives for public access for
recreation on WRE/WRP acreage would not
be realistic, remaining funds are to be avail-
able for the other purposes of the program.

in the environmental quality incentives pro-
gram. (Section 2409)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.
The Managers recommend that USDA rec-
ognize as a best management practice in con-
servation programs the use of remote telem-
etry data systems for irrigation scheduling.
Remote telemetry data systems, as used for
irrigation scheduling, combine the use of
field, weather, crop and soil data, which en-
sures that the precise amount of water is ap-
plied to crops to promote water and energy
efficiency while also increasing crop yields.
The Managers encourage USDA to incor-
porate remote telemetry data systems as a
best management practice under the Envi-
ronmental Quality Incentives Program.
(31) Agricultural conservation easement program
The House bill clarifies that one of the pro-
gram purposes of the Agricultural Conserva-
tion Easement Program is to limit non-agri-
cultural uses of land that negatively affect
the agricultural uses and conservation val-
ues. It strikes ‘‘restoring and’’ and inserts
‘‘restoring or’’. It amends the definition of
‘‘eligible land’’ to include up to 100 percent
of the described parcel under certain enroll-
ment circumstances. It strikes the consulta-
tion requirement with the Department of the
Interior. The bill defines the term ‘‘moni-
toring report’’. It authorizes technical as-
sistance to implement the program. The bill
allows for other forms of contributions from
the eligible entities: cash contribution, char-
itable donation or funding from a non-USDA
federal source. It continues the same cap for
grasslands. The bill amends minimum terms
and conditions to also require those are con-
sistent with the agricultural use of the land.
The bill further clarifies that the current
right of enforcement does not extend a right
of inspection unless the holder of the ease-
ment does not provide timely monitoring re-
ports. The bill also strikes the Agricultural
Land Easement ‘‘(ALE)’’ plan requirements
and requires a conservation plan for highly
erodible cropland. It requires proof of fraud
or gross negligence to require a refund. The
bill authorizes additional provisions regard-
ing mineral development and environmental
services markets. It authorizes within the
entity certification a process to allow a cer-
tified eligible entity to use its own terms
and conditions. It adds certification criteria
regarding those accredited by the Land
Trust Accreditation Commission with cer-
tain requirements. The bill amends sub-
section (d) of the ’85 Act by amending the
technical assistance authority to assist in
compliance with the terms and conditions of
easements. It requires the terms and condi-
tions of a wetland easement to comply with
a grazing management plan that is modified
at least every 5 years. The bill strikes ‘‘or
off- site’’ in paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of
the ’85 Act and the term ‘‘proposed or’’,
which is replaced with ‘‘permitted or’’. It
separates out and provides new modification
and termination authorities. It prohibits the
limitation in section 1001D(B)(1) of the ’85
Act from applying to a landowner with re-
spect to any benefit described in paragraph
(2)(B) of that section, related to the purchase
of the easement. (Sections 2601–2605)
The Senate amendment clarifies that one
of the purposes of ACEP is to limit non-agri-
cultural uses of land that may negatively
impact the agricultural uses and conserva-
tion values. It adds acequias to the list of el-
igible entities. It amends the definition of
‘‘eligible land’’ to reflect the additional re-
quirements for eligibility of certain land.
The amendment authorizes buy-protect-sell
transactions and authorizes technical assist-
ance to implement the program, including
for the development of a conservation plan.
It strikes clause (ii) of subsection (b)(2)(B) of
the ’85 Act regarding the source of contribu-
tion and replaces it with a charitable dona-
tion, certain costs related to securing a deed
and other costs, as determined by the Sec-
retary. The amendment requires an appli-
cant to develop an agricultural land ease-
ment plan. It adds an additional priority for
applications that maintain agricultural via-
bility. It amends minimum terms and condi-
tions to also require those are consistent
with the agricultural activities to be cov-
ered. The amendment strikes the ALE plan
requirements in clause (iv) of the ‘85 Act and
requires in a new subparagraph the terms
and conditions exclude a right of inspection,
unless monitoring reports are not provided.
It authorizes additional terms and condi-
tions. It also adds an additional term and
condition authorizing the certified eligible
entity to use its own terms and conditions to
account for geographic differences. The
amendment adds two certification criteria
for those accredited by the Land Trust Com-
mission with certain different requirements
or State Departments of Agriculture or
other State agencies. It adds acequias as an
entity that may enroll in a 30-year contract.
It adds as a consideration the ability of the
land to sequester carbon. The amendment
adds as a priority the improvement of water
quality. It adds acequias as eligible entities
for a contract or agreement regarding tech-
nical assistance and to carry out special wet-
land reserve enhancements. The amendment
authorizes the Secretary to establish or re-
store alternative vegetative communities. It
provides that subsection (a)(2) of the ’85 Act
(new subparagraph (B)) is subject to the new
acequia authority. It provides authority for
the Secretary to acquire land owned by
acequias. The amendment authorizes the
Secretary to terminate or modify a contract
under section 1231(a) of the ’85 Act if the land
is enrolled in an ALE easement under sec-
tion 1265C(b). It authorizes the Secretary to
simultaneously enroll land subject to an
easement in a CRP contract under sub-
chapter B of chapter 1 of the ’85 Act. (Sec-
tion 2410)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments. It nar-
rows existing limitation on nonagricultural
uses to those that negatively affect agricul-
tural and conservation values while expand-
ing cost-share and program eligibility, in-
cluding land subject to buy-protect-sell
transactions, and broadens secretarial au-
thority to set application criteria and modi-
fies authority to conduct enforcement, sub-
ordination, modification, exchange, and ter-
mination of easements. It also provides addi-
tional allowable conditions an easement
holder may place on the agreement and
prioritizes water quality improvement on
wetland reserve easements. It authorizes al-
ternative vegetative communities. Land en-
rolled under ALE may simultaneously be en-
rolled under a CRP contract. (Subtitle F)
The Managers make amendments to both
Agricultural Land Easements and Wetland
Reserve Easements in order to improve pro-
gram deliverability. The Managers expect
the agency to prioritize the maintenance and
enhancement of the functions and values of
currently enrolled WRE. While some States
have effectively achieved increased wetland
functions and values, including optimum
wildlife habitat, more could be done by
States to achieve these goals. By including
these statutory changes for WRE, the Man-
agers hope to ensure these wetlands and as-
sociated upland areas will be managed so the
taxpayers receive the wildlife habitat and
water quality benefits they have paid for and
deserve.
The Managers included language on alter-
native plant communities and intend for the
agency to eliminate the 30 percent restric-
tion on restoration of alternative plant com-
munities as part of a wetland reserve ease-
ment, and to provide flexibility in wetland
restoration to enhance wetland functions
and migratory bird habitat values and con-
tribute to the goals of state, regional, and
local conservation initiatives.
Riparian areas are critical to wildlife con-
servation and water quality, especially in
the Southwest where non-contiguous ripar-
ian habitats constitute a major portion of
those States’ wetlands. These riparian areas
in the Southwest that are not connected to
permanently protected wetlands are eligible
for WRE, and the Managers urge the Sec-
retary to invest the resources needed to
make WRE a useful and well-used tool in
those states where riparian areas are so crit-
ical to wildlife, including in New Mexico and
Arizona.
The Managers’ intent behind allowing
flexibility and additional options in the non-
federal share of cost share assistance
(matching funds) is to broaden the ability of
entities to participate in ALE, including for
grasslands of special environmental signifi-
cance, across a more diverse geography. The
intention of the language is to provide better
access to the program to states where farm
and ranchland preservation funding is not
readily available like South Dakota, Texas,
and Alabama. The Managers do not believe
the program should be limited only to enti-
ties that can provide cash match. It is im-
portant to acknowledge other expenses that
an entity must take on, such as the long-
term expense of monitoring an easement or
other additional upfront costs. The Managers
believe that the long-term strength of the
program is derived from making the program
available as broadly and equitably as pos-
sible across diverse regions of the country.
The Managers do not intend for USDA to re-
ject cash match entirely but to broaden the
options available to eligible entities.
The Managers have made two main
changes to certification language in the Con-
ference substitute. The first is to clarify the
intent of Congress that a certified entity
should be able to write its own deed terms,
subject to minimum deed terms set by
NRCS. This was the intent in the Agricul-
tural Act of 2014 and is clarified here. The
Department should not put undue burden on
an entity’s ability to write its own deed
terms. Second, the Managers have provided
three pathways for eligible entities to be cer-
tified. The first is the Agricultural Act of
2014’s retained provision enabling any eligi-
ble entity to be certified if it demonstrates
to the Secretary certain capabilities around
acquiring, administering and enforcing agri-
cultural land easements. Two additional
pathways have been created one for accred-
ited land trusts, and the other for State
agencies with statutory authority for farm
and ranch land protection. In order to be-
come certified, the entity must have ac-
quired a certain number of easements
through a Federal easement program and
successfully met program responsibilities in
doing so.
The Managers limit the Secretary’s au-
thority to the right of enforcement under
the program and clarify that such right only
extends to a right of inspection in two cases:
(1) where a monitoring report is not supplied
or (2) when there is reasonable evidence of
violation of the terms of the easement. The
Managers intend for entities to be the pri-
mary agent for enforcement of the deed
terms reinforcing Congressional intent back
to the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act
of 2008.
The Managers defined a monitoring report
in order to provide clarity to NRCS on the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9969
December 10, 2018
documentation required by eligible entities.
The Managers believe that this clarification
is needed to ensure that NRCS respects the
role of the eligible entity and does not pur-
sue an inspection role while the eligible enti-
ty is fulfilling responsibilities under their
agreements and providing reports to NRCS.
The Managers modified the definition of el-
igible land to allow for agricultural land to
be owned by an eligible entity on a transi-
tional basis to qualify for program participa-
tion, provided that the land subject to the
agricultural land easement be transitioned
to farmer or rancher ownership within 3
years. The language provides two pathways
for these ‘‘Buy-Protect-Sell’’-type projects,
both of which allow an application to the
program for purchase of an agricultural land
easement without a pending offer and with-
out identification of the farmer or rancher to
whom the land will eventually transfer.
The Managers recognize the value of ‘‘Buy-
Protect-Sell’’ projects, which are intended to
help farmers and ranchers gain access to af-
fordable farmland, and the need for flexi-
bility in the program to facilitate their use.
The Managers recognize that the process of
identifying a farmer or rancher to purchase
the protected land and effecting the sale of
that land can take time, and that unforeseen
circumstances can delay a sale. With this in
mind, the timeline—and option for exten-
sion—laid out in this section is intended to
provide as much flexibility as possible, while
at the same time holding eligible entities to
the terms of their initial application.
By striking the consultation with the Sec-
retary of the Interior, the Managers do not
intend to exclude the Department of the In-
terior from involvement in WRE. It is the in-
tent of the Managers that the Secretary of
Agriculture continue to implement the pro-
gram in close partnership with the Depart-
ment of the Interior at the local level.
While the Conference substitute removes
the requirement for an ALE plan as part of
the minimum deed terms (except for land
with highly erodible soil), the Managers en-
courage USDA and eligible entities to work
with landowners entering into an ALE ease-
ment to undertake conservation planning ac-
tivities on their land in order to maximize
the environmental value of the protected
land.
The Managers recognize the substantial in-
vestment taxpayers make in easements and
understand the importance of ensuring tax-
payer dollars are wisely spent. However, on
limited occasions, there may be justifica-
tions for changes to easements. Entities par-
ticipating in the ALE program take the obli-
gations that come with stewarding perpetual
easements very seriously. Modifying an ease-
ment can be necessary from time to time for
a variety of reasons. Modifications should be
done to (1) add acreage; (2) improve con-
servation values; or (3) improve the adminis-
tration of the easement. Alternative options
should always be considered before adminis-
trative action is taken to change or modify
the terms of the easement. Terminating an
easement should only be done in very rare
cases and the Conference substitute does not
weaken the current requirements for termi-
nation actions. In the case of termination
actions, the United States should be fully
compensated, including for any restoration
costs. However, the Managers understand
there needs to be some flexibility and
straight forward rules in these rare instances
of termination. The Managers expect that
the Department will provide entities with
the flexibility to properly administer per-
petual easements, but to be prudent in the
use of this flexibility. The Managers intend
that a contribution shall not fail to be con-
sidered a qualified contribution under the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1986 based solely on
the termination authority granted to the
Secretary under this section.
The Managers include the consideration of
agricultural viability as a priority for the
Secretary in evaluating applications under
the program. The Managers consider the
components of agricultural viability to in-
clude those that enable a producer to produc-
tively operate a farm or ranch on the pro-
tected land; maintain the long-term afford-
ability of the protected land; maintain an
economically sustainable farm business on
the protected land; and maintain the pro-
tected land in a way that enables its agricul-
tural use by future generations of farmers
and ranchers.
The Managers intend to provide explicit
authorization for eligible entities to add
deed terms to the agricultural land easement
that address farmland affordability and keep
the protected parcel in farmer ownership.
The Managers envision that these deed terms
include those that NRCS has permitted in
ALE easement purchases in Vermont and
Massachusetts, known as the Option to Pur-
chase at Agricultural Value, as well as deed
terms with a similar purpose, such as a Pre-
emptive Purchase Right.
The Managers allow for entities holding an
ALE to add deed terms that address mineral
development. The intent of the Managers is
to provide statutory clarity to the issue of
mineral development on easement lands. The
Managers have determined that instances
when the ALE program prohibits subsurface
mineral development on lands where mineral
rights have been severed, they are limiting
the applicability and impact of the program
by eliminating otherwise high value con-
servation lands from program eligibility.
This provision does not negate or supersede
any other applicable laws, including State
laws, which may otherwise apply to any min-
eral development activities. In the event
that mineral development rights are re-
served and exercised under the program, the
activity should be consistent with the con-
servation and agricultural purposes of the
land and all provisions of the program. It is
not the intention of the Managers to have a
massive expansion of mineral rights explo-
ration on ALE lands but it is intended to
provide clarity, especially on lands where
mineral rights are severed and not owned by
the landowner. This language is not intended
to require States that have specific prohibi-
tions against mineral development on eased
lands to allow mineral rights development
on eased lands.
(32) Regional conservation partnership program
The House bill amends the term ‘‘covered
program’’ to include CRP and the Watershed
Protection and Flood Prevention Act. It
amends the term ‘‘eligible activity’’ to in-
clude ‘‘resource-conserving crop rotations’’.
It amends the same term to include protec-
tion of source waters for drinking water. The
bill amends the length of the partnership
agreements to limit an agreement and re-
newal to 5 years, and one extension up to 12
months. The bill further authorizes the Sec-
retary to enter into a partnership agree-
ment, including a renewal under subsection
(d)(5) of the ’85 Act for longer than 5 years if
necessary to meet the objectives. It amends
subsection (c)(1) (E) of the ’85 Act to include
quantification of the project’s environ-
mental outcomes. It also directs the Sec-
retary to conduct a ‘‘simplified’’ competitive
process. The bill authorizes applications for
renewals for certain purposes. It also amends
the Adjusted Gross Income (‘‘AGI’’) waiver
authority under section 1001D of the Act to
create an exemption to the limitation of
paragraph (2), as well as any limitations re-
lated to the covered programs for producers.
The bill authorizes mandatory funding at
$250 million for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023. It directs the Secretary to pro-
vide guidance on how to quantify and report
environmental outcomes and the progress
being made towards quantifying and report-
ing the same. It eliminates the limitation
applying the Small Watershed Program to
only Critical Conservation Areas (‘‘CCA’’).
(Sections 2701–2706)
The Senate amendment amends the pro-
gram to simplify and streamline the pro-
gram. The Senate amendment eliminates the
requirement for USDA to operate the pro-
gram through the terms and conditions of
the covered programs and instead requires
USDA to operate it as a stand-alone program
using a new program contract for producers.
The Senate bill included new authority for
renewal of partnership agreements, provided
more flexibility in the partner funding con-
tributions, eliminated and replaced Alter-
native Funding Arrangement authority with
a new grant authority limited to 30 percent
of annual funding, eliminated the national
funding pool and created a new multistate
funding pool, increased mandatory funding
to $200 million per year, retained the 7 per-
cent reservation of funds from the covered
programs, and revised criteria for CCA des-
ignations. (Section 2411)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with modifications. The con-
ference report maintains most of the Senate
bill reforms, with a few amendments. The
two Senate bill funding pools will be fund
equally between states and multistate CCAs.
The new grant authority from the Senate
bill is revised to allow USDA to enter into up
to 15 grants or Alternative Funding Arrange-
ments per year with eligible partners. Man-
datory funding is increased to $300 million
per year and the 7 percent reservation of
funds is eliminated. (Subtitle G)
The Managers streamline the operation of
the Regional Conservation Partnership Pro-
gram (RCPP) to increase program adoption
by eligible partners and producers alike. The
Managers intend for USDA to use the cov-
ered programs (as defined in statute) as a
guide for what conservation activities can be
done through partnership agreements and
contracts with producers, but do not intend
for USDA to continue to implement RCPP
through the rules and regulations of the cov-
ered programs. NRCS shall run RCPP as a
stand-alone program, with its own rules and
regulations, and shall revise the program to
focus on increasing producer access, improv-
ing conservation outcomes, and simplifying
procedures.
The Managers do not intend for the change
in RCPP’s eligible activities to, in any way,
lessen the prioritization of projects that may
include drought mitigation, flood preven-
tion, water retention or water quantity and
groundwater recharge activities. The avail-
ability of funding to address these issues re-
mains of utmost importance in many regions
of the country.
The Managers continue to believe that ini-
tiatives developed at the local level and with
local input are critical to ensuring the suc-
cess of this program. Therefore, the Man-
agers encourage potential project partners to
engage with conservation districts within
the boundaries of a proposed project for
input and feedback on the natural resource
priorities that have been identified. The
Managers encourage NRCS to include con-
servation district engagement within its
ranking criteria.
The Managers modified the terms in the
establishment of RCPP to ensure eligible
partners entering into agreements can be
funded through alternative funding arrange-
ments and grant agreements through which
the eligible partners can implement projects
and provide financial assistance directly to

producers. It also modifies the purposes of
the program by striking the use of covered
programs under RCPP and refocuses the pro-
gram on carrying out conservation activities
through program contracts outside of cov-
ered programs. The Managers intend for this
to change how NRCS carries out RCPP by
moving away from implementation directly
through the covered programs.
The definition of ‘covered program’ under
RCPP is revised to be a ‘‘purpose, activity,
or agreement’’ of EQIP, CSP, ACEP, CRP,
Healthy Forest Reserve Program, and the
Watershed Act. The Managers intend this
change to mean that a partnership agree-
ment must include a purpose, activity or
agreement that is authorized in one of the
covered programs, but not be carried out
through the covered program.
The definition of eligible partner is up-
dated to specifically include acequias, land
trusts and other organizations who have au-
thority to hold conservation easements, and
conservation districts. The Managers note
that these entities are already considered el-
igible partners by NRCS, but wanted to
make that clear in statute so they continue
to be eligible in the future.
While the Managers intend to allow a part-
nership agreement longer than 5 years under
RCPP, they expect the Secretary to only
allow longer agreements in select situations,
like if the longer period is concurrent with a
deadline established under a State or Fed-
eral program that relates specifically to the
project.
The Managers emphasize the importance of
a partner’s duty to quantify the environ-
mental outcomes of their RCPP projects, and
partners are encouraged to assess and report
on the economic and social outcomes of their
projects, as partners may be able to encour-
age increased adoption of conservation prac-
tices. The Managers expect the Secretary to
provide guidance to partners on how to quan-
tify and report on the outcomes of their
projects. This guidance should include meth-
ods and tools that can be used to quantify
outcomes at varying scales appropriate to
projects (regional, state, county, watershed,
field, etc.), and for the various natural re-
source concerns addressed by projects. The
Managers emphasize the importance of pre-
senting the progress of partners and partici-
pating producers in regular reports to Con-
gress, while recognizing that different con-
servation practices have differing timelines
for their full effects to be realized.
The Managers clarified the partner con-
tribution requirements to ensure that a part-
ner contribution can be a combination of fi-
nancial or in-kind contributions, and that
time spent between the announcement of the
project award and the signing of the partner-
ship agreement can be counted toward the
partner contribution.
The Managers intend for NRCS to ensure
that there is a staff person in every state to
serve as an RCPP coordinator. This person
should be available to assist partners with
implementing the project and provide re-
ports and other information required by the
Secretary. While the Managers did not in-
clude the requirement for modification of
conservation practice standards from the
Senate bill within RCPP, this authority was
moved to Section 1242 of the Food Security
Act of 1985 so that the modification of con-
servation practice standards can be allowed
for all conservation programs.
The Managers direct USDA to create a
simplified application process for eligible en-
tities, particularly new partners and small
organizations.
The Managers intend NRCS to develop a
separate, noncompetitive process for renew-
ing successful partnership agreements. NRCS
should ensure that only the most successful
projects qualify for renewal, and the Man-
agers do not intend for renewals to use a ma-
jority of funding available each fiscal year.
Since the national funding pool is elimi-
nated, the Managers intend that any eligible
partner that was funded through the na-
tional funding pool and otherwise meets the
requirements for renewal of that partnership
agreement shall be renewed with funding
from the applicable State or multiple State
competitive process.
The Managers encourage the Secretary to
provide all RCPP applicants who are not
awarded a partnership agreement, informa-
tion and feedback, including written infor-
mation and feedback as appropriate, for im-
provements that could be made to the appli-
cation to make it more competitive if the
partner chooses to apply again in the future.
The Managers provided new authority for
the Secretary to deliver RCPP through a
new program contract with producers that is
not a contract from a covered program. The
Managers intend the Secretary to have
greater flexibility in setting the terms of the
program contract and the type of conserva-
tion activities to be undertaken by pro-
ducers. New application bundles are author-
ized to give higher priority to projects where
a majority of producers in a watershed agree
to submit applications for conservation ac-
tivities. The Managers intend the Secretary
to utilize this authority when there would be
a greater conservation benefit to the water-
shed.
The Managers authorize USDA to enter
into both alternative funding arrangements
and grant agreements with eligible partners,
depending on the specific requirements of
the project. The alternative funding arrange-
ment or grant agreements provision replaces
the problematic ‘‘alternative funding ar-
rangement’’ (AFA) provision in the current
law. The current AFA provision proved to be
time-intensive and difficult to contract for
multi-producer, irrigation infrastructure
projects and other watershed scale projects,
and only two AFA contracts were completed
nation-wide under the current law. This sec-
tion addresses the short-comings of the cur-
rent AFA provision by providing new statu-
tory authority for straight-forward con-
tracting with an eligible partner imple-
menting an RCPP project directly with mul-
tiple producers, such as a project to upgrade
water delivery or irrigation infrastructure
owned by a canal company, ditch company,
or irrigation district.
The Conference substitute limits AFA and
grant projects to no more than 15 projects
per year. The Managers encourage the Sec-
retary to use discretion to ensure that the
project can truly be carried out more effec-
tively through the alternative funding ar-
rangement or grant than through the tradi-
tional partnership agreement model. The
Managers also intend for the eligible part-
ners to ensure that the projects under this
authority directly benefit and involve pro-
ducers.
While the eligible partner will be respon-
sible for contracting with producers and
making payments to producers, the Sec-
retary may provide technical and adminis-
trative assistance to support the eligible
partner. Such assistance includes checking
producer eligibility requirements, including
conservation compliance, adjusted gross in-
come, and payment limits.
While the Conference substitute included
alternative funding arrangements alongside
grants within this authority, it is the intent
of the Managers that the Secretary utilize
alternative funding arrangements to provide
both flexibility in implementation and sup-
port for eligible partners. The Managers rec-
ognize that AFAs may provide the Depart-
ment with more administrative flexibility,
but intend for these to run very similar to a
grant agreement. If the eligible partner and
the Secretary so choose, they may simply
enter directly into a grant agreement in lieu
of an AFA.
In order to simplify the application proc-
ess, the national funding pool is eliminated.
Partners can apply if they are in a critical
conservation area, or under a new state and
multistate funding pool. The Managers in-
tend the state and multistate funding pool to
fund both large and small projects. For the
multistate authority, the State Conserva-
tionist for each state involved should agree
to fund the project in order for it to be
awarded.
There has been considerable frustration
among partners regarding the use of tech-
nical assistance by NRCS in implementing
the program. The Managers intend NRCS to
be straightforward and up front with part-
ners about the amount of technical assist-
ance that will be needed to implement
projects and to report publicly on that infor-
mation. To help further its capacity to get
conservation on the ground, NRCS should in-
crease efforts to engage third-party pro-
viders in technical assistance for projects.
The Managers intend for NRCS to continue
to apply conservation compliance require-
ments to producers participating in projects
through RCPP, including through the alter-
native funding arrangement or grant agree-
ment authority.
The Managers expect the Secretary to
work with eligible partners to ensure partici-
pation in projects by beginning farmers and
ranchers, veteran farmers and ranchers, so-
cially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers,
and limited resource farmers and ranchers.
Both USDA and eligible partners shall con-
duct outreach and provide technical assist-
ance to historically underserved producer
groups to ensure that these groups actively
participate in RCPP projects.
The Managers intend the current Critical
Conservation Areas (CCA) to remain in place
for the duration of the 2018 Farm Bill, unless
the Secretary can demonstrate the resource
concerns have been fully addressed for the
CCA. In addition, some partners believe that
some project awards in a CCA were not di-
rectly addressing the primary resource con-
cerns for the respective CCA. The Managers
intend for the Secretary to only award
projects in the CCA directly related to the
primary resource concerns for a CCA.
The Managers expect the Secretary to pro-
vide guidance to partners on how to quantify
and report on the outcomes of their projects.
This guidance should include methods and
tools that can be used to quantify outcomes
at varying scales appropriate to projects (re-
gional, state, county, watershed, field, etc.)
and for the various natural resource con-
cerns addressed by projects. The Managers
emphasize the importance of presenting the
progress of partners and participating pro-
ducers in regular reports to Congress, while
recognizing that different conservation prac-
tices have differing times for their effects to
be realized.
(33) Emergency conservation program
The House bill restructures section 401 of
the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 (the
‘‘ACA’’) into two subsections amending ex-
isting law to add wildfires and creating a
new subsection for repair and replacement of
fencing with option to receive the payment
in advance. It adds new section 402A to the
ACA, providing maximum cost-share rate,
exceptions for Limited Resource Farmers
and Ranchers, Beginning Farmers and
Ranchers, or Socially Disadvantaged Farm-
ers and Ranchers, and a maximum payment
limitation. (Section 2406)
The Senate amendment amends section 403
of the ACA and adds two new sections (au-
thorities). It provides a payment limit and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9971
December 10, 2018
establishes a set-aside of program funds for
repair and restoration of fencing. Section
12614 of the Senate amendment is identical
to section 2406 of the House bill, with the ex-
ception of the 25 percent maximum pre-pay-
ment limit and return of funds requirement.
(Section 2414 & 12614)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment. Losses
due to wildfire are made eligible. Fencing re-
pair and replacement cost-share are author-
ized for up to 75 percent of the total cost,
with an advance disbursement option avail-
able to the producer. A payment limit of
$500,000 is established. (Section 2403)
(34) Watershed protection and flood prevention
The House bill maintains the current au-
thorization of appropriations structure for
flood prevention and includes new $100 mil-
lion in mandatory spending for the overall
program during each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023. (Section 2404)
The Senate amendment authorizes $200
million in appropriations for each of fiscal
years 2019 through 2023. (Section 2415)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House bill with amendment. The substitute
includes a waiver for the watershed plan
under certain instances and provides $50 mil-
lion in mandatory funding for each fiscal
year thereafter. (Section 2401)
(35) Small watershed rehabilitation program
The Senate amendment authorizes the Wa-
tershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act
authorization of appropriations at $20 mil-
lion annually through FY 2023. (Section 2416)
The House bill maintains the current au-
thorization level of $85 million through FY
2023. This program is also covered by the new
mandatory money above.
The Conference adopts the House provi-
sion. (Section 2401)
(36) Repeal of conservation corridor demonstra-
tion program
The Senate amendment repeals the con-
servation corridor demonstration program.
(Section 2417)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.

gram
The Senate amendment repeals the cran-
berry acreage reserve program. (Section 2418)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 2812)

vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.
(44) Wildlife management
The Senate amendment codifies the work-
ing lands for wildlife conservation partner-
ship between the Department of Agriculture
and the Department of Interior and expands
the authority to the conservation reserve
program in the Farm Service Agency. It also
authorizes the Secretary to assist a request-
ing federal, state or local agency regarding
regulatory certainty through conservation
practices, under certain conditions. (Section
2425)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a technical change.
(Section 2407)
The Managers recognize the success of the
Working Lands for Wildlife model of con-
servation established between USDA’s Nat-
ural Resource Conservation Service and the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services as a model of
effective species conservation on private
lands that can provide regulatory certainty
for farmers, ranchers, and landowners. The
Managers support the regulatory predict-
ability that the model of conservation pro-
vides to producers who voluntarily imple-
ment agreed upon conservation practices
that promote species recovery. In the event
that a species is listed as threatened or en-
dangered under the Endangered Species Act
in the future, producers in the Working
Lands for Wildlife model of conservation who
voluntarily implement agreed upon con-
servation practices are able to continue to
operate their farms and businesses without
potential disruptions related to the listing.
Protections under this initiative include up
to 30 years of certainty related to protec-
tions from incidental take under the Endan-
gered Species Act as long as the producer or
landowner voluntarily maintains the agreed
upon conservation practice. The Managers
expand the Working Lands for Wildlife model
of conservation to apply to the Farm Service
Agency for programs like the Conservation
Reserve Program and expect the same regu-
latory certainty to apply.
(45) Healthy forests reserve program
The House bill includes this provision
within the forestry title. (Section 8107)
The Senate amendment makes amend-
ments to the Healthy Forests Reserve Pro-
gram and adds as a purpose of the program
to conserve habitats for candidate, threat-
ened, endangered species or species of great-
est conservation under State wildlife action
plans. The provision eliminates the limita-
tion on the use of cost-share agreements and
easements. It also directs that restoration
plans under the program include land man-
agement practices, vegetative treatments,
structural practices and measure, practices
that improve biological diversity, carbon se-
questration, and other appropriate activi-
ties. It strikes (e)(2). It authorizes certain
practices. (Section 2426)
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment and addresses it within Title
VIII.
(46) Watershed protection
The Senate amendment amends the defini-
tion of ‘‘works of improvement’’ in the Wa-
tershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act
and authorizes a waiver for the watershed
plan under certain circumstances. (Section
2427)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with modifications that do
not include a change to the definition and
modify the requirements for a waiver. (Sec-
tion 2401)
The Managers authorize a waiver for wa-
tershed plans where the Secretary deter-
mines that it is unnecessary or duplicative.
The Managers intend that the Secretary ex-
ercise this waiver authority in instances
where the proposed work of improvement
would not require the same type of plan or
analysis provided for in a PL–566 plan if the
activity were conducted under other USDA
conservation program authority, for work
which is categorically excluded from more
significant USDA or other Federal agency
review, or where adequate planning has al-
ready been conducted. The watershed plan
waiver authority does not authorize the Sec-
retary to waive the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) or other federal environ-
mental laws applicable to a proposed PL–566
work of improvement. The Managers in-
cluded this waiver to improve the deliver-
ability of the program and ensure financial
resources are devoted to implementing wa-
tershed protection measures that benefit
producers, rural communities, and the envi-
ronment.
(47) Modifications to conservation easement pro-
gram
The Senate amendment provides authority
for the Secretary to modify or exchange land
in a covered program and modify an agree-
ment, contract or an easement in a covered
program if such modifications meet certain
requirements and costs are covered by the
party requesting the modification or ex-
change. (Section 2429)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.
(48) Feral swine eradication and control pilot
program
The House bill provides the Secretary the
authority to establish a pilot project for
eradication and control of feral swine. It
enumerates the duties of the Secretary in
carrying out the pilot including assessment,
control methods, restoration, and the provi-
sion for financial assistance to producers. It
also enumerates the actions for which finan-
cial assistance will be provided. The bill re-
quires coordination between the Natural Re-
sources Conservation Service and the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service with
State Technical Committees to determine
the pilot areas for the project. It provides
that areas considered for the pilot will dem-
onstrate feral swine impacts as a threat to
agriculture, native ecosystems, or human or
animal health. It establishes the cost-share
level of 75 percent and provides for in-kind
contributions of materials and services. The
bill allocates $100 million in mandatory
funds for the period of 2019 through 2023 and
distributes the funding at 50 percent to each
agency and the scope of their work. It fur-
ther limits the use of these funds to no more
than 10 percent for administrative expenses

House provision with an amendment pro-
viding $75 million in mandatory funding.
(Section 2408)
(49) Soil and water resources conservation
The House bill reauthorizes the Soil and
Water Resource Conservation Act through
FY 2023 and expands USDA’s ability to assess
natural resource concerns through enhanced
measurement, evaluation, and reporting on
conservation program outcomes. (Section
2408)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment reau-
thorizing the authority. (Section 2402)
(50) Funding; Report on program enrollments
and assistance
The House bill amends the ’85 Act to ex-
tend CRP funding under both paragraphs (A)
and (B) through FY 2023. It authorizes ACEP
funding at $500 million for each fiscal year
2019 through 2023. It conforms this section
with CSP repeals. The bill retains the cur-
rent authorization of EQIP funding for 2018,
and authorizes funding at $2 billion for 2019,
$2.5 billion for 2020, $2.75 billion for 2021,
$2.935 billion for 2022 and $3 billion for 2023. It
strikes 2 reports due in 2014. It also strikes
the regional equity authority. The bill ex-
tends the authority through FY 2023 and con-
forms paragraph (1) regarding the CSP re-
peal. It strikes paragraph (h)(3) regarding an
authority to repool acres. It requires a re-
port each FY 2018 through 2023 by Dec. 15 re-
garding different activities. (Section 2501)
The Senate amendment amends the fund-
ing for section 1234(c)(1)(A) of the ’85 Act to
$11 million for the period of FY 2019 through
2023 and (B) to $50 million for the period of
FY 2019 through 2023 to carry out section
1235(f), capping outreach and assistance
spending at $5 million and conforming retir-
ing owners and operators with previous
changes to ‘‘contract holders’’. It authorizes
ACEP funding at $400 million for each fiscal
year 2019 through 2021, $425 million for FY
2022 and $450 million for FY 2023. It author-
izes EQIP funding at $1.473 billion for 2019,
$1.478 billion for 2020, $1.541 billion for 2021,
$1.571 billion for 2022, and $1.595 billion for
2023. The amendment strikes a 2012 review. It
extends the authority through FY 2023. It
targets 15 percent of funding to assist begin-
ning farmers and ranchers and the same for
socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers.
The amendment provides new conservation
standards and requirements. It strikes cer-
tain activities. (Sections 2501 & 2602)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision, including funding for var-
ious programs, reports, an extension of a
funding authority for certain farmers and
ranchers, and provides for interagency co-
ordination on conservation standards and re-
quirements. (Section 2501)
While the Conference substitute does not
increase the set-aside for beginning farmers
or socially disadvantaged producers, the
Managers recognize the importance of updat-
ing funding allocations in the conservation
programs to better reflect the changing de-
mographics among farmers and ranchers and
encourage USDA to continue to improve en-
rollment in conservation programs by these
producers.
(51) Delivery of technical assistance
The House bill amends the definition of
‘‘eligible participant’’ to remove eligibility
under section 524 of the Federal Crop Insur-
ance Act. It also defines ‘‘third-party pro-
vider’’. It authorizes a new alternative cer-
tification process. (Section 2502)
The Senate amendment defines ‘‘third-
party provider’’. It authorizes a new certifi-
cation process for third-party providers as
well as a streamlined process. It strikes the
current authorization and inserts new au-
thority for the expedited revision of con-
servation practice standards. It also requires
a report. (Section 2502)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to the
certification process and review of conserva-
tion practice standards, and includes the ex-
pedited revision of standards provision in the
Senate amendment. (Section 2502)
The Managers believe technical service
providers are an important part of the con-
servation delivery system. The Managers in-
tend for USDA to use the vast technical
knowledge available in the private sector as
a way of complementing NRCS reach and ex-
pertise. The Conference substitute clarified
the definition of a TSP to specifically in-
clude commercial entities. The Conference
substitute provides authority for non-Fed-
eral entities to certify technical service pro-
viders. The Managers intend for USDA to im-
plement this and make this available nation-
wide.
The Managers encourage NRCS to continue
to work with the U.S. Forest Service and
state forestry agencies to streamline and
align forest management plan requirements
in private forestry assistance programs ad-
ministered by each of these agencies. The
Managers also encourage NRCS to allow use
of landscape-wide or area-wide forest man-
agement plans to meet the requirements of
forest management plans in NRCS programs.
(52) Administrative requirements for conserva-
tion programs
The House bill strikes subsection (m) of
the ’85 Act because expanded language re-
lated to that exemption is not in Title I of
this bill and adds a new authority for tar-
geting conservation practices for source
water protection which includes a reserva-
tion of funds at not less than 10 percent of
conservation funds (not including CRP) for
each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. (Sec-
tion 2503)
The Senate amendment adds Acequias to
the authority for certain incentives in sec-
tion 1244 of the ’85 Act. It increases the cap
from 10 percent to 15 percent for cropland in
a county that can be subject to a wetland re-
serve easement. It updates the calculation
authority regarding acreage to reflect 2018
farm bill enactment. The Senate amendment
adds new authority to the pollinator author-
ity in subsection (h) of the ’85 Act. It applies
commodity program eligibility to the defini-
tion of an exempted producer and conforms
paragraph (2) of subsection (m) of the ’85 Act.
It directs the Secretary to enter into alter-
native funding arrangements with tribes
under certain circumstances. The amend-
ment adds an authority for source water pro-
tection. It authorizes a waiver and contract
limitation to payments made to acequias.
(Sections 2503 & 12613)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with modifications, includ-
ing deleting subsections (a) and (f) of the ’85
Act, providing an authority for the review
and guidance for practice costs and payment
rates, amending the authority for alter-
native funding arrangements for Indian
tribes. The substitute also adopts the House
provision on source water protection and a
modification to its reservation of funds, does
not include the pollinator authority within
this title, does not include the regulatory re-
lief provision within this title (moved to
title I), establishes authority for environ-
mental services market, and addresses regu-
latory certainty. (Section 2503)
The Managers encourage the Secretary to
expand upon existing work at USDA to en-
courage the protection of pollinators and the
enhancement of pollinator habitat through
adoption of conservation practices. This
work may be accomplished through the de-
velopment of area-wide conservation plans
and strategies to increase the use of inte-
grated pest management, as well as pro-
viding technical assistance to producers re-
lating to background science, promotion,
and implementation of conservation habitat
enhancement for beneficial insects. Exam-
ples of assistance that USDA could provide
to producers include, but are not limited to,
sharing best management practices that in-
tegrate natural predators and parasites of
crop pests into agricultural systems and pro-
moting additional practices that enhance
natural habitat for these insects, providing
an alternative to pesticide application on
farms.
The Managers intend for the Department
to emphasize the importance of protecting
sources of drinking water throughout the
title because of the direct public health ben-
efit such activities would provide. Protec-
tion of sources of drinking water not only
means emphasizing practices that have a sig-
nificant water quality or water quantity
benefit, but also focusing those practices in
watersheds where source waters can be pro-
tected or improved. Water quality and quan-
tity practices do not address source water
protection if those waters are not used as
water system sources or if they do not ad-
dress water system concerns.
The Managers understand that some pro-
grams do not have purposes that directly
align with source water, but the Managers
intend at least ten percent of the total
amount of conservation title funding go to-
wards source water protection, not nec-
essarily from each individual program. For
example, this could mean EQIP could in
practice provide more than its 10 percent
minimum share to satisfy the overall re-
quirement if the Agricultural Conservation
Easement Program could not. The Managers
do not intend for this to be a ‘‘check the
box’’ activity of retrospectively accounting
for funds that addressed protection of source
water, but instead represents a clear priority
for the Department to identify watersheds
where potable water is at risk and to target
those areas for conservation implementa-
tion.
The Managers provide authority to
incentivize practices that have a beneficial
environmental impact on protecting drink-
ing water. This tool is intended to address
practices that might have limited adoption
because of the cost to the producer or be-
cause the benefits are largely off-farm. Ex-
amples include edge of field practices such as
saturated buffers, woodchip denitrifying bio-
reactors, or drainage water management.
The Managers believe that USDA actively
seeking partnerships to identify targeted
areas helps amplify the importance of vol-
untary, incentive-based conservation. One of
those critical partnerships is with water
utilities and the Managers expect the De-
partment to work with drinking water utili-
ties to identify key areas in each state to
focus on protecting source water. The Man-
agers intend for this to be used in priority
areas in each state; not just certain areas of
the country.
The Managers believe environmental mar-
kets have the potential to play a significant
role in addressing natural resource concerns.
Producers enrolled in conservation programs
under this title should not be precluded from
participating in those markets as long as the
landowner is providing additive conservation
above and beyond the protections provided

under the program. This could be an impor-
tant market for landowners, and not allow-
ing them to participate in these markets
could serve as a disincentive for permanent
farmland protection such as those provided
under ACEP. For instance, landowners could
undertake management changes that could
increase the amount of carbon sequestered
above and beyond that amount of carbon
that is sequestered simply by preventing
conversion of grassland or timberland.
(53) Definition of acequia
The Senate amendment defines an acequia
in the ’85 Act. (Section 2504)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.
(54) Authorization of appropriations for water
bank program
The Senate amendment authorizes appro-
priations at $5 million for each of fiscal
years 2019 through 2023, to remain available
until expended. It strikes a provision that
applied through FY 1980. (Section 2505)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.
(55) Report on land access, tenure, and transi-
tion
The Senate amendment authorizes a report
on land access, tenure, and transition. (Sec-
tion 2506)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute addressed the
Senate amendment in title XII.
(56) Report on small wetlands
The Senate amendment authorizes a report
on small wetlands. (Section 2507)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with modifications to the re-
port. (Section 2409)
The Managers request that USDA, acting
through the Chief of NRCS, conduct a report
on small wetlands to be completed within 6
months following enactment. The Managers
require that the report include the number
of small wetlands that have been delineated
in each of the states during fiscal years 2014
through 2018. The Managers request that
USDA provide additional reports that look
at years prior to 2014 and that those reports
be made available by the end of each fiscal
year after the enactment of this Act. The
Managers intend for this report to provide
information on small wetlands and ensure
that NRCS is using the same methodology
across each of the states identified in deter-
mining wetlands that are small in nature.
(57) State technical committees
The House bill adds the State 1862 Institu-
tion to the State technical committee. (Sec-
tion 2504)
The Senate amendment directs State tech-
nical committees to review technologies and
practices and make recommendations to the
Secretary. It amends section 1261(b)(2) of the
’85 Act to strike ‘‘under section 1262(b)’’.
(Sections 2508 & 2604)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to in-
clude section 2604 of the Senate amendment
and the addition of the State cooperative ex-
tension and the land grant university in the
State. (Section 2822)
The Managers recognize the importance of
State Technical Committees and how they
provide important State input on natural re-
source concerns and the delivery of USDA
conservation programs. The Managers be-
lieve that focusing National programs to
meet the needs of agricultural producers in
each state should be done with input from
representatives within the State and include
the diversity of production. State technical
Committees should balance representation
between grower representatives, conserva-
tion organizations, Tribal, State, local gov-
ernment agencies, and other interested orga-
nizations within the State.
(58) Farmable wetland reform
The Senate amendment is a technical cor-
rection. (Section 2601)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.
(59) Drought and water conservation agreements
The Senate amendment amends 1231A of
the ’85 Act and authorizes the Secretary to
enter into agreements that address regional
drought concerns. (Section 12612)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.
(60 & 61) Repeal of terminal lakes assistance
The House bill repeals the authority for
terminal lakes assistance. (Section 2802)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute strikes the au-
thorization of appropriations and makes a
technical change. (Section 2821)
TITLE III—TRADE
(1) Generation and use of currencies by private
voluntary organizations and cooperatives
The House bill allows the generation of
proceeds from the sale of commodities by
private voluntary organizations to be used as
enumerated in this section. (Section 3004)
The Senate amendment allows the Admin-
istrator of USAID to permit private vol-
untary organizations to sell commodities

The House bill reauthorizes the authority
for the group through FY 2023. (Section 3006)
The Senate amendment reduces the con-
sultation period for proposed regulations,
handbooks, or guidelines concerning this
title to 30 days. It reauthorizes the Food Aid
Consultative Group through FY 2023. (Sec-
tion 3104)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 3105)
The Managers expect that reducing the
Food Aid Consultative Group (FACG) review
period from 45 days to 30 days will stream-
line and expedite the approval of agreements
and that efforts will be taken to ensure such
change does not reduce the opportunity for
FACG members to provide feedback on pro-
posed regulations, handbooks, or guidelines.
Furthermore, the Managers believe food
aid transportation efficiency and trans-
parency can be improved and expect the
FACG to review and recommend any specific
changes needed in regulations and proce-
dures governing food aid transportation to
enhance program delivery, maximize pro-
gram efficiency, and improve transparency,
including specifically reviewing the ship-
ment schedules, and terms and conditions of
governing contracts and freight solicita-
tions.
(3) Oversight, monitoring, and evaluation
The House bill amends section 207(f) of the
Food for Peace Act to allow up to 1.5 percent
of the funds made available under this sec-
tion to pay for program oversight, moni-
toring, and evaluation. It extends funding
authority for the early warning assessments
and systems to FY 2023 and eliminates re-
quirement that matching funds come from
Chapter 1, Part 1 of the Foreign Assistance
Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.). (Section
3008)
The Senate Amendment amends section
207(f) of the Food for Peace Act to allow the
Administrator to use up to 1.5 percent, but
not less than $17,000,000, of appropriated
funds made available under this section for
program oversight, monitoring, and evalua-
tion. It extends funding authority for the
early warning assessments and systems to
FY 2023. (Section 3105)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to elimi-
nate the requirement that matching funds
come from Chapter 1, Part 1 of the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.).
(Section 3107)
The Managers affirm the importance of the
Famine Early Warning Systems Network
(FEWS NET) to effectively and efficiently
respond to crises around the world. However,
the U.S. Agency for International Develop-
ment (USAID) should better utilize FEWS
NET to provide advance information and in-
form interventions to mitigate the effects of
drought in areas where livestock production
is a critical source of food and income.
(4) Assistance for stockpiling and rapid trans-
portation, delivery, and distribution of
shelf-stable prepackaged foods
The House bill extends authority for the
appropriation of funding for the program
through FY 2023. It changes the name of the
section to ‘‘International Food Relief Part-
nership’’. (Section 3009)
The Senate amendment amends section
208(f) of the Food for Peace Act to reauthor-
ize funding for distribution of shelf-stable
prepackaged foods. (Section 3106)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 3108)
(5) Allowance of distribution costs
The Senate amendment amends section
406(b)(6) of the Food for Peace Act to clarify
allowable distribution costs, including a va-
riety of activities for which costs were paid
prior to FY 2017. (Section 3107)
The House bill has no comparable provi-
sion.
The Conference substitute incorporates the
Senate provision with an amendment clari-
fying that the costs include distribution and
program implementation costs to use the
commodities provided under the Food for
Peace Act. (Section 3110)
The Managers intend for the allowable uses
of internal transportation, storage and han-
dling (ITSH) funds authorized under section
406(b)(6) of the Food for Peace Act to include
the types of activities for which costs were
paid under such paragraph prior to fiscal
year 2017. Such activities must be associated
with the use of agricultural commodities.
The Managers do not intend for the changes
made by this provision to result in increased
levels of annual ITSH spending as compared
to the average annual ITSH spending levels
in recent years by dollar value or as a per-
centage of overall Food for Peace funding.
(6) Annual report regarding food aid programs
and activities
The House bill amends section 407(f) of the
Food for Peace Act to allow the Adminis-
trator and Secretary of Agriculture to file
annual reports relating to their respective
food aid programs and activities, jointly or
separately. It requires the Administrator
and Secretary to notify Congress if their re-
ports will be delayed and provide reasons for
the delay. The bill requires a detailed ac-
count of the funds expended for the purposes

of 202(e), 406(b)(6) and 407(c)(1)(B). Addition-
ally, it restructures reporting requirements
by moving requirements under section 403(m)
of the Food for Peace Act, so they shall be
included within the report required under
section 407(f). It includes conforming repeal
of section 403(m). (Section 3012)
The Senate amendment amends 407(f)(1)(A)
of the Food for Peace Act to allow USAID
Administrator and Secretary of Agriculture
to file annual reports relating to their re-
spective food aid programs and activities,
jointly or separately. (Section 3109)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to re-
move the provision requiring Congressional
notification relating to reasons for delay in
production of the report. (Section 3112)
The Managers acknowledge information
provided in the annual report regarding food
assistance programs and activities is essen-
tial for Congressional and public oversight of
these programs. The Managers expect the
relevant agencies to cooperate to ensure that
annual reporting of food assistance is pro-
vided either jointly or separately in a con-
cise, transparent, and timely manner. Agen-
cies should promptly publish data on food
aid programs and activities as available, re-
gardless of when full reporting requirements
will be met.
(7) Nonemergency Food Assistance
The House bill amends section 412(e) of the
Food for Peace Act to provide not less than
$365 million of the amounts made available
to carry out Title II, nor more than 30% of
such amounts to be expended for non-
emergency food assistance programs for FY
2019 through FY 2023. It also amends section
412(e) to allow community development
funds appropriated to carry out part I of the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 that are made
available through grants or cooperative
agreements and that assist in implementing
certain activities—income-generating com-
munity development, health, nutrition, co-
operative development, agriculture, and
other development—to be deemed to have
been expended on nonemergency food assist-
ance programs for the purposes of this sec-
tion. (Section 3014)
The Senate amendment amends section
412(e) of the Food for Peace Act to provide
not less than $365 million of the amounts
made available to carry out this title for
nonemergency food assistance programs for
fiscal years through FY 2023. It amends sec-
tion 412(e) of the Food for Peace Act to allow
funds expended under the Farmer-to-Farmer
Program (section 501 of the Food for Peace
Act) to be considered amounts expended for
the nonemergency food assistance programs
under section 412. The amendment also
amends section 412(e) of the Food for Peace
Act to allow funds expended through Part I
of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 through
grants or cooperative agreements and con-
sistent with the goals of Title II, to be con-
sidered amounts expended for nonemergency
food assistance programs under certain cir-
cumstances. (Section 3111)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with a modification to
amend section 412(e) to allow funds expended
under the Farmer-to-Farmer Program (sec-
tion 501 of the Food for Peace Act) to be con-
sidered amounts expended for the non-
emergency food assistance programs under
section 412. (Section 3114)
The Managers emphasize the importance of
nonemergency development assistance to
strengthen resiliency and transition coun-
tries from food aid recipients to trading
partners. The Managers authorize the Ad-
ministrator to count Community Develop-
ment Funds (CDF) toward the minimum
level of nonemergency food assistance. The
Managers support the use of CDF to com-
plement Title II resources and expect that
the Administrator will continue to use these
funds to provide direct funding to Food for
Peace Title II nonemergency programs
through the Office of Food for Peace or its
successor. The Managers further expect that
any reduction in the use of commodities in
non-emergency programs that result from
the use of the CDF will be offset by addi-
tional commodities used in emergency food
aid operations.
(8) John Ognowski and Doug Bereuter Farmer-
to-Farmer program
The House bill amends section 501 of the
Food for Peace Act to clarify that assistance
provided under the program should be ‘‘tech-
nical’’ in nature. The bill amends section 501
of the Food for Peace Act to add retired ex-
tension staff of USDA as able to work in con-
junction with agricultural producers and
farm organizations on a voluntary basis. It
also amends section 501 to expand the scope
of issues the program can focus on to include
selection of seed varieties and plant stocks,
knowledge of insecticide and sanitation pro-
cedures to prevent crop destruction, use and
maintenance of agricultural equipment and
irrigation systems, and selection of fer-
tilizers and methods of soils treatment. The
bill further amends section 501 to encourage
the fostering of investments in institutional
capacity-building to allow for longer-term
sequenced assignments to provide deeper en-
gagement and greater continuity of projects.
It extends authority for appropriations at
existing levels for each of FY 2019 through
FY 2023. It allows for funds used under this
section to be counted toward the minimum
level of non-emergency food assistance under
412(e). The bill adds the establishment of
geographically defined crop yield metrics
system, a public database to assess improve-
ments in crop yields, and creates a new grant
program to facilitate new and innovative
partnerships and activities. It extends au-
thority for appropriations at existing levels
for each fiscal year FY 2019 through FY 2023.
(Section 3016)
The Senate amendment amends section 501
of the Food for Peace Act to allow employees
or staff of a State cooperative institution as
defined by subparagraphs (A) through (D) of
section 1404(18) of the National Agricultural
Research Extension, and Teaching Policy
Act of 1977 to volunteer for the purposes enu-
merated under section 501. It extends author-
ity for minimum levels of assistance at ex-
isting levels for each fiscal year FY 2019
through FY 2023. The amendment extends
authority for appropriations at existing lev-
els for each fiscal year FY 2019 through FY
2023. (Section 3113)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that clari-
fies that the nature of assistance should be
‘‘technical,’’ expands the scope of issues the
program can focus on to include selection of
seed varieties and plant stocks, knowledge of
insecticide and sanitation procedures to pre-
vent crop destruction, use and maintenance
of agricultural equipment and irrigation sys-
tems, and selection of fertilizers and meth-
ods of soils treatment, and creates a new
grant program to facilitate new and innova-
tive partnerships and activities. (Section
3116)
The Managers support the United States’
work to advance food security in developing
countries and open new markets for agricul-
tural trade through programs that leverage
the unique capabilities of Federal depart-
ments and agencies and that improve coordi-
nation between donors, beneficiaries, and the
private sector. The Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) plays an important role in
establishing trade between the United States
and other nations and should enhance its
role in facilitating the transfer of the knowl-
edge, skills, and experience of American
farmers, land grant universities, and exten-
sion services through the John Ogonowski
and Doug Bereuter Farmer-To-Farmer Pro-
gram.
The Managers intend for the Farmer-to-
Farmer Program to foster appropriate in-
vestments in institutional capacity-building
and allow longer-term and sequenced assign-
ments and partnerships to provide deeper en-
gagement and greater continuity on such
projects.
(9) Priority trade promotion, development, and
assistance
Section 3102(a) of the House bill amends
section 205 of the Agricultural Trade Act of
1978 to create the International Market De-
velopment Program, a consolidation of the
current Market Access Program (MAP), the
Foreign Market Development (FMD), Tech-
nical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC),
and the E Kika de la Garza programs. Sec-
tion 3102(b) of the House bill amends section
211(c) to provide $255 million in annual man-
datory funding for the International Market
Development Program, subject to the alloca-
tion of $253.5 million as follows: MAP not
less than $200 million annually; FMD not less
than $34.5 million annually; E. (Kika) de la
Garza Emerging Markets Program (EMP),
not more than $10 million annually; TASC
not more than $9 million annually; and the
remaining unallocated balance of $1.5 mil-
lion per year will be available for the Sec-
retary to make available for the MAP and/or
FMD programs. Section 3102(c) of the bill re-
peals the current law authorizations for the
MAP, FMD, TASC, and de la Garza pro-
grams. It also repeals section 1302 of the Om-
nibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 to
eliminate the suggested five-year limitation
on promotion of a specific branded product
in a single market, and other administrative
guidelines. Section 3102(d) of the bill makes
conforming amendments. (Section 3102)
The Senate amendment amends Title II of
the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to add a
new Subtitle C—Priority Trade Promotion,
Development, and Assistance. It consolidates
the MAP, FMD, de la Garza, and TASC pro-
grams under subtitle C. The Senate amend-
ment provides a total of $259.5 million in an-
nual mandatory funding for the Priority
Trade Promotion, Development, and Assist-
ance program, subject to the allocation of
$253.5 million as follows: MAP not less than
$200 million annually; FMD not less than
$34.5 million annually; E (Kika) de la Garza
Agricultural Fellowship Program not more
than $10 million annually; TASC not less
than $9 million annually; and the remaining
balance of $6 million annually will be avail-
able for use among the four programs, as de-
termined by the Secretary under a new Pri-
ority Trade Fund. The Senate amendment
repeals current law authorizations for the
MAP, FMD, TASC and de la Garza programs,
and makes several changes, including: clari-
fies definition of ‘‘emerging market’’ to in-
clude a ‘‘territory, customs union, or other
economic market’’ in addition to the current
law ‘‘country’’ for the de la Garza Fellowship
Program; adds section 255(d) to the Agricul-
tural Trade Act of 1978 to authorize the Sec-
retary to provide assistance under TASC to a
project for longer than a five-year period if
the Secretary determines it would effec-
tively support the purpose of the program;
and section 226(d) authorizes the use of funds
to carry out MAP and FMD in Cuba, con-
sistent with directives under the National
Security Presidential Memorandum of June
16, 2017 entitled ‘‘Strengthening the Policy of
the United States Toward Cuba’’, during the
period in which that memorandum is in ef-
fect. (Section 3201)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9975
December 10, 2018
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that con-
solidates the current MAP, FMD, TASC, and
EMP programs under one Agricultural Trade
Promotion and Facilitation section in the
Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. The amend-
ment provides a total of $255 million in an-
nual mandatory funding subject to alloca-
tion as follows: MAP not less than $200 mil-
lion annually; FMD not less than $34.5 mil-
lion annually; EMP not more than $8 million
annually; TASC at $9 million annually; and
the Priority Trade Fund at $3.5 million an-
nually to be distributed at the Secretary’s
discretion. Further, the substitute repeals
section 1302 of the Omnibus Budget Rec-
onciliation Act of 1993 to eliminate the sug-
gested five-year limitation on promotion for
specific branded product in a single market.
(Section 3201)
The Managers intend for the consolidation
of the Market Access Program, the Foreign
Market Development Cooperator Program,
the Kika de la Garza Emerging Markets Pro-
gram, and the Technical Assistance for Spe-
cialty Crops Program under one Agricultural
Trade Promotion and Facilitation Program
to establish permanent mandatory funding
for agricultural trade promotion activities.
The Managers intend to maintain the unique
functions of each program.
The Managers recognize that specialty
crops are uniquely challenged by sanitary
and phytosanitary barriers and other non-
tariff barriers to trade, including a lack of
international harmonization for maximum
residue levels (MRLs). While the Managers
affirm the importance of TASC in addressing
these barriers, they recognize that the TASC
program has been underutilized in recent
years. The Managers intend for the Sec-
retary to consider and, as necessary, make
reforms to streamline the application, ap-
proval, and compliance processes and re-
quirements for eligible organizations, par-
ticularly for smaller grants and shorter-term
or time-sensitive projects. The Managers di-
rect USDA to have substantial, ongoing en-
gagement with specialty crop stakeholders
and the Committees in carrying out the re-
quirements of this section to improve the
program, including as USDA reviews pro-
gram procedures and requirements and
makes improvements to streamline and fa-
cilitate assistance.
The Managers recognize that expanding
trade with Cuba not only represents an op-
portunity for American farmers and ranch-
ers, but also a chance to improve engage-
ment with the Cuban people in support of
democratic ideas and human rights. They
note that the June 2017 National Security
Presidential Memorandum toward Cuba af-
firmatively supports the sale of United
States agricultural commodities and does
not impair or otherwise affect the authority
otherwise granted by law to an executive de-
partment or agency. The Managers expect
that the Secretary will work closely with el-
igible trade organizations to educate them
about allowable activities to improve ex-
ports to Cuba under the Market Access and
Foreign Market Development Cooperator
Programs.
(10) Food for Progress Act of 1985
The House bill reauthorizes the section
through FY 2023, and adds colleges and uni-
versities as defined by Section 1404(4) of the
Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C.
3103(4)) as eligible entities to furnish com-
modities or provide financial assistance
under this section. (Section 3204)
The Senate amendment reauthorizes the
section through FY 2023 and clarifies that
the Secretary retains the authority to ad-
minister the programs applicable to this sec-
tion. It adds land grant colleges and univer-
sities as defined by Section 1404 of the Na-
tional Agricultural Research, Extension, and
Teaching Policy Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 3103) as
eligible entities to furnish commodities or
provide financial assistance under this sec-
tion and clarifies that when providing hu-
manitarian or developmental aid, ‘‘internal’’
transportation costs may be considered a
covered expense. The section adds paragraph
(5) at the end of subsection (l) to require a
certain amount of assistance be provided in
direct funds, in the amount of 30 percent of
the funds of the ‘‘transportation cap’’, 30 per-
cent of existing administrative funds, and $26
million in funds of the Commodity Credit
Corporation for each of FY 2019 through FY
2023, specified to be used to pay for any of
the costs in paragraph (4). Additionally, the
Senate amendment strikes existing ‘‘Re-
quirements’’ and instructs the Secretary to
issue regulations and revisions to agency
guidance and procedures necessary to imple-
ment the amendments made to this section
within 270 days of enactment of this Act. The
section instructs the Secretary to consult
with the Committee on Agriculture and the
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House
of Representatives and the Committee on
Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the
Senate relating to agency regulations, guid-
ance and procedures that are to be revised
within 270 days of enactment of this Act.
(Section 3301)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment requir-
ing the Secretary to include information on
the ‘‘rate of return’’ for a commodity in the
annual report, and includes a section author-
izing pilot agreements for FY 2019 through
FY 2023 to directly provide financial assist-
ance to eligible entities to cover the costs of
activities consistent with the humanitarian
and development purposes listed in (l)(4)(A).
(Section 3302)
The Managers affirm the importance of
Food for Progress in improving agricultural
productivity and strengthening food security
in developing countries by providing training
and technical assistance to producers, devel-
oping extension services, increasing access
to quality inputs, improving access to cap-
ital, and numerous other activities.
The Managers encourage the Secretary to
use the pilot agreement authority to test
and evaluate the effectiveness of directly
providing funds to eligible entities to imple-
ment the same types of development activi-
ties that are typically funded by proceeds
from monetization under this program.
(11) Cochran emerging market fellowship pro-
gram
The House bill amends section 1543 of the
Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade
Act of 1990 to clarify that the purpose of the
fellowship includes enhancing trade linkages
involving regulatory systems governing sani-
tary and phytosanitary standards for agri-
cultural products, and permits study in for-
eign colleges or universities that have met
certain criteria including having sufficient
scientific and technical facilities, having an
established partnership with at least one col-
lege or university in the United States, and
having substantial participation by U.S. fac-
ulty in the design of the fellowship cur-
riculum and classroom instruction under the
fellowship. (Section 3206)
The Senate amendment amends section
1543 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation,
and Trade Act of 1990 to add to the purposes
of the program the development of agricul-
tural extension services and regulatory sys-
tems governing sanitary and phytosanitary
standards for agricultural products. It in-
creases the authorization of appropriations
for the 3 country categories, respectively, to
(1) $4 million, (2) $3 million, and (3) $6 mil-
lion. (Section 3304)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that per-
mits study in foreign colleges or universities
that have sufficient scientific and technical
facilities, have established a partnership
with at least one college or university in the
United States, and have substantial partici-
pation by U.S. faculty in the design of the
fellowship curriculum and classroom in-
struction under the fellowship. (Section 3305)
The Managers intend to provide the Sec-
retary discretion to improve program effi-
ciency by permitting fellowships to occur at
a college or university located outside the
United States, subject to certain eligibility
requirements, where appropriate. The Man-
agers expect the Secretary to work closely
with Congress in implementing this provi-
sion to ensure the original intent of the pro-
gram is preserved.
(12) Borlaug International Agricultural Science
and Technology Fellowship Program—De-
veloping country fellowship recipients
The House bill amends section 1473G to add
a new authorization for fellowship recipients
from eligible developing countries to receive
scientific training or study at a college or
university outside of the United States, sub-
ject to specific criteria. It authorizes appro-
priations of $6 million for the Borlaug fellow-
ship program and requires that not less than
$2.8 million appropriated be used for partici-
pants from eligible foreign countries. (Sec-
tion 3207)
The Senate amendment amends section
1473G to add the development of agricultural
extension services in foreign countries to the
purpose of the program. It requires the Sec-
retary to encourage the ongoing engagement
of prior fellowship recipients to contribute
to new or ongoing agricultural development
projects, with a priority for capacity-build-
ing projects. (Section 3305)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 3306)
(13) Borlaug International Agricultural Science
and Technology Fellowship Program—Pro-
posed United States fellowships
The House bill adds a new subsection (a)(3)
to section 1473G of the National Agricultural
Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy
Act of 1977 to establish a new program under
which the Secretary shall provide U.S. citi-
zens with fellowships, to assist eligible coun-
tries in developing school-based agriculture
and youth extension programs. It requires
that the new U.S. citizen fellowships develop
globally minded U.S.agriculturists with ex-
perience living abroad, focus on meeting the
food and fiber needs of eligible countries, and
strengthen and enhance trade linkages be-
tween eligible countries and the U.S. agricul-
tural industry. The section authorizes the
Secretary to provide fellowships under sub-
section (a)(3) to U.S. citizens who hold at
least a bachelor’s degree in an agricultural
related field of study and have an under-
standing of U.S. school-based agricultural
education and youth extension programs. It
requires the Secretary to consult with the
National FFA Organization, the National 4–
H Council, and other entities to identify can-
didates for fellowships. The section requires
the Secretary to manage, coordinate, evalu-
ate, and monitor the fellowship program, ei-
ther directly or by contract with an outside
organization with experience in imple-
menting fellowship programs focused on
building capacity for school-based agricul-
tural education and youth extension pro-
grams in developing countries. (Section 3207)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.

House provision with an amendment estab-
lishing the International Agricultural Edu-
cation Fellowship Program in the Agri-
culture Improvement Act of 2018 as a new

program separate from the Borlaug Fellow-
ship Program, and authorizing appropria-
tions for the program. (Section 3307)
The Managers recognize the importance of
youth engagement in agricultural develop-
ment and intend for these fellowships to pro-
vide valuable opportunities to young
agriculturalists in eligible countries as well
as international experience for emerging
American agricultural leaders.
(14) International food security technical assist-
ance
The Senate amendment amends the Food,
Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of
1990 by adding at the end of Title XV, a pro-
vision directing the Secretary to compile
and make available information on the im-
provement of international food security. It
authorizes the Secretary to provide tech-
nical assistance to certain entities to imple-
ment programs for the improvement of inter-
national food security. (Section 3306)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 3308)
(15) McGovern-Dole international food for edu-
cation and child nutrition program
The House bill amends the section by re-
quiring, to the extent practicable, the assist-
ance provided under this section coincide
with the start of the school year and is avail-
able when needed throughout the relevant
school year. It authorizes appropriations in
the existing amount through FY 2023. (Sec-
tion 3205)
The Senate amendment directs the Sec-
retary of Agriculture to ensure that assist-
ance provided under this section is provided
in a timely manner and is made available
when needed throughout the applicable
school year. It authorizes appropriations in
the existing amount through FY 2023. The
section allows not more than 10% of avail-
able funds to be used for commodities pro-
duced in and procured from a developing
country that is a recipient country or devel-
oping country within the same region of the
recipient country and that meet nutritional,
quality and labeling standards of the recipi-
ent countries, and allows funding to cover
the associated costs of transporting those
commodities. (Section 3307)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 3309)
The McGovern-Dole program has success-
fully addressed hunger and malnutrition, im-
proved school attendance, and increased lit-
eracy and academic achievement for children
around the world. The Managers expect the
Secretary to use the new authority author-
ized in this provision to incorporate locally
and regionally grown commodities into
multi-year McGovern-Dole programs, par-
ticularly in the final years of a program, to
support the transition to full local ownership
and implementation.
The Managers strongly support the gradua-
tion of McGovern-Dole feeding programs,
while also recognizing less-developed coun-
tries may need additional, longer- term as-
sistance and should still be considered for in-
clusion in the program.
Additionally, the Managers encourage the
Secretary to consider extending the length
of a project if the Secretary determines that
a project needs additional time to sustain
the benefits and such an extension would
support the overall purposes of the program.
(16) Global Crop Diversity Trust
The House bill amends the Food, Conserva-
tion, and Energy Act of 2008 to increase the
authorized aggregate contribution of U.S.
funds to the trust to 33% of the total funds
contributed from all sources. It authorizes
appropriations at existing levels through FY
2023. (Section 3208)
The Senate amendment reauthorizes sec-
tion 3202 of the Food, Conservation, and En-
ergy Act of 2008 maintaining the 25% con-
tribution limit. It authorizes appropriations
at existing levels through FY 2023. (Section
3308)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment increas-
ing the authorized contribution to 33% of
total funds contributed from all sources be-
ginning in fiscal year 2019 and extending ap-
propriations at existing levels through FY
2023, while limiting the annual contribution
of funds to $5,500,000 for each of FY 2019
through FY 2023. (Section 3310)
The Managers affirm the importance of the
Global Crop Diversity Trust for ensuring the
conservation and availability of genetic re-
sources for food security worldwide, while
recognizing the importance of other inter-
national agricultural research and develop-
ment efforts including the Consultative
Group for International Agricultural Re-
search (CGIAR) and Feed the Future Innova-
tion Labs.
The Managers applaud the Trust for having
raised contributions of over $367 million and
concessional loans of more than $60 million
from sources other than the United States.
The Managers expect the Trust to continue
to secure substantial new contributions to
the endowment from other donors.
(17) Local and regional food aid procurement
projects
The House bill reauthorizes appropriations
at existing levels through FY 2023. (Section
3201)
The Senate amendment amends section
3206(e)(1) of the Food, Conservation, and En-
ergy Act of 2008 to include the ‘‘Secretary’’
as the proper entity to receive appropria-
tions and reauthorizes appropriations at ex-
isting levels through FY 2023. (Section 3309)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 3311)
(18) Foreign trade missions
The Senate amendment directs the Sec-
retary of Agriculture to support greater in-
clusion of Tribal agricultural and food prod-
ucts in trade-related activities. (Section
3310)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 3312)
(19) Findings
The House bill states the United States is
the world’s largest donor of international
food assistance, American farmers are in-
strumental in providing commodities, and
due to the efforts of the maritime industry
and private organizations commodities have
been delivered to millions of people around
the globe. The section provides the United
States should continue to use is agricultural
productivity to promote foreign policy and
enhance food security around the world.
(Section 3001)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute does not include
the House provision.
The Managers recognize that the United
States has long been the world’s largest
donor of international food assistance, and
that American farmers have been instru-
mental in the success of United States inter-
national food assistance programs by pro-
viding an affordable, safe, and reliable source
of nutritious agricultural commodities.
Furthermore, the Managers commend the
efforts of the United States maritime indus-
try and private voluntary organizations in
delivering U.S. agricultural commodities to
millions of people in need around the globe.
(20) Labeling requirements
The House bill amends section 202(g) of
Food for Peace to require agricultural com-
modities and other assistance provided under
this title, to the extent practicable, to be
clearly identified as being furnished by the
people of the United States. The section pro-
vides in the case of other assistance, that the
identification take place on other printed
material accompanying the assistance. (Sec-
tion 3002)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 3101)
The Managers intend for the Adminis-
trator of USAID to continue to use discre-
tion in applying this requirement in situa-
tions where labeling assistance furnished by
the United States could result in safety or
security concerns.
(21) Issuance of regulations
The House bill amends section 207(c)(1) of
the Food for Peace Act to strike ‘‘the Agri-
cultural Act of 2014’’ and inserts the ‘‘Agri-
culture Improvement Act of 2018’’ to require
regulations be issued within 270 days of en-
actment. (Section 3007)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 3106)
(22) Consideration of impact of provision of ag-
ricultural commodities and other assistance
on local farmers and economy
The House bill amends section 403 of the
Food for Peace Act by adding ‘‘food procured
outside of the United States, food vouchers,
or cash transfers for food’’ to the list of
types of assistance subject to market impact
analysis prior to being provided to a recipi-
ent country. It amends the section to clarify
that consideration of storage facilities is
only necessary where the provision of an ag-
ricultural commodity is at issue. It amends
the section to include the distribution of
‘‘agricultural commodity or use of the food
procured outside of the United States, food
vouchers, or cash transfers of food’’ as con-
siderations in the calculation of whether a
substantial disincentive to, or interference
with, domestic production or marketing in
that country will take place if that specific
type of assistance is provided. The section
requires that in addition to commodities, the
Secretary or Administrator shall ensure that
‘‘food procured outside of the United States,
food vouchers, and cash transfers for food’’
will not have a disruptive impact on the
farmers or the local economy within the re-
cipient country. (Section 3010)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 3109)
(23) Findings
The House bill states that U.S. export pro-
grams increase demand for U.S. agriculture
products in foreign markets, acknowledges
that, comparatively, global competitors are
outspending the U.S. on export programs,
and that preservation and streamlining of
the U.S. export market programs is con-
sistent with USDA reorganization efforts fo-
cusing on increasing U.S. agricultural trade
across the globe. (Section 3101)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute does not include
the House provision.
United States trade promotion programs
leverage federal dollars to significantly bol-
ster demand in foreign markets for United
States agricultural products, which in-
creases agricultural export volume and over-
all net farm income. At the same time, our
global competitors continue to provide sub-
stantially more public support for export

promotion than is provided to our own agri-
cultural exporters. Thus, the Managers un-
derscore the critical importance of main-
taining support for U.S. agricultural trade
promotion efforts.
Finally, the Managers note the preserva-
tion and streamlining of United States inter-
national market development programs com-
plements the recent reorganization within
USDA by ensuring the newly established
Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agri-
cultural Affairs has the tools necessary to
enhance the competitiveness of the United
States agricultural industry on the global
stage.
(24) Growing American Food Exports Act of 2018
The House bill amends section 1543A of the
Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade
Act of 1990 to assist with the removal of non-
tariff and other trade barriers to U.S. agri-
cultural products produced with bio-
technology and other agricultural tech-
nologies. It removes the restriction of sec-
tion 102 of such Act relating to the definition
of agricultural commodities and states that
‘‘policy advocacy and targeted projects’’
should address issues relating to U.S. Agri-
cultural commodities produced with the use
of biotechnology or new agricultural tech-
nologies, advocacy for science based regula-
tion in foreign markets of biotechnology or
new agricultural production technologies,
and quick-response intervention regarding
non-tariff barriers to United States exports
produced through biotechnology or new agri-
cultural production technologies. (Section
3209)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute modifies the
House provision by expanding the existing
program to cover projects to address quick
response interventions involving U.S. agri-
cultural commodities produced through new
agricultural production technologies and au-
thorizes appropriations of $2,000,000 for each
of FY 2019 through FY 2023. (Section 3301)
Additional Report Language
Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (Sec
3020)
The Managers affirm the importance of the
Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust as a re-
serve to meet unanticipated emergency food
assistance needs and are concerned that the
Trust has not been utilized since 2014 despite
unprecedented food assistance needs in re-
cent years and the continued risk of famine
in multiple countries. The Managers note
that the Trust, which currently holds over
$280 million, can be used to purchase U.S.
commodities to assist in averting an emer-
gency, responding to an emergency, and for
recovery and rehabilitation after an emer-
gency. They urge USAID and USDA to con-
sider the Trust as a significant resource to
meet those objectives.
TITLE IV—NUTRITION
(1) Definition of certification period
The Senate amendment amends section 3
of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (FNA)
to allow a State agency to extend the supple-
mental nutrition assistance program (SNAP)
certification period for elderly and disabled
households who have no earned income at
the time of certification to up to 36 months.
(Section 4101)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate provision.
(2) Food distribution program on Indian res-
ervations
The House bill amends section 4(b) of the
FNA by reauthorizing the Traditional and
Locally-Grown Food Fund in the Food Dis-
tribution Program on Indian Reservations
(FDPIR), adding the concept of regionally
grown food, eliminating the requirement to
conduct a survey of traditional foods, and
authorizing funds made available to carry
out FDPIR to remain available for obliga-
tion for a period of 2 fiscal years. (Section
4005)
The Senate amendment authorizes an 80
percent floor for the Federal share of admin-
istrative costs and authorizes funds made
available to carry out FDPIR to remain
available for obligation by the State agency
or tribe for 2 fiscal years. The Senate amend-
ment also establishes a demonstration
project for one or more tribal organizations
to enter into a self-determination contract
to purchase agricultural commodities for
FDPIR. (Section 4102)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to author-
ize an 80 percent floor for the Federal share
of administrative costs, to specify that funds
made available to carry out FDPIR remain
available for obligation by the State agency
or tribe for 2 fiscal years, and to establish a
demonstration project for one or more tribal
organizations to enter into a self-determina-
tion contract to purchase agricultural com-
modities for FDPIR. (Section 4003)
The Managers intend for tribal organiza-
tions to have an increased role in procuring
and distributing more locally, regionally and
tribal produced foods under FDPIR. The
Managers encourage the Secretary of Agri-
culture to work with the Secretary of the In-
terior and with Indian tribes to establish and
determine the process and criteria under
which tribal organizations may participate
in demonstration projects to purchase agri-
cultural commodities under FDPIR. The
Managers also encourage the Secretary of
Agriculture to consult with the Secretary of
the Interior regarding the familiarity with
self-determination contracts and with the
capacity of tribal organizations to success-
fully administer a demonstration project.
(3) Work requirements for supplemental nutri-
tion assistance program
The House bill amends the FNA by cre-
ating a single work requirement in section
6(d) that requires SNAP household members
age 18 to 59 to work, participate in employ-
ment and training or a work program, or any
combination of work, participation in em-
ployment and training or a work program
with a minimum of 20 hours per week in fis-
cal years 2021 through 2025 and 25 hours per
week in fiscal year 2026 and each fiscal year
thereafter. The House bill strikes the exist-
ing general work requirement in section
6(d)(1) and the existing able-bodied adult
without dependents (ABAWD) work require-
ment in section 6(o). The House bill limits
the criteria that States may use to request a
geographic waiver of the work requirement,
including requiring the approval of the
State’s chief executive officer, makes
changes to the ‘‘15-percent’’ exemption cri-
teria, and decreases the ‘‘15-percent’’ exemp-
tion to 12-percent starting in fiscal year 2026.
The House bill amends section 6(d)(4) of the
FNA to require States to offer minimum
services in employment and training so that
every covered individual may meet the new
work requirements; adds case management
to the definition of an ‘‘employment and
training program’’ (E&T program); and in-
cludes supervised job search programs, ap-
prenticeships, subsidized employment, fam-
ily literacy, and financial literacy as allow-
able components of E&T programs.
Furthermore, the House bill amends sec-
tion 16(h) of the FNA to provide funds for
E&T at $90 million for fiscal year 2019, $250
million for fiscal year 2020, and $1 billion for
each fiscal year thereafter. The allocation of
E&T funding is based on current law for fis-
cal year 2019 and 2020, but for fiscal year 2021,
and each fiscal year thereafter, the alloca-
tion of E&T funds is based on the new work
requirements in 6(d)(1)(B). The House bill
strikes the reallocation authority and re-
quires the return of unused E&T funds to the
Treasury. The House bill also increases the
minimum allocation of E&T funds from
$50,000 to $100,000. (Section 4015)
The Senate amendment retains the SNAP
work requirements under current law but
consolidates those work requirements in the
FNA by moving the ABAWD work require-
ment from section 6(o) to section 6(d)(2). Sec-
tion 6(d)(4) is amended to require a State
agency consult with the state workforce de-
velopment board, private employers or orga-
nizations in designing its E&T program and
to require that its E&T program meet state
or local workforce needs. The Senate amend-
ment adds a new requirement that an E&T
program containing a job search component
contain at least 1 additional component, and
expands the definition of an E&T program to
include any E&T pilot activities under
16(h)(1)(F) that are determined effective at
increasing employment or earnings for par-
ticipants. The Senate bill also authorizes
workforce partnerships, which are programs
operated by private employers or non-profits
that would provide participants with at least
20 hours per week of training, work, or expe-
rience. The Senate amendment requires the
State agency to refer individuals determined
to be ill-suited for an E&T component to an
appropriate E&T component or workforce
partnership, to reassess the mental and
physical fitness of the individual, or to the
maximum extent practicable, to coordinate
with other programs to identify work oppor-
tunities or assistance for the individual.
The Senate amendment amends section
16(h) to authorize additional funds for E&T
pilot projects, $92.5 million for each of fiscal
years 2019 and 2020, to remain available until
expended. The Senate bill authorizes 8 or
more additional pilot projects, prioritizing
projects that target certain individuals, in-
cluding those over age 50; formerly incarcer-
ated individuals; those in substance abuse
treatment; and homeless, disabled, and other
individuals with significant barriers to em-
ployment; and projects that are integrated
and family-focused in providing supportive
services. The Senate amendment also adds
an option for states to report data from
workforce partnerships and includes new re-
porting requirements to ensure that the E&T
components are responsive to State or local
workforce needs. (Section 4103)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments. The
amendments retain the general work re-
quirement and ABAWD work requirement in
current law; strike modifications to the cri-
teria that States may use to request a geo-
graphic waiver of the work requirement;
specify that the State’s request for a geo-
graphic waiver have the support of the
State’s chief executive officer; strike the
changes to the ‘‘15-percent’’ exemption cri-
teria; and decrease the ‘‘15-percent’’ exemp-
tion to 12-percent starting in fiscal year 2020.
The amendments require State agency con-
sultation with the state workforce develop-
ment board or private employers or organi-
zations in designing its E&T program and for
the E&T program to meet state or local
workforce needs. Additionally, the amend-
ments expand the definition of an E&T pro-
gram to include supervised job search pro-
grams, apprenticeships, subsidized employ-
ment, and any E&T pilot activities under
section 16(h)(1)(F) that are determined effec-
tive at increasing employment or earnings
for participants. The amendments also au-
thorize workforce partnerships operated by

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9978 December 10, 2018
private employers or non-profits that would
provide participants with at least 20 hours
per week of training, work, or experience.
The amendments require the State agency to
refer individuals who have been determined
to be ill-suited to an E&T component to an
appropriate E&T component or workforce
partnership, to reassess the mental and
physical fitness of the individual, or to co-
ordinate with other programs to identify
work opportunities or assistance for the in-
dividual. The amendments also add an option
for States to report data from workforce
partnerships.
The Conference substitute provides for an
increase in funding for E&T under section
16(h)(1) of the FNA from $90 million to $103.9
million for each fiscal year and prioritizes
the reallocation of unused E&T funding in
the following manner: not less than 50 per-
cent for E&T programs and activities cur-
rently being piloted under section 16(h)(1)(F)
that have the most demonstrable impact on
the ability of participants to find and retain
employment; not less than 30 percent for
E&T programs and activities under section
6(d)(4)(B)(i) that have the most demonstrable
impact on the ability of participants to find
and retain employment and that are tar-
geted to those 50 years of age or over; for-
merly incarcerated individuals; those in sub-
stance abuse treatment; homeless, disabled,
and other individuals with significant bar-
riers to employment; and households facing
multi-generational poverty; and any remain-
ing funds for E&T programs and activities
under section 6(d)(4)(B)(i) that have the most
demonstrable impact on the ability of par-
ticipants to find and retain employment.
(Section 4005)
The Managers acknowledge that neither
the Department nor Congress can enumerate
every ABAWD’s situation as it relates to
possible exemption from the time limit, and
subsequently, the work requirement. States
will maintain the ability to exempt up to
12% of their SNAP population subject to
ABAWD work requirements, down from 15%,
and continue to accrue exemptions and re-
tain any carryover exemptions from previous
years, consistent with current law. These ex-
emptions are meant to excuse individuals
who need short-term reprieve from require-
ments or for those specific populations the
State determines should be excluded.
The Managers also acknowledge that waiv-
ers from the ABAWD time limit are nec-
essary in times of recession and in areas
with labor surpluses or higher rates of unem-
ployment. The Managers intend to maintain
the practice that bestows authority on the
State agency responsible for administering
SNAP to determine when and how waiver re-
quests for ABAWDs are submitted. In re-
sponse to concerns that have been raised by
some Members that State agencies have not
fully communicated to the chief executive
their intent to request a waiver under sec-
tion 6(o), the Managers have included a pro-
vision to encourage communication between
the State agency and the chief executive of-
ficer of the State. The Managers agree that
State agencies should have the support of
these officials in their application for waiv-
er, ensuring maximum State coordination. It
is not the Managers’ intent that USDA un-
dertake any new rulemaking in order to fa-
cilitate support for requests from State
agencies, nor should the language result in
any additional paperwork or administrative
steps under the waiver process.
The Managers recognize the importance of
E&T as a means to improve SNAP partici-
pants’ ability to gain and retain employment
and reduce reliance on public assistance. The
Managers expect USDA and State agencies
to review and bolster the quality and ac-
countability of State E&T programs for
SNAP participants.
The Managers revamped current E&T pro-
gramming to include evidence-based compo-
nents that have proven to assist individuals
in obtaining education credentials, and gain-
ing and retaining employment. Case manage-
ment, including, but not limited to, com-
prehensive intake assessments, individual-
ized service plans, progress monitoring, or
coordination with service providers, is now a
required component of all State E&T pro-
grams. This is neither meant to be an im-
pediment to the State nor the individual.
States should have options as to how to best
serve their participants and ensure there is
an increased level of engagement and ac-
countability for both the State and indi-
vidual. The Managers expect such case man-
agement activities by State agencies to be
included in State plan reporting require-
ments under section 11(e) of the FNA. Addi-
tionally, the Managers agreed to allow su-
pervised job search programs, subsidized em-
ployment, and apprenticeships as additional
E&T components. The Managers note that
unsupervised job search may be a subsidiary
component for the purposes of meeting a
work requirement, only as long as such com-
ponent is less than half the requirement. The
Managers also encourage States to establish
a process for referral or reassessment of indi-
viduals subject to an E&T requirement who
were determined to be ill-suited to the E&T
component to which they had been referred.
The Managers expect State agencies to en-
gage SNAP households, specifically those
without earned income at their point of re-
certification, to be aware of and promote
participation in available E&T options. The
Managers acknowledge that earnings have
the potential to significantly improve the
economic stability of households without
earned income, and expect States to leverage
every opportunity to provide households
with a pathway forward.
The Managers encourage USDA and State
agencies to continue pursuing effective
methods for SNAP participants to attain
sustainable employment. To encourage con-
tinued innovation by State agencies and
incentivize result-driven activities, the Man-
agers amended the process for reallocation of
unused E&T funds to go toward State pro-
grams and activities that have demonstrated
success in participants finding and retaining
employment and reducing reliance on public
assistance. The Managers intend for the re-
allocated funds to fund programs developed
by the pilots authorized under the Agricul-
tural Act of 2014, new E&T activities, and
programs that build upon effective E&T
components. The Managers encourage USDA
to continually prioritize projects and activi-
ties that focus on certain populations facing
employment barriers, such as those older
than 50 years old; formerly incarcerated, dis-
abled, or homeless individuals; and those re-
covering from substance abuse. USDA should
also prioritize projects with family-focused
approaches. The Managers intend to focus
these reallocated resources on programs and
activities that are most effective, as meas-
ured by independent evaluations, and that
demonstrate upfront how these activities are
sustainable and can be transitioned into or
adopted as part of currently allowable em-
ployment and training components.
The Managers included Department of
Labor and Department of Veterans Affairs
E&T programs as part of the programs eligi-
ble to satisfy the SNAP work requirement,
in order to provide additional options to
SNAP participants and encourage coordina-
tion among federal E&T programs.
The Managers also encourage State E&T
programs to increase coordination with
State Workforce Innovation and Opportunity
Act (WIOA) workforce boards and local em-
ployers when establishing and evaluating
programs to increase program account-
ability and maximize the ability for SNAP
participants to meet any work requirements.
The Managers strongly encourage State
agencies to engage and seek input from local
employers when designing and selecting E&T
programs to ensure the skills being offered
are those that are needed and match the
local workforce needs.
The Managers expect workforce partner-
ships (WFPs) to serve as an option for indi-
viduals to fulfill work requirements under
SNAP. The Managers intend for WFPs to
provide a non-government option for E&T
programming, through nonprofit or private
organizations to supplement—not supplant—
Federal and State E&T programs for SNAP
participants.
The Managers intend to allow private em-
ployers, organizations of private employers,
or non-profit organizations that provide
quality, work-relevant skills, training, or ex-
perience to qualify as a WFP, which will ful-
fill work or training requirements for SNAP
participants.
While enrollment by SNAP participants is
voluntary, the Managers expect participa-
tion in WFPs to fulfill either mandatory or
voluntary work requirements. WFPs are in-
tended to allow businesses to provide more
industry-specific training or soft skills
workforce preparation for individuals. WFPs
are also intended to allow non-profit organi-
zations that provide quality, work-related
training to qualify as E&T programs.
The Managers expect that an organization
may establish or have an ongoing training
program certified as a WFP by a State or
USDA if the program:
(A) provides work-related training or expe-
rience of 20 or more hours per week;
(B) will serve as a reference for the partici-
pant fulfilling work requirements or for fu-
ture employment; and
(C) is otherwise following applicable em-
ployment and labor laws.
Once certified, a WFP’s reporting should be
limited to notifying a State agency when a
SNAP participant enters or leaves the pro-
gram or is no longer meeting the program’s
requirements. While State agencies may
refer applicants to a WFP, a WFP should be
allowed to maintain an independent applica-
tion and screening process.
The Managers intend for WFP providers to
be allowed to receive grants or funding
through other sources and partner with non-
profit organizations, community or tech-
nical colleges, a consortium of private em-
ployers, or industry and trade associations.
(4) Improvements to electronic benefit transfer
system
The House bill amends section 7(h)(2) of
the FNA to require the Secretary to review
and modify regulations related to evolving
electronic benefit transfer (EBT) technology
and to develop standards using risk-based
measures to maximize the security, ease of
use, and effectiveness of the technology.
(Section 4016)
The House bill amends section 7(h)(14) by
requiring that before the Secretary author-
izes use of mobile technologies to access
SNAP benefits in all States, the Secretary
shall approve no more than five demonstra-
tion projects that will pilot the use of mobile
technologies, while maintaining recipient
protections and access. (Section 4017)
The House bill amends section 7(h)(13) to
prohibit States, and agents, contractors, and
subcontractors of the State from imposing
fees for switching or routing EBT trans-
actions. (Section 4018)
The House bill amends section 7(d) of the

amended to authorize the Secretary to re-
quire that applicant retailers submit con-
tracts for EBT services and equipment and
records necessary to validate the FNS au-
thorization number to accept and redeem
benefits. (Section 4022)
The House bill amends section 7(h)(8) of
the FNA to require the head of household to
review program rights and responsibilities
after two or more lost cards in a 12-month
period. (Section 4019)
Finally, the House bill amends section
7(h)(12) to: (1) require a State to establish a
procedure for the recovery of benefits due to
the death of all members of the household;
(2) modify the time period for benefit storage
from 6 months to 3 months for inactivity;
and (3) modify the time period for expunging
benefits from 12 months to 6 months or upon
verification all members of the household
are deceased. (Section 4020)
The Senate amendment: (1) amends section
7(h) by inserting a new authority regarding
prohibited fees, effective through fiscal year
2022; (2) adds a new authority to section 7(f)
to allow a farmers market or direct mar-
keting farmer to operate a point of sale de-
vice at more than one location if certain re-
quirements are met; (3) directs GAO to study
the state EBT systems and evaluate fees,
outages, emerging entities and technologies,

tem, and submit findings to Congress; (4) re-
quires the Secretary to conduct a review of
EBT systems and issue guidance or regula-
tion based on the findings of the GAO study
and the Secretary’s review; and (5) allows
the Secretary to require applicant retailers
to submit EBT equipment information and
requires that the Secretary also consider in-
formation about the ability of an applicant
retailer’s EBT equipment and service pro-
vider to provide sufficient EBT data to mini-
mize fraudulent transactions. (Section 4104)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments (1) prohib-
iting the imposition of fees for switching and
routing EBT transactions through fiscal
year 2023; (2) striking the House expansion of
the parties for which the Secretary shall im-
plement controls over related to the delivery
of benefits; (3) striking the House require-
ment that the head of household review pro-
gram rights and responsibilities after two or
more lost cards in a 12-month period; (4) al-
lowing a farmers market or direct marketing
farmer to operate a point of sale device at
more than one location if certain require-
ments are met; (5) allowing the Secretary to
require applicant retailers to submit EBT
equipment information; (6) requiring that
the Secretary consider information about
the ability of an applicant retailer’s EBT
equipment and service provider to provide
sufficient EBT data to minimize fraudulent
transactions; and (7) making other technical
changes. (Section 4006)
The Managers recognize that the accept-
ance of SNAP benefits at farmers markets
has increased participants’ access to fresh,
healthy food while improving sales for local
farmers. In 2017, over $22.4 million in SNAP
benefits were redeemed by farmers markets
or direct marketing farmers. While this rep-
resents a significant expansion over previous
years, these transactions remain a small per-
centage of total SNAP transactions.
A persistent challenge to increasing SNAP
acceptance at farmers markets has been the
cost and availability of wireless EBT point-
of-sale equipment. This barrier has been
compounded by the recent announcement
that a major provider of mobile EBT tech-
nology plans to discontinue service. The
Managers direct the Secretary to take appro-
priate action to ensure that EBT service is
not disrupted and SNAP customers maintain
the ability to use their benefits at farmers
markets.
Another challenge is the requirement for
each farmers market location to obtain its
own EBT authorization and equipment, even
if the locations are operated and managed by
a single organization. The Managers intend
for the Secretary to allow a farmers market
or direct-marketing farmer to operate an in-
dividual point-of-sale device at more than
one location under the same SNAP author-
ization, while maintaining appropriate safe-
guards to ensure program integrity.
The Managers are aware that some State-
contracted EBT processors are charging
switching or routing fees in connection with
the routing of SNAP benefits. These fees re-
quire retailers and/or those routing trans-
actions on behalf of retailers (often referred
to as third party processors) to pay for
switching or routing EBT transactions to
the State EBT processor that handles the
client EBT account. These fees may seek to
offset artificially low cost-per-case-month
fees that are bid as part of State contracts,
and therefore, adversely affect competition
among existing or new EBT processors. So,
for the next five years, in the interest of
maintaining competitiveness for EBT trans-
action routing, the Managers extend existing
statutory prohibitions against the charging
of fees by State-contracted EBT processors
in connection with the redemption of SNAP
benefits to include the charging of gateway
switching or routing fees to SNAP author-
ized retailers or their third party processors.
This five-year prohibition will provide in-
terim certainty while allowing stakeholders
to coordinate and find practical compromise.
The Managers recognize USDA has existing
authority to review State EBT systems, as
well as fees, outages, emerging entities and
technologies, and the participating entities
within the EBT system. The Managers also
understand the Secretary has begun a feasi-
bility study related to a potential national
gateway system. In addition to the gateway
study, the Managers strongly encourage the
Secretary to review other components with-
in the EBT system, including, but not lim-
ited to, security, use of innovative tech-
nology, and improved monitoring.
The marketplace continues to develop in-
novative technologies, such as third-party
mobile applications, which can assist SNAP
participants with managing their benefits.
The Managers encourage USDA to use exist-
ing authority to review the effectiveness of
third-party mobile applications for SNAP
EBT cards and to inform States on how to
ensure these new technologies have a secure
system in place to protect personal account
information; do not sell, distribute or make
available personal account information for
commercial marketing purposes; and that
participants have consistent access to infor-
mation that would otherwise be made avail-
able to that household member.
Although the Managers agreed to reduce
the time limit before benefits are stored and
expunged, the intent is for SNAP partici-
pants to be provided appropriate opportunity
to restore benefits after they have been
stored and before they are expunged. Fur-
ther, when determining whether clients have
used their benefits within the required time-
frames, the Managers direct States to track
account activity using the ‘‘first in, first
out’’ method.
(5) Requirements for online acceptance of bene-
fits
The House bill amends section 3(o)(1) of the
FNA to include online entities within the
definition of retail food store. It also amends
section 7(k) to strike the required report to
Congress and require the nationwide imple-
mentation of the online acceptance of bene-
fits post-pilot. (Section 4021)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 4001)
The Managers recognize the importance of
modernizing SNAP to improve the efficiency
of the program through online redemption of
benefits. While the online pilots at USDA
have yet to begin, in spite of the deadline es-
tablished by the Agricultural Act of 2014, the
Managers encourage the Secretary to
promptly implement those pilots and adopt
online acceptance nationwide following com-
pletion of such pilots. In order to expedite
nationwide implementation, the Managers
agreed to remove the reporting requirement
from the online pilots. The Managers expect
USDA to continue to incorporate appro-
priate protections and monitoring to ensure
program integrity.
(6) National gateway
The House bill requires the Secretary to
create a national gateway through which to
route all SNAP EBT transactions. Prior to
implementing the national gateway in all
States, the Secretary is required to conduct
a feasibility study. The House bill authorizes
$10.5 million for fiscal year 2019 and $9.5 mil-
lion for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023,
and requires benefit issuers and third-party
processors to pay fees, proportionate to the
number of transactions and operating costs,
to the gateway operator. (Section 4022)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision. The Conference substitute
deletes the House provision.
(7) Supplemental nutrition assistance program
benefit transfer transaction data report
The House bill amends section 9 of the
FNA by authorizing the Secretary to collect
a statistically significant sample of SNAP
retailer transaction data, including the cost
and description of food purchased with
SNAP, to the extent practicable. The House
bill also exempts certain transaction data
from the Freedom of Information Act disclo-
sure requirements. (Section 4026)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision. The Conference substitute
deletes the House provision.
(8) Required action on data match information
The Senate amendment requires State
agencies to contact the household to clarify
or verify, if applicable, certain information
relating to household circumstances received
from data matches for the purpose of ensur-
ing an accurate eligibility and benefit deter-
mination. (Section 4106)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 4009)
Procedures for required action on data
matches have been established through regu-
lation at 7 CFR 273.12(c)(3). The Managers do
not intend for the Department to change or
reconsider this regulation. Rather, this pro-
vision is intended to codify existing regula-
tion and make a conforming change to ad-
dress the establishment of the National Ac-
curacy Clearinghouse.
(9) Transitional benefits
The House bill requires State agencies to
provide transitional SNAP benefits to house-
holds that cease to receive cash assistance
through TANF or to households with chil-
dren that cease to receive cash assistance
through a State-funded public assistance
program, for 5 months after the date on
which cash assistance is terminated. (Sec-
tion 4024)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.

projects to develop and implement SNAP
simplified application and eligibility deter-
mination systems. (Section 4025)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment making
technical changes. (Section 4010)
(11) Interstate data matching to prevent mul-
tiple issuances
The House bill requires an interstate data-
base or system of databases to prevent par-
ticipants from receiving duplicative benefits
in multiple States, and includes state data
collection and requirements to submit uni-
form data to USDA, including for each mem-
ber of a participating household: social secu-
rity number, employment status, amount of
income, the member’s portion of the house-
hold monthly allotment, and portion of
household assets attributed to that member.
(Section 4001)
The Senate amendment requires data
matching through an interstate data system
to prevent simultaneous issuance of benefits
to an individual by more than one State.
(Section 4109)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments that in-
clude parts of the Senate amendment to pro-
tect participant privacy and that make tech-
nical changes. (Section 4011)
The amendments also modify the House
provision that requires state data collection
by instead requiring the Secretary to ap-
prove the establishment of longitudinal
databases for research purposes that include,
if available, household demographic charac-
teristics, income and financial resources,
employment status, household cir-
cumstances such as deductible expenses, and
the monthly SNAP allotment amount, while
protecting participant privacy. To award
grants to States to establish and maintain
the longitudinal databases, the Secretary is
provided $20 million for fiscal year 2019 to re-
main available through fiscal year 2021 and
$5 million for fiscal year 2022 and each fiscal
year thereafter. (Section 4015)
The Managers intend to build upon the
successful pilot program authorized under
the Agricultural Act of 2014 to prevent dupli-
cate, simultaneous receipt of SNAP benefits
in two or more States. The Managers recog-
nize that certification in more than one
State is frequently due to a household mov-
ing between States and the State failing to
properly close or adjust benefits as a result
of household relocation, not a household
committing fraud. The Managers expect the
expansion of the National Accuracy Clear-
inghouse will create efficiencies in the proc-
ess by which States address this issue. How-
ever, the Managers do not intend for this
data matching to impede access to SNAP or
delay certification of eligible households.
The Managers provide discretion to the Sec-
retary to determine the most effective sys-
tem and vendor (s) to carry out this section.
The Managers expect State agencies to par-
ticipate in and take action on data matching
that indicates multiple benefit issuances,
consistent with required action on data
match information (Section 4009) in the con-
ference substitute agreement.
The Managers intend for longitudinal data-
bases to better assess households’ participa-
tion in SNAP and SNAP program operations,
and to improve SNAP program design and ef-
fectiveness. The Managers intend for the cre-
ation of State-based longitudinal databases
to improve research on participation in the
program, including duration of participation
in SNAP. Longitudinal data can serve as an
important measurement of program impact
and success, and can be used by States and
the Secretary to improve program adminis-
tration. This provision directs the Secretary
to establish a database framework to maxi-
mize potential consistency among States
and, in addition to administrative cost
share, incentivize States to develop and
maintain databases through grant alloca-
tion. The Managers recognize that State
computer systems and certification proc-
esses may vary between States and some
variations will need to be accommodated.
The Managers also ask that, to the max-
imum extent practicable, States strive to in-
clude all households in the datasets. While
ensuring minimal burden on States and pro-
gram participants is paramount, robust sets
of data are important in informing future
policy. However, this is not intended to pre-
clude the funding of longitudinal databases
in States that are not able to include all
households or participants within the State.
The Managers expect that all States that
have an interest in creating a database will
be given an opportunity to participate, even
if the State is not able to include all SNAP
households or faces higher data management
costs due to population size. The Managers
intend for longitudinal databases to be es-
tablished on the initiative of the State, and
encourage States that establish longitudinal
databases to do so in a thoughtful, deliberate
manner, with adequate consideration of po-
tential data uses and needed security prac-
tices.
The Managers expect the Secretary to di-
rect and States to ensure personally identifi-
able information is not used or stored in lon-
gitudinal databases of SNAP participants.
Further, the Managers urge the Secretary to
adopt the highest practical privacy and data
security standards for any approved data to
be used in any longitudinal database storage
systems operated by States or using Depart-
ment funds. The Managers encourage the De-
partment to consult with other Federal
agencies, such as the Census Bureau and the
Treasury Department about how those agen-
cies have protected the identity of individ-
uals whose information is contained in Fed-
eral databases.
The Secretary should allow for the sharing
of aggregated information not including per-
sonally identifiable information by States
from a longitudinal database to researchers
who are qualified and have the capacity to
protect such data. However, the Managers
intend for the data stored in longitudinal
databases to be subject to neither Federal
nor State Freedom of Information Act re-
quests.
The Managers do not intend for this sec-
tion to restrict States that have already or
will in the future establish their own longi-
tudinal databases in accordance with other
provisions of the Food and Nutrition Act of
2008. Further, the Managers encourage the
Secretary and States establishing new longi-
tudinal databases to utilize the lessons
learned by States that have already estab-
lished longitudinal databases.
(12) Income verification
The Senate amendment requires pilot
projects in up to 8 states to test strategies to
improve the accuracy or efficiency of the in-
come verification process, and fund projects
at $10 million total. (Section 4107)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate provision.
(13) Retail incentives
The House bill amends the FNA to estab-
lish a pilot project through which authorized
retail food stores may provide bonuses to
participating SNAP households based on
household purchases of fruits, vegetables,
and fluid milk. Retail food stores partici-
pating in the pilot project may be reim-
bursed in an amount not to exceed 25 percent
of the dollar value of bonuses earned by
households and used to purchase SNAP-eligi-
ble foods. The House bill provides the Sec-
retary with not more than $120 million each
fiscal year for such reimbursements. (Sec-
tion 4002)
The Senate amendment amends section 9
of the FNA to direct the Secretary to pro-
mulgate regulations to clarify the process by
which retailers may seek a waiver to offer an
incentive for the purchase of certain foods
recommended for increased consumption by
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. (Sec-
tion 4105)
The Senate amendment also amends sec-
tion 17 of the FNA to establish pilot projects
to increase the purchase of fluid milk in a
manner consistent with the Dietary Guide-
lines for Americans, and authorizes appro-
priations of $20 million to remain available
until expended. (Section 4108)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to strike
(1) the reimbursement to retail food stores
participating in pilot projects for not more
than 25 percent of the dollar value of bonuses
earned by household and used to purchase
SNAP-eligible food and (2) the $120 million
funding authority. The amendments author-
ize fluid milk incentive projects to increase
the purchase of fluid milk; specify that the
Secretary shall issue guidance to clarify the
process by which retail food stores may seek
waivers to offer an incentive for the pur-
chase of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, or
dairy (or products thereof) that are staple
foods identified for increased consumption
consistent with the most recent dietary rec-
ommendations; and make other technical
changes. (Sections 4008 and 4208)
The Managers recognize the necessity of
the public-private partnership between
USDA and retail food stores to implement
SNAP, and encourage retailers to offer in-
centives for the purchase of fruits, vegeta-
bles, whole grains, and dairy staple foods
with SNAP benefits. While the Managers un-
derstand that USDA currently allows retail
food stores to offer incentives under a waiv-
er, the waiver requests are not widely under-
stood or utilized. The Managers encourage
USDA to develop a more formal process to
engage a variety of retailers, and provide in-
centive options to a broader SNAP popu-
lation. This provision is not intended to per-
mit retailers to waive any other aspects of
SNAP equal treatment.
(14) Adjustment to percentage of recovered
funds retained by states
The House bill amends section 16(a) of the
FNA to allow States to retain 50 percent of
recovered funds, instead of 35 percent, and
limits the use of such funds to carrying out
SNAP, including technology investments,
improvements in administration and dis-
tribution, and fraud prevention. (Section
4027)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(15) Quality control
The House bill amends section 11(a)(3) of
the FNA to require that State agencies pro-
vide the Secretary with access to entire
state information systems containing SNAP-
related records for inspection and audit, sub-
ject to data and security protocols agreed to
by the State agency and Secretary. The pro-
vision amends section 16 (c) to require State
agencies to provide the Secretary with the
records and access to the entire information
systems in which such records are contained
necessary to determine the State’s payment
error rate. The House bill also amends sec-
tion 16 (g) to add to the list of criteria for re-
ceiving federal administrative cost-share for

the planning, design, development, installa-
tion, and operation of state information sys-
tems, a requirement that the Secretary be
provided with access to the entirety of such
system. (Section 4023)
The Senate amendment is substantially
similar to the House bill, but without the re-
quirement that data and security protocols
be agreed to by the State agency and Sec-
retary, without the amendment to section
16(c) to require access to entire information
systems necessary to determine the State’s
payment error rate, and with technical dif-
ferences. (Section 4110)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments making
technical changes. (Section 4013(a), (c), and
(e))
The Managers recognize the oversight and
administration problems with the quality
control (QC) process identified over the last
several years, both at the Federal and State
level, which resulted in a multi-year gap in
publication of SNAP error rates. The Man-
agers acknowledge the Office of Inspector
General audit of the Food and Nutrition
Service (FNS) and State QC processes for fis-
cal year 2011 and fiscal year 2012, as well as
the subsequent Department of Justice inves-
tigation of the use of a third-party con-
tractor in 20 States.
The Managers recognize the updates and
improvements to the QC process made by
FNS through clarified guidance, corrective
action plans with States, and the publication
of a fiscal year 2017 error rate. The Managers
intend to reinforce these efforts to obtain
statistically-valid data, and intend for
States to cooperate in the QC process by
making data available to FNS when re-
quested.
The federal government has a responsi-
bility to evaluate SNAP for program im-
provement, program access and program in-
tegrity. In order to do so, USDA needs suffi-
cient access, in accordance with agreements
with States, to State systems and records. In
particular, this allows for more transparency
and a greater ability to detect and reduce er-
rors and fraud. The Managers direct USDA to
access records and information systems and,
as appropriate, to better manage the pro-
gram in this regard.
(16) Quality control
The House bill amends section 16(c) of the
FNA by reducing the tolerance level for pay-
ment errors from $37 to $0 and by changing
the criteria for when the State is held liable
for its payment error rates. (Section 4028)
The House bill amends section 16(d) by
eliminating the $48 million performance bo-
nuses beginning in fiscal year 2019 while re-
taining requirements regarding performance
criteria including actions taken to correct
payment errors, reduce error rates, and im-
prove eligibility determinations. (Section
4029)
The Senate amendment amends section
16(c) by providing authority regarding qual-
ity control system integrity, including di-
recting the Secretary to issue interim final
regulations within 180 days and requiring the
Secretary to debar any person who know-
ingly submits or causes to be submitted false
information to the Secretary. The Senate
amendment also requires that starting for
fiscal year 2018 performance, $48 million in
performance bonuses be reduced to $6 million
for each fiscal year for application proc-
essing timeliness. (Section 4110)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments that
strike the changes to the tolerance level for
payment error, that strike the changes to
when States are held liable for payment
error rates, that include authority regarding
quality control system integrity, that speci-
fies performance bonuses are eliminated
starting for fiscal year 2018 performance, and
that make other technical changes. (Section
4013(b) and (d))
The Managers also recognize the role that
performance bonuses have historically
played in motivating States to pursue low
error rates, but acknowledge that some
States have implemented problematic prac-
tices in recent years. As a result, the Man-
agers chose to eliminate bonuses awarded
based on error rates. States will continue to
be held responsible for administering SNAP,
and legally bound to processing applications
in a timely manner, ensuring households re-
ceive the accurate amount of SNAP benefits,
and making certain the program is adminis-
tered in the most effective and efficient
manner. The Managers intend State perform-
ance indicators to include case and proce-
dural error rates (CAPERs) and metrics on
timeliness of application processing and pro-
gram access.
(17) Requirement of live-production environ-
ments for certain pilot projects relating to
cost sharing for computerization
The Senate amendment amends section 16
of the FNA to require that State agencies
test the automatic data processing and infor-
mation retrieval systems in a live produc-
tion environment prior to implementation.
(Section 4111)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 4012)
The Managers intend to provide cost-shar-
ing funds for State agencies to test changes
to state SNAP systems through the use of
‘‘live’’ pilots and receive approval from the
Secretary prior to fully implementing
changes to state SNAP systems. The Man-
agers intend for this testing and approval to
address concerns with recent cases of State
agencies adopting changes or implementing
integrated eligibility systems that have re-
sulted in errors in benefits issuances.
(18) Public-private partnerships
The House bill amends section 17 of the
FNA to allow the Secretary to conduct pilot
projects to support public-private partner-
ships that address food insecurity and pov-
erty, and authorizes appropriations of $5 mil-
lion to carry out such projects. (Section 4030)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to require
an independent evaluation of the public-pri-
vate partnership pilot projects and to make
other technical changes. (Section 4021)
SNAP, by design, is a partnership between
public and private entities, with the goal of
reducing food insecurity. The Secretary may
permit not more than 10 eligible entities to
carry out pilot projects that support these
necessary cooperative arrangements. The
Managers agree that any and all of these pi-
lots must address food insecurity and pov-
erty by improving the coordination of pro-
grams that promote independence, develop
contextualized solutions to poverty, and
strengthen the capacity for regions/commu-
nities to address and mitigate food insecu-
rity and poverty. Additionally, the Managers
expect independent evaluations of these
projects to ensure a robust and impartial as-
sessment of activities, best practices, and
overall effectiveness of the pilots.
(19) Assistance for community food projects
The Senate amendment provides $5 million
for fiscal year 2019 and each fiscal year
thereafter for Community Food Projects.
(Section 4113)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 4017)
(20) Nutrition education state plans
The House bill amends section 28 of the
FNA: (1) to require that the Secretary, act-
ing through the Director of the National In-
stitute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), in
consultation with the FNS Administrator,
implement a nutrition education and obesity
prevention program; (2) to provide annual
funding to 1862 and 1890 institutions to de-
liver nutrition education services that, to
the extent practicable, provide for the em-
ployment and training of professional and
paraprofessional aides to engage in direct
nutrition education, and to partner with
other public and private entities to optimize
program delivery; (3) to allow State agencies
to use SNAP 50/50 administrative funds to
prepare state plans on nutrition education
and to notify eligible participants about the
availability of the program; (4) to increase
mandatory funding for the program to $485
million beginning in fiscal year 2019, indexed
to inflation; (5) to allow for reallocation of
unexpended funds to other eligible institu-
tions during the fiscal year or subsequent
fiscal year; (6) to authorize additional appro-
priations for the program of $65 million for
each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023; (7) to
update the allocation of funds so that, begin-
ning in fiscal year 2019, funds are allocated
based solely on States’ SNAP populations;
and (8) to limit administrative costs for eli-
gible institutions to 10 percent.
The House provision also amends section 18
to reflect the repeal of the Expanded Food
and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP)
by section 7110 of the House bill. (Section
4033)
The Senate amendment: (1) requires that
the state plan describe how the State agency
will use an electronic reporting system to
evaluate SNAP-Ed projects; (2) requires in-
creased coordination with the expanded food
and nutrition education program and addi-
tional consultation with the Director of
NIFA; and (3) requires the State agency to
submit an annual evaluation report. (Section
4114)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments to (1) require
that the electronic reporting system used to
evaluate SNAP-Ed projects also be used to
account for State agency administrative
costs; (2) establish an information clearing-
house to share best practices ensuring that
SNAP-Ed projects are appropriate for the
target population; (3) require the Secretary
to provide technical assistance to State
agencies in developing and implementing a
SNAP-Ed state plan; (4) require an annual
State report to the Secretary; (5) require an
annual federal report to Congress that in-
cludes an evaluation of the level of coordina-
tion between SNAP-Ed, EFNEP, and other
USDA nutrition education programs; and (6)
make other technical changes. (Section 4019)
The Managers recognize the importance of
offering nutrition education, especially in
conjunction with SNAP benefits. The Man-
agers also recognize the role of partner orga-
nizations who implement nutrition edu-
cation programs. The Managers note that
SNAP-Ed programs are not evaluated in a
standardized manner across States or part-
ner organizations. However, the Managers
expect both States and partner organizations
to make improvements to the evaluation
process of their SNAP-Ed programs and to
leverage evaluation results to deliver nutri-
tion education in the most effective manner.
When appropriate, partners are encouraged
to share longitudinal data, especially for
multiyear projects. The Managers intend for
States to use the Information Clearinghouse
to share best practices in planning, imple-
menting, and evaluating SNAP-Ed programs.

H9982 December 10, 2018
The Managers encourage nonprofit partners
to work with research-capable organizations
to improve program evaluations.
The Managers recognize the role of land
grant colleges and universities in imple-
menting, evaluating, and improving nutri-
tion education, whether through SNAP-Ed or
EFNEP. The Managers expect those imple-
menting SNAP-Ed and EFNEP to coordinate
programming, as appropriate, to efficiently
serve target populations without duplicating
efforts.
The Managers also expect that States pro-
vide an accounting of allowable State agency
administrative costs. This is necessary to en-
sure all program funds are used in the most
appropriate manner and that beneficiaries of
nutrition education receive the most effec-
tive programming and services. The Man-
agers expect USDA to work with States to
provide appropriate aggregated data in a way
that does not increase the administrative
burden related to reporting.
(21) Emergency food assistance
The House bill amends section 27 of the
FNA by increasing the Emergency Food As-
sistance Program (TEFAP) entitlement com-
modity funding. The House bill extends fund-
ing authority at $250 million per year, ad-
justed for Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) changes,
through fiscal year 2023, in addition to $60
million in funds starting in fiscal year 2019,
the total of which is adjusted by changes
from the June 2018 TFP in subsequent fiscal
years. The House bill also establishes a
Farm-to-Food-Bank fund, which authorizes
$20 million to be distributed to States to pro-
cure, or to enter into agreements with food
banks to procure, excess fresh fruits and
vegetables grown in the State or surrounding
region to be provided to eligible recipient
agencies under section 201A (3) of the Emer-
gency Food Assistance Act of 1983. (Section
4032)
The Senate amendment increases the
TEFAP entitlement commodity funding by
extending funding authority at $250 million
per year, adjusted for TFP changes, through
fiscal year 2023, added to the following: for
fiscal year 2019, $23 million and for each of
fiscal years 2020 through 2023, $35 million.
Funding for fiscal year 2024 and each subse-
quent fiscal year will be indexed from the
fiscal year 2023 funding level.
The Senate amendment amends the Emer-
gency Food Assistance Act of 1983 to provide
$4 million per year in mandatory funding
through fiscal year 2023 for State agencies to
partner with emergency feeding organiza-
tions to establish projects to harvest, proc-
ess, or package unharvested, unprocessed, or
unpackaged commodities that are donated
by agricultural producers, processors, or dis-
tributors and to pay for up to 50 percent of
the cost of such projects. It also provides
emergency feeding organizations and eligible
recipient agencies the opportunity to provide
input on the commodity needs and pref-
erences of those entities. Additionally, the
Senate amendment requires the Secretary to
issue guidance outlining best practices to
minimize food waste of donated commodities
and reauthorizes TEFAP infrastructure
funding through fiscal year 2023. (Section
4115)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment specifying
that projects to harvest, process, or package
unharvested, unprocessed, or unpackaged do-
nated commodities also include the trans-
portation of such commodities. (Section
4018)
The Managers support State efforts to
channel unused, raw agricultural commod-
ities or food from commercial sources into
food donations and to minimize food waste in
the food donation process. The Managers in-
tend for funding provided for such efforts to
be used to convert raw commodities, unproc-
essed foods, or other foods that are not in a
consumable or shelf-stable form to be used or
stored by emergency feeding organizations.
The funds for such projects are not intended
to be used for food or commodity purchases,
since such funds are already provided
through separate funding for TEFAP. The
Managers intend for any funds provided for
transportation under subsection (d) to be
used to support a project under this sub-
section, not for transportation related to
other activities within TEFAP.
The Managers expect the guidance to in-
clude best practices to minimize food waste
within the procurement, processing, and dis-
tribution of food donations to State agencies
and emergency feeding organizations.
The Managers encourage State agencies to
engage stakeholders, including emergency
feeding organizations and eligible recipient
agencies, in the development of the State
plan, especially when determining selection
of USDA commodities, in order to best meet
State and local needs.
(22) Retail food store and recipient trafficking
The House bill amends section 29 of the
FNA by extending to fiscal year 2023 the au-
thorization of appropriations for tracking
and preventing SNAP trafficking using data
mining technologies. (Section 4034)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 4020)
(23) Technical and conforming amendments
The House bill provides technical correc-
tions. (Section 4035)
The Senate amendment provides technical
corrections. (Section 4116)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 4022)
(24) Re-evaluation of thrifty food plan
The House bill amends section 3(u) of the
FNA to, by 2022, and at five-year intervals,
require a re-evaluation and publication of
the TFP based on current food prices, food
composition data, and consumption patterns.
(Section 4004)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment speci-
fying that the re-evaluation of the TFP also
be based on dietary guidance. (Section 4002)
SNAP benefits are based on USDA calcula-
tions of the cost of food. However, SNAP
benefits can become out-of-date based on in-
consistent review of the TFP. The Managers
require that the TFP be re-evaluated every
five years to ensure it reflects current eating
habits of Americans, including patterns of
food preparation, and the items most often
purchased by consumers.
(25) Update to categorical eligibility
The House bill amends section 5(a) and 5(j)
of the FNA such that categorical eligibility
may only be used in instances where a bene-
ficiary is receiving either cash assistance or
ongoing and substantial services such as
transportation, childcare, counseling, or
other services funded under part A of title IV
of the Social Security Act with an income
eligibility limit of not more than 130 percent
(200 percent for elderly or disabled) of the
poverty line. (Section 4006)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(26) Basic allowance for housing
The House bill amends section 5(d) of the
FNA to exclude up to $500 of a housing allow-
ance received under section 403 of title 37 of
the United States Code from the calculation
of income when determining SNAP eligi-
bility, and amends section 5(e)(6)(A) of the
FNA so a household that receives an allow-
ance under section 403 of title 37 of the
United States Code can only claim expenses
in excess of that allowance when deter-
mining the household’s expenses for the ex-
cess shelter deduction. (Section 4007)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(27) Earned income deduction
The House bill amends section 5(e)(2)(B) of
the FNA to increase from 20 to 22, the per-
centage of a household’s earned income that
may be deducted for purposes of calculating
income when determining SNAP eligibility.
(Section 4008)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(28) Simplified homeless housing costs
The House bill amends section 5(e)(6)(D) of
the FNA to require that States provide a
simplified homeless housing deduction of
$143, adjusted for inflation, for homeless
households who are not receiving free hous-
ing during the month and not claiming an
excess shelter expense deduction under sec-
tion 5(e)(6)(A). (Section 4009)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 4004)
In order to ensure equal treatment across
States, the Managers agree that homeless
households that are not receiving free shel-
ter throughout the month should receive a
standardized deduction of $143.
(29) Availability of standard utility allowances
based on receipt of energy assistance
The House bill amends section 5(e)(6)(C) of
the FNA by limiting the availability of the
standard utility allowance for heating and
cooling costs to those households consisting
of an elderly or disabled member and amends
section 5(k)(4) of the FNA so that third party
energy assistance payments are considered
money payable directly to households with-
out an elderly or disabled member for pur-
poses of calculating exclusions to income,
and are no longer considered out-of-pocket
expenses for such households for determina-
tion of the excess shelter expense deduction.
(Section 4010)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(30) Child support; cooperation with child sup-
port agencies
The House bill amends section 5(e) of the
FNA by striking the State option to provide
a deduction from income for child support
payments, therefore requiring all States to
provide an exclusion for child support pay-
ments. It amends sections 6(l) and 6(m) of
the FNA, striking the State option to re-
quire child support cooperation for custodial
and noncustodial parents, thus requiring co-
operation. The House bill also strikes section
6(n), eliminating the State option to dis-
qualify SNAP participants for child support
arrears, thus not allowing States the option
to disqualify SNAP participants for child
support arrears. (Section 4011)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to strike
the changes to the State options in section
5(e) and sections 6(l) through 6(n) and to re-
quire that the Secretary conduct an inde-
pendent evaluation that includes, among

other things: (1) an assessment of the impact
of the eligibility requirements in sections
6(l) through (n) in States that have formerly
implemented or continue to implement those
requirements, and of the feasibility of imple-
menting those requirements in other States;
(2) an assessment of the factors that contrib-
uted to the decision of States that formerly
implemented those requirements to cease
such implementation; and (3) a review of al-
ternatives to those requirements that are
used by other States to assist SNAP partici-
pants to make or receive child support pay-
ments and the effectiveness of such alter-
natives. (Section 4014)
The Managers agreed to include an evalua-
tion of child support enforcement coopera-
tion requirements. The Managers intend for
this study to evaluate a representative sam-
ple of States of the types indicated in sub-
paragraph (A), including those that have im-
plemented, those that formerly imple-
mented, and those that have not imple-
mented State options on eligibility related
to child support enforcement. The Managers
also intend for USDA to assess the impact of
mandatory child support cooperation on food
security, including reviewing relevant data
about individuals who choose not to partici-
pate in SNAP due to mandated child support
cooperation.
(31) Adjustment to asset limitations
The House bill amends section 5(g)(1) of the
FNA by increasing from $2,000 to $7,000 the
maximum allowable value of assets for par-
ticipating households, and from $3,000 to
$12,000 for households including an elderly or
disabled member, and adjusts such values for
inflation for each fiscal year starting on Oc-
tober 1, 2019. (Section 4012)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(32) Updated vehicle allowance
The House bill amends section 5(g) of the
FNA to require all States to exclude $12,000
(adjusted annually for inflation) of the value
of one vehicle per licensed driver from house-
hold asset calculations, and strikes the al-
ternative vehicle allowance. (Section 4013)
The Senate bill contains no comparable
provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(33) Savings excluded from assets
The House bill amends section 5(g) of the
FNA to exclude up to $2,000 (adjusted annu-
ally for inflation) in savings from household
assets in determining SNAP eligibility. (Sec-
tion 4014)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(34) Implementation funds
The House bill provides $150 million under
section 18(a) of the FNA for fiscal year 2019
to remain available until expended to imple-
ment the amendments made by subtitle A of
Title IV of the House bill. (Section 4036)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(35) Multivitamin-mineral dietary supplements
eligible for purchase with supplemental nu-
trition assistance benefits
The House bill amends section 3(k) of the
FNA to allow certain ‘‘multivitamin-mineral
dietary supplements’’ to qualify as a food
item that may be purchased with SNAP ben-
efits. (Section 4037)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(36) Review of supplemental nutrition assistance
program operations
The House bill amends section 9 of the
FNA by adding a new subsection to require
the Secretary to review and report on a rep-
resentative sample of certain types of au-
thorized group-living facilities to determine
whether SNAP benefits are properly being
used by households residing in such facilities
and requiring reports to Congress within 3
years. The House bill also specifies that
nothing in section 9 authorizes the Secretary
to deny an application for authorization, in-
cluding continued authorization, or a re-
quest to withdraw the authorization of such
group-living facilities based on a determina-
tion that the residents of those facilities are
residents of an institution prior to the sub-
mission of the report or 3 years after the
date of enactment, whichever is earlier.
(Section 4038)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments that
make technical changes and specify that
nothing in the new subsection authorizes the
Secretary to deny an application for author-
ization, including continued authorization,
or a request to withdraw the authorization of
such group-living facilities based on a deter-
mination that the residents of those facili-
ties are residents of an institution prior to 18
months after the date of enactment. (Section
4007)
The Managers expect the Secretary to re-
view and conduct oversight of authorized fa-
cilities to prevent the issuance of duplicative
benefits for food and ensure program integ-
rity of SNAP. In addition, the Managers in-
tend for the Secretary to review the procure-
ment of benefits on behalf of SNAP eligible
individuals by residential drug and alcohol
treatment facilities, and conduct oversight
as necessary.
(37) Disqualification of certain convicted felons
The House bill amends section 6 of the
FNA to disqualify certain convicted felons
from participating in SNAP. (Section 4039)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(38) Determination of amount of block grant
payable to Puerto Rico
The House bill requires the Secretary to
study the feasibility and impact of using a
TFP exclusive to Puerto Rico in calculating
the amount of the block grant for Puerto
Rico, and authorizes such sums as necessary
to be appropriated to carry out the study.
(Section 4040)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(39) Service of traditional foods in public facili-
ties
The House bill amends section 4033 of the
Agricultural Act of 2014 to expand the public
facilities eligible for the service of tradi-
tional foods under that section. (Section
4041)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to
amend 4033(d)(1) of the Agricultural Act of
2014 to limit the liability of States, counties
or county equivalents, local education agen-
cies, and other entities authorized to facili-
tate the donation, storage, preparation, or
serving of traditional food. (Section 4203)
The Managers intend to update the liabil-
ity protection for the donation or serving of
traditional foods to include States, counties
or county equivalents, local educational
agencies, entities, and persons authorized by
the operator of a food service program.
(40) Extension of study on comparable access to
supplemental nutrition assistance for Puerto
Rico
The House bill amends section 4142 of the
Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008
to renew an authorization for a study on the
feasibility of including the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico in the SNAP program, in lieu
of providing Puerto Rico with a block grant.
(Section 4042)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(41) Administrative flexibility for States
The House bill amends section 11(e)(6)(B) of
the FNA to allow, at the option of the State
agency, non-State agency employees to un-
dertake certification or carry out any other
function of the State agency under SNAP.
(Section 4043)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
The Managers determined, after reviewing
USDA’s December 2017 guidance, that certifi-
cation and eligibility functions must be per-
formed by public, merit system employees.
The Managers encourage the Secretary to
consult with States about the efficiency and
effectiveness of SNAP certification systems
and believe States should continue to im-
prove customer service through methods
that neither affect privacy nor eligibility de-
terminations. The Managers determined a
statutory change to this system was unwar-
ranted. However, the Managers encourage
the Secretary to continue to work with
States to find the appropriate balance to
protect SNAP integrity and access and ad-
dress requests for flexibility through the ex-
isting process in a timely fashion.
(42) Commodity supplemental food program
The House bill authorizes a minimum cer-
tification period of one year, which at the re-
quest of the State, can be extended based on
certain criteria. (Section 4103)
The Senate amendment authorizes a cer-
tification period of not less than one year,
and subject to the approval of the Secretary,
a certification period of more than 1 year,
but not more than 3 years, and temporary
certification. (Section 4202)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment making
technical changes. (Section 4102)
The Managers understand the importance
of providing nutritious food to low-income
seniors. The Managers intend to extend the
certification period to up to three years for
seniors, with an annual contact to confirm
continued eligibility information and inter-
est in the program. The Managers also in-
tend to allow temporary certification of an
individual for the Commodity Supplemental
Food Program. The Managers made these
changes to reduce administrative burden for
participants and implementers, and to make
the most efficient use of program funds.
(43) Health food financing initiative
The House bill amends the authorization of
appropriations by striking ‘‘until expended’’
and instead authorizing the funds to remain
available until Oct. 1, 2023. (Section 4203)
The Senate amendment authorizes ‘‘enter-
prises’’ for program loans, grants and fund-
ing projects and limits eligibility to projects
that accept SNAP benefits, as applicable.
(Section 12409)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 4204)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9984 December 10, 2018
The Managers recognize that access to
healthy food may require a variety of retail
settings in some areas, particularly in rural
areas and Tribal communities. To encompass
a broader variety of Healthy Food Financing
Initiative (HFFI) projects that will increase
the supply of and demand for healthy foods
in underserved communities, the bill ex-
pands eligible projects to include healthy
food enterprises. These enterprises could in-
clude food hubs, mobile markets, direct to
consumer markets, or food business incuba-
tors. As healthy food enterprises do not nec-
essarily involve the direct sale of food to
low-income consumers, the Managers intend
to clarify that direct acceptance of SNAP
benefits should be required if applicable to
the project’s structure. The Managers also
seek to clarify that HFFI should provide
equal consideration to projects regardless of
whether they intend to serve an urban or a
rural community.
(44) The Gus Schumacher food insecurity nutri-
tion incentive
The House bill amends section 4405 of the
Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008
by (1) renaming the program the Gus
Schumacher Food Insecurity Nutrition In-
centive Program; (2) limiting program incen-
tives to financial incentives; (3) striking the
independent evaluation requirement and re-
quiring instead that projects have adequate
plans to collect data for reporting and agree
to participate in a program evaluation; (4)
updating program priorities to include,
among other priorities, prioritizing projects
that coordinate with multiple stakeholders;
and (5) requiring the Secretary to consult
with the Director of NIFA to establish a
training, evaluation, and information center
for use by program grantees and for gener-
ating an annual report to Congress on grant
outcomes based on program data from grant-
ees.
The House bill authorizes mandatory funds
at $45 million for fiscal year 2019, $50 million
for fiscal year 2020, $55 million for fiscal year
2021, $60 million for fiscal year 2022, and $65
million for fiscal year 2023 and each fiscal
year thereafter. Of the mandatory funds
made available, the House provision provides
the training, evaluation, and information
center $2 million for each of fiscal years 2019
and 2020, and $1 million each fiscal year
thereafter. (Section 4003)
The Senate amendment amends section
4405 by (1) renaming the program the Gus
Schumacher Food Insecurity Nutrition In-
centive; (2) making certain definition
changes, including amending the definition
of ‘‘supplemental nutrition assistance pro-
gram’’ to include programs for nutrition as-
sistance under section 19 of the FNA; (3)
specifying that grantees may partner with or
make subgrants to public, private, nonprofit,
or for-profit entities; (4) providing authority
to the Secretary to allow a tribal agency to
use certain types of federal funds for the
non-federal program match; (5) requiring
that projects must increase the purchase of
fruits and vegetables by SNAP participants
by providing an incentive for the purchase of
fruits and vegetables at the point of pur-
chase to a household purchasing food with
SNAP benefits, and that projects (excepting
those receiving $100,000 or less) measure the
purchase of fruits and vegetables by SNAP
participants; (6) striking the independent
evaluation requirement and requiring
projects have adequate plans to collect data
for reporting and share information with the
Training and Technical Assistance Centers
and Information and Evaluation Centers; (7)
updating program priorities; (8) authorizing
Training and Technical Assistance Centers
to assist grantees and subgrantees, including
entities applying for a grant or subgrant;
and (9) authorizing Information and Evalua-
tion Centers to collect program data and pre-
pare an annual report with project outcomes
to submit to the Secretary.
The Senate amendment authorizes $50 mil-
lion of mandatory funds for fiscal year 2019
and each fiscal year thereafter. Of the man-
datory funds made available, the Senate pro-
vision authorizes a cost cap of 15 percent for
carrying out the Training and Technical As-
sistance Centers and the Information and
Evaluation Centers and program administra-
tive costs. (Section 4303)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments that (1)
rename the program ‘‘The Gus Schumacher
Nutrition Incentive Program’’; (2) make cer-
tain definition changes, including amending
the definition of ‘‘supplemental nutrition as-
sistance program’’ to include programs for
nutrition assistance under section 19 of the
FNA; (3) specify that grantees may partner
with or make subgrants to public, private,
nonprofit, or for-profit entities; (4) provide
authority to the Secretary to allow a tribal
agency to use certain types of federal funds
for the non-federal program match; (5) strike
the limitation of program incentives to fi-
nancial incentives, and require instead that
projects must increase purchase of fruits and
vegetables by SNAP participants by pro-
viding an incentive for the purchase of fruits
and vegetables at point of purchase to a
household purchasing food with SNAP bene-
fits, and that projects (excepting those re-
ceiving $100,000 or less over 1 year) measure
the purchase of fruits and vegetables by
SNAP participants; (6) strike the inde-
pendent evaluation requirement and require
that projects have adequate plans to collect
data for reporting and share information
with the Nutrition Incentive Program Train-
ing, Technical Assistance, Evaluation, and
Information Centers; (7) require the Sec-
retary to consult with the Director of NIFA
to establish 1 or more Nutrition Incentive
Program Training, Technical Assistance,
Evaluation, and Information Centers to as-
sist grantees and applicants, and to collect
project data and generate an annual report
with grant outcomes to submit to Congress;
(8) establish a produce prescription program
to improve dietary health through increased
consumption of fruits and vegetables; (9) pro-
vide mandatory funding of $45,000,000 for fis-
cal year 2019, $48,000,000 for each of fiscal
years 2020 and 2021, $53,000,000 for fiscal year
2022, and $56,000,000 for fiscal year 2023 and
each fiscal year thereafter; (10) set a cost cap
of $17,000,000 total for fiscal years 2019 and
2020 and $7,000,000 for fiscal years 2021
through 2023 for the Nutrition Incentive Pro-
gram Training, Technical Assistance, Eval-
uation, and Information Centers; and (11) of
the annual funding provided for fiscal years
2019 through 2023, limit funds to not more
than 10 percent for produce prescriptions and
8 percent for administration. (Section 4205)
The Managers note the success of the Food
Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) pro-
gram established by the Agricultural Act of
2014. Building on that success, the Managers
establish permanent funding and authority
for FINI. This section also establishes one or
more training, evaluation, and information
centers to provide information and support
as FINI continues to expand.
The Managers believe it is important that
information and results of FINI-funded pro-
grams be made available to Congress, USDA
agencies, researchers, grantees and the pub-
lic. Collecting information should not, how-
ever, be duplicative or place such an admin-
istrative burden on grantees that it inter-
feres with their ability to effectively imple-
ment SNAP produce incentive programs. The
Managers intend for the Information and
Evaluation Center/s to collect standard data
from FINI grantees, facilitate grantees’ pro-
duction of NIFA annual reports, and create a
website on which program information is
easily searchable. This should be done in a
manner that also protects the privacy of
SNAP participants and retail food stores.
The Managers encourage the Secretary to
consult with past FINI program managers on
the data to collect, collection instruments,
and website design.
The Managers also intend for the Training
and Technical Assistance (T&TA) Center/s to
develop best practices and ensure that infor-
mation and supportive services are available
to all regions and types of communities, in-
cluding areas that are geographically remote
or lack strong public or private institutional
infrastructure upon which grantees can rely
for technical support.
The Managers are aware that software and
point of sale equipment to facilitate incen-
tive transactions can be costly. The Man-
agers encourage T&TA Center/s to cooperate
with FNS and grocery, farm, and electronic
payment groups to develop or adapt existing
systems/technology and make options avail-
able to current and future FINI grantees.
The Managers also agree the FINI and
Produce Prescription should be renamed the
Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Pro-
gram, in recognition of Mr. Schumacher’s
role in the establishment of nutrition incen-
tives nationwide. Mr. Schumacher was a
magnificent advocate for farmers and fami-
lies and saw the importance in building ac-
cess and affordability through incentive pro-
grams.
(45) Harvesting health pilot projects
The Senate amendment provides $4 million
of mandatory funds for each fiscal year 2019
through 2023 to establish a pilot project for
nonprofit organizations or State or local
agencies to partner with healthcare pro-
viders to prescribe fresh fruits and vegeta-
bles or provide to certain low-income indi-
viduals that suffer from, or are at-risk of de-
veloping a diet-related health conditions.
(Section 4304)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments to (1) estab-
lish a produce prescription program instead
of a pilot project; (2) require eligible entities
participating in the produce prescription
program to agree to share information with
the Nutrition Incentive Program Training,
Technical Assistance, Evaluation, and Infor-
mation Centers; (3) allow not more than 10
percent of funds made available for the Gus
Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program to
carry out the produce prescription program;
(4) make technical changes; and (5) incor-
porate language for this provision into a sin-
gle section as part of the Gus Schumacher
Nutrition Incentive Program. (Section 4205)
Previously, produce prescription projects
have been eligible for funding through the
FINI program. While similar in concept,
these programs are often different in imple-
mentation and goals. The Managers chose to
establish a separate produce prescription
program with dedicated funding to increase
coordination with the healthcare community
and better evaluate the impact of these
types of projects on dietary health, food se-
curity, and health care use and costs. Be-
cause produce prescription programs do not
always require a purchase, the Managers do
not intend that the procedure established by

The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provisions.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 5403)
The Managers intent for repealing section
4.21 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 is to re-
move the statutory limitation on the com-
pensation of the members of the boards of di-
rectors of Farm Credit System Banks. How-

tem Banks in carrying out FCA’s obligations
to regulate and supervise Farm Credit Sys-
tem Banks.

which established the Farm Credit System
Financial Assistance Board. (Sections 5501 &

ate Amendment repeals Title VI of the 1971

tem Financial Assistance Corporation. (Sec-

ceivership and conservatorship authorities
comparable to those of other Federal finan-
cial regulators, including the Federal De-
posit Insurance Corporation, National Credit
Union Administration, and the Federal
Housing Finance Agency. The provision
clarifies FCSIC’s treatment of ‘‘qualified fi-
nancial contracts’’ (including securities con-
tracts, commodity contracts, swap agree-
ments, and derivatives) in its role as re-
ceiver, and authorizes FCSIC and the Farm
Credit Administration to create a bridge
bank to assist in addressing a situation
where one or more System banks are in de-
fault or are anticipated to go into default.

poration being appointed as a conservator or
receiver of a System institution. The Man-
agers intend for the authorities of the Cor-
poration to be functionally equivalent to the
parallel authorities of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.
(23) Reporting
The Senate amendment requires the Sec-
retary of Agriculture to prepare an annual
report to Congress that identifies certain
characteristics with respect to borrowers of
farm loans made and guaranteed, the bor-
rowers’ operations, and other data, for each

(25) Study on Loan Risk
The House bill requires the Farm Credit
Administration to conduct a study that: (1)
analyzes and compares the financial risks of
Farm Credit banks, associations, and the
Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation,
and how these risks are required to be cap-
italized; and (2) assesses the feasibility of in-
creasing the acreage exception in section

parable provision.
The Conference substitute does not include
the House provision.
(4) Refinancing of Certain Rural Hospital Debt
The House bill authorizes assistance for a
community facility under section 306(a) for a
business, non-profit or any other entity
under section 310B to include the refinancing
of a debt obligation of a rural hospital as an
eligible loan or loan guarantee purpose if the
assistance would help preserve access to
health service in a rural community and
meaningfully improve the financial position
of the hospital. (Section6005)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment that re-
quires hospitals seeking refinancing to meet
USDA’s financial feasibility and adequacy of
security requirements. (Section 6103)
The Managers emphasize the necessity
that USDA work with rural hospitals to im-
prove their financial health as a part of a re-
financing agreement. The Managers also en-
courage USDA to build on its current tech-
nical assistance efforts to improve the long-
term operations of rural hospitals in order to

forming amendments throughout section 601.
(Section 6206(1)–(2))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to clarify
that the Secretary is required to make
grants, make loans, and guarantee loans to
finance rural broadband projects. (Section
6201)
In implementing the Guaranteed Loan Pro-
gram to help expand broadband access in
rural areas, the Managers encourage RUS to
consider development of a certified lender
program that will encourage public-private
partnerships and expedite investment into
rural broadband infrastructure.
(6) Simplified Application Window
The House bill amends section 601(c)(2)(A)
of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to re-
quire the Secretary to establish 1 evaluation
period per year for broadband loan program
applications. (Section 6108)

ate provision with an amendment clarifying
that the most unserved communities are
those without residential broadband service
of at least 10 Mbps downstream transmission
capacity and 1 Mbps upstream transmission
capacity. (Section 6201)
(8) Fees for Guaranteed Broadband Loans
The House bill amends section 601(c) of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to require
the Secretary to collect fees on loan guaran-
tees in amounts that when combined with
any appropriated funds equal the subsidy on
such guarantees. (Section 6203(b))
The Senate amendment is substantially
similar to the House bill. The Senate amend-
ment amends section 601(c) to require the
Secretary to charge lenders of guaranteed
loans a fee to offset subsidy costs. (Section
6117(b))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to require
the Secretary to charge and collect fees from
lenders in such amounts as to bring down the
cost of subsidies for guaranteed loans, but
that do not act as a bar to participation in
the program. (Section 6201)
(9) Access to Broadband Telecommunications
Services in Rural Areas; Broadband Stand-
ards; Grants
The House bill amends section
601(d)(1)(A)(i) to require broadband loan or
loan guarantee applicants to demonstrate
the ability to furnish or improve service in
order to meet the new broadband service
standards established under section 6101 of
the House Bill in all or part of an unserved
or underserved rural area. (Section 6101(a)(1))

The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with technical amendments.
(Section 6201)
(11) Access to Broadband Telecommunications
Services in Rural Areas; Unserved Area, In-
cumbent Service Providers
The Senate amendment amends section
601(d)(2)(A) of the Rural Electrification Act
of 1936 to: (1) increase from 15 percent to 90
percent the share of households in a proposed
service area that must be unserved or have
service levels below the minimum acceptable
service level of fixed broadband service,
whether terrestrial or wireless; and (2) re-
duce from 3 to 2 the number of incumbent
service providers in any part of the proposed
service area that would make the area ineli-
gible for financing. (Section 6206(3)(B))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment increasing
from 15 percent to 90 percent the share of
households in a proposed service area that
must be unserved for broadband projects
funded by grants, loan/grant combinations,
loans with subsidized interest rates, and pay-
ment assistance loans. The amendment in-
creases from 15 percent to 50 percent the
share of households in a proposed service
area that must be unserved for broadband
projects funded by loans or loan guarantees.
The amendment does not adopt the Senate
provision decreasing the number of incum-
bent service providers. (Section 6201)
(12) Access to Broadband Telecommunications
Services in Rural Areas; Application Process
The Senate amendment amends section
601(d)(7) to: (1) require the Secretary to pro-
vide feedback and decisions on funding to an
applicant of a grant, loan, or loan guarantee
in a timely manner; (2) clarify that in addi-
tion to a determination of area eligibility
prior to preparing a loan application, a pro-
spective applicant may also submit to the
Secretary a proposal for a project on which
the Secretary shall provide feedback regard-
ing how the proposal could be changed to im-
prove the likelihood that the Secretary
would approve the application. (Section
6206(3)(H)–(I))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that speci-
fies that only applicants proposing to serve
communities without residential broadband
service of at least 10 Mbps downstream
transmission capacity and 1 Mbps upstream
transmission capacity are eligible for tech-
nical assistance and training. (Section 6201)
(13) Elimination of Unnecessary Reporting Re-
quirements
The House bill: amends section
601(d)(8)(A)(ii) to eliminate reporting re-
quirements with respect to: (1) the location
of residences and businesses that will receive
broadband service; and (2) changes in
broadband service adoption rates. (Section
6112)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provisions.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment cre-
ating new reporting requirements for all
USDA broadband projects. (Section 6207)
(14) Establishing Forward-Looking Broadband
Standards/Access to Broadband Tele-
communications Services in Rural Areas
The House bill amends Section 601(e) of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to require

and (2) projections of minimum acceptable
standards of service for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30
years into the future. The amendment fur-
ther prohibits the Secretary from making
any loan to finance a project that the Sec-
retary determines cannot meet the projected
minimum acceptable standard of service at
any time while the loan or loan guarantee is
outstanding. The amendment allows the Sec-
retary and the applicant to agree to sub-
stitute standards if the standards are cost-
prohibitive to meet.
The House bill also provides that, to the
extent possible, the loan terms and condi-
tions require for the lifetime of the loan that
the project will be capable of meeting either
the minimum standard currently in effect or
the projected standard in place at the time
the loan was agreed to. (Section 6101(a)(2)–
(3))
The Senate amendment amends Section
601(e) of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936
to codify USDA’s current definition of min-
imum acceptable broadband service of 25
Mbps downstream transmission capacity and
3Mbps upstream transmission capacity. (Sec-
tion 6206(4))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment modi-
fying the broadband buildout requirements
that the Secretary shall establish for
projects with agreement lengths of 5 to 10
years, 11 to 15 years, 16 to 20 years, and more
than 20 years. (Section 6201)
The Managers are acutely aware of the
challenges created by the ever-increasing
bandwidth needs of applications running
over the Internet. These bandwidth needs
mean that the expectation for ‘‘broadband-
quality service’’ in urban, suburban, and
rural communities increases over time.
While protecting project areas provided as-
sistance from a competing USDA-assisted
project is essential for program integrity,
such protections can result in a lack of fur-
ther investment in rural broadband systems
and rural residents receiving levels of service
which degrade relative to expectations over
time.
In establishing the broadband buildout
speeds, the Managers intend the Secretary
establish requirements for applicants to
build systems capable of providing higher
quality broadband service as the term of as-
sistance lengthens, to help to ensure that
USDA-financed broadband systems are able
to meet the connectivity needs of rural resi-
dents for the entirety of the length of time
such system is protected from overbuilding
under USDA’s broadband programs.
(15) Improving Access by Providing Certainty to
Broadband Borrowers
The House bill amends title II of the Rural
Electrification Act of 1936 to permit the Sec-
retary to obligate, but not disperse, funds
under section 601 to approved applications
while conditioning the disbursement of funds
on the successful completion of environ-
mental, historic, or other reviews. Further,
it permits the Secretary to de-obligate funds
if the reviews cannot be completed in a rea-
sonable amount of time.
The House bill amends section 601(d) of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to permit
the Secretary to obligate, but not disperse,
funds under section 601 to approved applica-
tions while conditioning the disbursement of
funds on the successful completion of envi-
ronmental, historic, or other reviews. Fur-
ther, it permits the Secretary to de- obligate
funds if the reviews cannot be completed in
a reasonable amount of time. (Section 6107)
The Senate amendment amends section 601
of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to au-
thorize the Secretary to obligate, but not
disperse, funds under this Act before the
completion of otherwise required environ-
mental, historical, or other types of reviews
if the Secretary determines that a subse-
quent site-specific review shall be adequate
and easily accomplished for the location of
towers, poles, or other broadband facilities
in the service area of the borrower without
compromising the project or the required re-
views.
The Senate Amendment also amends sec-
tion 601 of the Rural Electrification Act of
1936 to require, as a condition of receiving a
grant, loan, or loan guarantee, a recipient of
assistance to provide to the Secretary com-
plete, reliable, and precise geolocation that
indicates the location of new broadband serv-
ice that is being provided or upgraded within
the service territory supported by the grant,
loan, or loan guarantee at specified times.
(Section 6206(8))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that
moves the language dealing with geolocation
data to the new section requiring public no-
tice, assessments, and reporting. (Sections
6207 and 6208)
(16) Improving Borrower Refinancing Options/
Refinancing of Broadband
The House bill amends section 601(i) of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to permit
the Broadband Loan Program to refinance
telecommunications loans other than those
made under the Act. (Section 6111(b))
The Senate amendment amends section
601(i) of the rural Electrification Act of 1936
to provide RUS the authority to refinance
telephone and broadband loans other than
those made under the Act. (Section 6209(b))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision as a new section 703 of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936. (Section
6209)
(17) Unified Broadband Reporting Requirements
The House bill amends section 601(j) and
(k)(2) of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936
to require the Secretary to submit a single
report to Congress describing all the
broadband financing activities administered
by the Secretary including the loans, loan
guarantees, and grants applied for and pro-
vided under the programs. (Section 6106)
The Senate amendment amends section
601(j) of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936
to add grants to the reporting requirements
(Section 6206(6))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision (Section 6207).
In adopting a substitute amendment, the
Managers have established a single process
for reporting across multiple USDA
broadband programs. The amendment will
ensure that applicants will be reporting
similar, comparable data to the Secretary.
The amendment similarly requires the Sec-
retary to combine that data into a single re-
port to Congress which covers the entirety of
the Department’s broadband assistance ac-
tivities.
In addition, the substitute amendment
combines in a single section these reporting
requirements with the amended notice and
assessment requirements. The Managers rec-
ognize that these two processes—one pre-ap-
plication and one post-application—are
interrelated and each are essential to pro-
moting program integrity. The Managers in-
tend for the Secretary to establish require-
ments which are complementary, wherever
possible, both to facilitate implementation
and to ease compliance for applicants and
existing providers.
Finally, the Managers recognize the impor-
tance of oversight and integrity within the
broadband programs, as well as the signifi-
cant work entailed in verifying the eligi-
bility of unserved communities. To that end,
the Conference report provides significant
resources to the Secretary to carry out over-
sight of the broadband programs. These
funds shall be utilized without distinction to
provide oversight across all of the broadband
programs that the Secretary administers.
(18) Access to Broadband Telecommunications
Services in Rural Areas
The House bill amends section 601(k) of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 by increas-
ing the authorization of appropriations to
$150 million for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023 and reauthorizing the program
through fiscal year 2023.
The House bill also amends section 601(l) of
the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to ex-
tend the termination of authority to make
loans and loan guarantees until September
30, 2023. (Section 6113)
The Senate amendment amends section
601(m) of the Rural Electrification Act of
1936 (as redesignated) to: (1) increase the au-
thorization of appropriations to $150,000,000
for each of the fiscal years 2019 through 2023
and reauthorizing the program through fis-
cal year 2023 (same as the House Bill); and (2)
require the Secretary, from amounts made
available each fiscal year, to set aside at
least 1 percent to be used for conducting
oversight and implementing accountability
measures.
The Senate amendment also amends sec-
tion 601(n) of the Rural Electrification Act of
1936 as redesignated) to extend the termi-
nation of authority to make grants, loans,
and loan guarantees until September 30, 2023.
(Section 6206(9)–(10))
The Conference substitute provides an
amendment increasing the authorization of
appropriations to $350 million for each of fis-
cal years 2019 through 2023 and sets aside be-
tween 3 and 5 percent of program level
amounts for conducting oversight and imple-
menting accountability measures for the
Farm Bill Broadband Program and Commu-
nity Connect projects. (Sections 6201 and
6207)
(19) Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure
The House bill amends section 601 of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to authorize
loans to eligible entities for the development
of ‘‘middle-mile’’ broadband infrastructure,
defined as infrastructure that does not di-
rectly connect to end user locations, includ-
ing interoffice transport, backhaul, Internet
connectivity, data centers, or special access
transport to rural areas. Loans and loan
guarantees for middle-mile infrastructure
are limited to no more than 20% of the
amounts made available under section 601.
(Section 6114)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to
amend section 602 of the Rural Electrifica-
tion Act of 1936 to require the Secretary to
use grant funding as well as loans and loan
guarantees to provide funds for the construc-
tion, improvement, or acquisition of middle-
mile infrastructure to serve rural areas, and
to require that at least 75 percent of the
interconnection points of a project serve eli-
gible rural areas. The amendment also au-
thorizes appropriations of $10 million for
each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. (Sec-
tion 6202)

Consolidated Farm and Rural Development
Act to allow a recipient of certain grants,
loans, or loan guarantees to use not more
than 10 percent of the amount for rural
broadband infrastructure projects, including
both retail and non-retail activities, except
for a recipient who is seeking to provide re-
tail broadband service in any area where re-
tail broadband service is available at the
minimum broadband speeds.
The House bill also amends Title I of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to allow a
recipient of certain grants, loans or loan
guarantees to set aside not more than 10 per-
cent of the amount for retail broadband serv-
ice, for use only in an area that is not being
provided with the minimum acceptable level
of broadband service. (Section 6104)
The Senate amendment amends section 331
of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Develop-
ment Act to allow for no more than 10% of
any Rural Development grant, loan, or loan
guarantee to be used to fund broadband fa-
cilities and service, provided that the fund-
ing will not result in competitive harm to
any existing grant, loan, or loan guarantee.
(Section 6116)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment requir-
ing that the funding not result in competi-
tive harm to any existing grant, loan, or

tion Act of 1936, under certain cir-
cumstances. (Section 6210)
The Managers intend that USDA not au-
thorize funding for the construction of any
retail broadband project that would result in
competitive harm to any USDA grant, loan,
or loan guarantee.
(22) Modifications to the Rural Gigabit Program
The House bill amends section 603 of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to amend
the Rural Gigabit Network Pilot Program
and replace it with the Innovative
Broadband Advancement Program to provide
grants, loans or both to eligible entities for

tablished by the Rural Utilities Service (Sec-
tion 6105)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment requir-
ing projects to provide broadband speeds of
at least the maximum broadband buildout
requirements established under section
601(e)(4) of the Rural Electrification Act of
1936, as amended. (Section 6203)
(23) Incentives for Hard to Reach Communities
The House bill amends Title VI of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to add a
new section 604 of the Rural Electrification
Act to create a grant program for borrowers
under Title I, II, or VI of the Rural Elec-
trification Act who are financing rural
broadband projects that provide retail serv-
ice.
The House bill also establishes a method
for calculating service points per road mile
as a density measure. Eligible applicants are
those areas with a density of 12 or fewer
homes, businesses, or institutions per mile of
road in a proposed service area. The bill also
authorizes appropriations of $350 million for
each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. (Sec-
tion 6102)

House provision’s authorization of appropria-
tions. (Section 6201)
The Conference report includes significant
new authority for the Secretary to provide
grants to applicants to extend broadband
service deeper into rural communities. The
Managers are mindful of past broadband
grant programs which have occasionally re-
sulted in grants to providers who fail to
meet their obligations under their grant
agreements. The Managers recognize the
work that the Department has undertaken in
an attempt to recover taxpayer dollars in
those instances and to continue to improve
the ability for the department to hold grant-
ees accountable for the entirety of their obli-
gations. To further this work, the Managers
intend that any agreements the Secretary
executes with grant applicants include terms
which:
1. Require that the project meet all statu-
tory and regulatory service requirements
agreed to as part of the application process,
including the broadband buildout require-
ments, if applicable;
2. Require the repayment of the grant if
the project is sold or transferred without
agency approval during the term of the
grant; and
3. Provide the government a first lien on
the grant assets during the term of the grant
and thereafter comply with the applicable
federal regulations under the Uniform Ad-
ministrative Requirements, Cost Principles,
And Audit Requirements For Federal
Awards, codified in 2 C.F.R. 200.
(24) Community Connect Program

the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to cod-
ify the existing Community Connect Pro-
gram, while authorizing the program at
$50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023. (Section 6207)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 6204)
(25) Outdated Broadband Systems
The House bill adds a new section 605 to
the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to pro-
vide that beginning October 1, 2020, the Sec-
retary shall consider as unserved for the pur-
poses of all broadband loan programs under
this Act any portion of a service territory
subject to an outstanding grant agreement
with a broadband provider if the broadband
service provided is not at least 10 megabits
per second download and at least 1 megabit
per second upload, unless the broadband pro-
vider has constructed or begun to construct
broadband facilities in the service territory
that meet the minimum acceptable standard
of service established under section 601(e)(1).
(Section 6115)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision as a new section 604 of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936. (Section
6204)
(26) Refinancing of Broadband and Telephone
Loans
The House bill amends section 201 of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to clarify
that the Secretary, through the RUS tele-
phone loan program, may refinance
broadband loans made under section 601 of
the Act. (Section 6111(a))
The Senate amendment amends Section 201
of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to
clarify that the Secretary, through the RUS
telephone loan program, may refinance loans
of persons furnishing telephone service in
rural areas, including indebtedness of recipi-
ents on another telecommunications loan
made under the Act.
The Senate amendment also strikes the
current law limitation that the refinancing
may not constitute more than 40% of a loan
made under Title II of the Act. (Section
6209(a))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 6211)
The Managers intend for Section 6211, refi-
nancing of loans, that an existing loan may
be refinanced using the Substantially Under-
served Trust Area program when it is deter-
mined to be appropriate. The recipients of
these loans are serving the most difficult,
and highest cost areas of the country, and al-
lowing for the refinancing of higher interest
loans will provide the ability for these tele-
communications carriers to continue to
build high-speed broadband networks.
The Managers expect that the new refi-
nancing authority gives the Department the
ability to issue a new loan with new terms
with the proceeds being used to repay or pre-
pay an existing loan. These transactions
should be not be considered loan modifica-
tions.
Within 90 days of enactment, USDA should
publish a notice detailing implementation of
the re-financing provisions in Section 6211.
(27) Federal Broadband Program Coordination
The House bill directs the Secretary of Ag-
riculture to coordinate with the Assistant
Secretary of the National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administration for
assessment and mapping capabilities. The
Secretary will consult with the Federal Com-
munications Commission (FCC) before mak-
ing a broadband loan or grant for a project
to serve an area in which another entity is
receiving Connect America Fund or Mobility
Fund support under the federal universal
service support mechanism. The Chairman of
the FCC shall consult with the Secretary be-
fore providing support in an area where an
entity has received assistance from USDA.
The Secretary, FCC, and the Assistant Sec-
retary shall submit a report to the Congres-
sional committees assessing its abilities to
meet various objectives regarding long-term
broadband service needs of rural residents.
(Section 6116)
The Senate amendment amends section
601(d)(1) of the Rural Electrification Act of
1936 to require the Secretary to coordinate
with the Federal Communications Commis-
sion to ensure that any grants, loans, or loan
guarantees made under this section com-
plement and do not conflict with universal
service high-cost support. (Section
6206(3)(A)(ii))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 6212)
(28) Effective Date
The House bill provides that amendments
made by subtitle B of the House Bill shall
not take effect until the Secretary of Agri-
culture has issued final regulations to imple-
ment the amendments.
The House bill also requires that within 90
days of the enactment the Secretary shall
prescribe final regulations to implement the
amendments made by sections 6101
(broadband standards) and 6102 (incentives
for hard to reach communities). (Section
6117)
The Senate Amendment contains no com-
parable provision.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9991
December 10, 2018
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment giving
the Secretary one year to issue a final rule
implementing the amendments made to Sec-
tion 601 of the Rural Electrification Act of
1936. (Section 6213)
(29) Strategic Economic and Community Devel-
opment
The House bill amends section 379H in its
entirety to require the Secretary to: (1) give
priority to applications for programs that
support implementation of a strategic com-
munity investment plan; (2) reserve a por-
tion of funds for projects that support the
implementation of a strategic community
investment plan; and (3) set forth the re-
quirements for such plans. The bill requires
the Secretary to provide technical assistance
to communities in developing strategic com-
munity investment plans and authorizes ap-
propriations of $5 million for each of fiscal
years 2018 through 2023 to provide the tech-
nical assistance. (Section 6201)
The Senate amendment amends section
379H in its entirety to require the Secretary
to: (1) give priority to applications for pro-
grams that support implementation of a
strategic community investment plan; (2) re-
serve not more than 10 percent of funds for
projects that support the implementation of
a strategic community investment plan; and
(3) set forth the requirements for such plans.
The amendment also requires the Secretary
to provide technical assistance to commu-
nities in developing strategic community in-
vestment plans and authorizes appropria-
tions of $5 million for each of fiscal years
2019 through 2023 to provide the technical as-
sistance. (Section 6123)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment increasing
the reserve to not more than 15 percent of
funds for projects. (Section 6401)
(30) Expanding Access to Credit for Rural Com-
munities
The House bill amends the definition of
‘‘rural and ‘‘rural area’’ under section
343(a)(13) of the Consolidated Farm and
Rural Development Act to provide that a
city or town that has a population of up to
50,000 inhabitants is eligible for loan guaran-
tees for water, wastewater, and essential
community facilities.
The bill also amends the definition of
‘‘rural area’’ in section 601(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to provide
that a city or town that has a population of
up to 50,000 inhabitants is eligible for guar-
anteed loans in the rural broadband pro-
gram. (Section 6202)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to re-
serve funding for Community Facilities ap-
plications for projects in communities with
populations of 20,000 people or less, and to
prioritize Water and Wastewater Facility ap-
plications for projects in communities with
populations of 10,000 people or less. (Section
6402)
The Conference report expands the size of
rural communities eligible to seek assist-
ance under the guaranteed lending authori-
ties of the Community Facilities and Water
and Waste Disposal programs. In order to
meet the needs of the enlarged class of bor-
rowers under these programs, the Managers
believe it is important to make commensu-
rate increases in the program levels of these
programs, where appropriate.
The Secretary should utilize the authority
provided under Section 6418 to charge fees to
lenders to reduce the subsidy cost of oper-
ating these programs in order to provide ad-
ditional assistance to rural communities at a
reduced cost to the taxpayer. The Managers
encourage the Secretary to work closely
with rural communities, rural lenders, and
the relevant committees in Congress as the
Department utilizes the new guaranteed
lending authorities provided in this bill.
In addition, as the volume of lending in-
creases under the guaranteed lending pro-
grams, the Managers recognize the need for
the Department to streamline the approval
process. The Managers encourage the Sec-
retary to find ways to make application re-
views more efficient and more standardized.
In addition to technology, process, and re-
gionalization improvements that can be
made, the Managers also believe that uti-
lizing the authorities of Sec 364 of the Con-
solidated Farm and Rural Development Act
(7 U.S.C. 1926(a)) to develop certified lender
programs will encourage public-private part-
nerships and expedite investment into rural
infrastructure.
(31) Guaranteed Loan Fees
The House bill amends section 333 of the
Consolidated Farm and Rural Development
Act to require the Secretary to collect fees
on insured or guaranteed loans in amounts
that when combined with any appropriated
funds equal the subsidy on such loans. (Sec-
tion 6203(a))
The Senate amendment amends section 333
of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Develop-
ment Act to require the Secretary to charge
lenders of guaranteed loans a fee to offset
subsidy costs. (Section 6117(a))
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to pro-
vide that the Secretary charge and collect
from the lender fees in such amounts as to
bring down the costs of subsidies for the in-
sured or guaranteed loan, except that the
fees shall not act as a bar to participation in
the programs nor be inconsistent with cur-
rent practices in the marketplace. (Section
6418)
Guaranteed lending programs are impor-
tant to meeting credit needs of rural bor-
rowers who are unable to qualify for conven-
tional credit. The Managers believe a modest
increase in fees in the Community Facilities
and Water and Waste Disposal programs can
achieve a zero-subsidy rate and potentially
minimize or eliminate the need for future
appropriations while increasing the volume
of loans extended to rural communities.
However, the Managers are also mindful that
guaranteed lending under these programs
serves a public policy purpose and encour-
ages the Secretary to work with the Com-
mittees on Appropriations to establish a fee
structure, annual appropriations amount,
and program level appropriate to achieve
that purpose.
To assist in determining the appropriate
fee structure and to examine the potential to
reduce subsidy rates under other guaranteed
lending programs, the Managers direct the
Secretary to conduct a study of several guar-
anteed lending programs to clarify the ex-
tent of necessary fee increases; the impact
on loan volume; whether fee increases could
be structured to minimize impact on smaller
lenders and borrowers; and how to better en-
hance credit terms for future borrowers,
lenders and secondary market participants.
In conducting the study, the Secretary shall
consult with a range of stakeholders uti-
lizing each program from across the rural
lending community, including: rural commu-
nity leaders, borrowers, rural banking insti-
tutions, rural credit unions, Farm Credit in-
stitutions, secondary market participants,
and other interested stakeholders.
No later than September 30, 2019, the Sec-
retary shall submit to the Committee on Ag-
riculture of the House of Representatives
and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutri-
tion and Forestry of the Senate a report ana-
lyzing guaranteed lending under the Commu-
nity Facilities, Water and Waste Disposal,
Broadband Access, Business and Industry,
and Rural Energy for America programs to
determine:
1. The level to which the origination fee
and annual renewal fees would need to be
raised in order to:
a. achieve a zero-subsidy level
b. reduce the subsidy rate to a level which
will not act as a bar to participation in the
programs nor be inconsistent with current
practices in the marketplace;
2. The projected loan volume and the pro-
jected appropriations amount necessary to
support that program level for each program
under the fee structures described in 1.
3. Whether such fees would prevent partici-
pation by smaller lenders and borrowers.
4. Whether participation under a zero-sub-
sidy structure could be increased by charg-
ing higher fees for larger loans and lower
fees for smaller loans and, if so, what level of
fees and loan sizes would achieve higher par-
ticipation.
5. How subsidy rates are formulated for in-
dividual guaranteed lending programs and
how to enhance subsidy rate formulation to
reflect performance of each program.
6. Differences between USDA and SBA loan
processes and whether USDA could expedite
loan processing and ensure consistency be-
tween area service centers, states and na-
tional offices.
7. Whether a transition period is necessary
to shift USDA’s guaranteed programs to a
zero-subsidy structure without diminishing
existing loan volume.
8. Other actions the department could take
to reduce the subsidy cost of running guar-
anteed lending programs, besides increasing
fees, including a quantification of the esti-
mated effects of such changes.
(32) Water, Waste Disposal, and Wastewater Fa-
cility Grants
The House bill amends section 306(a)(2)(B)
to increase the maximum amount of financ-
ing an eligible entity can receive from a re-
volving fund from $100,000 to $200,000. The
bill reauthorizes the program for fiscal years
2019 through 2023. The bill also decreases the
authorization of appropriations from $30 mil-
lion to $15 million per fiscal year. (Section
6204)
The Senate amendment is similar to the
House bill and reauthorizes the program
through fiscal year 2023. (Section 6101)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 6403)
(33) Rural Water and Wastewater Technical As-
sistance and Training Programs
The House bill amends section 306(a)(14)(A)
to permit the Secretary to provide grants to
entities which assist eligible rural water sys-
tems with long term sustainability planning.
The bill also amends section 306(a)(14)(C) to
increase the set-aside of funds for technical
assistance to 3 to 5 percent of funds appro-
priated for rural water and waste grants
under section 306(a)(2), unless applications
qualifying for grants received by the Sec-
retary from eligible nonprofit organizations
for the fiscal year total less than 1% of those
funds. (Section 6205)
The Senate amendment is the same as the
House bill. The amendment also amends Sec-
tion 306(a)(14)(B) to add a priority for rural
water technical assistance and training to
communities affected by emerging contami-
nants detected in drinking water and surface
water supplies.
The Senate amendment amends section
306(a)(14)(C) to increase the set-aside of funds
for technical assistance up to 3–to–5 percent
of funds appropriated for rural water and
waste grants under section 306(a)(2), unless
applications qualifying for grants received

by the Secretary from eligible nonprofit or-
ganizations for the fiscal year total less than
3% of those funds. (Section 6102)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to change
the priority to an eligible activity under the
technical assistance program. (Section 6404)
The Managers encourage the Secretary to
allow for national applications without re-
strictions or award caps for funding under
the Essential Community Facilities Tech-
nical Assistance and Training Program from
qualified national non-profit organizations
for the sole purpose of providing on-site
training and technical assistance on a na-
tional or multi-State regional basis. The
Managers note there are no restrictions on
funding awards prescribed in the authorizing
statute of the program (Sec. 6006 of the Agri-
cultural Act of 2014) (P.L. 113–79). The Man-
agers modeled the program after the Water
and Waste Disposal Technical Assistance and
Training Program (306)(a)(14) of the Consoli-
dated Farm and Rural Development Act (7
U.S.C. 1926(a)(14)), which does not prescribe
any caps or restrictions on funding. The
Managers intend that applications not be
limited to $150,000 for national and multi-
state non-profit applications, but rather be
considered for an amount of no less than
$500,000 to provide community facilities
technical assistance and training on a na-
tional or multi-state basis.
The Managers recognize that the scientific
understanding of the wide variety of emerg-
ing contaminants, including the broad cat-
egory of substances identified as per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), is con-
tinuing to develop and not yet mature. The
Department and technical assistance pro-
viders should utilize the best available
science and rely on the determinations pro-
duced by the Environmental Protection
Agency when advising eligible water systems
about emerging contaminants under this sec-
tion.
(34) Rural Water and Wastewater Circuit Rider
Program
The House bill amends section 306(a)(22)(B)
to increase the authorization of appropria-
tions to $25 million for FY2018 and each FY
thereafter. (Section 6206)
The Senate bill amends section
306(a)(22)(B) to increase the authorization of
appropriations to $25 million for each of fis-
cal years 2019 through 2023. (Section 6103)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 6405)
(35) Tribal college and University Essential
Community Facilities
The House bill amends section 306(a)(25)(C)

tions to $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023. (Section 6207)
The Senate Amendment reauthorizes the
Tribal College and University Essential
Community Facilities Program through fis-
cal year 2023. (Section 6104)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 6406)
(36) Business Innovation Services Essential
Community Facilities
The Senate amendment amends section
306(a) to authorize the Secretary to make
grants and loans for essential community fa-
cilities for business and innovation services,
such as incubators, co-working spaces,
makerspaces, and residential entrepreneur
and innovation centers. (Section 12618)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute does not adopt
the Senate provision.
The Managers recognize the need for addi-
tional financial support for community fa-
cilities that support rural businesses and in-
novation, and make clear that the Secretary
may use programs authorized under 306(a) of
the Consolidated Farm and Rural Develop-
ment Act (7 U.S.C. 1926(a)) to make loans,
loan guarantees, and grants for essential
community facilities for business and inno-
vation services, such as incubators, co-work-
ing spaces, makerspaces, and residential en-
trepreneur and innovation centers.
(37) Emergency and Imminent Community Water
Assistance Grant Program (ECWAG)
The House bill amends section 306A to (1)
authorize the Secretary to extend the res-
ervation of funds for an additional 120 days
in order to provide potable water to protect
public health, in the event of a natural dis-
aster (including drought); and (2) authorize
appropriations of $27 million for each of fis-
cal years 2019 through 2023. (Section 6208)
The Senate amendment amends Section
306A of the Consolidated Farm and Rural De-
velopment Act to: (1) increase the amount of
funds reserved for ECWAG grants to between
5 percent and 7 percent of the funds provided
for water and wastewater grants under sec-
tion 306(a)(2); (2) authorize appropriations of
$50 million for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023; (3) prioritize funding of
projects that address water contamination
posing a threat to human health of the envi-
ronment; (4) increase the maximum amount
of a grant to address water quality or quan-
tity decline from $500,000 to $1 million, and:
(5) create an interagency task force to study
drinking water and surface water contamina-
tion in rural communities and submit its
findings to Congress. (Section 6106)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to author-
ize the Secretary to extend the reservation
of funds for an additional 120 days in order to
provide potable water to protect public
health. (Section 6407)
In implementing the amendment made by
this section, the Managers remind the De-
partment that the Environmental Protection
Agency is the lead federal agency charged
with the scientific assessment of potential
drinking water contaminants and regulating
treated drinking water. In making awards
under (b)(1)(A), the Department should con-
tinue to utilize the Agency’s determinations,
or those of relevant state and local regu-
lators, of what poses a threat to human
health or the environment, as required by
Sections 306(a)(9) and (10) of the Consolidated
Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C.
1926(a)).
Additionally, the Department should pro-
vide in its regulations implementing this
program that any entities responsible for
fouling a drinking water supply are not eligi-
ble to be the recipients of an award under
this program.
(38) Water Systems for Rural and Native Vil-
lages in Alaska
The House bill reauthorizes the program
through FY 2023. (Section 6209)
The Senate amendment amends section
306D to reauthorize the program through FY
2023, and to: (1) clarify that a consortium of
Alaska Native Villages are eligible recipi-
ents of these grants; and (2) provide that up
to 2% of the funds appropriated for a fiscal
year may be used by a consortium for train-
ing and technical assistance programs. (Sec-
tion 6107)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 6408)
(39) Household Water Well Systems
The House bill reauthorizes the program
through FY 2023 (Section 6210)
The Senate amendment reauthorizes the
program through FY 2023, increases the au-
thorization of appropriations to $40 million
annually, reduces the eligibility threshold
for households to those whose income is not
more than 60 percent of the median non-
metropolitan household income for the
State, allows for individually owned house-
hold decentralized water and wastewater sys-
tems to qualify, and provides that loans
made with grants/funds shall have an inter-
est rate of 1 percent with a term not to ex-
ceed 20 years and cannot exceed $15,000.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision, with an amendment to in-
crease the authorization of appropriations
from $5 million to $20 million for each of fis-
cal years 2019 through 2023. (Section 6409)
The Managers intend that the Secretary
give priority and work closely with non-
profits having substantial experience in pro-
viding direct technical assistance to low-in-
come homeowners dealing with decentralized
water system issues.
In implementing the amendment made by
this section, the Managers remind the De-
partment that the Environmental Protection
Agency is the lead federal agency charged
with the scientific assessment of potential
drinking water contaminants and regulating
treated drinking water. In making awards
under (4) for ground water well contamina-
tion, the Department should continue to uti-
lize the Agency’s determinations, or those of
relevant state and local regulators, of what
substances are considered contaminants and
pose a threat to human health or the envi-
ronment, as required by Sections 306(a)(9)
and (10) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural
Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1926(a)).
Additionally, the Department should pro-
vide in its regulations implementing this
program that any entities responsible for
fouling a drinking water supply are not eligi-
ble to be the recipients of an award under
this program.

scribed in the Conference substitute for the
working group that makes up a rural jobs ac-
celerator partnership, the Managers intend
an applicant may consider including one or
more representatives of an economic devel-
opment or other community or labor organi-
zation; a financial institution, including a
community development financial institu-
tion (as defined in section 103 of the Commu-
nity Development Banking and Financial In-
stitutions Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4702); a phil-
anthropic organization; or a rural coopera-
tive, if the cooperative is organized as a non-
profit organization.
The Managers intend that in addition to
the selection criteria stipulated in the Con-
ference substitute, an applicant may also be
asked to indicate the speed of available
broadband service or how the jobs accel-
erator plans to improve access to high-speed
broadband service, if necessary, and leverage
that broadband service for programs of the
jobs accelerator. To be selected for a grant
through this program, an applicant should
provide details on the identified industry
cluster in their application, including a de-
scription of data showing the existence of
emergence of an industry cluster; the impor-
tance of the industry cluster to economic
growth in the identified region; the unique
assets the identified region has to support
the industry cluster and to have a competi-
tive advantage in that industry cluster; evi-
dence of a concentration of firms or con-
centration of employees in the industry clus-
ter; and available industry-specific infra-
structure that supports the industry cluster.
The applicant should also provide a descrip-
tion of how the rural jobs accelerator part-
nership would improve the competitiveness
of the identified region, the ability to repa-
triate United States jobs, the fostering of
high-wage job creation, the support of inno-
vation and entrepreneurship, and the pro-
motion of private investment in the identi-
fied regional economy.
The Managers believe the flexible use of
funds through this program is important to
successful rural jobs accelerator partner-
ships. The innovation center that may be
funded through this program may function
as or be used for housing for business owners
or workers; co-working space, which may in-
clude space for remote work; space for busi-
nesses to utilize with a focus on entre-
preneurs and small and disadvantaged busi-
nesses but that may include collaboration
with companies of all sizes; job training pro-
grams; and efforts to utilize the innovation
center as part of the development of a com-
munity downtown, among other uses deemed
appropriate by the Secretary. Support pro-
grams that may be funded through this pro-
gram may include integrating small busi-
nesses into a supply chain; creating or ex-
panding commercialization activities for
new business formation; identifying and
building assets in rural communities that
are crucial to supporting regional econo-
mies; facilitating the repatriation of high-
wage jobs to the United States; supporting
the development of innovative processes,
technologies, and products; enhancing the
capacity of small businesses in regional in-
dustry clusters, including small and dis-
advantaged business; and increasing United
States exports and business interaction with
international buyers and suppliers.
The Managers recognize the need for fed-
eral interagency support of rural jobs accel-
erator partnerships. Beyond the Secretary of
Commerce (or a designee) and the Secretary
of Agriculture (or a designee) co-chairing the
task force to oversee this program, this task
force should also include the Secretary of
Education (or a designee); the Secretary of
Energy (or a designee); the Secretary of
Health and Human Services (or a designee);
the Secretary of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment (or a designee); the Secretary of Labor
(or a designee); the Secretary of Transpor-
tation (or a designee); the Secretary of the
Treasury (or a designee); the Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency (or
a designee); the Administrator of the Small
Business Administration (or a designee); the
Federal Co-Chair of the Appalachian Re-
gional Commission (or a designee); the Fed-
eral Co-Chairman of the Board of the Delta
Regional Authority (or a designee); the Fed-
eral Co-Chair of the Northern Border Re-
gional Commission (or a designee); national
and local organizations that have relevant
programs and interests that could serve the
needs of the jobs accelerators; representa-
tives of State and local governments or
State and local economic development agen-
cies; representatives of institutions of higher
education, including land-grant universities;
and such other heads of Federal agencies and
non-Federal partners as determined appro-
priate by the co-chairs of the task force.
(47) Northern Great Plains Regional Authority
The House bill amends section 383N(a) of
the Consolidated Farm and Rural Develop-
ment Act by extending and reducing the au-
thorization of appropriations to $2 million
for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023.
(Section 6224)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute does not adopt
the House provision.
(48) Rural Business Investment Program
The Senate amendment amends Subtitle H
of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Develop-
ment Act to: change the definition of capital
for purposes of the program from ‘‘venture
capital’’ to ‘‘equity capital’’; (2) remove the
$500 cap on guarantee fees the Secretary may
charge; (3) increase the limitation on rural
business investment companies controlled by
Farm Credit System institutions from 25%
to 50% before the rural business investment
company is prohibited from providing equity
investments to companies that are not oth-
erwise eligible to receive financing from the
Farm Credit System; and (4) prohibit the
Secretary from requiring an entity applying
to become a certified rural business invest-
ment company provide investment or capital
that is not required of other companies eligi-
ble to apply to operate as a rural business in-
vestment company. (Section 12626)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 6426)
(49) Electric Loan Refinancing
The Senate amendment amends section
2(a) of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936
to authorize the Secretary refinance electric
and telephone loans made by the Rural
Utilities Service. (Section 6201)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 6501)
The Managers expect that all affected fed-
eral agencies will work together to expedi-
tiously implement the new authority to refi-
nance Rural Utilities Service and Federal Fi-
nancing Bank loans. Within 90 days USDA
should publish a notice detailing implemen-
tation of the re-financing provisions.
The Managers expect that the new refi-
nancing authority gives the agency the abil-
ity to issue a new loan with new terms with
the proceeds being used to repay or pre-pay
an existing loan. These transactions should
not be considered loan modifications. The
Managers do not expect any additional budg-
et authority to be necessary to implement
these provisions.

technical assistance to the Rural Utilities
Service on loans to be made for electrifica-
tion loans. (Section 6202)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment clarifying
that the Department of Energy provides
technical assistance to Rural Utilities Serv-
ice and not individual borrowers. (Section
6501(b))
(51) Loans for Telephone Service
The Senate amendment amends Section 201
of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 by
making technical changes to remove obso-
lete provisions. (Section 6203)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 6502)
(52) Cushion of Credit Payments Program/Ex-
tension
The House bill amends the Rural Elec-
trification Act of 1936 to: (1) authorize appro-
priations of $10 million for each of fiscal
years 2019 through 2023 for the Rural Eco-
nomic Development Loan and Grant Pro-
gram; and (2) add a new section 313B to con-
solidate and specifically authorize the statu-
tory provisions governing the Rural Eco-
nomic Development Loan and Grant Pro-
gram. (Section 6304)
The Senate amendment amends the Rural
Electrification Act of 1936 to: (1) authorize
appropriations of $5 million for each of fiscal
years 2022 and 2023 for the Rural Economic
Development Loan and Grant Program; (2)
provide mandatory CCC funding of $5 million
for each of fiscal years 2022 and 2023; (3) pro-
vide for the continuation of the Rural Eco-
nomic Development Loan and Grant Pro-
gram beyond the current expected cessation
of the Program with the expiration of the
final certificate of beneficial ownership in
FY2021; (4) cease additional deposits into the
Cushion of Credit beginning October 1, 2018;
and (5) modify the fixed interest rate and 5
percent paid on Cushion of Credit deposits to
the rate used to make payments on the 5-
year Treasury note, not to exceed 5%. (Sec-
tion 6204)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to cease
additional deposits into the Cushion of Cred-
it beginning on the date of enactment of the
Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018; and to
modify the interest paid on Cushion of Credit
deposits from a fixed interest rate of 5 per-
cent currently paid on Cushion of Credit de-
posits to 4 percent in fiscal year 2021, and to
an amount equal to the 1–year Treasury rate
thereafter. In addition, beginning on the
date of enactment through September 30,
2020, a borrower may reduce the balance of
its Cushion of Credit account if the amount
obtained from the reduction is used to pre-
pay loans made or guaranteed under the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936. No prepay-
ment premium will be imposed or collected
with respect to that portion of a loan that is
prepaid by a borrower under this limited pre-
payment authority. (Section 6503 & 6504)
The managers expect that all affected fed-
eral agencies will work together to expedi-
tiously implement the new authority to pre-
pay Rural Utilities Service and Federal Fi-
nancing Bank loans without penalty under
this section. Within 90 days of enactment,
USDA should publish a notice detailing im-
plementation of the Cushion of Credit provi-
sions. The Managers do not expect any addi-
tional budget authority to be necessary to
implement these provisions.
In providing the authority for depositors
to prepay loans with balances in the Cushion
of Credit account, it is the Managers’ inten-
tion that each depositor be able to apply
funds to individual loans of the depositor’s
choosing.
(53) Guarantees for Bonds and Notes Issued for
Electrification for Telephone Purposes
The House bill amends section 313A of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to: (1) strike
the requirement that loans be made solely
for the purpose of electrification or tele-
phone purposes under the Act, and instead
allow that utility infrastructure loans be
made to, or refinanced for, eligible borrowers
under the Rural Electrification Act; (2) pre-
scribe terms of the guarantees, including to
require that the term of each guarantee
must be 35 years; and (3) require that the
Secretary carry out section 313A, as amend-
ed, under a notice of Solicitation of Applica-
tions until all necessary regulations are
fully implemented. (Section 6301 & 6303)
The Senate amendment amends section
313A of the Rural Electrification Act of1936
to: (1) same as House bill; (2) prescribe terms
of the guarantees, including to provide that
the term of a guarantee, by agreement be-
tween the Secretary and the borrower, may
be for a term of 30 years (or another term of
years that the Secretary determines is ap-
propriate); (3) substantially similar to the
House bill; (4) extend the termination date
until September 30, 2023; and (5) strikes the
prohibition against the Secretary guaran-
teeing payment on a bond or note issued by
a lender, the proceeds of which are used for
the generation of electricity. (Section 6205)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 6505)
The Managers have included language to
streamline the Guaranteed Underwriter Pro-
gram. The Managers intend that this pro-
gram will continue to guarantee loans or re-
finance bonds or notes issued by cooperative
lenders for the purposes of assisting utilities
in improving their infrastructure. These
electric and telecommunications utilities in-
clude any former RUS borrower that has re-
paid or prepaid an insured, direct or guaran-
teed loan under the Rural Electrification Act
of 1936, or any utility that is eligible to re-
ceive an insured or direct loan under such
Act.
(54) Expansion of 911 Access
The House bill reauthorizes section 315 of
the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 through
2023. (Section 6302)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 6506)
(55) Transparency in the Telecommunications
Infrastructure Loan Program
The Senate amendment amends Title VI of
the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to re-
quire the Secretary to publish and make
available to the public a fully searchable
database related to the Telecommunications
Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee
Program, including: (1) a notice and specified
details of each application; (2) a notice and
specified details of each borrower receiving
assistance; and (3) other information suffi-
cient to allow the public to understand the
assistance provided.
The Senate amendment also requires the
Secretary to provide an opportunity for the
public to submit information concerning the
service the borrower is offering in the census
blocks proposed in an application. (Section
6208)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to expand
the transparency and reporting requirements
to all broadband infrastructure programs ad-
ministered by USDA, remove references to
census blocks, and moves some existing re-
porting language from Section 601 of the
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to a new
Section 701. (Section 6207)
In adopting a substitute amendment, the
Managers have established a single process
for providing notice and assessments of pro-
posed service territories across multiple
USDA broadband programs. The amendment
will ensure that the Secretary will be re-
quired to follow the same process for making
information about applicants for retail
broadband assistance publicly available, re-
gardless of which program the assistance is
provided through. Similarly, existing
broadband providers will have a single source
of information about proposed projects in
which they might be considered incumbent
providers.
The amendment also seeks to move the De-
partment away from the inaccurate, census-
block approach to determining the existing
service within a proposed service territory.
Census-block level data has long been identi-
fied as a significant stumbling block to gain-
ing an accurate map of broadband deploy-
ment in rural areas. The amendment re-
quires existing service providers to provide
data on their operations only within the bor-
ders of the proposed service territory. The
Managers intend that the Secretary imple-
ment this section by requiring applicants
and existing providers to each provide serv-
ice point-level data when submitting data
under this section, as appropriate.
(56) Cybersecurity and Grid Security Improve-
ments
The Senate amendment amends Title III of
the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 by add-
ing at the end a new section authorizing the
Secretary to make or guarantee electric
loans for cybersecurity and grid security im-
provements. (Section 6210)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 6507)
(57) Rural Energy Savings Program
The House bill amends section 6407 of the
Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of
2002 to: (1) require the Secretary to not in-
clude any debt incurred under the Rural En-
ergy Savings Program incurred in the cal-
culation of a borrower’s debt equity ratio for
the purposes of determining eligibility for
loans under the Rural Electrification Act; (2)
require the Secretary to streamline account-
ing requirements imposed on borrowers
while maintaining adequate assurances of
loan repayment; (3) increase the interest
rate that a borrower may charge when re-
lending programs funds from 3% to 5%; (4)
require the Secretary to submit a report to
Congressional authorizing committees on
program administration; and (5) reauthorize
the program through 2023. (Section 6401)
The Senate amendment amends Section
6407 of the Farm Security and Rural Invest-
ment Act of 2002 to: (1) very similar provi-
sion; (2) very similar provision; (3) increase
the interest rate that a borrower may charge
when relending program funds from3% to 6%;
(4) very similar provision; (5) reauthorized
the program through 2023; and (6)amend the
definition of ‘‘energy efficiency measures’’
eligible for financing to specifically include
cost-effective on- or off- grid renewable en-
ergy or energy storage systems. (Section
6302)

when relending program funds from 3 percent
to 5 percent. (Section 6303)

TITLE VII—RESEARCH
The Managers recognize that Federal in-
vestment in public agricultural research has
been trending downward in real dollars since
2003. This comes at a time when farmers are
struggling to make ends meet and are in des-
perate need of new tools to cut costs, combat
crop disease, and protect against flood and
drought. Furthermore, the demands of a
growing and hungry world population re-
quire that American agricultural research
again take the lead in advancing innovation
in food production.
The Managers recognize that the U.S. has
been second to China in total public agricul-
tural research funding since 2008, and China’s
spending on public agricultural research and
development is now nearly double that of the
United States. We are at a critical juncture
and must reverse this trend to reassert our
nation’s global leadership in agricultural re-
search.

versity offering a baccalaureate or higher de-
gree in the study of agricultural sciences,
forestry, or both, which is any of the 32 spec-
ified areas of study. The House provision es-
tablishes a process of review within 90 days
of enactment of each NLGCA to ensure com-
pliance with the revised definition and to
propose revocation of the designated NLGCA
for noncompliance. The House provision also
extends until fiscal year 2023 the current law
authority for cooperating forestry schools
and Hispanic-serving agricultural colleges to
no longer be designated as such institutions.
(Section 7102)
The Senate amendment amends the section
1404(14) definition of an NLGCA to mean a

laureate or higher degree in the study of ag-
ricultural sciences, forestry, or both, which
may include any of same 32 specific areas of
study specified in the House bill and any
other area determined appropriate by the
Secretary. Similar to the House bill, the
Senate amendment establishes a process of
review within 90 days of enactment of each
NLGCA to ensure compliance with the re-
vised definition and to propose revocation of
the designated NLGCA for noncompliance.
(Section 7102)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision, with an amendment that
specifies in the definition of NLGCA that the
study of agricultural sciences, forestry, or
both is any of the 32 specified areas of study
or any other area determined appropriate by
the Secretary. (Section 7102)
The Managers expect the Secretary to rig-
orously scrutinize any other area of study
beyond those specifically enumerated in
statute before determining such area of
study to be appropriate for the purposes of
designating an NLGCA institution. Such
area of study should be closely related to the
core areas of agricultural sciences and for-
estry that are listed in the definition.
(3) National agricultural research, extension,
education, and economics advisory board
The House bill amends section 1408 of
NARETPA to reauthorize the National Agri-
cultural Research, Extension, Education,
and Economics Advisory Board. It amends
the membership composition of the Advisory
Board and directs the Advisory Board to
make recommendations and to address long-
and short-term national priorities consistent
with various priorities of the Agriculture
and Food Research Initiative and NARETPA.
(Section 7103)
The Senate amendment amends section
1408 to reauthorize the Advisory Board. (Sec-
tion 7103)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to the
membership composition of the Advisory
Board to include a national association of
agricultural economists. (Section 7103)
(4) Specialty crop committee; Citrus disease sub-
committee
The House bill amends section 1408A of
NARETPA to extend the citrus disease sub-
committee of the specialty crops committee
through September 30, 2023. It increases the
membership of the citrus disease sub-
committee from 9 to 11 members and in-
creases from 3 to 5 the number of members
who represent Arizona or California. (Sec-
tion 7104)
The Senate amendment extends the citrus
disease subcommittee of the specialty crops
committee through September 30, 2023. (Sec-
tion 7104)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7104)
(5) Renewable energy committee
The House bill discontinues the Renewable
Energy Committee by repealing section
1408B of NARETPA. (Section 7105)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7105)
(6) Veterinary services grant program
The Senate amendment amends section
1415B of NARETPA to sunset the authoriza-
tion for the Veterinary Services Grant Pro-
gram in fiscal year 2023, to require that not
less than two-thirds of the funds made avail-
able under section 1415B be awarded to quali-
fied entities with a focus on food animal
medicine, and to add to the preference for se-
lecting grant recipients, qualified entities
exposing students in grades 11 and 12 to edu-
cation and career opportunities in food ani-
mal medicine. (Section 7105)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments to remove
the authorization sunset, to require the Sec-
retary to prioritize grant awards for pro-
grams or activities focused on the practice of
food animal medicine, and to specify that a
qualified entity may use grant funds to ex-
pose students in grades 11 and 12 to edu-
cation and career opportunities in food ani-
mal medicine. (Section 7106)
The Managers intend to enhance the Vet-
erinary Services Grant Program (VSGP),
which was developed to relieve veterinary
shortage situations and support veterinary
services. To increase the number of food ani-
mal veterinarians, the Managers intend to
recruit high school students and provide
work experience to expose them to veteri-
nary career opportunities. According to data
from the Department of Agriculture (USDA),
approximately 15 percent of veterinarians
specialize in food animal or mixed animal
practice while two-thirds practice exclu-
sively on companion animals. Prioritizing
food animal medicine in the VSGP will allow
for additional grants to develop, implement,
and sustain food animal veterinary services
through education, training, recruitment,
placement, and retention of veterinarians,
veterinary technicians, and students of vet-
erinary medicine and technology, and to es-
tablish or expand veterinary practices in
rural areas.
(7) Research equipment grants
The House bill adds a new section 1462A of
NARETPA to establish a competitive grants
program for the acquisition of research
equipment for use in food and agricultural
sciences programs. Further, it stipulates
grant amounts may not exceed $500,000 to an
eligible institution and authorizes $5 million
for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. Ad-
ditionally, the House bill defines ‘‘eligible
institution’’ to mean a ‘‘college or univer-
sity’’ or a State cooperative institution.
(Section 7121)
The Senate amendment adds a new section
1419 to establish a competitive grants pro-
gram that is substantially similar to the
House bill, with the exception that the Sen-
ate amendment defines ‘‘eligible institution’’
to mean ‘‘an institution of higher education
as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher
Education Act of 1965’’ or a State coopera-
tive institution. (Section 7107)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7125)
(8) Next generation agriculture technology chal-
lenge
The Senate amendment adds a new section
1419C to NARETPA to establish a next gen-
eration agriculture technology challenge
competition to incentivize the development
of innovative mobile technology that re-
moves barriers to entry in the marketplace
for beginning farmers and ranchers. The Sen-
ate amendment provides that the Secretary
may award not more than $1,000,000 in the
aggregate to 1 or more winners of the com-
petition. (Section 7110)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 7110) The Managers
recognize that there are many barriers to
entry for new and beginning farmers and
ranchers. One of the major challenges in-
cludes the lack of innovative mobile tech-
nology to help new and beginning farmers
and ranchers start farming. The Managers
intend that this authority be used to stimu-
late new advancements to bridge gaps in
technology and better serve new and begin-
ning farmers and ranchers.
(9) Nutrition education program
The House bill strikes section 1425 in
NARETPA to discontinue the nutrition edu-
cation program and to strike funding for the
expanded food and nutrition education pro-
gram. (Section 7110)
The Senate amendment amends section
1425 to extend the authorization of appro-
priations for the nutrition education pro-
gram and the expanded food and nutrition
education program through fiscal year 2023.
(Section 7111)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to allow
the expanded food and nutrition education
program to coordinate with the nutrition
education and obesity prevention grant pro-
gram under section 28 of the Food and Nutri-
tion Act or another health promotion or nu-
trition improvement strategy. (Section 7112)
(10) Extension carryover at 1890 land-grant col-
leges, including Tuskegee University
The House bill amends section 1444(a) of
NARETPA to allow 1890 colleges to carry
forward to the succeeding fiscal year more
than 20 percent of the funds they receive in
a given fiscal year, effective October 1, 2018.
(Section 7112)
The Senate amendment is substantially
similar to the House bill but does not specify
an effective date of October 1, 2018. It also re-
quires an annual report to Congress describ-
ing allocations made to, and matching funds
received by, 1890 colleges and 1862 land-grant
colleges for extension. (Section 7114)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment striking
the annual report requirement and moves it
to section 7116. (Section 7114)
The Managers encourage USDA to allow
extension funding to carry over at 1890 insti-
tutions in a similar manner to 1862 institu-
tions.
(11) Report on allocations and matching funds
for 1890 Institutions
The House bill directs the Secretary to
transmit to Congress annually a report on
the allocations made to, and matching funds
received by, institutions pursuant to sec-
tions 1444 and 1445 of NARETPA. (Section
7106)
The Senate amendment amends section
1445 to require an annual report to Congress

describing allocations made to, and match-
ing funds received by, institutions under sec-
tion 1445 and institutions designated under
the Act of July 2, 1862. (Section7115)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments to include
allocations and matching funds received by
institutions under section 1444 of NARETPA,
subsections (b) and (c) of section 3 of the
Smith-Lever Act, and the Hatch Act of 1887.
(Section 7116)
The Managers recognize the important role
that land-grant colleges have throughout the
country, particularly in agricultural re-
search and extension. It will benefit farmers,
producers, and other community stake-
holders if state governments match the fed-
eral government’s funding level commit-
ments at both 1890 and 1862 land-grant col-
leges. The Managers expect that the Sec-
retary’s annual report on the efforts made by
States to match dollar-for-dollar federal
funding will provide additional information
to Congress for future policy decisions, help
land-grant colleges better serve their com-
munities, and encourage States to provide
additional support for agricultural research.
(12) New beginning for tribal students
The House bill amends section 309(b) of the
Department of Agriculture Reorganization
Act of 1994 to require the Secretary, within a
year of the date of enactment, to establish a
‘‘New Beginnings Initiative’’ in consultation
with the Office of Tribal Relations, under
which the Secretary shall provide funds to a
land-grant college or university in an
amount equal to the funds such college or
university expends for providing Indians edu-
cational programs and services, or tuition at
such college or university. (Section 11204)
The Senate amendment adds a new section,
1450, to NARETPA authorizing the Secretary
to award competitive grants to land-grant
colleges or universities to provide identifi-
able support specifically targeted for Tribal
students. A land-grant college or university
that receives a grant under this section shall
provide matching funds toward the cost of
carrying out the support in an amount equal
to not less than 100 percent of the grant
award. The Senate amendment provides that
no State shall receive more than $500,000 per
year through grants under this program. Ad-
ditionally, it requires that the Secretary
provide a report on the type of grants award-
ed, the amounts awarded, and the graduation
rate of student awardees and authorizes ap-
propriations in the amount of $5 million for
each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. (Sec-
tion 7118)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments specifying
that the term ‘‘land-grant college or univer-
sity’’ includes a 1994 Institution and other
technical changes. (Section 7120)
(13) Binational agricultural research and devel-
opment (BARD)
The Senate amendment amends section
1458 of NARETPA to provide that activities
under the BARD Fund to promote and sup-
port agricultural research and development
that are of mutual benefit to the United
States and Israel shall be carried out in a
manner consistent with the section and to
accelerate the demonstration, development,
and application of agricultural solutions re-
sulting from or relating to BARD Fund pro-
grams. (Section 7120)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment striking
that the activities be carried out in a man-
ner consistent with the section. (Section
7122)
The Managers acknowledge the strong re-
search and development partnership between
the United States of America and the Gov-
ernment of Israel, carried out through ac-
tivities under the Binational Agricultural
Research and Development (BARD) Fund.
The Managers encourage the Secretary to
promote, support, and expand agricultural
research and development that are of mutual
benefit to the United States and Israel.
In addition, the Managers intend for
USDA, in coordination with the Government
of Israel, to pursue the expansion of activi-
ties under BARD to accelerate the dem-
onstration, development, and application of
agricultural solutions resulting from or re-
lating to BARD Fund programs. The broader
BARD areas of interest for collaborative pri-
orities include:
(A) increased efficiency of agricultural pro-
duction including sustainable development,
efficient use of resources, economic evalua-
tion of policies and regulatory issues, and
crops that yield higher value per unit;
(B) protection of plants and animals
against biotic stress, including pest genetics
in biological environments, invasive species,
and emerging diseases;
(C) agricultural production challenges in
increasing marginal conditions, such as tol-
erance to drought, salinity, high tempera-
ture and nutrient stresses;
(D) food quality, safety and security in-
cluding improved assessment and detection
methods, food nutritive value in relation to
human health, functional foods, reliable sup-
ply, and postharvest treatments;
(E) water quality and quantity including
efficient use of low quality water, improved
economic return for water in agriculture,
crop response to soil and water quality and
its constituents, impact of nutrients on
water quality;
(F) functional genomics and proteomics
that deal with important agricultural issues
including production and protection traits,
genetic optimization, and increased yield;
(G) sensors and robotics linking biological
phenomena with sensors or otherwise bridg-
ing into the field of bioengineering, nano-
technology, precision agriculture, and labor
reduction; and
(H) sustainable bio-energy systems, includ-
ing biofuel production systems, and those
that reduce energy costs, leverage renewable
resources, reduce greenhouse gases, and help
to diversify the farm economy.
(14) Partnerships to build capacity in inter-
national agricultural research, extension,
and teaching
The Senate amendment adds a new section
1458A to NARETPA to promote building ca-
pacity and improving performance among
1862, 1890, 1994, NLGCA, Hispanic-serving ag-
ricultural colleges, and cooperating forestry
schools, and similar institutions in devel-
oping countries, to strengthen agricultural
research, teaching, and extension institu-
tions. The section authorizes $10 million for
each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. (Sec-
tion 7121)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments defining ‘‘de-
veloping country’’ and ‘‘international part-
ner institutions’’ and other technical
changes. (Section 7123)
The Managers understand that global food
production must continue to increase to
meet the world’s growing population. The
Managers intent is to build capacity and im-
prove the performance of covered institu-
tions and agricultural higher education in-
stitutions in developing countries per-
forming, or desiring to perform, activities
substantially similar to agricultural re-
search, extension, and teaching activities in
order to solve food, health, nutrition, rural
income, and environmental challenges, espe-
cially among chronically food insecure popu-
lations.
(15) Limitation on indirect costs for agricultural
research, education, and extension
The House bill amends section 1462 of
NARETPA to allow indirect cost recovery
charged against any agricultural research,
education, or extension grant awarded to in-
crease from 22 percent to 30 percent of total
federal funds received, unless otherwise pro-
vided in law. It clarifies that the limitation
on indirect costs applies to both the initial
grant award and any subgrant, so that the
total of all indirect costs charged against the
total of the Federal funds provided does not
exceed the 30 percent limitation. (Section
7120)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7125)
(16) Supplemental and alternative crops
The House bill amends section 1473D of
NARETPA to reauthorize appropriations
through fiscal year 2023 for the competitive
grants program to develop supplemental and
alternative crops. It amends the program to
include canola and alternative crops ‘‘for ag-
ronomic rotational purposes and for use as a
habitat for honey bees and other polli-
nators’’. (Section 7124)
The Senate amendment is substantially
similar to the House bill and also provides
that the Secretary may award grants and
enter into agreement or other arrangements
to conduct research related to the develop-
ment of industrial hemp as well as the devel-
opment of new and emerging commercial
products derived from hemp. (Section 7125)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to increase
the authorization of appropriations to $2
million for each of fiscal years 2019 through
2023. (Section 7129)
(17) New era rural technology program
The Senate amendment amends section
1473E of NARETPA to reauthorize the New
Era Rural Technology Program for fiscal
years 2019 through 2023 and adds precision
agriculture to the areas of technology devel-
opment, applied research, and training sup-
ported under the program. (Section 7126)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 7130)
(18) Agriculture advanced research and develop-
ment authority pilot (AGARDA)
The Senate amendment adds a new section
1473H to NARETPA to establish the Agri-
culture Advanced Research and Development
Authority (AGARDA) under the Office of
Chief Scientist. ‘‘Advanced research and de-
velopment’’ is defined as activities to over-
come long-term and high-risk research chal-
lenges in agriculture and food through accel-
eration of innovative agricultural research
or the development of qualified products and
projects or agricultural technologies. The
Senate amendment directs the Secretary to
develop a strategic plan for AGARDA and
disseminate the information in the plan to
those who can best contribute to the activi-
ties described in the strategic plan. It per-
mits the Secretary to use ‘‘other transaction
authority’’ to expedite awarding grants and
entering into contracts. The provision per-
mits the Secretary to appoint highly quali-
fied individuals without regard to certain
sections of the U.S. Code governing appoint-
ments in the competitive service and with-
out regard to the General Schedule pay rates
and authorizes establishment of the
AGARDA Fund in the U.S. Treasury admin-
istered by the Chief Scientist to carry out

H9998 December 10, 2018
this section. The provision permits the Sec-
retary to accept and deposit monies received
from cost recovery or contribution into the
AGARDA Fund. The authority under this
new section terminates on September 30,
2023. (Section 7128)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments that (1)
broaden the definition of ‘‘advanced research
and development’’, (2) specify that one of the
goals of AGARDA is to undertake advanced
research and development in areas that in-
dustry is unlikely to undertake because of
technological or financial uncertainty; (3)
add royalty payments as monies that the
Secretary may accept and deposit into the
AGARDA Fund and allow amounts deposited
into the Fund to remain available until ex-
pended; and (4) modify the termination of ef-
fectiveness to 5 years after the date of enact-
ment and provide exceptions to such termi-
nation for certain provisions of the section.
(Section 7132)
The Managers recognize the need to ad-
dress high risk and long-term challenges
that threaten the stability and economic vi-
ability of agriculture in the United States.
To do this effectively, the Managers intend
to complement existing research efforts by
providing new authority to spur innovation.
As such, the conference substitute estab-
lishes the Agriculture Advanced Research
and Development Authority pilot program to
carry out advanced research and develop-
ment of qualified products and projects, agri-
cultural technologies, and research tools.
The Managers encourage the Secretary to
establish a robust strategic plan for
AGARDA that implements a new approach
to problem solving that considers and learns
from the successes and experiences of other
advanced research and development authori-
ties, such as the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA), the Biomedical
Advanced Research and Development Au-
thority (BARDA), and the Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA–E).
The Managers intend that the Secretary of
Agriculture use the other transaction au-
thority, when appropriate, in a creative
manner and subject to the same terms and
conditions as afforded to the Secretary of
Defense under DARPA, including that the
other transaction authority may be used
when a standard contract, grant, or coopera-
tive agreement is not feasible or appropriate.
The Managers expect the Secretary to
prioritize projects during the pilot program
to meet challenges related to the discovery
of solutions to plant and animal disease
threats, including those with the highest
risk of emerging or moving transboundary,
and the discovery of mechanization solutions
that will provide viable alternatives for
labor intensive aspects of specialty crop pro-
duction.
The projects funded through this pilot pro-
gram should address barriers in research and
development that support transformative ad-
vances that industry by itself is not likely to
undertake because of technological or finan-
cial uncertainty.
The Managers encourage USDA to partner
and collaborate with agencies, relevant in-
dustries, academia, and other stakeholders
to conduct advanced research and develop-
ment. The Managers do not intend for USDA
to change how other authorized agricultural
research programs are funded and imple-
mented due to the establishment of
AGARDA.
(19) Rangeland research programs
The House bill amends section 1483 of
NARETPA to reauthorize appropriations for
rangeland research through fiscal year 2023.
(Section 7127)
The Senate amendment repeals subtitle M
of NARETPA to eliminate the rangeland re-
search program. (Section 7130)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7134)
(20) Special authorization for biosecurity plan-
ning and response
The House bill amends section 1484 of
NARETPA to increase authorization of ap-
propriations to $30 million for each fiscal
year 2019 through 2023. The House bill au-
thorizes the Secretary to use the funding to
enter into cooperative agreements, in addi-
tion to awarding competitive grants. It adds
that the Secretary shall, in addition to other
stated activities, use the funds to coordinate
tactical science activities of USDA’s Re-
search, Education, and Economics mission
area to protect the American agricultural
system against biosecurity threats from
pests, diseases, contaminants, and disasters.
(Section 7128)
The Senate amendment reauthorizes ap-
propriations of $20 million for each fiscal
year through fiscal year 2023. (Section 7131)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7135)
(21) Land-grant designation
The House bill adds a new section to Sub-
title C of NARETPA to prohibit the designa-
tion of additional entities as eligible to re-
ceive funds under a list of ‘‘covered pro-
grams’’, including the Hatch Act, the Smith-
Lever Act (sections 3(b), (c), and (d)),
McIntire-Stennis Act, and programs funding
research, extension, and facilities at 1890
land-grant colleges. It also prohibits the in-
crease of the amount of funding a state can
receive under a covered program as a result
of a state’s designation of additional entities
as eligible to receive funds under a covered
program. The House bill specifies that this
new section does not limit eligibility for ca-
pacity and infrastructure programs specified
in section 251(f)(1)(C) of the Department of
Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 that
are not covered programs. (Section 7118)
The Senate amendment adds a new section
to Subtitle P of NARETPA to prohibit the
designation of additional entities as eligible
to receive funds under a list of ‘‘capacity
programs’’, including the Smith-Lever Act
(sections 3(b) and (c)), the Hatch Act,
McIntire-Stennis Act, and programs funding
research, extension, and facilities at 1890
land-grant colleges, and other agricultural
research, extension, or education programs
relating to capacity and infrastructure. It
provides exceptions from the prohibition
against new designations for 1994 institu-
tions under the McIntire-Stennis Act, and in
extraordinary circumstances, as determined
by the Secretary. Additionally, the section
prohibits the increase of the amount of fund-
ing a state can receive under a capacity pro-
gram as a result of the designation of addi-
tional entities as eligible to receive funds
under a capacity program. (Section 7133)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments that pro-
vide exceptions from the prohibition against
new designations for 1994 institutions and in
extraordinary circumstances and that make
technical changes. (Section 7111)
The Managers support the continuing mis-
sion of the U.S. land-grant university system
to address local, State, and national prior-
ities concerning food and agricultural
sciences. Formula funds provided by USDA
support capacity and infrastructure for re-
search, education, and extension programs
related to food and agricultural sciences.
Funds allocated to States for agricultural
research programs under the Hatch Act and
agricultural extension programs pursuant to
the Smith-Lever Act are based on individual
formulas that take into account rural popu-
lation and farm numbers. Urban population
and State land area are not considered. The
efficiencies gained through central adminis-
tration of research, extension, and education
programming within the States reduce costs
while maximizing resources devoted to local,
State, and national priorities.
The Managers recognize the budgetary lim-
itations facing the land-grant system of col-
leges and universities and all other public-
sector entities.
Efforts to divide existing land-grant uni-
versities under the guise of local control of
extension programing would establish sepa-
rate, distinct administrative units with the
effect of duplicating administrative costs
and burdens, while significantly disrupting
the ability to provide programming on high-
priority local, State, and national issues.
The Managers address this concern by pro-
hibiting USDA from providing capacity fund-
ing to institutions not previously designated
as land-grant universities, thereby pre-
serving the capability of the system to ad-
dress our nation’s priorities within the budg-
etary constraints that currently exist.
(22) Scholarships for students at 1890 institu-
tions
The House bill adds a new section to Sub-
title G of NARETPA to require the Sec-
retary to award a grant to each 1890 institu-
tion to provide scholarships for students who
have been accepted for admission and will,
within one year, be enrolled at the institu-
tion, and who intend to pursue a career in
food and agricultural sciences, including a
career in: agribusiness; energy and renewable
fuels; and financial management. It author-
izes appropriations of $19 million for each of
fiscal years 2019 through 2023 and requires
that each grant be made in the amount of $1
million. (Section 7114)
The Senate amendment requires the Sec-
retary to award a grant to each 1890 institu-
tion to provide scholarships for students who
seek to attend the institution and intend to
pursue a career in food and agricultural
sciences, including agribusiness; food pro-
duction, distribution, and retailing; the
clothing industries; energy and renewable
fuels; and farming marketing, finance, and
distribution. It authorizes appropriations of
$19 million for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023 and requires the Secretary to
allocate $1 million for a fiscal year to each of
the 19 eligible institutions. The Senate
amendment also establishes findings and
purposes related to the program. (Section
7134)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to limit
grants to 1890 institutions that have estab-
lished a competitive scholarship awards
process for this scholarship program and re-
stricts the Secretary from using more than
$10 million in mandatory funds to award
grants for each academic year from July 1,
2020 through July 1, 2023. The substitute pro-
vides that each grant be made in an amount
not less than $500,000. The substitute pro-
vides $40 million in mandatory funding from
the Commodity Credit Corporation (‘‘CCC’’)
on October 1, 2019 to remain available until
expended and $10 million in discretionary
funding for each of fiscal years 2020 through
2023, with a 4 percent administrative expense
cap. The substitute also requires that the
Secretary submit a report to Congress every
2 years. (Section 7117)
(23) National strategic germplasm and cultivar
collection assessment and utilization plan
The Senate amendment amends section
1632 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation,
and Trade Act of 1990 (‘‘FACT Act’’) to re-

and cultivar collections assessment and uti-
lization plan. It amends section 1633 to re-
quire the Secretary to make such a plan pub-
licly available upon completion. (Section
7205)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 7205)
The Managers recognize that food security
and productivity across growing conditions
depend on regionally-adapted cultivars and
the maintenance of a robust strategic
germplasm, and therefore direct the Sec-
retary to implement an updated assessment
of the national strategic germplasm and
cultivar collection, as well as the research,
education, and capacity updates necessary to
meet current and future needs of American
farmers and U.S. consumers. The Managers
intend the Secretary to make progress on
the development of publicly available
cultivars, building on direction provided in
the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of
2008, and expect an acceleration in progress
on delivering regionally-adapted cultivars
that can be used to improve farm produc-
tivity, crop marketability, and efficient nu-
trient use.
(24) National genetics resources program
The House bill amends section 1635 of
FACT Act to reauthorize the National Ge-
netics Resources Program through fiscal
year 2023. (Section 7205)
The Senate amendment is substantially
similar to the House bill and also amends the
organization of the Advisory Council by add-
ing 4 members and changing the appoint-
ment of members, and by adding membership
from 1862, 1890, and 1994 institutions and cer-
tain other institutions of higher education.
The section also instructs the Advisory
Council to include recommendations, includ-
ing on the state of public cultivar develop-
ment and on the training and resources need-
ed to meet future breeding challenges, re-
search gaps relating to cultivar develop-
ment. (Section 7206)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 7206)
(25) Agricultural genome initiative
The House bill amends section 1671 of
FACT Act by including phenome, in addition
to genome, within the Agriculture Genome
Initiative. The House bill outlines the re-
search initiative goals to expand knowledge
concerning genomes and phenomes of crops
important to the agriculture sector of the
United States. It authorizes appropriations
of $30 million for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023. (Section 7207)
The Senate amendment similarly amends
section 1671 to include phenome, in addition
to genome, within the Agriculture Genome
Initiative. The Senate amendment also in-
corporates animals of importance to the ag-
riculture sector of the United States to the
research initiative goals and purposes. It au-
thorizes appropriations of $30 million for fis-
cal year 2019 through 2023. (Section 7208)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment author-
izing appropriations of $40 million for each of
fiscal years 2019 through 2023. (Section 7208)
The Managers acknowledge the enormous
challenge of efficiently and sustainably pro-
ducing a safe, dependable food supply for a
growing population. Meeting this challenge
requires the development and management
of crop varieties that will perform well de-
spite increased weather variability. Signifi-
cant progress has been made by the crop in-
dustry in sequencing numerous plant
genomes. This genomic knowledge will in-
crease the ability to predict crop perform-
ance in diverse environments, enhancing the
capability to develop new varieties and to
better manage the effects of weather varia-
bility on crop productivity. The Managers
support a large-scale, inter-disciplinary net-
work of researchers dedicated to producing
and analyzing very large datasets of
phenotypes to better predict crop yields.
The Managers recognize the importance of
animal genomics research conducted and
supported by USDA and strongly supports in-
creased efforts in genomics research on agri-
culturally important animals to address crit-
ical goals including: (1) understanding how
environment and production systems impact
the growth and productivity of livestock,
poultry, and aquaculture to help predict and
improve performance under variable condi-
tions; (2) leveraging livestock, poultry, and
aquaculture genomic information with
phenotypic and environmental data to assist
in selection of superior genetics and im-
proved management; (3) understanding gene
function in production environments to im-
prove livestock, poultry, and aquaculture
performance; and (4) developing improved
data analytics to enhance understanding of
the biological function of genome sequences
in livestock, poultry, and aquaculture. The
Managers commend the university commu-
nity, the private-sector, and USDA for its
work to advance animal genomics research
and encourages additional focus on these ef-
forts in the future.
(26) High-priority research and extension
The House bill amends section 1672 of
FACT Act to change the alfalfa and forage
research program to the alfalfa seed and al-
falfa forage systems research program. It
adds the following to the list of high-priority
research areas: macadamia tree health,
turfgrass, fertilizer management, cattle
fever ticks, laying hen and turkey produc-
tion, chronic wasting disease, and algae.
(Section 7208)
The Senate amendment adds the following
to the list of high-priority research areas:
macadamia tree health, turfgrass, nutrient
management, and chronic wasting disease.
Additionally, the Senate amendment estab-
lishes the Pollinator Health Task Force and
amends the provisions governing the coordi-
nation of pollinator and honeybee research
under section 1672(g). (Sections 7209 & 12620)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to include
nutrient management, dryland farming agri-
cultural systems, and hop plants. The sub-
stitute also provides for the enhanced coordi-
nation of honeybee and pollinator research
by the USDA Chief Scientist and requires
that to the maximum extent practicable, the
Chief Scientist shall make such research re-
sults publicly available. (Section 7209)
The Managers are aware that pollinators
are responsible for the production of one-
third of the U.S. food supply, but that man-
aged honey bees continue to die off in alarm-
ing numbers, resulting in steady annual
input cost increases to maintain sufficient
managed colony numbers to pollinate Amer-
ica’s crops. Because of the importance of pol-
linators in the production of the nation’s
food supply and their impact on the stability
of our agricultural economy, the Managers
have included additional honeybee and polli-
nator research requirements. Specifically,
the Managers have included provisions to fa-
cilitate coordination of honeybee and polli-
nator research efforts USDA-wide and ensure
adequate input from the pollinator, bee-
keeper, grower, and scientific communities.
To further address the protection of polli-
nators, the Managers encourage the continu-
ation of government-wide collaboration and
policy development through the Pollinator
Health Task Force.
(27) Organic agriculture research and extension
initiative
The House bill amends section 1672B of
FACT Act to add the examination of optimal
soil health outcomes relating to organically
produced agricultural products to the pur-
poses for which grants may support activi-
ties under the program. It reauthorizes ap-
propriations through fiscal year 2023, and in-
creases mandatory CCC funding to $30 mil-
lion for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023.
(Section 7209)
The Senate amendment is similar to the
House bill except it increases mandatory
CCC funding to: $40 million in each of fiscal
years 2019 and 2020; $45 million for fiscal year
2021; and $50 million for fiscal year 2022 and
each fiscal year thereafter. (Section 7210)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment making
technical changes and providing mandatory
CCC funding of $20 million in each of fiscal
years 2019 and 2020, $25 million for fiscal year
2021, $30 million for fiscal year 2022, and $50
million for fiscal year 2023 and each fiscal
year thereafter. (Section 7210)
The Managers recognize that strong in-
vestment in organic research, education, and
extension has led to growth in the organic
industry and the discovery of new research
that benefits all farmers, and therefore the
conference substitute includes $395 million
in mandatory funding to support organic re-
search. The Managers have provided perma-
nent funding for this program to ensure that
the program has baseline funding hereafter.
The Managers encourage research funding to
be used to continue development of organic
solutions for pest and disease management,
seed breeding, nutrient management, and
improvements in soil health. Organic re-
search is important for developing plant va-
rieties and animal breeds suitable for or-
ganic farming, advancing ecosystem services
and environmental benefits, creating tools to
aid with organic transition, and addressing
other needs to advance organic production.
The Managers acknowledge that research
funding is one of the primary forms of sup-
port for organics in the Agriculture Improve-
ment Act of 2018 so the conference substitute
increases funding beyond the levels in the
Agricultural Act of 2014 to continue develop-
ment of the organic market.
The Managers also recognize that Aerated
Static Pile (ASP) composting with energy
recovery is an emerging technology for
transforming organic wastes into a stable
soil amendment, while also producing suffi-
cient heat energy for on-site hot water heat-
ing needs. The Managers encourage USDA to
continue to support emerging organic waste
management practices.
(28) Farm business management
The House bill amends section 1672D of
FACT Act to reauthorize the program
through fiscal year 2023 and clarify that
grants may be made to expand a national
farm financial management database. The
House bill also amends the selection criteria
to include prioritization of applications that
collaborate with educational programs, and
those that contribute data to the national
farm financial management database. (Sec-
tion 7210)
The Senate amendment reauthorizes the
program through FY 2023. (Section 7211)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7211)
(29) Urban, indoor, and other emerging agri-
culture production research, education, and
extension initiative
The Senate amendment authorizes com-
petitive research and extension grants to
support research, education, and extension
activities for the purposes of enhancing
urban, indoor, and other emerging agricul-
tural production. Priority may be given to
grant proposals that involve the cooperation
of multiple entities, or States or regions
with a high concentration of or significant

interest in urban farms, rooftop farms, and
indoor production facilities. The Senate
amendment provides $4 million in manda-
tory CCC funds for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023 and authorizes appropriations
of an additional $10 million for each of fiscal
years 2019 through 2023. It requires the Sec-
retary to conduct a census of urban, indoor,
and other emerging agricultural production
and provides a separate authorization of an
additional $14 million for the period of fiscal
years 2019 through 2021 to carry out this cen-
sus. (Section 7212)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments striking the
inclusion of assessment of shipping and
transportation impacts on nutritional values
for research under the competitive research
and extension grants, providing $10 million
in mandatory CCC funds for fiscal year 2019
to remain available until expended, and
making other technical changes. (Section
7212)
The Managers recognize that methods of
agricultural production are changing and
evolving across the country. For example,
agricultural production occurs on vacant
land in urban areas, contributing to eco-
nomic recovery and creating opportunities
for new farmers. Highly-efficient indoor
farms grow fresh produce in areas near con-
sumers to increase access to their products
year-round. Rooftop agriculture produces
local food and creates new entrepreneurial
opportunities in urban, suburban, and rural
areas. The Managers recognize that these
and other emerging agriculture production
methods bring a new generation of farmers
and connect consumers to agriculture. The
Managers intend for the Secretary to fund
research, education, and extension that sup-
port these efforts and address the specific re-
search needs and challenges faced by urban,
indoor and other emerging agricultural pro-
duction methods.
(30) Centers of excellence at 1890 institutions
The Senate amendment amends section
1673 of FACT Act to require the Secretary to
establish at least three centers of excellence,
each led by an 1890 institution, to focus on
one or more of the following: student success
and workforce development; nutrition,
health, wellness, and quality of life; farming
systems and rural prosperity; global food se-
curity and defense; natural resources, energy
and the environment; and emerging tech-
nologies. It requires the Secretary to submit
a report to Congress on the resources in-
vested in and work being done by those cen-
ters of excellence and authorizes $10 million
for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023.
(Section 7213)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments specifying
that the Secretary shall recognize at least
three centers of excellence and making tech-
nical changes. (Section 7213)
The Managers encourage the Secretary,
through the National Institute of Food and
Agriculture, to consider the views of the 1890
universities, the 1890 Universities Founda-
tion, and the National Institute of Food and
Agriculture’s (NIFA) peer review systems in
determining the appropriate criteria for rec-
ognizing 1890s Centers of Excellence. The
process should ensure that both smaller and
larger 1890 universities have an opportunity
to participate in authorized center of excel-
lence program activities. Funding should be
restricted to programmatic activities, and
not include construction activities.
(31) Assistive technology program for farmers
with disabilities
The House bill reauthorizes appropriations
through fiscal year 2023 for demonstration
grants to provide agricultural education and
assistance to individuals with disabilities en-
gaged in farming or farm-related occupa-
tions. It adds language to clarify that the
provision applies to veterans engaged in
farming or farm-related occupations, or who
are pursuing new farming opportunities.
(Section 7211)
The Senate amendment reauthorizes ap-
propriations for the demonstration grants
through fiscal year 2023. (Section 7214)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7214)
(32) National food safety training
The House bill amends section 405 of the
Agricultural Research, Extension, and Edu-
cation Reform Act of 1998 (‘‘AREERA’’) to
reauthorize appropriations of such sums as
necessary for fiscal years 2019 through 2023.
The House bill strikes the prohibition on
funding that restricts USDA from providing
additional grant funding once an entity has
received three years of grant funding. (Sec-
tions 7300 and 7301)
The Senate amendment amends section 405
by striking ‘‘such sums as necessary’’ and
specifying an authorization of appropriations
of $10 million for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023. (Section 7301)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment to au-
thorize appropriations of $10 million for each
of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. (Section
7301)
(33) Support for research regarding diseases of
wheat, triticale, and barley caused by fusar-
ium graminearum or by tilletia indica
The House bill reauthorizes appropriations
of $10 million for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023. (Section 7303)
The Senate amendment reauthorizes ap-
propriations at an increased level of $15 mil-
lion for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023.
(Section 7303)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment restricting
grant recipients from using more than 10
percent of the grant funds for indirect costs.
(Section 7303)
(34) Specialty crop research initiative
The House bill expands the specialty crop
research and extension initiative to include
research of ‘‘size-controlling rootstock sys-
tems for perennial crops,’’ ‘‘emerging and
invasive species,’’ and ‘‘threats to specialty
crop pollinators,’’ among other production
practices and technologies. It reauthorizes
appropriations of $100 million annually
through fiscal year 2023. Additionally, the
House bill extends reservation of mandatory
funding for the emergency citrus disease re-
search and extension program and reauthor-
izes discretionary funding through fiscal
year 2023. (Section 7305)
Similar to the House bill, the Senate
amendment expands the specialty crop re-
search and extension initiative to include
additional production practices and tech-
nologies. (Section 7305)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 7305)
The Managers recognize that the funding
for research programs for specialty crops
should generally be made available to all
specialty crops and not include carve-outs or
set-asides for any one particular specialty
crop. The Managers also acknowledge the
unique challenges presently facing the citrus
industry in the United States with respect to
HLB and the Asian Citrus Psyllid vector. In
direct response to a joint request from the
leadership of the citrus industry and other
specialty crop stakeholders, the Managers
have agreed to establish a Citrus Trust Fund
to support the Emergency Citrus Disease Re-
search and Extension Program for one addi-
tional five-year period. The Managers intend
for this program to address this challenge at
this particular time and do not intend for
such program to continue in perpetuity.
The Managers are aware of concerns that
prioritizing grants that are multi-state,
multi-institutional, or multi-disciplinary
disproportionately impacts the funding suc-
cess of projects for certain commodities
grown only in one state. The Managers en-
courage the Secretary to take appropriate
steps to ensure that meritorious proposals
are not denied solely because they lack one
of the enumerated priorities.
(35) Critical agricultural materials act
The House bill reauthorizes appropriations
for fiscal years 2019 through 2023. (Section
7501)
The Senate amendment specifies that
hemp, as defined in section 297A of the Agri-
cultural Marketing Act of 1946, is eligible for
funding under the Critical Agricultural Ma-
terials Act. The Secretary shall conduct,
sponsor, promote, and coordinate basic and
applied research for the development of crit-
ical agricultural materials from agricultural
crops having strategic and industrial impor-
tance, including for hemp. The Senate
amendment also reauthorizes appropriations
for fiscal years 2019 through FY 2023. (Sec-
tion 7401)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 7501)
(36) Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status
Act of 1994
The House bill amends section 532 of the
Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status
Act of 1994 to add to and update the defined
list of 36 tribal colleges as ‘‘1994 Institu-
tions.’’ The House bill reauthorizes endow-
ment funding, capacity-building grants, and
research grants for the 36 tribal colleges for
fiscal years 2019 through 2023. (Section 7502)
The Senate amendment is substantially
similar to the House bill with technical dif-
ferences.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment speci-
fying that the effective date for the updated
list shall be the date of enactment. (Section
7502)
(37) Research Facilities Act
The House bill amends the Research Fa-
cilities Act by: (1) amending the definition of
‘‘agricultural research facility’’ to strike ‘‘a
college, university, or nonprofit institution’’
and inserting ‘‘an entity eligible to receive
funds under a capacity and infrastructure
program as defined in Section 251(f)(1)(C) of
the 1994 Agriculture Reorganization Act’’; (2)
requiring proposals to demonstrate that the
recipient entity has the ability and commit-
ment to support the long-term, ongoing
maintenance costs of the facility; and (3) es-
tablishing a program to make competitive
grants to assist in the construction, alter-
ation, acquisition, modernization, renova-
tion, or remodeling of agricultural research
facilities.
The House bill also reauthorizes appropria-
tions under the Research Facilities Act
through fiscal year 2023 and provides that
funds appropriated remain available until
expended. The House bill prohibits more
than 25 percent of the funds under the Act
for a fiscal year to be made available to any
single agricultural research facility and lim-
its an eligible entity to receiving funds for
only one project at a time under the Act.
(Section 7503)
The Senate amendment reauthorizes ap-
propriations under the Research Facilities
Act through fiscal year 2023. (Section 7403)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7503)

December 10, 2018
(38) Competitive, Special, and Facilities Re-
search Grant Act (AFRI)
The House bill amends the Competitive,
Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act
by adding to the priority research areas of
the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative
the following: (1) soil health; (2) tools that
accelerate research in the use of automation
or mechanization for labor-intensive tasks in
crop production and distribution; and (3) bar-
riers to entry for young, beginning, socially
disadvantaged, veteran, and immigrant
farmers and ranchers. The House bill also
makes several amendments to relieve or im-
pose matching fund requirements for various
research purposes, reauthorizes appropria-
tions through fiscal year 2023, and increases
to 5 percent the amount of appropriated
funds that the Secretary may retain for ad-
ministrative costs. (Section 7504)
The Senate amendment adds the following
to the priority research areas: soil health
and automation or mechanization in the pro-
duction and distribution of specialty crops,
with a focus on labor-intensive tasks. The
Senate amendment authorizes the Secretary
to provide grants to carry out collaboration
in biomedical and agricultural research
using existing research models and reauthor-
izes appropriations through fiscal year 2023.
(Section 7404)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment striking
the changes to matching funds requirements
for various research purposes, which are
made in section 7614, and authorizes the Sec-
retary to provide grants to carry out col-
laboration in biomedical and agricultural re-
search using existing research models. (Sec-
tion 7504)
The Managers understand in July 2018, the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineer-
ing, and Medicine (NASEM) released its
‘‘Science Breakthroughs to Advance Food
and Agricultural Research by 2030’’ con-
sensus report which identifies five priority
research areas essential to developing a
more efficient, resilient, sustainable, and
competitive U.S. agricultural system. The
Managers urge the Secretary to utilize this
report to identify opportunities for addi-
tional agricultural research investments di-
rected towards the Agriculture and Food Re-
search Initiative (AFRI), NIFA’s flagship
competitive research program, which sets
the standard for scientific innovation in
these fields.
The Dual Purpose with Dual Benefit: Re-
search in Biomedicine and Agriculture Using
Agriculturally Important Domestic Species
is an interagency partnership grants pro-
gram funded by the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD) and the USDA. Both the USDA and
the National Institute of Health (NIH)
should be commended for developing this im-
portant interagency program. The Managers
strongly urge continuation of this partner-
ship given the sponsors use of farm animals
as dual purpose models to better understand
developmental origins of disease, fat regula-
tion and obesity, stem cell biology, assisted
reproductive technologies, and infectious
diseases, all of which directly benefit both
agriculture and biomedicine. This program
also strengthens ties between human medi-
cine, veterinary medicine, and animal
sciences, which is key to success of the One
Health Initiative.
(39) Extension design and demonstration initia-
tive
The Senate amendment amends the Com-
petitive, Special, and Facilities Research
Grant Act to establish a competitive grant
program to encourage the design of adaptive
prototype systems for extension and edu-
cation. Eligible entities for the grant are
State agricultural experiment stations and
land-grant colleges and universities. There is
an authorization of appropriations of $5 mil-
lion for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023.
(Section 7405)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment specifying
that the Secretary shall award grants each
fiscal year and that eligible entities also in-
clude a cooperative extension service and
making technical changes. (Section 7505)
(40) Repeal of review of agricultural research
service
The Senate amendment repeals section
7404 of the Farm Security and Rural Invest-
ment Act of 2002 that required the one-time
review of the Agricultural Research Service.
(Section 7408)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 7506)
(41) Biomass research and development
The House bill amends section 9008 of the
Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of
2002 by reauthorizing appropriations for each
of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. (Section
7509)
The Senate amendment amends the defini-
tion of ‘‘biobased product’’ to include carbon
dioxide intended for permanent sequestra-
tion that is a byproduct of certain commer-
cial and industrial products. It adds an ex-
pert in carbon dioxide capture, utilization,
and sequestration to the membership of the
Biomass Research and Development Tech-
nical Advisory Committee. In addition to re-
authorizing appropriations for each of fiscal
years 2019 through 2023, the Senate amend-
ment provides $3 million in mandatory CCC
funds for each of fiscal years 2019 through
2023. (Section 7409)

Matching Requirement—Extension
The House bill amends section 209 of the
District of Columbia Public Postsecondary
Education Reorganization Act to reinstate
the DC land-grant matching requirement.
The effective date of this provision is Octo-
ber 1, 2018. (Section 7603)
The Senate amendment also reinstates the
DC land-grant matching requirement, with
technical differences from the House bill.
(Section 7410)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7508)
(43) Enhanced use lease authority program
The House bill amends section 308 of the
Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Depart-
ment of Agriculture Reorganization Act of
1994 to transition the lease authority pro-
gram out of ‘‘pilot’’ status, to specify a June
18, 2023 termination date for the program,
and to require periodic reports not later than
June 18, 2019, June 18, 2021, and June 18, 2023.
The House bill also clarifies that the prohibi-
tion against public retail development ap-
plies to onsite public retail development.
(Section 7601)
The Senate amendment extends the lease
authority to terminate on a date that is 15
years after the date of enactment of section
308, and to require a report not later than 13
years after the date of enactment of section
308. (Section 7411)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment striking
the clarification for the prohibition against
onsite public retail development, estab-
lishing September 30, 2023 as the termination
date of the program, and requiring a report
not later than September 30, 2021. (Section
7601)
The Managers intend that the enhanced
use lease authority prohibit retail sales on
Agricultural Research Service (ARS) prop-
erty that generate foot traffic including, but
not limited to, food and clothing stores
where customers physically visit retailers
for an exchange of goods and services.
(44) Transfer of administrative jurisdiction, por-
tion of Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricul-
tural Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland
The House bill authorizes the Secretary of
Agriculture to transfer a parcel of real prop-
erty at the Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agri-
cultural Research Center to the administra-
tive jurisdiction of the Secretary of the
Treasury for the purpose of establishment of
Bureau of Engraving and Printing facilities
on the parcel and specifies the conditions of
the transfer, including requiring an appraisal
by Secretary of Treasury to determine the
fair market value of the parcel. (Section
7605)
The Senate amendment provides the Sec-
retary of Agriculture with authority to
transfer the same parcel of property to the
Secretary of the Treasury as the House bill.
The Senate amendment also specifies the
conditions of the transfer, but does not in-
clude an appraisal requirement. (Section
7412)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment requiring
that the Secretary of Agriculture enter into
a binding memorandum of agreement with
the Secretary of Treasury in regard to the
responsibilities of each party for evaluating
and, if necessary, remediating any hazardous
materials found at the parcel. (Section 7602)
(45) Foundation for food and agriculture re-
search
The Senate amendment amends section
7601 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 to require
the Board of Directors for the Foundation
for Food and Agriculture Research to ac-
tively solicit and accept any funds, gifts,
grants, devises, or bequests of real or per-
sonal property made to the Foundation, in-
cluding from private entities. It also re-
quires that the Foundation post its annual
report online and publish an annual stake-
holder notice with a description of agricul-
tural research priorities for the upcoming
fiscal year. Additionally, the Senate amend-
ment directs the Foundation to submit to
Congress a strategic plan describing a path
for the Foundation to be self-sustaining. The
Senate amendment requires the Secretary,
on the date of enactment, to transfer $200
million of funds from the CCC to the Founda-
tion, to remain available until expended.
(Section 7413)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment. The
amendment specifies that the Foundation’s
coordination of activities with Federal re-
search and development programs avoids
conflicts at the Department of Agriculture
and requires that the Foundation document
its consultation process with the Secretary
and include a summary in the Foundation’s
annual report. The substitute provides that
the strategic plan should include a detailed
plan for soliciting additional resources and
managing and leveraging such resources. The
Secretary is to transfer $185 million of funds
from the CCC to the Foundation on the date
that the Foundation submits its strategic
plan. (Section 7603)
The Managers recognize the work done by
the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Re-
search (FFAR) to leverage private funding,
matched with federal dollars to support pub-
lic agricultural research. It is the Managers’
intent that FFAR continue to plan for long-
term self-sustainability through comprehen-
sive strategic planning, ongoing public out-
reach, and donor solicitation.
The Managers intend for the FFAR to fos-
ter public-private partnerships among the
agricultural research community, including
federal agencies, academia, non-profit orga-
nizations, corporations and individual donors
to identify and prioritize the most pressing
needs facing agriculture.
The Managers are aware that FFAR is or-
ganized and operated exclusively for chari-
table, educational, and scientific purposes as
a nonprofit corporation consistent with sec-
tion 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
As such, no substantial part of its activities
may be to attempt to influence legislation.
FFAR has received funding provided by the
Federal Government. The Managers direct

that FFAR have in place management and
recordkeeping systems to ensure that no
Federal funds are used to carry out any ac-
tivity to attempt to influence legislation.
The Managers expect that FFAR will provide
any such records to the Committee on Agri-
culture of the House of Representatives or
the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,
and Forestry of the Senate, upon request.
(46) Assistance for forestry research under the
McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act
The Senate amendment amends section 2
of the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative For-
estry Research Act to include 1994 Institu-
tions that offer an associate’s degree or a
baccalaureate degree in forestry to be eligi-
ble for assistance for forestry research. (Sec-
tion 7414)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 7604)
(47) Legitimacy of industrial hemp research
The Senate amendment amends section
7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 to require
the Secretary to conduct a study on the
hemp research pilot program that includes a
review of the economic viability of the do-
mestic production and sale of industrial
hemp and hemp products, and to submit a re-
port describing the study to Congress within
120 days. The provision also repeals the hemp
research pilot programs one year after the
Secretary publishes a final regulation allow-
ing for full-scale commercial production of
hemp as provided in section 297C of the Agri-
cultural Marketing Act of 1946. (Section 7415)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that re-
quires the Secretary to submit a report de-
scribing the study not later than 12 months
after the date of enactment. (Section 7605)
(48) Collection of data relating to barley area
planted and harvested
The Senate amendment directs the Na-
tional Agricultural Statistics Service to in-
clude New York in the states surveyed for
the table entitled ‘‘Barley Area Planted and
Harvested’’ in certain reports. (Section 7416)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 7606)
(49) Collection of data relating to the size and
location of dairy farms
The Senate amendment requires the Ad-
ministrator of the Economic Research Serv-
ice (ERS) to update the report entitled
‘‘Changes in the Size and Location of US
Dairy Farms’’ published in September 2007.
As part of the update, it requires that the
Secretary include an expanded Table 2 con-
taining the full range of herd sizes detailed
in Table 1. The report shall be updated no
later than 120 days after the date of enact-
ment. (Section 7417)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment specifying
that the report shall be updated not later
than 60 days after the 2017 Census of Agri-
culture is released. Instead of requiring an
expanded Table 2, the substitute directs that
the Secretary, to the maximum extent prac-
ticable, use the same reporting measurement
of the full range of herd sizes in Tables 1 and
2 while protecting the confidentiality of in-
dividual producers. (Section 7607)
(50) Agriculture innovation center demonstra-
tion program
The House bill reauthorizes appropriations
for the Agriculture Innovation Center Dem-
onstration Program through fiscal year 2023.
(Section 6502)
The Senate amendment strikes subsection
(g) of section 6402 of the Farm Security and
Rural Investment Act of 2002 to eliminate
the requirement for the Secretary to use
$300,000 to support research on the effects of
projects for value-added agricultural com-
modities on agricultural producers and com-
modity markets. It also authorizes such
sums as necessary to carry out the program.
(Section 7418)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment specifying
that the Board of Directors for each Agri-
culture Innovation Center be composed of a
diverse group of representatives from public
and private entities, including four entities
representing commodities produced in the
State and may include a State legislator.
The substitute also strikes the report to
Congress and authorizes the appropriation of
$15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2023. (Section 7608)
(51) Smith-Lever community extension program
The Senate amendment amends the Smith-
Lever Act to permit the Secretary to provide
competitive grant funding to: (1) 1890 col-
leges and Tuskegee University; and (2) 1994
Institutions for the Children, Youth, and
Families at Risk program and the Federally
Recognized Tribes Extension Program. The
Senate amendment provides that the excep-
tion to the matching funds shall not apply to
the competitive grant funding awarded to a
1994 Institution for the Children, Youth, and
Families at Risk program and the Federally
Recognized Tribes Extension Program. (Sec-
tion 7419)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments making
technical changes and striking the changes
made to the matching funds exception for
1994 Institutions. (Section 7609)
(52) Grazing lands research laboratory
The House bill amends section 7502 of the
Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008
to extend from 10 to 15 years, the prohibition
on declaring Federal land and facilities at El
Reno, Oklahoma as excess or surplus prop-
erty or conveying or transferring such land
and facilities. (Section 7411)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 7411)
(53) Farm and stress assistance network
The House bill amends section 7522 of the
Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008
to reauthorize such sums as necessary for
each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. The
House bill requires ‘‘consultation’’ as op-
posed to ‘‘coordination’’ with the Secretary
of Health and Human Service, clarifies that
grants may be used to train individuals who
may assist farmers in crisis, makes Indian
tribes eligible for grants, and requires a re-
view of the program within two years after
the first grant is awarded. (Section 6003)
The Senate amendment authorizes the ap-
propriation of $10 million for each of fiscal
years 2019 through 2023. It clarifies that
grants may be used for training programs
and workshops for advocates and other indi-
viduals who may assist farmers in crisis. The
Senate amendment authorizes grants to be
used to enter into contracts with commu-
nity-based, direct-service organizations to
initiate, expand, or sustain programs and not
later than one year after the date of enact-
ment, requires a report by the Secretary of
Agriculture, in coordination with the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services, de-
scribing the state of behavioral and mental
health in farmers and ranchers. (Section
7511)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment making In-
dian tribes eligible for grants. (Section 7412)
The Managers recognize with the inclusion
of this provision that farmers and individ-
uals who work in agriculture face highly
stressful working conditions, which can con-
tribute to serious behavioral health con-
cerns, especially during downturns in the
farming economy. Historically, there have
been efforts to address these concerns, in-
cluding through programs characteristic of
the 1980s farm crisis and recognition of this
issue in the Food, Conservation, and Energy
Act of 2008.
The Managers recognize that in the ab-
sence of federal support for such efforts,
state and local organizations have worked to
address behavioral health concerns among
those who work in agriculture. The Man-
agers emphasize the importance of moving
quickly to get the Farm and Ranch Stress
Assistance Network operating effectively,
given current conditions in the farming
economy. The Managers intend that priority
be given to grantees with demonstrated ex-
perience and those that intend to collaborate
with organizations focused on behavioral
health concerns, including non-profit organi-
zations.
The Managers intend for this provision to
facilitate the development and positive im-
pact of a nationwide network accessible to
all farmers and individuals who work in agri-
culture and that priority be given to grant-
ees with this capability, including the State
cooperative extension services.
The Managers direct that USDA and the
Department of Health and Human Services
examine the problem of occupational stress
among farmers and individuals who work in
agriculture to develop a long-term strategy
and response.
(54) Mechanization and automation for spe-
cialty crops
The Senate amendment requires that not
later than 180 days after the enactment of
the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, the
Secretary conduct a review of programs at
the Department of Agriculture that affect
the production or processing of specialty
crops, and develop and implement a strategy
to accelerate the development and use of au-
tomation and mechanization in the produc-
tion or processing of specialty crops. (Sec-
tion 7514)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 7610)
The Managers note that labor availability
is one of the most critical challenges facing
the labor-intensive specialty crop sector
both in the short and long term. Committee
hearings in Washington, D.C. and field hear-
ings around the country have documented
the need for proper solutions for mechaniza-
tion challenges. The Managers therefore re-
quest the research agencies in the USDA
more vigorously fund this vital research pri-
ority through their respective programs.
(55) Experienced services program
The Senate amendment amends section
1252 of the Food Security of 1985 to rename
the ACES program the Experienced Services
Program. It expands the program to include
technical, professional, and administrative
services for the research, education, and eco-
nomics mission area at USDA. (Section
12305) The Senate amendment also termi-
nates the authority in section 1252 effective
on October 1, 2023. (Section 2408)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provisions with an amendment making
technical changes. (Section 7611)

December 10, 2018
(56) Functions and duties of the Under Sec-
retary for Research, Education, and Eco-
nomics
The House bill amends section 251 of the
Department of Agriculture Reorganization
Act of 1994 to add to the functions of the
Under Secretary for research, education, and
economics the requirement to ensure that
agricultural economics and statistical pro-
grams are effectively coordinated and inte-
grated and that such programs, along with
agricultural research, education, and exten-
sion programs, address the priority research
areas of the Agriculture and Food Research
Initiative. (Section 7602)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(57) Farmland tenure, transition, and entry
data initiative
The House bill directs the Secretary to col-
lect and report annually data and analysis
on farmland ownership, tenure, transition,
and entry of beginning farmers or ranchers.
It authorizes appropriations of $2 million
each fiscal year for fiscal years 2019 through
2023. (Section 7604)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(58) Simplified plan of work
The House bill amends the requirements
for the submission of plans of work by land-
grant institutions with respect to the use of
formula funds and state matching funds
under the Hatch Act, Smith-Lever Act, and
similar formula funds provided to the 1890
land-grant universities. It provides that the
procedures of such plans of work are not sub-
ject to audits to determine their sufficiency.
(Section 7606)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment that
strikes the changes with respect to audits.
(Section 7612)
The Managers expect that implementation
of this section will result in a more stream-
lined, concise, and less burdensome plan of
work. The Managers encourage the Sec-
retary to engage land-grant institutions in
the implementation of this section.
(59) Time and effort reporting exemption
The House bill exempts entities receiving
certain funds from time and effort reporting
requirements under part 200 of title 2 of the
Code of Federal Regulations with respect to
the use of such funds. (Section 7607)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments requiring
that the Secretary consult with the Office of
Management and Budget in reviewing and re-
vising the time and effort reporting require-
ments and that such revisions reduce the
amount of paperwork and time required
under the current reporting requirements.
(Section 7613)
The Managers are concerned that adminis-
tratively, land-grant capacity funds have
burdensome reporting requirements. Land-
grant capacity funding, provided via a statu-
tory formula, requires matching funds from
the states and is further supported by local
funding, enabling institutions to sustain re-
search capabilities and extension operations
in a manner that reflects the direct input of
local constituencies. The Managers note that
recipients of capacity funds operate under
various levels of oversight and account-
ability, including state and local govern-
ments, leadership within the colleges of agri-
culture, leadership within the university in-
stitutions, and most importantly, the local
constituencies they serve. The Managers en-
courage USDA to consider these factors
while reviewing and revising current report-
ing requirements.
The Managers encourage the administra-
tion to consider granting an exemption as
outlined in 2 CFR 200.102 to land-grant ca-
pacity funds. The Managers direct the Ad-
ministration to work with the land-grant en-
tities who receive capacity funds, including
representatives of 1862, 1890, and Cooperative
Forestry Institutions, in the implementation
of this section.
(60) Public education on biotechnology in food
and agriculture sectors
The House bill requires the Secretary, in
consultation with the Secretary of Health
and Human Services, the Secretary of Edu-
cation, and other appropriate persons and or-
ganizations, to develop and carry out a na-
tional science-based education campaign to
increase public awareness regarding the use
of technology in food and agriculture produc-
tion. (Section 7608)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(61) Matching funds requirement
The House bill amends section 1492 of
NARETPA by removing competitive grants
awarded under the Competitive, Special, and
Facilities Research Grant Act from among
those covered by the matching requirements
under section 1492. (Section 7130)
The Senate amendment repeals section
1492 and reinstates the matching require-
ments in place prior to the Agricultural Act
of 2014 for competitive grants awarded by the
Secretary under: (1) NARETPA; (2) Title XVI
of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and
Trade Act of 1990; (3) the Agricultural Re-
search, Extension, and Education Reform
Act of 1998; (4) Part III of subtitle E of title
VII of the Food, Conservation, and Energy
Act of 2008; or (5) the Competitive, Special,
and Facilities Research Grant Act. (Section
7601)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 7614)
The Managers intend to remove the uni-
versal matching requirement for competitive
grants established in the Agricultural Act of
2014.
(62) Research and extension funding equity for
recently designated 1890 institutions
The House bill amends section 1444 and 1445
of NARETPA to provide that any institution
designated as an eligible 1890 institution on
or after September 30, 1999 shall be deemed
to have been designated as an eligible insti-
tution on or before September 30, 1978, and
thus eligible for a proportional share of the
1890 extension and research formula funds al-
located among institutions designated as
such prior to September 30, 1978. (Section
7113)
The Senate amendment amends section
1444 of NARETPA to add a new subsection
(a)(5) authorizing additional appropriations
for one of fiscal years 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022
to ensure that an eligible institution receiv-
ing a distribution of funds under this section
for that fiscal year receives not less than the
amount of funds received by that eligible in-
stitution under this section for the preceding
fiscal year. It also requires that for 1 of fis-
cal years 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, if the 1890
formula would result in a distribution of less
than $3,000,000 to an eligible institution that
first received funds under this section after
the date of enactment of the Agricultural
Act of 2014 for a fiscal year, that institution
shall receive a distribution of $3,000,000 for
that fiscal year; however, it provides that
this requirement only applies if additional
amounts are appropriated under the new sub-
section (a)(5) for the prior fiscal year. The
Senate amendment amends section 1445 of
NARETPA in a similar manner. (Section
7602)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments. The amend-
ments establish a minimum additional fund-
ing amount for eligible entities in the fiscal
years following certain eligible entities’
qualification for $3 million. If there are in-
sufficient funds appropriated for section 1444
or section 1445 to continue the minimum ad-
ditional funding amounts for eligible institu-
tions, the substitute provides for a reduction
in allocations made to eligible institutions.
(Section 7115)
Additional Report Language
The Managers recognize the importance of
the aerial application of pest control tools.
These tools are useful not only to ensure
overall food safety and food security, but
also to promote public health through im-
proved mosquito control techniques. The
ARS Aerial Application Technology Program
conducts innovative research making aerial
applications more efficient, effective, and
precise. This program has yielded more effec-
tive public health control programs, as well
as increased efficiencies and greater crop
production. Research for aerial application
serves the public interest as a vital tool for
the future.
The Managers recognize the statutory in-
tent of the Food and Agriculture Service
Learning Program is to fund projects that
deliver experiential learning on food, agri-
culture, and nutrition education that require
significant investments in human capital
and evidence-based programming. As such,
the Managers encourage NIFA to maximize
grant size to ensure meaningful outcomes
and robust evaluation. The Managers recog-
nize the importance of community service
partnerships for developing and imple-
menting experiential food, nutrition, and
farm-to-school curricula. The Managers en-
courage NIFA to coordinate with other fed-
eral agencies engaged in national commu-
nity service programs when administering
the Food and Agriculture Service Learning
Program.
USDA is the federal government’s primary
agency charged with promoting good nutri-
tion and the delivery of food assistance to
Americans of all ages. There is strong evi-
dence that nutrition plays a vital role in how
a person ages. The U.S. has a rapidly aging
population. Research into nutrition benefits
aging Americans by keeping them active
longer, delaying or reducing the effects of
chronic illnesses and obesity, and reducing
health care costs for such diseases. The ARS
provides critical support for human nutri-
tion research through its nutrition research
centers. The Managers support the invest-
ment in human nutrition research, espe-
cially as it affects the aging population, and
expects ARS to continue strong support for
nutrition research and existing centers.

towards landscape-scale restoration. The
provision authorizes $20 million to be appro-
priated toward these grants each fiscal year
through 2023, to remain available until ex-
pended, deposited in the ‘‘State and Private
Forest Landscape-Scale Restoration Fund’’.
(Section 8101)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 8101)
The Managers include reforms to the Land-
scape Scale Restoration program. The Man-
agers direct the U.S. Forest Service to ad-
minister this program as a competitively
awarded grant program to carry out science
based, landscape-scale restoration work. The
Managers recognize the importance of con-
ducting landscape-scale restoration on both
state and private land in cross boundary
work. The Managers also encourage the U.S.
Forest Service to coordinate with the Nat-
ural Resources Conservation Service, State
Foresters, and other stakeholders on an on-
going basis regarding the administration and
identification of other applicable resources
for landscape-scale restoration.

other related authorities for projects, directs
interagency cooperation and encourages the
Secretary to use certain excess funds to-
wards these projects, including through
grants to state foresters, capped at the
greater of either 20 per cent of the excess or
$20 million. The bill provides that only laws
and regulations that apply to non-federal
land apply to a project. (Section 8332)
The Senate amendment authorizes cross-
boundary hazardous fuel projects, defines
certain terms, authorizes grants to state for-
esters, authorizes the Secretary to use other
related authorities for grant projects, directs
interagency cooperation and authorizes $20
million in appropriations for each of FY 2019
through 2023. (Section 8401)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 8401)
The Managers recognize the risks of cata-
strophic wildfire to life, property, and infra-
structure and have consequently provided
several new authorities, including this au-
thority to promote cross-boundary wildfire
mitigation, to the Forest Service to address
the threat of wildfire and promote restora-
tion of Federal and non-Federal land. The

program purpose. It requires that land be
private forest land or private land being re-
stored to forest land in its eligibility re-
quirements. It adds a species deemed to be of
greatest conservation need by a State wild-
life action plan. The bill adds an additional
enrollment consideration. It strikes limita-
tions on funds used for easements and cost-
share agreements. It authorizes permanent
easements to be used separately or in com-

hazardous fuels as a purpose. (Section 8407)
The Managers make improvements to the
Healthy Forests Reserve Program. The Man-
agers were concerned that duplicative ap-
proval requirements outside of initial ap-
proval and annual monitoring for manage-
ment practices in the Healthy Forests Re-
serve Program may be impeding the ability
of landowners to successful use the program
to its fullest environmental benefit. The
Managers direct the Natural Resources Con-
servation Service to work with landowners
to streamline the process around manage-
ment practices, ensuring that landowners
participating in the program are not re-
quired to seek approval for individual ac-
tions taken under their NRCS-approved res-
toration plans.
Additionally, the Managers intend that
when designing restoration projects using
the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003
or under other authorities authorized in the
Forestry title, the Secretary consider oppor-
tunities to restore sustainable recreational
infrastructure or access, or to accomplish
other recreation outcomes, where such op-
portunities are compatible with the primary
restoration purpose(s) of the project.

2023. It amends section 205(d) of the Secure
Rural Schools and Community Self-Deter-
mination Act of 2000 to reduce the member-
ship of RACs from 15 to 9 and to reduce the
members that are representative of commu-
nity interests from 5 to 3. The bill adds a re-
quirement for members of the RAC to reside
in the county or adjacent county where the
RAC has jurisdiction. It allows for a designee
of the Secretary to perform certain func-
tions. (Section 8202)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with modifications author-
izing RAC waiver authority and creating a
Regional Appointment Pilot Program. (Sec-
tion 8702)

lenges facing Resource Advisory Committees
(RACs) by bringing requirements more in
line with achievable benchmarks. The Man-
agers note that RACs are under-utilized
across the country and encourage the Forest
Service to highlight the new requirements in
outreach to interested communities. In addi-
tion, the Managers intend for the Forest
Service to proceed with the RAC re-charter
process and member nominations imme-
diately so they will be fully functioning
when reauthorized.
(42) Program for Title II self-sustaining resource
advisory committee projects
The House bill amends Title II of the Se-
cure Rural Schools and Community Self-De-
termination Act of 2000 by authorizing the

(57) Regulations regarding designation or dead
or dying trees of certain tree species on na-
tional forest system lands in California as
exempt from prohibition on export of un-
processed timber originating from federal
lands
The House bill directs the Secretary to
issue rulemaking to determine that unproc-
essed timber from NFS lands in California is
considered surplus to domestic needs and is
therefore exempt from export prohibitions.
It requires the Secretary to consult with rep-
resentatives of sawmills in California and
make a reasonable effort to avoid adverse
impacts to the industry. It allows the Sec-
retary to adjust contract provisions in re-
gion 5 of the NFS to carry out this section.

event and at least 75 percent of the impacted
land must be reforested within a 5-year pe-
riod. The Secretary must also allow for pub-
lic comment and objection before imple-
menting a reforestation activity or salvage
operation. Salvage and reforestation activi-
ties must be consistent with the applicable
forest plan. Courts are also prohibited from
issuing preliminary injunctions with respect
to salvage or reforestation activities in re-
sponse to large scale catastrophic events.

TITLE IX—ENERGY
(1) Definitions
The Senate amendment expands the defini-
tion of ‘‘biobased product’’ to include ‘‘re-
newable chemicals,’’ and expands the defini-
tion of the term ‘‘biorefinery’’ to include fa-
cilities that convert renewable biomass into
renewable chemicals, or an intermediate in-
gredient or feedstock of renewable biomass
into any one or more, or a combination of
biofuels, renewable chemicals, or biobased
products. Further, it amends the term ‘‘Re-
newable Energy System’’ to include systems
that produce usable energy from a renewable
energy source including distribution compo-
nents necessary to move energy produced by
a system to the initial point of sale, and
other ancillary infrastructure of a system
such as storage systems. (Section 9101)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 9001)
(2) Biobased markets program
The House bill prohibits federal agencies
from placing limitations on the procurement
of wood and wood-based products greater
than espoused in this section, authorizes to
be appropriated $2 million annually for fiscal
year 2014 through fiscal year 2023, and elimi-
nates the mandatory funding provision. (Sec-
tion 6402)
The Senate amendment transfers the pro-
gram from Departmental Management to the
Office of Rural Development. It instructs the
Secretary to update the eligibility criteria
used to determine which renewable chemi-
cals qualify to receive the ‘‘USDA Certified
Biobased Product’’ label within 90 days of en-
actment, establish guidelines for an inte-
grated and expedited process by which
biobased products can be determined eligible
for Federal Procurement preference and ap-
proved for the ‘‘USDA Certified Biobased
Product’’ label, and work with the Secretary
of the Department of Commerce to develop
North American Industry Classification Sys-
tem (NAICS) codes for renewable chemical
manufacturers and producers of biobased
products. Additionally, the amendment lim-
its other agencies from imposing procure-
ment limitations more restrictive than the
regulations contained within this section. It
instructs USDA to develop education and
outreach efforts to assist stakeholders in
navigating the federal procurement and vol-
untary labeling programs found under this
section, authorizes $3 million in appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year
2023, and reauthorizes mandatory funding at
$3 million for each year 2019 through 2023.

label from ‘‘90’’ to ‘‘180’’ days and strikes in-
structions to USDA to perform education
and outreach efforts. (Section 9002)
The Managers support elevating the
Biobased Market Program within the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and believe this
program is consistent with the mission of
Rural Development. The Managers urge
USDA to establish and promote public-pri-
vate partnership frameworks for Biobased
Market Program activities to increase U.S.
purchasing of biobased products that is nec-
essary to growth of the biobased sector. Allo-
cating funding to support public-private
partnerships would allow biobased manufac-
turers and allied stakeholders to identify po-
tential customers—ranging from military
bases to private-sector fleets and facilities—
to design and implement effective outreach.
The Managers also encourage USDA to fur-
ther promote and give a preference to the
procurement of agricultural biobased prod-
ucts within USDA Rural Development, in-
cluding rural housing and rural electrifica-
tion.
The Managers intend for USDA’s imple-
mentation of the integrated qualification
process that USDA evaluate within the year
additional standards available for the use of
renewable agricultural resources through
standard setting bodies, including inter-
national standards. The Managers intend
that USDA recognize feedstock inputs pro-
duced using biobased mass balance methods,
which USDA may accomplish through the
creation of a Biopreferred process label
specifying the percentage of biobased feed-
stock used.
The Managers intend that USDA continue
to develop and implement education and out-
reach efforts to assist stakeholders in navi-
gating the federal procurement and vol-
untary labeling programs.
Not later than 1 year after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall
establish a biobased content methodology for
products produced using biologically recy-
cled carbon that provides full credit for car-
bon content from biological processing of
carbon captured from an industrial source
that would otherwise be released into the at-
mosphere.
The Managers intend for the Biobased Mar-
kets Program to better function through in-
creased transparency, that the Secretary pe-
riodically update Congress on product pro-
curement trends of federal agencies and their
contractors to help ensure the program is ac-
complishing its mission.
The Managers believe the Secretary could
best implement the Biobased Markets Pro-
gram through collaborating with the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency’s Adminis-
trator on the Safer Choice label program to
provide agency procurement officials with
data on products that are certified biobased
and have a reduced impact on human and en-
vironmental health.
(3) Biorefinery assistance
The House bill expands the eligibility of
technologies to those being adopted in a via-
ble commercial-scale operation of a bio-
refinery that produces an advanced biofuel
or technologies not previously described that
has been demonstrated to have technical and
economic potential for commercial applica-
tion in a biorefinery that produces an ad-
vanced biofuel. It maintains authorization of
appropriations at $75 million annually for
fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2023 and
eliminates the mandatory funding provision
and biobased product manufacturing set
aside provision. (Section 6403)
The Senate amendment expands the defini-
tion of ‘‘eligible technologies’’ to tech-
nologies that produce any one or more or a
combination of advanced biofuels, renewable
chemicals or biobased products. It maintains
discretionary funding at $75 million for fiscal
year 2014 through fiscal year 2023 and reau-
thorizes mandatory funding at $100 million
for 2019 and $50 million for 2020. (Section
9103)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that pro-
vides $50,000,000 in mandatory funding for
2019 and $25,000,000 for 2020 and maintains an
authorization of appropriations of $75,000,000
through fiscal year 2023. (Section 9003)
The Managers intend that the program en-
titled ‘‘Biorefinery Assistance’’, which pro-
vides loan guarantees for the construction
and retrofitting of biorefineries, be available
to advanced biofuel, renewable chemical, or
biobased product manufacturing facilities.
The Managers expect the Secretary to im-
plement Section 9003, Biorefinery Assistance
as soon as possible in fiscal year 2019. The
Managers intend that the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget completes the review of all
loan proposals within 30 days of receipt.
The Managers expect the Secretary to en-
sure that all biobutanol manufacturers can
qualify for the biorefinery assistance pro-
gram as an advanced biofuel, regardless of
their feedstock.
(4) Repowering assistance program
The House bill authorizes to be appro-
priated $10 million annually for fiscal year
2014 through fiscal year 2023 and eliminates
the mandatory funding provision. (Section
6404)
The Senate amendment repeals section
9004 of the Farm Security and Rural Invest-
ment Act of 2002. (Section 9104)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 9004)
(5) Bioenergy program for advanced biofuels
The House bill modifies the equitable dis-
tribution portion of the program by limiting
the amount of payments for advanced biofuel
produced from a single eligible commodity
to not exceed one-third of the total program
funding available in a fiscal year. It author-
izes to be appropriated $50 million annually
for fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2023
and eliminates the mandatory funding provi-
sion. (Section 6405)
The Senate amendment amends discre-
tionary funding, providing $15 million for fis-
cal year 2019 through fiscal year 2023. It pro-
vides for mandatory funding at $15 million
for each year fiscal year 2019 through fiscal
year 2023. (Section 9105)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment that au-
thorizes $7,000,000 in mandatory funding for
fiscal years 2018 through 2023 and maintains
an authorization of appropriations in the
amount of $20,000,000 for fiscal years 2019
through 2023. (Section 9005)
The Managers urge USDA to utilize the
Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels to
make payments equally on all eligible ad-
vanced bioenergy production, replacing the
current structure that provides separate
payments for base and incremental produc-
tion. Public comments received during the
previous rulemaking process for this pro-
gram indicated the current structure creates
unnecessary and burdensome record- keeping
requirements. USDA never issued a final rule
and the program continues to operate under
an interim final rule with the existing base
and incremental payment structure.
(6) Biodiesel fuel education program
The House bill authorizes to be appro-
priated $2 million annually for fiscal year
2019 through fiscal year 2023 and eliminates
mandatory funding for the program. (Section
6406)
The Senate amendment authorizes to be
appropriated $2 million annually for fiscal
year 2019 through fiscal year 2023. (Section
9106)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 9006)
The Managers encourage USDA to con-
tinue to fund competitively awarded Bio-
diesel Education Program grants through ex-
isting annual budgetary accounts.
(7) Rural energy for America program
The House bill maintains an appropriated
level of $20 million annually for fiscal year
2014 through fiscal year 2023. It limits man-
datory funding to fiscal year 2014 through
fiscal year 2018 and provides a categorical ex-
clusion for electric generating facilities with
a capacity of 10 megawatts or less in the pro-
gram from having to prepare environmental
assessments or an environmental impact
statement. (Sections 6407 & 6408)
The Senate amendment allows for the pur-
chase and installation of efficient energy
equipment or systems to qualify for loan
guarantees and grants provided under this
section. It strikes the reporting provision en-
acted in the Food, Conservation, and Energy
Act of 2008. Additionally, the Senate amend-
ment reauthorizes appropriations at $50 mil-
lion for fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year
2023 and maintains mandatory baseline fund-
ing of $50 million per year. (Section 9107)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment clarifying
that agricultural producers are eligible for
loan guarantees for the purchase and instal-
lation of energy efficient equipment or sys-
tems for agricultural production or proc-
essing, clarifying limitations on the loan
guarantees for energy efficient equipment,
and establishing that total funding for these
systems shall not exceed 15% of the funds
available to the program. (Section 9007)
The Managers intend that for loan guaran-
tees made under Section 9007 (c)(1)(A)(ii) of
the Farm Security and Rural Investment
Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 8107), those loans shall
be made to achieve additional energy effi-
ciency beyond what the producer would oth-
erwise need to install. If the producer is
building a new structure for production pur-
poses, the additional efficiency should come
on top of what would already be required to
make a business case for the project to be
successful. Through guaranteed loans made
under (c)(1)(A)(ii), the purpose and goals of
the Rural Energy for America Program shall
be maintained by requiring additional effi-
ciency above a baseline determined by the
requirements under (c)(1)(A)(ii).
The Managers intend for USDA’s deter-
mination of applicability under (c)(1)(B) that
USDA compare only such equipment and sys-
tems that perform the same agricultural pro-
duction function.
When determining the applicability of
(c)(1)(B), the Managers intend that USDA
consider the availability of energy efficient
equipment or systems that could be used in
general for the same purpose. For example,
several options exist for high efficiency
lighting equipment that may be used in agri-
cultural production. However, if an eligible
producer wishes to apply for the loan guar-
antee to purchase or install proprietary high
efficiency lighting equipment that may also
be used to grow agricultural products, the
Secretary shall consider the proprietary
equipment as meeting the obligation of more
than one type of equipment being available.
The Managers recognize that the assorted
methods of renewable electricity generation
that qualify for financial assistance under
the Rural Energy for America Program
(REAP) are treated differently regarding
whether or not a given project may qualify
for a categorical exclusion from the need to
provide additional documentation under the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10010 December 10, 2018
Under current regulations solar, wind, bio-
mass, and various distributed technologies
have different standards.
The Managers suggest that, in order to
harmonize these regulations and facilitate
additional deployment of renewable energy
systems that do not have a significant im-
pact on the environment, the Secretary con-
sider an update of the relevant regulations
to allow any solar, wind, or biomass project
that has a rating of 10 megawatts or less, and
which has undergone an extraordinary cir-
cumstances analysis and submitted an envi-
ronmental report the Secretary finds accept-
able to fulfill the necessary requirements
under NEPA, to be designated as being cat-
egorically excluded from any requirement to
prepare or publish a ‘‘Notice of Availability
of the EA’’ or participate in a public review
and comment period. Additionally, the Man-
agers suggest the Secretary consider a simi-
lar harmonization and update of the relevant
regulations regarding the availability of a
categorical exclusion for small scale renew-
able and distributed energy projects that in-
volve no or minimal alterations in the phys-
ical environment and typically occur on pre-
viously disturbed land.
(8) Biomass crop assistance program
The House bill authorizes to be appro-
priated $25 million annually for fiscal year
2019 through fiscal year 2023 and eliminates
the mandatory funding provision. (Section
6411)
The Senate amendment adds algae as an
eligible material and clarifies material har-
vested for the purpose of hazardous woody
fuel reduction qualifies for matching pay-
ments. It authorizes appropriations of $20
million annually for fiscal year 2019 through
fiscal year 2023 and reauthorizes the program
with $25 million of mandatory funding for
each annual fiscal year 2019 through fiscal
year 2023. (Section 9110)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment that
adds algae as an eligible material under the
program. (Section 9010)
(9) Biogas research and adoption of biogas sys-
tems
The Senate amendment inserts a new sec-
tion after section 9011 of title IX of the Farm
Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002,
establishing an Interagency Biogas Opportu-
nities Task Force to coordinate policies and
programs to accelerate biogas research and
investment in biogas systems. It also author-
izes a study on advancing biogas markets
and analyzing data related to biogas sys-
tems. (Section 9111)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute does not adopt
the Senate provision.
The Managers intend that USDA coordi-
nate policies and programs to accelerate
biogas research and investment in biogas
systems, while also studying ways to ad-
vance biogas markets and analyze data re-
lated to these systems.
Not later than 180 days after the date of
enactment of the Agriculture Improvement
Act of 2018, the Secretary in coordination
with the Secretary of Energy and the EPA
Administrator shall establish an Interagency
Biogas Opportunities Task Force building
upon the existing Biogas Opportunities
Working Group. The Task Force will coordi-
nate policies, programs, and research to ac-
celerate biogas research and investment in
cost-effective biogas systems. The Task
Force shall be composed of the head of each
Federal office responsible for biogas research
or biogas system financing, including a rep-
resentative from the Department of Agri-
culture, the Department of Energy, the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency, and National
Renewable Energy Laboratory. The Task
Force will also have representation of 1 or
more representatives of State or local gov-
ernments, 1 or more nongovernmental or in-
dustry stakeholders, and a community
stakeholder.
The Task Force shall evaluate and improve
the coordination of loan and grant programs
of the Federal agencies represented on the
Task Force to broaden the financing options
available for biogas systems. It will also ex-
plore how to enhance opportunities for pri-
vate financing of biogas systems; review Fed-
eral procurement guidelines to ensure that
products of biogas systems are eligible for

programs of the Federal Government; evalu-
ate the development of North American In-
dustry Classification System and North
American Product Classification System
codes for biogas and biogas system products;
review opportunities and develop strategies
to overcome barriers to integrating biogas
into electricity and renewable natural gas
markets; develop tools to broaden the mar-
ket for non-energy biogas system products;
provide information on the ability of biogas
system products to participate in markets
that provide environmental benefits; iden-
tify and investigate research gaps in biogas
and anaerobic digestion technology; includ-
ing research gaps in environmental benefits,
market assessment; and performance stand-
ards; assess the most cost-effective vol-
untary investments in biogas to reduce
waste and methane emissions; and identify
and advance additional priorities, as deter-
mined by the Task Force.
Not later than 18 months after the date of
the establishment of the Task Force, the
Task Force shall submit to Congress a report
that identifies whether it was able to carry
out the duties outlined above and include
recommendations on how Congress should
prioritize policies and technological opportu-
nities, aimed at expanding the biogas indus-
try. The report shall also consider rec-
ommendations on how to eliminate barriers
to investment in biogas systems in the land-
fill, livestock, wastewater, and other rel-
evant sectors; and to enhance opportunities
for private and public sector partnerships to
finance biogas systems. Two years after the
establishment of the Task Force it shall
identify, collect, and analyze environmental,
technical, and economic performance data
relating to biogas systems, including the
production of energy of biogas systems, co-
products, greenhouse gas and other emis-
sions, water quality benefits, and other data
necessary to develop markets for biogas and
biogas system co-products. This data shall be
made public.

(11) Carbon utilization and biogas education
program
The Senate amendment adds a new section
authorizing the Secretary to provide grants
to eligible entities for educating the public
and biogas producers about the benefits of
carbon sequestration. It authorizes appro-
priations of $2 million annually for fiscal
2019 through fiscal year 2023 and authorizes
$2 million in mandatory funding for each
year fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2023.
(Section 9113)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that clari-
fies the objective of the public education
should be about the benefits and opportuni-
ties to rural businesses, communities, and
utilities serving rural communities. Further,
the amendment clarifies that eligible enti-
ties shall also provide education to agricul-
tural producers and other stakeholders.
Lastly, the amendment strikes the inclusion
of the mandatory funding provision. (Section
9011)
The Managers intend that grants made
under Section 9014 shall be made to agricul-
tural producers and other rural entities.
TITLE X—HORTICULTURE
(1) Local agriculture market program
The House bill eliminates Commodity
Credit Corporation (‘‘CCC’’) funding for the
Value-Added Agricultural Producer Grant
(‘‘VAPG’’) program. It also increases the au-
thorization of appropriations level for VAPG
to $50 million for each of FY 2019–2023. Addi-
tionally, the House bill eliminates CCC fund-
ing for both the Local Food Promotion Pro-
gram (‘‘LFPP’’) and Farmers Market Pro-
motion Program (‘‘FMPP’’). It authorizes ap-
propriations LFPP and FMPP of $30 million
for each of FY 2019–2023. (Sections 9002 &
6501)
The Senate amendment combines the pur-
poses and coordinates the functions of the
FMPP and LFPP established under section 6
of the Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Mar-
keting Act of 1976 and the VAPG grants
under section 231(b) of the Agricultural Risk
Protection Act of 2000. It directs the Sec-
retary to streamline and simplify the pro-
gram, as well as to connect producers with
local food markets and value-added agricul-
tural product opportunities. There is addi-
tional authority for grants to support part-
nerships. Section 210(i)(1) provides $60 mil-
lion in CCC funds for FY 2019 and each fiscal
year thereafter. Section 210(i)(3) requires 47%
of available funds to be used for farmers’
market and local food promotion grants.
(Section 10102)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that pro-
vides separate requirements to be considered
as an eligible entity for value-added pro-
ducer grants from the farmers’ markets and
local food promotion program. The sub-
stitute also provides for several program
purposes specific to the previous authority
for the value-added producer grants. Finally,
the amendment provides for $50 million in
CCC funds for FY2019 and each fiscal year
thereafter, to remain available until ex-
pended. (Section 10102)
The Managers recognize the increasing de-
mand for local food and value added produc-
tion, so the Conference Substitute includes
$500 million in mandatory funding for the
Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP),
which combines the Value Added Producer
Grant program (VAPG) and the Farmers
Market Promotion Program (FMPP) and the
Local Food Promotion Program (LFPP). The
Managers have provided permanent funding
for this program to ensure that the program
have baseline funding hereafter. The Man-
agers have agreed to form the LAMP to en-
courage USDA to utilize administrative effi-
ciencies and increase coordination between

Marketing Service (AMS) particularly
through state and regional USDA offices,
with producers who are eligible for these pro-
grams while preserving each program’s core
functions and constituencies. The Managers
intend for each program’s statutory author-
ity, mission, grant priorities and activities
to be retained as before. In addition to ad-
ministrative efficiency and increased coordi-
nation, combining these programs will pro-
vide additional support for local and regional
food system infrastructure, regional supply
chain coordination, and new food and agri-
cultural products.
The combined program includes a new
focus on regional partnerships to encourage
a multi-stakeholder approach to local food
system development, while leveraging addi-
tional funds and providing technical assist-
ance to eligible entities. The Managers in-
tend that grants awarded to partnerships be
received and managed by either an eligible
entity or entities or partner or partners de-
pending on the terms of the partnership
agreement or the application submitted to
USDA. One of the goals of a partnership is to
alleviate unnecessary administrative and
technical barriers for any applicant partici-
pating in a partnership. The Conference Sub-
stitute includes provisions regarding edu-
cation, outreach, and application assistance
duties for partners, which the Managers view
as an important component for developing
local and regional food systems in low-in-
come and underserved communities.
The Managers intend that eligible entities
for the farmers market and local food grants,
who participate in regional partnerships,
may apply for funding for both the partner-
ship and grant program in a single applica-
tion.
The Managers are aware of past stake-
holder confusion regarding the definition of
direct producer sales that do not involve an
intermediary such as a food hub. It is the
Managers intent to support the development,
coordination, and expansion of direct pro-
ducer-to-retail, direct producer-to-res-
taurants and direct producer-to-institutional
marketing as part of supporting the develop-
ment, coordination and expansion of direct
producer-to-consumer marketing through
LAMP.
The Managers recognize that farmer co-
operatives efficiently spread the benefits of
the VAPG, including within LAMP, among a
large number of producers in the aggregate.
Cooperatives by their nature bring many
producers together who individually do not
have the size, expertise and resources to take
advantage of the value chain beyond the
farm gate, and they give them the oppor-
tunity to profit from those down-stream ac-
tivities. Therefore, funds invested and the
benefits of projects generated by coopera-
tives through the VAPG are distributed to a
wide number of producers. Likewise, by in-
vesting in initiatives of cooperatives, such
projects lower the overall costs to the gov-
ernment in program administration per indi-
vidual farmer that benefits. Therefore, the
Managers direct USDA to continue to treat
cooperatives as a priority in administering
the VAPG of LAMP.
(2) Organic certification
The House bill directs the Secretary of Ag-
riculture (the ‘‘Secretary’’) to issue regula-
tions to limit the type of organic operations
that are excluded from certification. The bill
further requires the Secretary to modernize
trade tracking and data collection systems,
including full traceability, as well as a re-
port to Congress regarding investigations
and compliance actions. It authorizes the
Secretary to oversee and approve a certi-
fying agent in a foreign country and provides
for annual certification.
The House bill also directs the Secretary
to establish expedited and emergency proce-
dures related to food, crop, or human safety
for placing a substance on the National List.
The provision allows for an employee of an
owner or operator of an organic farming op-
eration to represent the owner or operator
on the National Organic Standards Board
(NOSB) and allows for the convening of a
task force to consult with the Food and Drug
Administration (‘‘FDA’’) or Environmental
Protection Agency (‘‘EPA’’) when deciding if
a substance that has been determined safe
within the meaning of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or determined by
the EPA to not be harmful, should be in-
cluded on the National List.
The House bill authorizes sharing of cer-
tain information during an investigation. It
also authorizes a certifying agent to require
additional information from a producer and
handler under certain circumstances, and au-
thorizes access to cross border documenta-
tion systems. The section requires the $5
million of CCC funds provided be available
for modernization of trade and data collec-
tion and to maintain current database and
technology upgrades. (Section 9006)
The Senate amendment directs the Sec-
retary to issue regulations to limit the type
of organic operations that are excluded from
certification, amends the definition of ‘‘cer-
tifying agent’’, and defines the term ‘‘na-
tional organic program import certificate’’.
The amendment requires an import certifi-
cation for imports represented as organic in
the U.S. It further requires the Secretary to
establish a tracking system, modernize trade
tracking and data collection systems, in-
cluding full traceability, and provide a re-
port to Congress on organic imports. It au-
thorizes the Secretary to oversee a certi-
fying agent in a foreign country and provides
the certification be for a period of time con-
sistent with the certification of a domestic
certifying agent.
The provision also requires that a vote on
an amendment to the National List receives
2/3 of the votes when a quorum is present.
The Senate amendment authorizes sharing
of certain information during an investiga-
tion and for the review of an accreditation of
an agent in a foreign country and provides
access to cross border documentation sys-
tems. It authorizes an organic agricultural
product imports interagency working group.
The section requires $5 million of CCC funds
be provided for data collection. Finally, the
section requires certain provisions be carried
out in a manner consistent with all trade ob-
ligations. (Section 10104)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment providing
for the oversight of foreign and domestic cer-
tifying offices as well as notice and process
regarding new and suspended certifications.
The amendment also adopts the House provi-
sion regarding additional documentation and
verification.
The amendment adopts the House provi-
sion regarding employees of an owner or op-
erator of an organic farming operation to
represent the owner or operator on the
NOSB. (Section 10104)
The Managers recognize that fraudulent
organic imports have the potential to un-
fairly damage the reputation of the National
Organic Program’s (NOP) organic certifi-
cation system and undercut domestic sales
of certified organic products. Therefore, the
Managers agreed to provisions from both the
House-passed bill and Senate Amendment
that are intended to provide the Secretary
with better data, information-sharing and
clarity of authority to identify and prevent
known compliance risks to the NOP, particu-
larly those imported from certifiers, han-
dlers, or producers not accredited or cer-
tified by USDA or covered under an organic
equivalency agreement. The Managers in-
tend for these measures to be consistent for
all products covered under the NOP. The
Managers adopted and are applying a trade
savings provision to ensure USDA implemen-
tation does not inhibit trade in organic agri-
cultural products that are otherwise cer-
tified and following NOP standards, as well
as other trade protocols.
The Managers encourage improved coordi-
nation between Federal agencies that over-
see import protocols and agencies respon-
sible for organic certification and enforce-
ment in order to ensure information sharing
and response in cases of potential fraud.
Since the NOP is a marketing and process-
oriented program, the Managers provide
funding for the Secretary to establish and
utilize more modern systems and method to
share data with other agencies both within
USDA, between the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS), AMS, and For-
eign Agricultural Service (FAS), as well as
outside of USDA, particularly U.S. Customs
and Border Protection. In addition, the Con-
ference Substitute adopts a provision au-
thorizing the Secretary to require producers
and handlers of imported organic products,
in cases of a known NOP compliance risk, to
provide additional documentation, including
an NOP import certificate, as long as this
additional information is not more than is
otherwise required under an equivalency
agreement negotiated between the United
States and the foreign government. The
Managers codified the oversight authority of
the Secretary to accredit certifying agents
operating in a foreign country as well as cer-
tifying offices and foreign operations located
within the United States. The Managers in-
tend for the Secretary to implement these
measures to be consistent with such stand-
ards and information as are required for do-
mestic producers and handlers within the
NOP.
The Managers appreciate the role of the
National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) as
an advisory board that is governed by the
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA)
and works with the AMS to consider and
offer recommendations on a wide range of
issues involving the production, handling,
and processing of organic products. The Man-
agers expect the Board and AMS to be trans-
parent and adhere to the best science and
technical assistance available, including
from other science agencies, to provide cer-
tainty and predictability to the agricultural
community and consumers.
The Managers codified USDA measures and
NOSB procedures, currently in practice, to
provide certainty to producers and users of
the NOP. The Conference Substitute adopts
subsection (e) of Sec. 10104 of the Senate
Amendment to require 2/3 of the votes cast
at an NOSB meeting at which a quorum is
present to be a decisive vote regarding
changes made to the organic ‘‘National
List’’. The Conference Substitute adopts
Subsection (c) of section 9006 of the House
bill to allow for an employee of an organic
farming operation to represent the owner or
operator on the NOSB. An employee of an or-
ganic farming operation, organic handling
operation, or organic retail establishment,
as designated by the owner or company, may
be any employee, including a farmworker or
minimum wage employee.
The Managers expect the NOSB, when re-
viewing potential amendments to the Na-
tional List, to consider the findings, sup-
porting data, and technical assistance made
available by the U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency to evaluate the safety and con-
sumer health effects of pesticides registered
for use, and consider the findings, supporting

data, and technical assistance made avail-
able by the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion to evaluate the safety and consumer
health of food additives. Given the continued
urgency in producer implementation of food
safety standards and requirements, the Man-
agers encourage the NOSB, while following
the material review requirements estab-
lished in the Organic Foods Production Act,
to establish procedures for timely consider-
ation and review of materials directly re-
lated to food safety compliance for inclusion
on the national list.
(3) National organic certification cost-share pro-
gram
The Senate amendment strikes the di-
rected delegation clause to the AMS and au-
thorizes $11.5 million of CCC funds for each
of FY 2019–23, to remain available until ex-
pended. There is no authorization of appro-
priations. (Section 10105)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that pro-
vides $24 million of CCC funds for FY 2019–
2023. (Section 10105)
The Managers recognize that organic cost-
share assistance is an important resource for
farmers desiring to transition into organic
production or to obtain organic certification.
In FY2017, the USDA transferred administra-
tion of the National Organic Certification
Cost Share Program from the Agriculture
Marketing Service to the Farm Service
Agency. During this transfer, USDA obli-
gated a fraction of the mandatory funding
made available for organic cost-share assist-
ance. The Managers direct the Secretary to
expend all carryover funding that was made
available for the National Organic Certifi-
cation Cost Share Program, from fiscal years
2014 through 2018, during fiscal years 2019
through 2023. The Managers also direct the
Secretary to develop and implement an out-
reach plan to reach organic farmers inter-
ested in organic cost-share assistance.
(4) Specialty crop block grants
The House bill amends the administrative
requirements of the program to include and
develop (in consultation with the Secretary)
an evaluation of performance through coop-
erative agreements with State Departments
of Agriculture and stakeholders to periodi-
cally evaluate the program. It authorizes the
Secretary to use $5 million each fiscal year
2018–23 towards multistate projects and adds
new grant purposes. (Section 9004)
The Senate amendment provision amends
state plan requirements to enhance the com-
petitiveness of specialty crops at the na-
tional, regional and local levels. It also in-
cludes performance measures in the state
plan developed by the State department of
agriculture, in consultation with stake-
holders. The Senate amendment requires the
state plan to identify best practices for
methods to enhance the competitiveness of
specialty crops, requires an application meet
the state plan requirements, adds an annual
evaluation requirement regarding perform-
ance measures for States receiving a grant,
and increases the cap on administrative ex-
penses to 4 and 9 percent for the Secretary
and States respectively. The section also re-
quires the Secretary to provide guidance to
States regarding best practices and priorities
prior to the submission of State plans each
year. It requires stakeholder input be used to
develop priorities and considered by the Sec-
retary as States develop a plan under eligi-
bility requirements, clarifies the Adminis-
trator shall administer funds of approved
multistate projects, and authorizes the Sec-
retary to use $5 million each fiscal year
thereafter towards multistate projects. (Sec-
tion 10107)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment that
clarifies the Secretary may directly admin-
ister multistate projects for applicants in a
nonparticipating-State and provides for the
evaluation of the grant program. (Section
10107)
The Managers intend for the Specialty
Crop Block Grant Program to be a state-
driven program that improves the competi-
tiveness and meets the priorities of specialty
crop producers. The Managers are cognizant
of the reporting challenges imposed at the
Federal level on States administering Spe-
cialty Crop Block Grants and have therefore
elaborated on those crop priorities to guide,
in a cooperative manner, grant applicants,
state departments of agriculture, and USDA
on the state plan requirements, performance
measures and evaluations needed to properly
allocate resources. To broaden specialty crop
stakeholder access to multi-state projects,
the Managers adopted a modification to
allow USDA to directly administer all as-
pects of multi-state projects for applicants
in a nonparticipating state.
(5) Plant variety protection
The House bill defines the term ‘‘asexually
reproduced’’, adds asexual multiplication as
an act constituting infringement of plant va-
riety protection, and protects asexual repro-
ducible plant material from certain acts in
connection with sale, offering for sale or ad-
vertising. (Section 9005)
The Senate amendment is identical to sec-
tion 9005(b) of the House bill. (Section 10108)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 10108)
The Managers recognize the importance of
expanding the scope of the Plant Variety
Protection Act to provide the same rights
and protections provided to breeders of
asexually propagated plants. The Managers
expect the Department of Agriculture to pro-
mulgate the necessary rules and guidance to
implement these amendments to the Plant
Variety Protection Act no later than 1 year
after the date of enactment of this Act.
(6) Multiple crop and pesticide use survey
The Senate amendment authorizes a mul-
tiple crop and pesticide use survey. (Section
10109)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with modification to include
$500,000 of CCC funding for FY 2019, to remain
available until expended. (Section 10109)
The Managers recognize the importance of
crop protection tools as crucial technologies
for helping farmers prevent, manage, and
eradicate pests and plant diseases that
threaten crop production yields. The Man-
agers intend for the Secretary of Agri-
culture, acting through the Office of Pest
Management Policy, to conduct crop and
pesticide use surveys for a variety of crops
for the use of risk assessment modeling and
mitigation for active ingredients. The Man-
agers intend for the multiple crop and pes-
ticide use surveys to be conducted frequently
and in a timely manner to allow the Office of
Pest Management Policy sufficient time to
respond to the Environmental Protection
Agency’s 60-day comment periods related to
pesticide registrations. The Managers direct
the Secretary of Agriculture to work with
the Office of Management & Budget (OMB)
to gain approval of a generic clearance for
the purposes of this provision to meet the re-
quirements of information collection review
under the Paperwork Reduction Act (and as
outlined in an April 7, 2010, OMB Memo-
randum for the Heads of Executive Depart-
ments and Agencies, and Independent Regu-
latory Agencies regarding information col-
lection under the Paperwork Reduction Act).
The generic clearance is necessary for the
Department of Agriculture to gather and ac-
curately communicate to the Environmental
Protection Agency information regarding
the agricultural community’s actual use pat-
terns and mitigations in order for the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency’s final deci-
sions to be more probabilistic and therefore
more accurate and data based.
(7) Clarification of use of funds for technical as-
sistance
The Senate amendment excludes technical
assistance under this title of the 2018 farm
bill from section 111 CCC cap. (Section 10110)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 10112)
(8) Hemp production
The Senate amendment provision amends
the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to
allow States to regulate hemp production
based on a state or tribal plan. The amend-
ment requires that such plan includes infor-
mation on locations of hemp production,
testing for THC concentration, disposal of
plants that are out of compliance, and neg-
ligence or other violations of the state or
tribal plan. It requires the Secretary to es-
tablish a plan, in consultation with the U.S.
Attorney General, for States and tribes with-
out USDA approved plans to monitor and
regulate hemp production. The section clari-
fies that nothing in this subtitle affects or
modifies the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metic Act or authorities of the HHS Sec-
retary and FDA Commissioner and clarifies
that nothing in this title authorizes inter-
ference with the interstate commerce of
hemp. (Sections 10111 & 10112)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendment, including au-
diting authority and a grandfather clause re-
garding program participation. (Sections
10113 and 10114)
In Sec. 297A, the Managers intend to clar-
ify, within the hemp production subtitle,
that hemp is defined as the plant cannabis
sativa L, or any part of that plant, including
seeds, derivatives, and extracts, with a
delta–9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) con-
centration of not more than 0.3 percent on a
dry weight basis.
In Sec. 297B, the Managers intend to au-
thorize states and tribal governments to sub-
mit a state plan to the Secretary for ap-
proval to have primary regulatory authority
over the growing and production of hemp.
The Managers do not intend to limit what
states and tribal governments include in
their state or tribal plan, as long as it is con-
sistent with this subtitle. For example,
states and tribal governments are authorized
to put more restrictive parameters on the
production of hemp, but are not authorized
to alter the definition of hemp or put in
place policies that are less restrictive than
this title.
Within 60 days of receiving a state or tribal
plan, the Secretary must approve or deny
the plan. The Secretary is required to con-
sult with the Attorney General regarding the
approval or denial of state plans, but the
Managers intend for the final decision to be
made by the Secretary. The consultation
with the Attorney General should not alter
the 60 day requirement to approve or deny a
plan.
The Managers authorized the Secretary to
audit state and tribal compliance with an ap-
proved plan and take corrective action, in-
cluding revoking approval, based on a state
or tribal government’s noncompliance, as ap-
propriate. The Managers intend to allow
state and tribal governments to appeal deci-
sions by the Secretary pertaining to a state

or tribal plan for hemp production and do
not intend to preclude a state or tribal gov-
ernment from resubmitting a new state or
tribal plan for consideration at a later date.
If a state or tribal plan is denied or revoked,
the Managers intend for hemp production in
that state or tribal area to fall under the
Secretary’s jurisdiction as authorized in sec-
tion 297C.
The Secretary is authorized to provide
technical assistance to states and Indian
tribes to aid in the development of a state or
tribal plan.
The Managers define negligent and other
types of producer violations that require en-
forcement under a state or tribal plan. The
Managers also set limits on who may partici-
pate in state or tribal plans. Any person con-
victed of a felony relating to a controlled
substance shall be ineligible to participate
under the state or tribal plan for a 10-year
period following the date of the conviction.
However, this prohibition shall not apply to
producers who have been lawfully partici-
pating in a state hemp pilot program as au-
thorized by the Agricultural Act of 2014,
prior to enactment of this subtitle. Subse-
quent felony convictions after the date of en-
actment of this subtitle will trigger a 10-year
nonparticipation period regardless of wheth-
er the producer participated in the pilot pro-
gram authorized in 2014. Additionally, any-
one who materially falsifies any information
in their application to participate in hemp
production through a state, tribal, or USDA
plan shall be ineligible.
In Sec. 297C, the Managers intend to re-
quire the Secretary to develop a USDA plan
or plans to be implemented in states and
tribal territories that forego developing and
submitting a state or tribal hemp production
plan. The Managers expect the USDA plan or
plans to meet the same content require-
ments as state and tribal plans in Sec. 297B.
The USDA plan may contain, as determined
by the Secretary, additional practices and
procedures that are otherwise consistent
with this subtitle. It is the Managers intent
that the Secretary have discretion regarding
the appropriate number of plans, one or more
than one, needed to implement Sec. 297C.
The Managers require the Secretary to col-
lect, maintain, and make accessible to Fed-
eral, state, territorial, and local law enforce-
ment, real-time information regarding the
status of a license or other authorization for
all hemp producers, whether participating
under a state, tribal, or USDA plan. The
Managers encourage the Secretary to de-
velop a memorandum of understanding with
Federal law enforcement agencies to define
the parameters of this system and to poten-
tially share the costs of such information
sharing system.
In Sec. 297D, the Managers clarify that the
Secretary has the sole authority to issue
guidelines and regulations regarding the pro-
duction of hemp. However, nothing in this
subtitle shall affect or modify the authority
granted to the Food and Drug Administra-
tion and the Secretary of Health and Human
Services under the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or section
351 of the Public Health Service Act (42
U.S.C. 262), including for hemp-derived prod-
ucts. The Secretary is required to consult
with the Attorney General on the promulga-
tion of regulations, but ultimately, the regu-
lations shall only be issued by the Secretary
of Agriculture. To ensure that the Secretary
moves forward with issuing regulations in as
timely a fashion as possible, the Secretary
shall periodically report to Congress with
updates regarding implementation of this
title.
While states and Indian tribes may limit
the production and sale of hemp and hemp
products within their borders, the Managers,
in Sec. 10112, agreed to not allow such states
and Indian tribes to limit the transportation
or shipment of hemp or hemp products
through the state or Indian territory.
(9) Recognition and role of State lead agencies
The House bill amends section 2(aa) of the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (‘‘FIFRA’’) to include a defi-
nition of ‘‘State lead agency’’ for the pur-
poses of FIFRA. It amends section 22(b) of
FIFRA by limiting regulations to those pro-
mulgated by the EPA or within the author-
ity of a State lead agency. The subsection
further amends section 23(a)(1) of FIFRA to
authorize States or Tribes to establish and
maintain uniform regulation of pesticide
through cooperative agreement with the Ad-
ministrator of the EPA (‘‘Administrator’’).
The section further amends section 24(a) of
the FIFRA to restrict the authority of a po-
litical subdivision of a State to regulate a
pesticide beyond the Federal limits. Addi-
tionally the House bill amends section
25(a)(2) of FIFRA by requiring the Adminis-
trator to publish any comments regarding
prescribed regulations promulgated pursuant
to FIFRA from the Secretary or any State
lead agency in the Federal Register, including
any response to the comments, if such com-
ments are received within 30 days of receipt
of a copy of any such regulation. The section
further allows for the Secretary or a State
lead agency to request that any comments
sent to the Administrator regarding pre-
scribed regulations promulgated pursuant to
FIFRA within 15 days of receipt of a copy of
the regulation, including any responses to
the comments, be published in the Federal
Register. (Section 9101)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(10) Pesticide registration and use
The House bill amends section 3(c)(5) of the
FIFRA to require the Administrator of the
EPA to register a pesticide if the Adminis-
trator determines that the pesticide, when
used in accordance with widespread and com-
monly recognized practices, is not likely to
jeopardize the survival of a federally listed
threatened or endangered species or to alter
habitat critical for the survival or recovery
of such species. It further amends section 3
to require the Administrator to use the best
scientific and commercial information avail-
able, which may include species and habitat
information from the Secretary of Interior
or Secretary of Commerce, and consider all
restrictions on use when considering the cri-
teria for the registration of a pesticide. The
Administrator shall not be required to con-
sult or communicate with the Secretary of
the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce
under the authority of any other statute
when making such determination, unless
otherwise petitioned by the registrant of the
pesticide. The House bill amends section
3(c)(7) of FIFRA to require the Adminis-
trator to conditionally register or amend the
registration of a pesticide under special cir-
cumstances if the Administrator determines
that the pesticide, when used in accordance
with widespread and commonly recognized
practices, is not likely to jeopardize the sur-
vival of a federally listed threatened or en-
dangered species or to alter habitat critical
for the survival or recovery of such species.
The House bill amends section 3(g)(1)(A) of
FIFRA to require the Administrator to com-
plete the determination, and subsequent
periodic reviews, that a pesticide, when used
in accordance with widespread and com-
monly recognized practices, is not likely to
jeopardize the survival of a federally listed
threatened or endangered species or to alter
habitat critical for the survival or recovery
of such species, over the following schedule:
by October 1, 2026 for an active ingredient
first registered on or before October 1, 2007;
by October 1, 2033 for an active ingredient
first registered between October 1, 2007 and
the day before enactment; and not later than
48 months after the effective date of registra-
tion for an active ingredient registered on or
after the date of enactment. The House bill
amends section 5(a) of FIFRA to require the
Administrator, when issuing an experi-
mental use permit for a pesticide, to deter-
mine that the pesticide, when used in accord-
ance with widespread and commonly recog-
nized practices, is not likely to jeopardize
the survival of a federally listed threatened
or endangered species or to alter habitat
critical for the survival or recovery of such
species. The House bill amends section 6(b)
of FIFRA to require the Administrator,
when issuing a notice to cancel or change
the classification of a pesticide, to determine
that the pesticide, when used in accordance
with widespread and commonly recognized
practices, is not likely to jeopardize the sur-
vival of a federally listed threatened or en-
dangered species or to alter habitat critical
for the survival or recovery of such species.
The House bill amends section 12 of FIFRA
to clarify that any taking of a federally list-
ed threatened or endangered species result-
ing from the lawful use of a pesticide deter-
mined by the Administrator to meet the cri-
teria specified in section 3(c)(5)(A)(v) is not
considered unlawful. The House bill amends
section 24(c) of FIFRA to require the Admin-
istrator, when denying a State pesticide reg-
istration, to determine that the pesticide,
when used in accordance with widespread
and commonly recognized practices, is not
likely to jeopardize the survival of a feder-
ally listed threatened or endangered species
or to alter habitat critical for the survival or
recovery of such species. The House bill di-
rects the Administrator to publish and con-
tinue to review a work plan for completing
required determinations and implementing
and enforcing registration standards. (Sec-
tions 9111, 9112, 9113, 9114, 9115 & 9116)

House provision with an amendment that es-
tablishes an interagency working group and
requires certain reports in section 3 of
FIFRA. (Section 10115)
(11) Use of authorized pesticides; Discharge of
pesticides
The House bill amends section 3(f) of
FIFRA to direct the Administrator or a
State to not require a permit under the Fed-
eral Water Pollution Control Act for a dis-
charge from a point source into navigable
waters. It also amends section 402 of the Fed-
eral Water Pollution Control Act by adding
new subsection(s) to prevent the Adminis-
trator or a State from requiring a permit for
a discharge into navigable waters of a pes-
ticide authorized under FIFRA except under
listed circumstances. (Sections 9117 and 9118)

H10014 December 10, 2018
Secretary of Agriculture or a State, local, or
Tribal authority to authorize the qualified
use of methyl bromide in response to an
emergency event. Subsection (a) also re-
quires that any State, local, or Tribal au-
thority that authorizes such use notify the
Secretary within 5 days of such determina-
tion. A State, local, or Tribal authority may
not authorize the use of methyl bromide if
the Secretary objects to the use within 5
days of the notification. The House bill re-
quires that a notification by any State,
local, or Tribal government contain a certifi-
cation of the authorization to use methyl
bromide in response to an emergency event,
a description of the emergency event and the
economic loss that would result from such
event, contact information for a designated
responsible individual of the authority, the
location of the emergency event including
the total acreage of the event, the identity
of the pests to be controlled, the total vol-
ume of methyl bromide to be used, and the
anticipated date of such use. It allows the
Secretary to object to an authorization of
use within 5 days of receipt of notification
by a State, local, or Tribal authority. The
Secretary shall provide notification of the
objection in writing, including reasons for
such objection and any additional informa-
tion that the Secretary would require to
withdraw the objection. The Secretary may
object to an authorization if the Secretary
determines the notification does not contain
all the information required, does not dem-
onstrate the existence of an emergency
event, or the qualified use does not comply
with the enumerated limitations on use.
Subsection (c) also allows the Secretary to
withdraw an objection if, within 14 days of
the transmission of the notification for au-
thorized use, the State, local, or Tribal gov-
ernment submits additional information to
the satisfaction of the Secretary. Upon
issuance of the withdrawal, the State, local,
or Tribal authority may authorize the use of
methyl bromide subject to the limitations of
qualified use. The House bill deems the pro-
duction, distribution, sale, shipment, appli-
cation, or use of a pesticide containing meth-
yl bromide pursuant to an authorization
under this section to also be authorized
under FIFRA, regardless of whether the use
is registered under FIFRA, and included on
the approved label for the product. The sec-
tion limits the amount of methyl bromide
that may be used per specific location of an
emergency to 20 metric tons. Further, the
aggregate amount of methyl bromide that
may be used in the U.S. in a calendar year
shall not exceed the total amount authorized
by the Montreal Protocol on Substances the
Deplete the Ozone Layer for critical use in
the U.S. in calendar year 2011. It allows for
the production or importation of methyl bro-
mide in response to an emergency event not-
withstanding any other provision of law,
gives the Secretary exclusive authority for
determining which species are considered
quarantine pests, and includes definitions of
relevant terms such as ‘‘emergency event,’’
‘‘pests,’’ and ‘‘qualified use’’. (Section 9121)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment that re-
quires a study on methyl bromide use in re-
sponse to an emergency event. (Section
10116)
The Managers intend that the Secretary of
Agriculture engage substantively with the
Secretary of State and the Administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency
throughout the planning and conduct of the
study, and in formulating any recommenda-
tions resulting from the study. The Man-
agers intend that the definition of ‘‘emer-
gency event’’ in this section only apply for
the purposes, and the duration, of the study.
(14) Preventing the arrival in the United State
of forest pests through restrictions on the
importation of certain plants for planting
The House bill addresses cooperation be-
tween the Animal and Plant Health Inspec-
tion Service and the Forest Service to inter-
cept tree and wood pests and would require a
report on the interception of forest pests.
(Section 9122)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment that au-
thorizes a report on forest pests. (Section
10110)
(15) Report on regulation of plant biostimulants
The House bill authorizes a report on plant
biostimulant products and defines the term
‘‘plant biostimulant’’. (Section 9201)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendment author-
izing a study including authority for the
Secretary to modify the description of plant
biostimulant. (Section 10111)
The Managers recognize the importance of
plant biostimulants as an emerging tech-
nology for production agriculture. The Man-
agers intend for the Secretary of Agri-
culture, in consultation with Administrator
of the EPA, States, and relevant stake-
holders, to provide a report to Congress that
identifies any potential regulatory, non- reg-
ulatory, and legislative recommendations,
including the appropriateness of any defini-
tions for plant biostimulants. The Managers
intend for this report to facilitate the regu-
latory framework for plant biostimulant
products and ensure the efficient and appro-
priate review, approval, uniform national la-
beling, and availability of these products to
agricultural producers.
TITLE XI—CROP INSURANCE
(1) Definitions
The Senate amendment defines ‘‘cover
crop termination’’ and ‘‘hemp’’ as used in
the Federal Crop Insurance Act (the ‘‘Act’’).
(Section 11101)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 11101)
(2) Data collection
The Senate amendment amends section
506(h)(2) of the Act to require appropriate
data collected by the National Agricultural
Statistics Service (NASS) and through the
Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Pro-
gram (NAP) be provided to the Federal Crop
Insurance Corporation (FCIC). The data
must be provided in an aggregate form. (Sec-
tion 11102)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 11102)
The Managers intend that any additional
information made available from the Farm
Service Agency (FSA) related to NAP
records, which could assist with new product
development, be shared with the applicants
under section 11103.
(3) Sharing of records
The Senate amendment amends section
506(h)(3) of the Act to require the Secretary
to share records with private developers of
crop insurance products who have received
payment under section 522(b)(2)(E) related to
crop insurance policy research and develop-
ment costs. (Section 11103)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 11103)
The Managers intend that the sharing of
records be limited to policies directly being
developed by the applicants.
(4) Use of resources
The Senate amendment amends section
507(f) of the Act to update the resources,
data, boards, and the committees the Board
should use within the Department, including
sharing information to support the transi-
tion of crops from NAP to crop insurance.
(Section 11104)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with modifications that add
board discretion and remove certain assess-
ment requirements. (Section 11104)
The Managers recognize that the Risk
Management Agency (RMA), Natural Re-
sources Conservation Service (NRCS) and
FSA serve a significant number of common
program participants. The Managers expect
the agencies to coordinate to avoid duplica-
tion, streamline or create common proc-
esses, and make participants aware of oppor-
tunities even if the participants are outside
that particular agency. For example, a pro-
ducer may have some crops that are eligible
for Federal Crop Insurance and others that
are eligible for FSA’s NAP. The Managers
encourage USDA to establish procedures in
both agencies to make sure producers are in-
formed of all of their options for coverage
without regard to which agency the pro-
ducers interact with first.
(5) Specialty crops coordinator
The Senate amendment amends section
507(g) of the Act to require the Specialty
Crops Coordinator to designate a Specialty
Crop Liaison in each regional field office,
and to establish a website focused on the ef-
forts of the FCIC to provide and expand crop
insurance for specialty crop producers. (Sec-
tion 11105(a))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a modification to re-
move specific requirements for the website.
(Section 11105)
The Managers intend for the website re-
quired under new section 507(g)(5) of the Act
to include an online mechanism to provide
comments relating to specialty crops and a
calendar publishing opportunities to provide
comments at specialty crop events or public
forums. The Managers also encourage the
Specialty Crops Coordinator to publish on
the website a plan, with projected comple-
tion dates, for expanding existing policies or
plans of insurance for specialty crops to new
crops, new areas, and by adding new revenue
options or endorsements.
(6) Addition of specialty crops and other value-
added crops
The Senate amendment amends section
508(a)(6) of the Act to require the manager of
the FCIC to annually prepare, to the max-
imum extent practicable, at least 2 of each of
the following: (1) research and development
for a policy or plan of insurance for a new
crop; (2) expansion of an existing policy or
plan of insurance to additional counties or
states (including malting barley); and (3) re-
search and development for a policy or plan
of insurance, or endorsement, for crops with
existing policies or plans of insurance, such
as dollar plans. (Section 1105(b))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a technical modifica-
tion replacing a description and an amend-
ment to decrease the number of required ac-
tions from 2 of each to 1 of each. (Section
11105)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10015
December 10, 2018
The Managers intend for this provision to
be implemented in coordination with other
changes that improve data sharing between
FSA and RMA. The Managers intend for NAP
data to be used to support expanding Federal
Crop Insurance to additional crops and, for
existing insurable crops, to additional coun-
ties. The Managers recognize that Federal
Crop Insurance provides significantly better
risk protection for producers and expect the
combination of these changes with the an-
nual review under this section to act as an
‘‘on-ramp’’ for producers to more robust risk
management options.
(7) Insurance period
The Senate amendment amends section
508(a)(2) of the Act to add hemp. (Section
11106)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 11106)
(8) Cover crops
The Senate amendment amends section
508(a)(3) of the Act to include a conservation
activity or enhancement (including cover
crops) that is approved by the Natural Re-
sources Conservation Service or an agricul-
tural expert. Requires that voluntary good
farming practices be considered a good farm-
ing practice only if the insured crop may be
expected to make normal progress toward
maturity under typical growing conditions.
It also provides standards for cover crop ter-
mination and summer fallow in relation to
insurability. (Section 11107)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with modifications to clarify
termination guidelines and provides that an
exception can be recommended by the Nat-
ural Resources Conservation Service or an
agricultural expert, as determined by the
Corporation, unless the exception is deter-
mined to be unreasonable by the Corpora-
tion. (Section 11107)
The Managers note that producers consid-
ering voluntary conservation practices like
cover crops, whether directly through a
USDA conservation program or informally
according to USDA’s recommended proce-
dures, should have confidence that following
the program guidance, procedures or advice
will not impact their insurability or protec-
tion under Federal Crop Insurance. The Man-
agers expect USDA to coordinate internally
and provide clear guidance to farmers,
agents and loss adjustors to ensure that
guidance, procedures, or advice regarding
voluntary conservation practices from one
part of USDA does not potentially put other
USDA benefits at risk.
(9) Underserved producers
The Senate amendment modifies section
508(a)(7) of the Act to: (1) clarify that the
definition of ‘‘adequately served’’ applies
‘‘by crop’’; (2) add a definition of the term
‘‘underserved producer’’ to mean ‘‘a begin-
ning farmer or rancher, a veteran farmer or
rancher, or a socially disadvantaged farmer
or rancher’’; (3) include a review of the types
of production common among underserved
producers and types of production, such as
diversified production for local markets; and
(4) require a report every 3 years to include
recommendations to increase participation
in states and among underserved producers
that are not adequately served by crop insur-
ance. (Section 11108)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a modification to add
Tribes and Tribal Members to the definition
of underserved producers. (Section 11108)
The Managers recognize that while under-
served producers are involved in a wide vari-
ety of agricultural production and crops,
many of these producers are concentrated in
certain types of production. Therefore, the
Managers intend for the Board to examine
types of production common among under-
served producers, including diversified pro-
duction for local markets.
(10) Administrative basic fee
The House bill increases the basic adminis-
trative fee to $500 per crop per county. (Sec-
tion 10002)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with modifications to set
the basic administrative fee at $655 per crop
per county. (Section 11110)
(11) Prevention of duplicate coverage
The House bill amends section 508(c)(1) of
the Act to provide that crops for which the
producer has elected Agriculture Risk Cov-
erage, or that are enrolled in the Stacked In-
come Protection Plan, are ineligible for cov-
erage based on an area yield and loss basis or
supplemental coverage. It also makes cer-
tain conforming amendments. (Section 10003)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(12) Performance-based discount
The House bill amends section 508(d) of the
Act to repeal the authority for performance-
based discounts for producers. It also makes
certain conforming amendments. (Section
10004)
The Senate amendment amends section
508(d)(3) of the Act to allow the FCIC to offer
premium discounts for practices that can be
demonstrated to reduce risk, considering
precision irrigation, fertilization, crop rota-
tions, cover crops, and other appropriate
practices. (Section 11109)
The Conference substitute deletes both
provisions.
The Managers note that Federal Crop In-
surance must be made available to all pro-
ducers at rates and prices set by the RMA.
Rebating is strictly prohibited by the Act,
with specific limited exceptions. This prohi-
bition against rebating, whether in the form
of discounts, incentives, or other induce-
ments, ensures fair treatment for all pro-
ducers. The Managers commend RMA for
taking the rebating prohibition seriously
and carrying out section 508(a)(9)(B)(iii) in a
manner that is consistent with Congres-
sional intent and current law.
(13) Enterprise units
The Senate amendment amends section
508(e)(5) of the Act to allow a producer to es-
tablish a single enterprise unit by combining
across county lines: (1) enterprise units; or
(2) all basic units and all optional units.
(Section 11110)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 11111)
The Managers do not intend for the new
section 508(e)(5)(E) of the Act to mandate en-
terprise units that would cross state bound-
aries. Further, the Managers do not intend
to change the Corporation’s authority to
offer enterprise units, beyond the authority
to combine enterprise units as provided in
new section 508(e)(5)(E).
(14) Treatment of forage and grazing
The House bill amends section 508(b)(1) of
the Act to strike the exception that provides
that catastrophic risk protection plans shall
not be available for crops and grasses used
for grazing. It also adds a new section 508D,
which permits separate crop insurance poli-
cies, including a catastrophic risk protection
plan under which crops that can be both
grazed and mechanically harvested on the
same acres during the same growing season
are eligible. Provides that such separate
policies can be independently indemnified for
each intended use. Additionally, the House
bill amends section 508(n) of the Act to spe-
cifically except coverage under the new sec-
tion 508D from the section 508(n) limitations.
(Section 10001)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with technical modifica-
tions to clarify the provision allows pro-
ducers to purchase separate policies for each
intended use, as determined by the FCIC, and
any indemnity paid under those policies for
each intended use shall not be considered to
be for the same loss for the purposes of sec-
tion 508(n) of the Act. (Section 11109)
The Managers note there are a suite of pro-
grams administered by FSA or offered by
RMA that address risks faced by livestock
owners and forage producers. The Managers
believe the Secretary should take into con-
sideration the different causes of loss cov-
ered by these programs when carrying out
the limitation on multiple benefits for the
same loss.
(15) Pasture, rangeland, and forage policy for
members of Indian tribes
The Senate amendment amends section
508(e)(7) of the Act to provide premium sub-
sidy at the rate of 90 percent for a member
of an Indian tribe for the first purchase of
Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage insurance.
(Section 11111)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.
(16) Continued authority
The House bill amends section 508(g) to re-
quire FCIC to establish: (1) underwriting
rules to provide producers with an election
to limit the decrease in actual production
history (APH) to not more than 10 percent of
the prior crop year’s APH, provided that the
production decline was the result of drought,
flood, natural disaster, or other insurable
loss; and (2) actuarially sound premiums to
cover the additional risk. (Section 10005)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 11112)
The Managers note that RMA has a long
history of offering producers protection from
a decrease of more than 10% in their APH.
The Managers intend for RMA to continue
offering this option to producers in conjunc-
tion with other APH adjustments in statute.
(17) Submission of policies and materials to the
board
The Senate amendment amends section
508(h) of the Act to authorize the FCIC
Board, in the case of a policy, pilot program,
and other materials relating to the produc-
tion of hemp, to waive the viability and mar-
ketability requirements under section 508(h).
(Section 11112)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 11113)
(18) Whole farm revenue agent incentives
The Senate amendment amends section
508(k) of the Act to provide an additional re-
imbursement to an agent that sells a Whole
Farm Revenue Policy. (Section 11113)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10016 December 10, 2018
(19) Crop production on native sod
The Senate amendment amends section
508(o)(2)(A) of the Act to provide that: (1)
during the period beginning on February 8,
2014, and ending on the date of enactment of
the 2018 farm bill, native sod acreage that
has been tilled for the production of an in-
surable crop shall be subject to 4 cumulative
years of a reduction in benefits. Addition-
ally, the Senate amendment provides that,
as a condition on the receipt of crop insur-
ance benefits, a producer that has tilled na-
tive sod acreage for the production of an in-
surable crop shall certify that acreage to the
Secretary using a specified acreage report
form and 1 or more maps, and submit correc-
tions or updates as appropriate. It also re-
quires the Secretary to submit an annual re-
port to the House Committee on Agriculture
and the Senate Committee on Agriculture,
Nutrition, and Forestry (the ‘‘Agriculture
Committees’’) describing the tilled native
sod acreage that has been certified in each
county and State. (Section 11114)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments to clarify
that native sod acreage that has been tilled
would be subject to a reduction in benefits
for not more than four cumulative years dur-
ing the first ten years after initial tillage.
The amendment also removes the option for
a governor of a State to elect to have the re-
quirements apply to the State, if the State is
not currently subject to the requirements.
(Section 11114)
The Managers intend for producers in
Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North
Dakota, and South Dakota who till native
sod to have either a reduction in crop insur-
ance benefits or have the land not partici-
pate in crop insurance for a significant pe-
riod. By making the reduction in benefits
cover any insurable crop rather than annual
crops, the Managers intend to remove the
possibility of a producer avoiding these
ramifications by planting a perennial crop.
(20) Use of national agricultural statistics serv-
ice data to combat waste, fraud, and abuse
The Senate amendment amends section
515(d)(1) of the Act to include the use of pub-
lished aggregate data from NASS or any
other data source to: (1) detect yield dispari-
ties or other data anomalies that indicate
potential fraud; and (2) target the relevant
counties, crops, regions, companies, or
agents associated with that potential fraud
for audits and other enforcement actions.
(Section 11115)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 11115)
The Managers encourage the FCIC to in-
corporate or include published aggregate
data from the NASS in existing data mining
efforts and other activities to combat waste,
fraud, and abuse. The Managers do not in-
tend for the additional data sets to dupli-
cate, substitute, or replace ongoing fraud re-
duction efforts and activities, such as data
mining currently carried out by the Center
for Agribusiness Excellence.
(21) Submission of information to corporation
The Senate amendment amends section
515(g) of the Act to require Approved Insur-
ance Providers (‘‘AIPs’’) to submit to FCIC
the actual production history used to estab-
lish insurable yields not later than 30 days
after the applicable production reporting
date for the crop to be insured. (Section
11116)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment to limit
the submission requirements with respect to
a policy for a covered commodity (as defined
in section 1111 of the Agricultural Act of 2014
(7 U.S.C. 9011)) and to allow AIPs the ability
to correct errors in the information. (Section
11116)
The Managers intend for the FCIC to es-
tablish procedures to collect actual produc-
tion history to be used to establish insurable
yields from AIPs. The Managers intend for
the information to be shared with FSA for
use in administering commodity programs.
The Managers expect the FCIC to implement
this provision in a reasonable manner with-
out penalty to producers or AIPs, while con-
tinuing to allow AIPs the ability to correct

(22) Acreage report streamlining initiative
The Senate amendment amends section
515(j)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act to: (1) provide that
producers may report acreage and other in-
formation to the Department electronically
(including in the form of geospatial data) or
conventionally; (2) require the Administra-
tors of the RMA and the FSA to implement
a consistent method for determining crop
acreage, acreage yields, farm acreage, prop-
erty descriptions, and other common infor-
mational requirements, including measures
of common land units; and (3) require each
AIP to accept from a producer or an author-
ized agent of a producer reports of crop acre-
age, acreage yields, and other information
electronically (including in the form of
geospatial data) or conventionally. (Section
11117)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.
The Managers note that direction on this
joint initiative between RMA and FSA has
been consolidated in title I. The Managers
expect RMA and the FCIC to continue to co-
ordinate with FSA and to make significant
progress to streamline processes for pro-
ducers.
(23) Continuing education for loss adjusters and
agents
The Senate amendment amends section 515
of the Act to further require FCIC to estab-
lish requirements for continuing education
for loss adjusters and agents of AIPs to en-
sure that both are familiar with appropriate
conservation activities and agronomic prac-
tices that are common and appropriate to
the area in which the insured crop being in-
spected is produced, and include organic and
sustainable practices. (Section 11118)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a modification to
broaden the education topics. (Section 11117)
(24) Funding for information technology
The Senate amendment bill amends sec-
tion 515(k) of the Act to provide $1 million
for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2020. (Section
11119)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute deletes the Sen-
ate amendment.
(25) Program administration
The House bill reduces the amount that
FCIC may use under section 516(b)(2)(C)(i) to
not more than $7 million per fiscal year.
(Section 11119)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 11118)
(26) Agricultural commodity
The Senate amendment adds hemp to the
list of commodities enumerated in section
518. (Section 11120)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 11119)
The Managers expect that in determining
the insurability of a crop of hemp under the
Act, and in providing insurance options to
hemp producers, RMA will collaborate with
the appropriate USDA, state, or tribal au-
thorities as necessary to do so consistent
with the regulations and guidelines estab-
lished in subtitle G of the Agricultural Mar-
keting Act of 1946. The Managers note that
USDA or the appropriate state or tribal au-
thority, and not AIPs, agents, or loss adjust-
ers, bear the responsibility of determining
that a crop grown as hemp complies with the
applicable regulations and guidelines under
Subtitle G.
The Managers also intend for
‘‘aquacultural species’’ to include algae spe-
cies as determined appropriate by the Board.
(27) Maintenance of policies; Reimbursement of
research, development, and maintenance
costs
House bill section 10007(a) amends section
522(b) of the Act to—
(1) allow for reimbursement of ‘‘reasonable
and actual research and development costs’’
for policies that have been approved by the
FCIC Board;
(2) require that costs of the applicant shall
be considered ‘‘reasonable and actual costs’’
if the costs are based on—
(A) wage rates equal to 2 times the hourly
wage rate plus benefits, as provided by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics; or
(B) actual documented costs incurred by
the applicant;
(3) designate the applicant (as opposed to
the AIP) authority to determine whether to
maintain a policy, and to establish the fee to
be paid for maintenance of the policy;
(4) require the FCIC Board to approve the
amount of a fee unless the Board determines,
based on substantial evidence in the record,
that the amount of the fee unnecessarily in-
hibits the use of the policy; and
(5) prohibit the FCIC Board from dis-
approving a user fee based on its comparison
to a maintenance fee, or on the potential for
the fee to result in a financial gain or loss to
the applicant.
The House bill also provides that the
amendments shall apply to reimbursement
requests made on or after October 1, 2016, and
that requests for reimbursement previously
denied between October 1, 2016, and the date
of enactment of this Act may be resub-
mitted. (Section 10007).
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendments to clarify
reasonable costs apply to any employees or
contracted personnel costs. The amendment
also modifies the requirements for the Board
to approve or disapprove the amount of a
maintenance fee, by including that the fee
shall remain in effect and not be reviewed by
the Board unless specified criteria are met.
(Section 11120)
The Managers believe the remuneration
provided to the submitters of policies devel-
oped under the 508(h) process ensures that
underserved commodities have a fair oppor-
tunity to benefit from innovative risk man-
agement solutions. The Managers expect
RMA and the FCIC Board to work with pri-
vate submitters and those maintaining the
policies developed to determine fair com-
pensation for work on these policies.
(28) Maintenance of policies; reimbursement of
research, development, and maintenance
costs
The Senate amendment amends 522(b) of
the Act to waive the viability and market-
ability requirements for hemp under para-
graphs (2) and (3). (Section 11121)

December 10, 2018
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 11121)
(29) Research and development priorities and
authorities
The House bill amends paragraph (7) of the
Act (as redesignated from current paragraph
(19)) to define ‘‘beginning farmer or rancher’’
for purposes of research and development of
whole farm insurance plans as having ac-
tively operated and managed a farm or ranch
for less than 10 years. This is longer for these
purposes than the Act’s underlying defini-
tion as having actively operated and man-
aged a farm or ranch for up to 5 years. (Sec-
tion 10008)
The Senate amendment amends paragraph
(7) (as redesignated from current paragraph
(19)) of the Act to require FCIC, within 2
years, to hold stakeholder meetings to so-
licit feedback, review and modify procedures
and paperwork requirements to decrease bur-
dens, and increase flexibility and effective-
ness. (Section 11122)
The Conference substitute adopts both pro-
visions with amendments to include addi-
tional factors the FCIC Board shall consider
during review of the whole farm revenue pro-
tection policy. (Section 11122)
The Managers note the continued growth
of Whole Farm Revenue Policies (WFRP).
The Managers believe that this policy has
the potential to provide vital risk manage-
ment to producers who are underserved by
crop insurance and enhance options for exist-
ing policy holders. The Managers note that
WFRP has the potential to provide meaning-
ful risk protection for non-traditional agri-
cultural commodities (e.g. aquaculture) or
production and marketing systems (e.g.
urban, local food, or greenhouses), that are
not served as well under current yield or rev-
enue-based policies for individual crops.
The Managers believe that RMA should
make WFRP policies more effective. In car-
rying out the review described in new section
522(c)(7)(E) of the Act, the Managers urge
RMA to expedite the analysis of removing
the cap on livestock and nursery revenue, in-
corporating crop insurance indemnities and
NAP payments into historical revenue, and
allowing all producers, regardless of total
average revenue, to insure up to the max-
imum amount of liability. Additionally, the
Managers expect RMA to solicit input from
the diverse group of producers participating
in WFRP and take appropriate steps to
streamline, add flexibility or tailor program
rules to diverse producers’ needs and cir-
cumstances.
The Managers also expect RMA to work
with FSA to notify the existing beginning
farmers registered with FSA of the addi-
tional benefits under WFRP related to the
newly aligned beginning farmer definition.
(30) Tropical storm or hurricane insurance
The House bill adds a new section 522(c)(9)
of the Act to require FCIC to enter into 1 or
more contracts with qualified entities to
carry out research and development of poli-
cies (including for tomato, pepper, and citrus
crops) (1) against losses due to a tropical
storm or hurricane; (2) to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of a risk management tool for a low
frequency, catastrophic loss weather event;
and (3) to provide protection for production
or revenue losses, or both. (Section 10008(c))
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with technical modifica-
tions. (Section 11122)
The Managers note hurricanes and tropical
storms caused significant agricultural dam-
age in 2017 and 2018 to crops with high levels
of crop insurance participation, but low lev-
els of coverage, which led to passage of addi-
tional ad hoc disaster assistance. The Man-
agers expect RMA to identify policies that
could provide cost effective insurance op-
tions for catastrophic weather events such as
tropical storms and hurricanes to alleviate
the need for such disaster assistance in the
future.
(31) Subsurface irrigation practices
The House bill adds a new section 522(c)(10)
of the Act to require that FCIC offer to enter
into a contract with a qualified entity to
conduct research and development on the
creation of a separate practice for subsurface
irrigation, including the establishment of a
separate transitional yield within the county
that is reflective of the average gain in pro-
ductivity and yield associated with the in-
stallation of a subsurface irrigation system.
(Section 10008(c))
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with technical modifica-
tions. (Section 11122)
The Managers note that instantaneous
gains in productivity can be achieved
through the adoption of subsurface irriga-
tion systems. The Managers expect these
methods to be carefully examined and, if ap-
propriate, treated as a separate irrigation
practice so that a producer’s APH may more
accurately reflect the yield and revenue po-
tential of the crop following the installation
of such system.
(32) Irrigated grain sorghum crop insurance pol-
icy
The Senate amendment adds a new section
522(c)(9) of the Act to require FCIC to carry
out, or to enter into 1 or more contracts with
qualified entities to carry out, research and
development regarding improvements to 1 or
more policies to insure irrigated grain sor-
ghum, and alternative methods for producers
with not more than 4 years of production his-
tory to insure irrigated grain sorghum. It
also requires the FCIC to submit within 1
year to the Agriculture Committees a report
that describes the results of the study and
any related recommendations. (Section
11122(4))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with technical modifications
and an amendment to study grain sorghum
rates and yields compared to policies for
other feed grains. (Section 11112)
(33) Study and report on grain sorghum rates
and yields
The House bill adds a news section
522(c)(11) of the Act to require that FCIC
enter into a contract with a qualified entity
to conduct a study to assess the differences
in rates, average yields, and coverage levels
of grain sorghum policies as compared to
other feed grains within a county. It also re-
quires FCIC to submit to the Agriculture
Committees a report that describes the re-
sults of the study within 1 year. (Section
10008(c))
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute deletes the
House provision.
(34) Limited irrigation practices
The Senate amendment adds a new section
522(c)(10) of the Act to require FCIC to: ex-
pand the availability of the limited irriga-
tion insurance program to not fewer than 2
neighboring States; carry out, or offer to
enter into 1 or more contracts with 1 or more
qualified persons to carry out, research on
the marketability of the existing limited ir-
rigation insurance program; and make rec-
ommendations on how to improve participa-
tion in the program. It also requires a quali-
fied person, in carrying out the research, to
collaborate with certain researchers, and
State and Federal officials; provide rec-
ommendations to encourage limited irriga-
tion and water conservation; and develop ap-
plicable web-based applications. Addition-
ally, the section requires FCIC to submit
within 18 months to the Agriculture Com-
mittees a report that describes the results of
the study, recommendations, and any ac-
tions taken by FCIC to carry out the rec-
ommendations. (Section 11122(10))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendments to include
‘‘consider expanding’’ and remove the re-
quirement of expansion to not fewer than
two states. (Section 11122)
(35) Quality loss
The House bill adds a new section 522(c)(12)
to the Act to require that FCIC offer to enter
into a contract with a qualified entity to
conduct research and development on the es-
tablishment of an alternative method of ad-
justing for quality losses that does not im-
pact the average production history of pro-
ducers. Notwithstanding subsections (g) and
(m) of section 508 of the Act, it requires that
if FCIC uses any method developed as a re-
sult of the contract to adjust for quality
losses, such method shall be optional for pro-
ducers to elect to use, and offered at an actu-
arially sound premium rate. (Section
10008(c))
The Senate amendment adds a new section
522(c)(11) to the Act to require FCIC to carry
out, or offer to enter into 1 or more con-
tracts with 1 or more qualified persons to
carry out, research and development on es-
tablishing alternative methods of adjusting
for quality losses.
Notwithstanding subsections (g) and (m) of
section 508 of the Act, any method developed
under the research and development that is
used by FCIC shall be optional for a producer
to use, and offered at an actuarially sound
premium rate. The section states not later
than 1 year after the date of enactment,
FCIC shall submit to the Agriculture Com-
mittees a report that describes the results of
the research and development. (Section
11122(4))
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a modification regard-
ing actual loss. (Section 11122)
The Managers intend for the research and
development required under new section
522(c)(10) of the Act to include, but not be
limited to, wheat for alternative methods of
adjusting for quality losses. The Managers
also intend the requirements in subpara-
graph (B) of the new section 522(c)(10) to be
considered during the research and develop-
ment.
(36) Citrus
The Senate amendment adds a new section
522(c)(12) to the Act to require FCIC to carry
out, or offer to enter into 1 or more con-
tracts with 1 or more qualified persons to
carry out, research and development on the
insurance of citrus fruit, including improve-
ments to 1 or more existing policies, includ-
ing the Whole-Farm Revenue Protection
pilot policy; alternative methods of insuring
revenue for citrus; and the development of
new, or expansion of existing, revenue poli-
cies for citrus fruit. It requires FCIC to sub-
mit within 1 year to the Agriculture Com-
mittees a report that describes the results of

The Senate amendment adds a new section
522(c)(13) to the Act to require FCIC to carry
out, or offer to enter into 1 or more con-
tracts with 1 or more qualified persons to
carry out, research and development on a
policy to insure in a controlled environment
such as a greenhouse the production of flori-
culture, nursery, and bedding plants; or the
establishment of cuttings, seedlings or tissue
culture in a growing medium. It requires
FCIC to make a policy or plan of insurance
available notwithstanding law that other-
wise requires that: losses must be due to
drought, flood, or other natural disaster
(508(a)(1)); and insurance shall not extend be-
yond the period during which the insured
commodity is in the field. The section re-
quires FCIC to submit within 1 year to the
Agriculture Committees a report that de-
scribes the results of the research and devel-
opment and any related recommendations.
(Section 11122(4))
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 11122)
The Managers intend for the research and
development to consider policies or plans for
coverage that are limited to losses outside of
the producer’s control or management, and
that the producer follow good farming prac-
tices. The Managers expect RMA to consider
all potential eligible losses and encourage
the review of circumstances related to the
Ralstonia outbreak in 2005 in Michigan and
other states as it develops a policy.
(38) Hops
The Senate amendment adds a new section
522(c)(14) to the Act to require FCIC to carry
out, or to enter into 1 or more contracts with
qualified persons to carry out, research and
development regarding a policy to insure the
production of hops or revenue derived from
the production of hops. It requires FCIC to
submit within 1 year to the Agriculture
Committees a report that describes the re-
sults of the research and development and
any related recommendations. (Section

bill established a Textile Trust Fund, of
which the Sheep Marketing and Production
Grant Program was an underlying sub-
section. The Conference substitute provides
$2 million in CCC mandatory funds for FY
2019 to carry out section 209 of the Agricul-
tural Act of 1946, to remain available until
expended, but does so within the existing au-
thority, rather than as a subsection of a Tex-
tile Trust Fund. (Section 12102)
(2) National Animal Health Laboratory Network

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10019
December 10, 2018
The Senate amendment amends section
10409A(d) to increase the authorization of ap-
propriations to $30 million per year for fiscal
years 2019 through 2023. (Section 12102)
The Conference substitute amends the ex-
isting NAHLN authority to establish a pro-
gram addressing animal disease prevention
and management. It further establishes the
National Animal Disease Preparedness and
Response Program (NADPRP) and the Na-
tional Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Coun-
termeasures Bank (NAVVCB). The substitute
provides $120 million of mandatory funding
for the period of fiscal years 2019–2022, of
which $100 million is to be allocated among
the NAHLN, the NADPRP and the NAVVCB.
It further provides $30 million of mandatory
funding for fiscal year 2023 and each year
thereafter, of which $12 million is to be allo-
cated among the NAHLN, the NADPRP and
the NAVVCB. Additionally, the authoriza-
tion for appropriations for the NAHLN is in-
creased to $30 million per year for fiscal
years 2019–2023, to remain available until ex-
pended. Finally, conforming amendments are
made to the existing authorization for appro-
priations for NAHLN in section 10409A (Sec-
tion 12101).
The National Animal Health Laboratory
Network (NAHLN) serves to connect state,
federal and university laboratories to coordi-
nate animal disease surveillance and testing
capabilities, and supports the National Vet-
erinary Services Laboratory by providing
early confirmation of animal diseases. Dur-
ing the 2015 outbreak of Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza, many disease confirmation
tests were conducted by laboratories oper-
ating under the NAHLN, and this rapid con-
firmation allowed for depopulation of in-
fected flocks and establishment of safety
protocols around infected farms. These time-
ly actions were made possible by NAHLN
laboratories providing early diagnosis of the
disease and were critical in curtailing the
outbreak.
The Managers recognize the need for mod-
ernization of laboratory testing capabilities
and information technology infrastructure
across the NAHLN. Section 12101 of this act
provides $120 million of Commodity Credit
Corporation funds for the period of fiscal
years 2019–2022, of which $100 million is to be
allocated among the NAHLN, the National
Animal Disease Preparedness and Response
Program (NADPRP) and the National Ani-
mal Vaccine and Veterinary Counter-
measures Bank (NAVVCB). For fiscal year
2023 and each year thereafter, the Managers
provide $30 million of Commodity Credit Cor-
poration funds, of which $12 million is to be
allocated among the NAHLN, the NADPRP
and the NAVVCB. Additionally, the author-
ization for appropriations for the NAHLN is
increased to $30 million per year for fiscal
years 2019–2023.
The Managers intend for the Secretary to
make annual assessments on how best to al-
locate a portion of the funds provided under
Section 12101 in order to address animal dis-
ease preparedness and response needs that
may vary from year to year.
(3) National animal disease preparedness, re-
sponse, and recovery program; national ani-
mal vaccine and veterinary countermeasures
bank
The House bill establishes the National
Animal Disease Preparedness and Response
Program and the National Animal Health
Vaccine Bank, to address the risk of intro-
duction and spread of animal pests and dis-
ease affecting the economic interests of the
U.S. livestock and related industries, includ-
ing the maintenance and expansion of export
markets. The bill requires that the program
be carried out by the Secretary through co-
operative agreements with eligible entities,
including a State department of agriculture
or universities. Specific activities that are
to be carried out through cooperative agree-
ments are described in this subsection. Sec-
tion 10409B further describes program appli-
cation processes and priorities, use of funds,
and reporting requirements similar to those
provided by the Senate Amendment.
The House bill further establishes the Na-
tional Animal Health Vaccine Bank for the
benefit of the domestic interests of the
United States and to help protect the U.S.
agriculture and food system against terrorist
attack, major disaster, and other emer-
gencies. The bill requires that the Vaccine
Bank maintains sufficient quantities of ani-
mal vaccine, antiviral, therapeutic, or diag-
nostic products to appropriately and rapidly
respond to animal disease outbreaks that
would have the most damaging effect on
human health or the economy. The Sec-
retary is instructed to prioritize the acquisi-
tion of sufficient quantities of Foot and
Mouth Disease vaccine, and accompanying
diagnostic products, and the Secretary shall
consider contracting with one or more enti-
ties that are capable of producing foot-and-
mouth disease vaccine and that have surge
production capacity of the vaccine.
The mandatory funding in the House bill
includes $30 million for the National Animal
Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), $70
million for the National Animal Disease Pre-
paredness and Response Program, and $150
million for the National Animal Health Vac-
cine Bank in fiscal year 2019. In each of fiscal
years 2020 through 2023, $50 million in man-
datory funding is provided to carry out the
NAHLN, the National Animal Disease Pre-
paredness and Response Program, and the
National Animal Health Vaccine Bank, of
which not less than $30 million is for the Na-
tional Animal Disease Preparedness and Re-
sponse Program. Additionally, this sub-
section authorizes appropriations of $15 mil-
lion for each of fiscal years 2019–2023 to carry
out the NAHLN. All funds provided are to re-
main available until expended. Finally, sec-
tion 10417(d) limits the Secretary’s use of
funds for administrative expenses to not
more than 4 percent of amounts made avail-
able, limits eligible entities from retaining
more than 10 percent of funds received under
an agreement to pay administrative costs,
prohibits funds from being used for construc-
tion of new facilities, and directs proceeds
from the sale of vaccine or antigen by the
Bank to be credited to an account for the op-
eration of the Bank. (Section 11101)
The Senate amendment establishes a Na-
tional Animal Disease Preparedness, Re-
sponse and Recovery Program under sub-
section 10409B(a) and a National Animal Vac-
cine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank
under subsection 10409B(b). The National
Animal Disease Preparedness, Response and
Recovery Program is established to prevent
the introduction into or the dissemination
within the United States of any pest or dis-
ease of animals affecting the economic inter-
ests of the livestock and related industries,
including the maintenance and expansion of
export market potential. The Secretary shall
carry out the program through cooperative
agreements with eligible entities including a
State department of agriculture or univer-
sities, among others. Similar to the House
Bill, specific activities that are to be carried
out through cooperative agreements are de-
scribed in this subsection, in addition to in-
cluding emerging veterinary counter-
measures among the animal health tech-
nologies to be enhanced and developed. The
subsection further lays out Program applica-
tion processes and priorities, use of funds,
and reporting requirements similar to those
provided in the House Bill.
Section 10409B(b) establishes a National
Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Counter-
measures Bank to benefit the domestic in-
terests of the U.S. The Vaccine and Veteri-
nary Countermeasures Bank is to maintain a
sufficient quantity of animal vaccine,
antiviral, therapeutic products, diagnostic
products, and veterinary countermeasures to
appropriately respond to the most damaging
animal diseases affecting human health or
the economy, and that will be capable of
rapid deployment in the event of an out-
break. The Secretary is required to prioritize
the maintenance of sufficient quantities of
foot-and-mouth disease vaccine and accom-
panying diagnostic products. Finally, the
Secretary shall consider contracting with
one or more entities that are capable of pro-
ducing foot- and-mouth disease vaccine and
that have surge production capacity of the
vaccine.
Section 10409(c) limits the Secretary’s use
of funds for administrative expenses to not
more than 4 percent of amounts made avail-
able, limits eligible entities from retaining
more than 10 percent of funds received under
an agreement to pay administrative costs,
prohibits funds from being used for construc-
tion of new facilities, and directs proceeds
from the sale of vaccine or antigen by the
Bank to be credited to an account for the op-
eration of the Bank. Section 10409(d) author-
izes such sums as necessary to be appro-
priated to carry out the National Animal
Disease Preparedness, Response, and Recov-
ery Program and the National Animal Vac-
cine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank.
(Section 12103)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendment.
Section10403 of the Animal Health Protec-
tion Act is amended to establish a new defi-
nition for ‘‘veterinary countermeasures’’.
The Conference substitute further restruc-
tures the statute related to the new authori-
ties.
The National Animal Disease Preparedness
and Response Program (NADPRP) is estab-
lished under subsection (b) to address the in-
creasing risk of the introduction and spread
within the United States of animal pests and
diseases affecting the economic interests of
the livestock and related industries of the
United States, including the maintenance
and expansion of export markets. The
NADPRP shall be carried out by the Sec-
retary through cooperative agreements with
eligible entities including a State Depart-
ment of Agriculture or universities, among
others. Specific activities that are to be car-
ried out through cooperative agreements are
described in this subsection. Further, the
subsection lays out the application processes
and priorities, use of funds, and reporting re-
quirements
The National Animal Vaccine and Veteri-
nary Countermeasures Bank (NAVVCB) is
established under subsection (c) to benefit
the domestic interests of the United States.
Through the NAVVCB the Secretary shall
maintain sufficient quantities of veterinary
countermeasures to appropriately and rap-
idly respond to the most damaging animal
diseases, with a priority for Foot and Mouth
Disease. As part of such prioritization, the
Secretary may offer to enter into one or
more contracts with one or more entities
that are capable of producing foot and mouth
disease vaccine and that have surge produc-
tion capacity of the vaccine.
Subsection (d) provides $120 million in
mandatory funding for the period of fiscal
years 2019–2022, with a minimum of $5 mil-
lion reserved in each year for the NADPRPP.
For fiscal year 2023 and each year thereafter,
$30 million in mandatory funding is provided,
with a minimum of $18 million reserved in
each year for the NADPRPP. Additionally,
the authorization of appropriations for
NAHLN is increased to $30 million per year

for fiscal years 2019–2023, and an authoriza-
tion for appropriations is established for the
NADPRP and the NAVVCB for such sums as
are necessary for each of fiscal years 2019–
2023. All funds provided are to remain avail-
able until expended, and the funds author-
ized for appropriation under this paragraph
are in addition to any funds authorized or
otherwise made available under section 10417
of the Animal Health Protection Act. This
subsection limits the Secretary’s use of
funds for administrative expenses to not
more than 4 percent of amounts made avail-
able, limits eligible entities from retaining
more than 10 percent of funds received under
an agreement to pay administrative costs,
prohibits funds from being used for construc-
tion of new facilities, and directs proceeds
from the sale of vaccine or antigen from the
NAVVCB to be credited to an account for the
operation of the NAVVCB.
Subsection (e) describes the authority for
the Secretary to enter into cooperative
agreements under this section for fiscal year
2019 through 2023, and this limitation shall
have no impact on cooperative agreements
that are established beyond fiscal year 2023
(Section 12101).
In recent years, animal disease outbreaks
have posed significant challenges to the live-
stock and poultry industries. Various re-
gions of the country and species have been
impacted by disease, and responding to those
outbreaks is a costly and complex endeavor
for farmers and ranchers, veterinarians, and
state and federal governments. The Man-
agers recognize the need to enhance our na-
tional animal disease preparedness and re-
sponse capabilities. Further, the Managers
recognize that such enhancement is an en-
deavor that the federal government must
conduct in coordination with state and local
governments, farmers and ranchers, univer-
sities, laboratories and other cooperators.
The Animal Disease Prevention and Man-
agement program builds upon the existing
National Animal Health Laboratory Net-
work (NAHLN) and establishes the National
Animal Disease Preparedness and Response
Program (NADPRP) and the National Ani-
mal Vaccine and Veterinary Counter-
measures Bank (NAVVCB). The existing
NAHLN authority is revised to establish the
NADPRP and the NAVVCB, which will im-
prove how the U.S. protects against, pre-
pares for, and responds to animal and
zoonotic disease outbreaks.
Protecting U.S. agriculture from animal
and zoonotic disease threats involves numer-
ous efforts including improving disease test-
ing capabilities, improving states’ disease re-
sponse measures including the development
and implementation of continuity of busi-
ness and secure food supply plans, research-
ing new practices and technologies to pro-
tect livestock and poultry, and stockpiling
necessary equipment and drugs to respond to
animal disease outbreaks. The NADPRP will
allow for a coordinated effort to be carried
out by the Secretary through cooperative
agreements with state governments and
state animal health officials, universities,
organizations representing the livestock and
poultry industries, veterinarians and other
eligible entities, to consider all of these fac-
tors and needs and establish a coordinated
strategy to bolster animal disease protec-
tion.
Further, the Managers recognize that ani-
mal disease threats evolve and become in-
creasingly complex, especially zoonotic dis-
eases, and the equipment and drugs cur-
rently at our disposal may be inadequate in
responding to the disease threats of the fu-
ture. Thus, the Managers instruct the estab-
lishment of the NAVVCB, which will allow
for the stockpiling of a variety of equipment
and animal drugs needed to respond to ani-
mal disease outbreaks, with a priority for
stockpiling vaccine necessary to respond to
an outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease
(FMD). The Managers envision the term ‘vet-
erinary countermeasure’ to mean any bio-
logical product (including an animal vaccine
and diagnostic), pharmaceutical product (in-
cluding an animal therapeutic, anti-
microbial, antiviral and antitoxin), non-
pharmaceutical product (including a dis-
infectant or pesticide, response equipment
and personal protective equipment) or other
product or equipment to prevent, detect, di-
agnose, contain, control, treat, recover from,
or mitigate harm or damage resulting from
(including adverse effects impacting public
health or animal health, the environment, or
the economy), animal pests or diseases.
The Managers encourage the Secretary to
consider all options for stockpiling veteri-
nary countermeasures. The funds provided
under Section 12101 should be used to estab-
lish the optimal complement of products to
address the highest risk strains of FMD and
other diseases of consequence. In considering
stockpiling options, the Managers expect the
Secretary to review the procurement process
annually to identify potential efficiencies
and improvements, particularly any needed
changes to allow for maximum contract
flexibility and product innovation over time.
While the Managers expect funding provided
under Section 12101 to significantly enhance
the Secretary’s ability to stockpile vaccine
and related products, the Managers under-
stand that greater investment for such pur-
poses may be desired and warranted in the
future. As such, the Managers encourage the
Secretary and interested stakeholders to
work together to identify alternative fund-
ing sources to achieve such investment.
Section 12101 of this act provides $120 mil-
lion of Commodity Credit Corporation funds
for the period of fiscal years 2019–2022, of
which $20 million is reserved for the
NADPRP, and $100 million is be allocated
among the NAHLN, the NADPRP and the
NAVVCB. For fiscal year 2023 and each year
thereafter, the Managers provide $30 million
of Commodity Credit Corporation funds, of
which $18 million is reserved for the
NADPRP, and $12 million is be allocated
among the NAHLN, the NADPRP and the
NAVVCB. Additionally, the authorization of
appropriations for NAHLN is increased to $30
million per year for fiscal years 2019–2023,
and an authorization for appropriations is
established for the NADPRP and the
NAVVCB for such sums as are necessary for
each of fiscal years 2019–2023.
The Managers expect the Secretary to de-
velop a long range plan to carry out Section
12101 to identify priorities related to animal
disease preparedness and response, and ad-
dress those needs by optimizing the capabili-
ties of the NAHLN, the NADPRP, and the
NAVVCB. On an annual basis, the Secretary
shall review this plan and determine how to
best allocate the funds provided under Sec-
tion 12101 in light of changes to animal dis-
ease threat profiles.
(4) Study on livestock dealer statutory trust
The Senate amendment directs the Sec-
retary to conduct a study on the feasibility
of establishing a Livestock Dealer Statutory
Trust. The amendment requires the study to
analyze the potential impacts such a trust
would have on livestock producers, dealers,
markets, financiers, and others in the live-
stock sector, specifically with regard to
credit availability. It also requires the Sec-
retary, no later than 540 days after the date
of enactment, to submit to the Agriculture
Committees a report describing the findings
of the study. (Section 12104)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with amendment. The sub-
stitute directs additional considerations
under the study including: how the establish-
ment of a livestock dealer statutory trust
would affect seller recovery in the event of a
livestock dealer payment default; whether
authorizing the Secretary to appoint an
independent trustee under the livestock
dealer statutory trust would improve seller
recovery; and how the establishment of a
livestock dealer statutory trust would affect
the treatment of sellers of livestock as it re-
lates to preferential transfer in bankruptcy.
The study shall be completed 1 year after the
date of enactment of the Act. (Section 12103)
The Managers recognize the burdens felt
by unpaid sellers of livestock affected by
livestock dealer default. In response, the
Managers instruct the Secretary to conduct
a study of the feasibility of establishing a
livestock dealer statutory trust, modeled
after the existing packer statutory trust.
The study shall review recent livestock
dealer defaults and consider whether seller
recovery would have been improved in those
experiences had a livestock dealer statutory
trust been in place. Further, the study shall
review how preferential transfers in bank-
ruptcy proceedings are impacting unpaid
sellers of livestock. Finally, the study shall
review challenges encountered when the
Packer trust has been employed, and wheth-
er any changes should be considered to im-
prove effectiveness of a potential livestock
dealer statutory trust. Such improvements
may include allowing the appointment of an
independent trustee and encouraging greater
communication and data sharing between
the Secretary and unpaid sellers of livestock
when a dealer statutory trust is employed.
The study should also include an assessment
of the cost and benefits of establishing a
dealer statutory trust and the Department’s
ability to implement and oversee such a
trust. In conducting the study, the Managers
expect the Secretary to utilize the expertise
of the Packers and Stockyards Division of
the Agricultural Marketing Service and to
engage with and solicit input from industry
stakeholders that would be subject to a deal-
er statutory trust.
(5) Definition of livestock
The Senate amendment amends the Emer-
gency Livestock Feed Assistance Act of 1988
to specifically include alpacas, llamas, live
fish, and crawfish in the definition for live-
stock, and remove the Secretarial designa-
tion requirement regarding other animals
that are part of a foundation herd or pur-
chased as part of a normal operation. (Sec-
tion 12105)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12104)

parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendment repealing
the authorization for appropriations. (Sec-
tion 12105)
(7) Veterinary training
The House bill amends section 10504 of the
2002 Farm Bill to include, in all regions of
the United States, veterinary teams, includ-
ing those based at colleges of veterinary
medicine, capable of providing effective serv-
ices before, during, and after emergencies.

(8) Report on FSIS guidance and outreach to
small meat processors
The House bill requires the USDA Inspec-
tor General, not later than 1 year after the
date of the enactment of this Act, to conduct
a study on the effectiveness of existing FSIS
guidance materials and other tools used by
small and very small establishments, as de-
fined by FSIS regulations, and provide rec-
ommendations on measures the Food Safety
and Inspection Service (FSIS) should take to
improve regulatory clarity and consistency.
(Section 11104)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with amendment. The sub-
stitute directs the Secretary to enter into
contract with a land-grant college or univer-
sity or a non-land-grant college of agri-
culture to review the effectiveness of exist-
ing FSIS guidance materials used by small
and very small establishments operating
under Federal inspection and provide rec-
ommendations on measures FSIS should
take to improve regulatory clarity and con-
sistency. (Section 12107)
The Conference Substitute requires a re-
port considering the effectiveness of USDA
outreach to small meat processors operating
under federal inspection. The Secretary shall
contract with a land-grant college or univer-
sity or a NLGCA with expertise in food safe-
ty and inspection to conduct the report. In
conducting outreach to develop the report,
the college or university shall consult with
the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service
Evaluation Working Group. The report shall
be provided to the House Committee on Agri-
culture and the Senate Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition and Forestry.
(9) Regional cattle and carcass grading correla-
tion and training centers
The House bill requires the Secretary to
establish up to three regional centers to be
known as ‘‘Cattle and Carcass Grading Cor-
relation and Training Centers’’ to: (1) pro-
vide education and training for cattle and
carcass beef graders of AMS, cattle pro-
ducers, and other professionals involved in
the reporting, delivery, and grading of feeder
cattle, live cattle, and carcasses for the pur-
pose of limiting the subjectivity in the appli-
cation of beef grading standards; (2) provide
producers with greater confidence in the
price of the producers’ cattle; (3) provide in-
vestors with both long and short positions
more assurance in the cattle delivery sys-
tem; and (4) coordinate USDA and state and
local resources. The House bill also requires
that no funds are to be used for construction
of any new facilities. (Section 11105)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision. (Section 12108)
(10) Repeal of office of homeland security
The Senate amendment repeals the Office
of Homeland Security created in the 2008
Food, Conservation, and Energy Act. (Sec-
tion 12201)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 12201)
The Senate amendment moves the author-
ization of the Office of Homeland Security
(the Office) from the Food, Conservation, and
Energy Act of 2008 (7 USC 8911) to subtitle A
of the Department of Agriculture Reorga-
nization Act of 1994 with updated authori-
ties. The Managers do not intend for the Of-
fice to physically close and reopen.
(11) Office of homeland security
The Senate amendment establishes an Of-
fice of Homeland Security and authorizes an
Agriculture and Food Threat Awareness
Partnership Program. (Section 12202)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts Senate
amendment with minor technical modifica-
tion. (Section 12202)
Managers expect the Executive Director of
the Office to serve as the principal advisor to
the Secretary on homeland security, includ-
ing emergency management and agriculture
and food defense, and to coordinate activi-
ties of the Department related to homeland
security and emergency response. The Office
is expected to proactively engage USDA’s
agencies with critical missions important to
homeland security, as well as to engage and
assert the USDA roles, responsibilities, and
needs within interagency discussions, includ-
ing those with the Executive Office of the
President and the intelligence community
agencies.
(12) Agriculture and food defense
The Senate amendment: (1) provides sev-
eral definitions; (2) requires the Secretary to
develop, in collaboration with appropriate
Federal, State, regional, and local officials, a
comprehensive strategic response plan or
plans, as appropriate, for certain diseases or
pests of concern; (3) requires the Secretary
to provide information to a State or regional
authority to assist in developing a com-
prehensive strategic response plan or plans
that shall include several factors such as
concepts of operations for each disease of
concern and describing decision matrixes,
roles, and interactions for each level of gov-
ernment and industry; (4) authorizes the Na-
tional Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN),
headed by the Director of the National Insti-
tute of Food and Agriculture in partnership
with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) to provide passive surveil-
lance and early identification of plant dis-
eases and pests; and (5) establishes the Na-
tional Plant Disease Recovery System
(NPDRS) to focus on and plan for long term
recovery from high-consequence plant trans-
boundary disease and directs the NPDRS to
coordinate diseases of concern response plan-
ning and develop research plans for recovery
through the identification and use of novel
resistant genetic material to stabilize and
improve crops in the face of potential plant
disease pressure. (Section 12203)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a modification that
State plans include a concept of operations,
and address, as appropriate, the require-
ments in the Senate amendment. (Section
12203)
The Senate amendment establishes stra-
tegic response planning for plant and animal
diseases and pests of particular concern at
the national level, as well as support for
State, or States, interested in more detailed
response planning adapted to the individual
needs of that State, or States. The Managers
understand a response plan designed to the
detail of a concept of operations cannot to-
tally anticipate real events and that there is
not a response plan that will remain totally
effective for long after an initial disease or
pest detection is made during a real event.
Every situation or emergency is different.
Adjustments to the response will need to be
made to accommodate a situation in real
time. Nevertheless, developing a response
plan to the detail of a concept of operations
is an important preparedness step to estab-
lish and maintain a state of readiness. A con-
cept of operations should outline the process
to be followed in implementing a response
and should define the roles of the stake-
holders involved throughout the process. It
has been demonstrated repeatedly by law en-
forcement, emergency response, and defense
planners that exercised plans, even when the
plan is divergent from an actual event, pro-
vide value and improve a response partici-
pant’s ability to react and adapt, increasing
the success of containing and managing a
real threat or event. Establishing key per-
formance metrics for a response will be para-
mount for consistent evaluation and to ac-
complish ongoing improvement of a response
plan. Therefore the Managers expect the re-
sponse planning developed for plant and ani-
mal diseases and pests of concern to provide
for benchmarking of performance in order to
measure and make positive change or to
maintain an expected standard.
(13) Biological agents and toxins list
The Senate amendment amends the under-
lying law by adding a new consideration for
selecting a pathogenic biological agent to be
added to the list of biological agents and tox-
ins. (Section 12204)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment with a modification regard-
ing its considerations for inclusion on the
list. (Section 12204)
The Managers expect that when a biologi-
cal agent is examined for inclusion on the
Biological Agents and Select Toxins List
that consideration is given to the potential
impact on performance of research on the
causative agent of the disease.
(14) Authorization of appropriations
The Senate amendment authorizes appro-
priations of $5 million for each of fiscal years
2019 through 2023. (Section 12205)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate amendment. (Section 12205)
The Managers note that several of the
functions directed in this subtitle already re-
ceive funding through other authorizations
of appropriations and other sources, such as
funding directed towards OHSEC, APHIS,
ARS and NIFA for activities in this subtitle
currently carried out by those entities. The
Managers support those authorizations of
funding and appropriations and expect them
to continue. The Managers expect the au-
thorizations in this section will be weighted
towards new responsibilities authorized in
this subtitle and intend this authorization to
supplement, not supplant those other
sources.
(15) Farming opportunities training and out-
reach
The House bill amends section 7405 of the
Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of
2002 to: (1) prioritize grants for agricultural
education for youth for agricultural employ-
ment and volunteer opportunities, and for
projects that demonstrate experience in pro-
viding such education and opportunities for
socially disadvantaged youth; (2) authorize
the Secretary to waive the matching require-
ment to effectively reach an underserved
area or population; (3) include retiring farm-
ers and non-farming landowners, and adds
authority for training and technical assist-
ance, as well as education programs and
workshops; and (4) reauthorize $10 million in
mandatory spending each year for FY2019–
2023 and reauthorizes appropriations of $20
million each for FY2019–2023 for the Outreach
and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged
Farmers and Ranchers program, also known
was the 2501 Program. The House bill amends
section 2501(a)(4) of the Food Agriculture,
Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to in-
clude priority for grants, contracts, and
other agreements for projects that deliver
agricultural education to youth in under-
served communities, and reauthorizes $20

servation, and Trade Act of 1990 under the
newly established ‘‘Farming Opportunities
Training and Outreach.’’ The Senate amend-
ment: (1) authorizes the Secretary to encour-
age and assist socially disadvantaged, vet-
eran, and beginning farmers and ranchers
through education and training and equi-
table participation in agricultural programs;
(2) moves the definition of beginning farmer
and authorizes the equivalent of existing Be-
ginning Farmer and Rancher Development
grant program with a few differences includ-
ing that the Secretary should act through
the Director of the National Institute of
Food and Agriculture in carrying out the
grant program, providing that the grants can
be used to assist beginning farmers and
ranchers in acquiring land from retiring
farmers and ranchers, and for food safety and
recordkeeping; (3) requires a simplified appli-
cation process for grants under $50,000; (4)
provides $50 million in mandatory funding in
fiscal year 2018 and each year thereafter and
authorizes $50 million a year in appropria-
tions for FY2018–2023, reserved equally be-
tween Beginning Farmer and Rancher Devel-
opment Grant Program and the authority
under subsection (c) (socially disadvantaged
and veteran farmers and ranchers); (5) au-
thorizes same 5 percent set-asides as in cur-
rent law from beginning farmer program; (6)
requires that 5 percent of funds allocated to
the Socially Disadvantaged Farmer Research
and Policy Center go to limited resource and
socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers,
and farmworkers; (7) requires that 5 percent
of projects awarded through education teams
and curriculum development go towards vet-
erans; (8) places a 5 percent cap on adminis-
trative expenses; (9) limits indirect costs to
10%; and (10) the Secretary should act
through the Director of the National Insti-
tute of Food and Agriculture in carrying out
the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Develop-
ment grant program. The Senate amendment
requires that grants for socially disadvan-
taged farmers and ranchers are for a term no
longer than 3 years and in an amount no
more than $250,000 for each year of the grant;
and requires the Secretary to give priority in
awarding grants to nongovernmental and
community based organizations with exper-
tise in working with socially disadvantaged,
or veteran, farmers and ranchers. (Section
12301)
The conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that au-
thorizes the Secretary to waive the match-
ing requirement in the Beginning Farmer
and Rancher Development program of the
Farming Opportunities Training Outreach
program to effectively reach an underserved
area or population; requires a simplified ap-
plication process for all grants under $50,000;
provides $30 million in mandatory funding in
fiscal years 2019 and 2020, $35 million in fiscal
year 2021, $40 million for fiscal year 2022, and
$50 million for fiscal year 2023 and each year
thereafter and authorizes $50 million a year
in appropriations for FY 2019–2023, reserved
equally between Beginning Farmer and
Rancher Development Grant Program and
the authority under subsection (c) (socially
disadvantaged and veterans). (Section 12301)
The Managers recognize the increasing de-
mand for programming for beginning and so-
cially disadvantaged farmers, so the Con-
ference agreement includes $435 million in
mandatory funding for the Farming Opportu-
nities Training Outreach program, which
combines the Beginning Farmer and Rancher
Development Program and the Outreach Pro-
gram for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers
and Veterans. The Managers have provided
permanent funding for this program to en-
sure that the program has baseline funding
hereafter. The Managers also intend that the
Secretary will continue to administer the
Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development
Program through the National Institute of
Food and Agriculture and that the Outreach
Program for Socially Disadvantaged Farm-
ers and Veterans be administered through
the Office of Partnerships and Public En-
gagement.
(16) Urban agriculture
The Senate amendment adds a new section
222 in the Department of Agriculture Reorga-
nization Act of 1994 to: (1) establish an Office
and Director of Urban Agriculture and Inno-
vative Production to encourage and promote
urban, indoor, and other emerging agricul-
tural production practices; (2) establish an
Urban Agriculture and Innovative Produc-
tion Advisory Committee; (3) provide for the
assignment of a farm number for rooftop, in-
door, and other urban farms; (4) provide au-
thority to award competitive grants to oper-
ate community gardens or nonprofit farms,
educate a community on food systems, nutri-
tion, environmental impacts, and agricul-
tural production, and help offset start-up
costs for new and beginning farmers; (5) es-
tablish pilot projects to increase compost
and reduce food waste, and create urban and
suburban county committees; and (6) author-
ize appropriations of $25 million a year. (Sec-
tion 12302)
The House bill does not contain a com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that ad-
justs the Director’s responsibilities, reduces
the committee to 12 members, amends the
reporting requirement, removes provision re-
lating to the assignment of farm numbers,
removes community organizations and insti-
tutions of higher learning from consider-
ation for grants, removes funding priority
provision, and limits authorization of appro-
priations to fiscal years 2019 through 2023.
(Section 12302)
The Managers recognize that urban agri-
culture and innovative production methods
like indoor and rooftop farming create new
economic opportunities in urban, suburban,
and rural communities. The Managers ac-
knowledge that urban agriculture and inno-
vative production methods also increase ac-
cess to food in low-income communities and
improve availability of fresh products
throughout the entire year, and recognize
that these agricultural opportunities help
build a new generation of farmers.
The Managers intend that the Office of
Urban Agriculture and Innovative Produc-
tion be responsible for policy and program
development, as well as interagency collabo-
ration, and provide customer service to ex-
ternal stakeholders on issues pertaining to
urban agriculture and innovative production.
The Managers direct the Secretary to update
Farm Service Agency procedures that allow
for assignment of farm numbers (as defined
in section 718.2 of title 7, Code of Federal
Regulations) to include rooftop farms, indoor
farms, and other urban farms.
The Managers direct that individual grants
awarded through the Office of Urban Agri-
culture and Innovative Production serve
multiple farmers or gardeners for the pur-
poses of community service, education, farm
incubation, or making a profit. The Man-
agers encourage the Secretary to use these
grants to assist with costs related to agricul-
tural production including but not limited to
land acquisition, equipment, utilities, seeds
and plants, supplies, basic transportation,
and farm cooperative development. The Man-
agers expect the Secretary to establish cri-
teria and guidelines to meet the suggested
purposes of the grant program.
The Managers recognize composting is not
the only available technology for food waste
recovery. It is the Managers’ intent that any
pilot project under this section does not ad-
versely impact existing commercial relation-
ships of other food waste recovery efforts, in-
cluding those of commercial renderers who
collect and process animal and food waste
from commercial and farm sources. It is the
Manager’s intent that activities occurring
through pilot projects selected under this
paragraph shall take into consideration the
most-preferred food waste recovery activi-
ties as described in the Food Recovery Hier-
archy of the Environmental Protection
Agency (as of the date of enactment or any
successor guidance or outreach materials).
(17) Office of advocacy and outreach
The House bill amends section 226B of the
Department of Agriculture Reorganization
Act of 1994 to: (1) change the name of the of-
fice to the ‘‘Office of Partnerships and Public
Engagement’’, and makes applicable con-
forming amendments; (2) extend outreach to
limited resource producers, veteran farmers
and ranchers, and Tribal farmers and ranch-
ers, and promotes outreach specifically to
youth; (3) expand the duties of the office to
include veteran farmers and ranchers and
Tribal farmers and ranchers; (4) expand the
Office’s monitoring of goals and objectives to
veteran farmers and ranchers and Tribal
farmers and ranchers; (5) expand the Office’s
measuring of outcomes to veteran farmers
and ranchers and Tribal farmers and ranch-
ers; and (6) reauthorize appropriations at ex-
isting levels through FY2023. (Section 11203)
The Senate amendment reauthorizes ap-
propriations at existing levels through
FY2023. (Section 12303)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment that
does not separately define Tribal farmers
and ranchers aside from the definition of so-
cially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers,
which includes tribal farmers and ranchers.
(Section 12406)
The Managers acknowledge that it is im-
portant for the Office of Partnerships and
Public Engagement (OPPE) to improve ac-
cess to USDA programs for tribal farmers
and ranchers and direct this office to con-
duct these outreach efforts. Tribal farmers
and ranchers are already included in the def-
inition of a socially disadvantaged farmer
and rancher, so the conferees did not adopt
the addition of tribal farmers and ranchers
from the House bill.
The Managers recognize that the Office of
Tribal Relations (OTR) is an important func-
tion of USDA and should be within the Office
of the Secretary. The Director of OTR serves
as USDA’s primary point of contact for con-
sultation and coordination with Tribal Gov-
ernments and should continue to directly ad-
vise the Secretary on tribal issues and poli-
cies. The Managers agree that OTR should
coordinate with OPPE to provide outreach
and assistance to tribes and tribal farmers
and ranchers to improve access to USDA pro-
grams and resources.
(18) Tribal advisory committee
The House bill amends section 309 of the
Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Depart-
ment of Agriculture Reorganization Act of
1994 to transfer the Office of Tribal Relations
into the newly established Office of Partner-
ships and Public Engagement. (Section 11204)

nization Act of 1994 to establish the USDA

Secretary on tribal agricultural topics and
annually report recommendations to the
Secretary. (Section 12304)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment altering
the manner in which the membership of the
committee is established. (Section 12303)
(19) Youth outreach and beginning farmer co-
ordination
The House bill amends the Department of
Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 by in-
serting after section 220 a new section 221 to:
(1) establish the position of Agricultural
Youth Coordinator to promote the role of
youth-serving organizations and school-
based agricultural education; (2) direct the
Coordinator to identify short-term and long-
term interests of the Department; (3) direct
the Coordinator to assist ‘‘young farmers’’;
(4) direct ‘‘particular emphasis on beginning
farmer and rancher programs’’; (5) outline
contracts and cooperative agreements the
Coordinator may engage in with land-grant
universities, research centers of the Agricul-
tural Research Service, and nonprofit orga-
nizations; and (6) with regard to contracts
and cooperative agreements (Section
221(c)(1)), include ‘‘the conduct of regional
research on the profitability of small farms.’’
(Section 11206)
The Senate amendment amends the Farm
Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 by
inserting after section 7404 a new 7405 to: (1)
establish an Agricultural Youth Coordinator
to promote and coordinate outreach through
the use of contracts and cooperative agree-
ments; (2) authorize the Agricultural Youth
Coordinator to use contracts for youth edu-
cation; (3) direct assistance to ‘‘youth in-
volved in food and agriculture organiza-
tions’’; and (4) list areas of emphasis includ-
ing: beginning farmer and rancher programs,
agriculture education, nutrition education
science, technology, engineering, and mathe-
matics education, and other food and agri-
culture programs for youth. (Section 12306)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment that ex-
changes the term ‘‘young farmers’’ for
‘‘youth.’’ (Section 12305)
The Managers recognize the importance of
involving youth in farming and ranching
through programs like 4–H, FFA, and Farm
to School. The Managers intend for the Agri-
cultural Youth Organization Coordinator to
promote youth-serving organizations and
school-based agricultural education, serve as
a resource for assisting youth organizations
in agriculture in applying for participation
in agricultural programs, and advocate on
behalf of youth organizations in agriculture
in interactions with employees of the De-
partment.
(20) State beginning farmer and rancher coordi-
nation
The House bill amends section 226 of the
Department of Agriculture Reorganization
Act of 1994 to direct the Secretary, through
the FSA, to designate one employee, who re-
ceives sufficient training, from among em-
ployees of FSA, NRCS, RMA, RBCS or RUS,
in each state as the State Beginning Farmer
and Rancher Coordinator responsible for de-
veloping a State plan to coordinate outreach
and technical assistance in county and area
Department offices. (Section 11202)
The Senate amendment amends the Farm
Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 by
inserting after section 7404 a new 7405 to: es-
tablish a National Beginning Farmer and
Rancher Coordinator to provide outreach
and technical assistance to help beginning
farmers and ranchers participate in Depart-
ment programs. The Senate provision for di-
recting the Secretary is the same as con-
tained in the House bill, but Senate language
does not require the Secretary to work
through the FSA. (Section 12306)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that
adopts the definition of ‘‘beginning farmer or
rancher’’ as defined in section 2501(a) of the
Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade
Act of 1990. (Section 12304)
The Managers recognize that America’s
farmers and ranchers are aging while, at the
same time, aspiring and beginning farmers
face challenges in establishing successful op-
erations. The Managers intend for the Na-
tional Beginning Farmer and Rancher Coor-
dinator and the associated State Coordina-
tors to assist new and beginning farmers and
ranchers with technical assistance and make
them aware of USDA programs.
(21) Availability of department of agriculture
programs for veteran farmers and ranchers
The Senate amendment: (1) amends the
definition of veteran as any individual who
has obtained veteran status within the pre-
vious 10 years, as defined in section 2501 of
the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and
Trade Act of 1990; (2) extends benefits to vet-
erans including Farm Service Agency down
payment loans, reduced interest rates on
guaranteed loans, increased coverage under
Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey
Bees, and Farm-raised Fish, reduced pre-
miums and fees for the Noninsured Crop Dis-
aster Assistance Program, and increased
educational focus from the Food Safety Out-
reach Program and the Federal Crop Insur-
ance Education Program; and (3) amends the
definition of veteran, for the purpose of Risk
Management Agency programs, as any indi-
vidual who has gained veteran status within
the previous 5 years and extends to veterans
eligibility for increased premium subsidy,
lower administrative fees, and assistance in
establishing baseline yields. (Section 12307)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12306)
The Managers encourage the Department
to expand support to new veteran farmers
and have therefore made veterans eligible for
additional farm program priorities and dis-
counts. The Conference Substitute also
changes the definition of a veteran farmer to
include all new veterans who are farmers.
(22) Office of congressional relations and inter-
governmental affairs
The Senate amendment amends section 218
of the Department of Agriculture Reorga-
nization Act of 1994 to rename the Assistant
Secretary of Congressional Relations as the
Assistant Secretary of Congressional Rela-
tions and Intergovernmental Affairs and al-
lows for the succession of the current Senate
confirmed Assistant Secretary into the
newly titled role. (Section 12401)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12401)
(23) Military veterans agricultural liaison
The Senate amendment amends section 219
of the Department of Agriculture Reorga-
nization Act of 1994 to improve coordination
between USDA and other federal agencies to
assist in providing information to veterans
about agricultural vocational and rehabilita-
tion programs and directs the Military Vet-
erans Liaison to report collected informa-
tion annually and publish it on a dedicated
website. (Section 12402)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12402)
The Managers intend for the website au-
thorized under this section to improve co-
ordination between USDA and other federal
agencies to assist in providing information
to veterans about agricultural programs.
The Managers recognize that improving
communication channels between USDA offi-
cials and veterans will ensure that USDA is
better able to assist veterans who are look-
ing to return home and start a new career in
agriculture.
(24) Civil rights analysis
The Senate amendment amends the De-
partment of Agriculture Reorganization Act
of 1994 by inserting after section 222 a new
section 223 that requires the Secretary to
conduct a civil rights analysis of certain ac-
tions of USDA, allows the Assistant Sec-
retary of Civil Rights to grant, on a case-by-
case basis, an expedited civil rights analysis
or a waiver of the civil rights analysis, and
requires the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct a study of various
actions and efforts of USDA concerning civil
rights. (Section 12403)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that re-
quires the Department to conduct civil
rights impact analyses in accordance with
the Department’s current policy, Depart-
mental Regulation 4300–004, issued by USDA
on October 16, 2016. (Section 12403)
The Managers recognize the history of dis-
criminatory actions at the Department and
want to ensure that the Department is in
compliance with civil rights requirements.
The conference report thus adopts two provi-
sions, a civil rights impact analysis, and a
Comptroller General report.
First, the Managers recognize the impor-
tance of evaluating the potential discrimina-
tory effects of certain actions, policies, or
decisions under consideration by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and therefore require
the Secretary to conduct civil rights impact
analyses in accordance with Departmental
Regulation 4300–004, as in effect on October
17, 2016, the Department’s current policy.
The Managers understand that any pro-
posed action or policy could have unintended
adverse or disproportionate impacts on em-
ployees, applicants, contractors, or bene-
ficiaries of the Department based on their
membership in a group that is protected
from discrimination under Federal law. The
Managers therefore intend for the Secretary
to use the civil rights impact analyses as an
opportunity to proactively identify these im-
pacts and, if applicable, implement changes
to the proposed activity to ensure the De-
partment’s actions and policies do not have
a negative civil rights impact.
Second, the conference report also requires
the Comptroller General to conduct a study
describing the effectiveness of the Depart-
ment in processing and resolving civil rights
complaints, minority participation rates in
farm programs, the implications of the re-
alignment of civil rights functions of the De-
partment, and the Department’s efforts to
identify and reduce the incidence of civil
rights violations.
(25) Farm service agency
The Senate amendment provides con-
forming technical corrections related to ad-
ministrative reorganization actions, renam-
ing the Consolidated Farm Service Agency
as the Farm Service Agency. (Section 12404)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12404)

duction and conservation

ate provision. (Section 12405)
(27) Under Secretary of agriculture for rural de-
velopment
The Senate amendment directs the Sec-
retary to establish the position of Under Sec-
retary of Agriculture for Rural Development
as a permanent, mandatory position. (Sec-
tion 12406)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12407)
Section 12407 requires the Department to
reestablish the position of Under Secretary
for Rural Development, a position formerly
established in the Department. The Man-
agers intend for this position to be a perma-
nent, mandatory position and not subject to
any administrative reorganizations.
The Managers recognize that Rural Devel-
opment’s more than $222 billion dollar finan-
cial portfolio leverages significant invest-
ments throughout rural America, serving as
an important source of capital for under-
served communities, and provides essential
technical assistance and supports families,
farmers, ranchers, and businesses across
America.
(28) Administrator of the rural utilities service
The Senate amendment allows the Admin-
istrator of the Rural Utilities Service to be
paid a salary consistent with other adminis-

clarify the definition of pet to include cer-
tain companion animals, while also pro-
viding protections for other animals such as
horses, service animals, and emotional sup-
port animals. (Section 12502)
The Managers recognize that victims of do-
mestic violence often may be reluctant to
leave an abusive relationship out of fear for
the safety and welfare of their companion
animals. Animal friendly housing can be dif-
ficult to secure, and the costs entailed with
animal housing can factor into victims’ deci-
sions to leave abusive relationships. Section
12502 authorizes appropriations for $3 million
for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023 to
establish a grant program to provide emer-
gency and transitional housing assistance

for domestic violence victims with pets. The
Secretary of Agriculture may enter into a
memorandum of understanding with another
Department or Agency to administer the
grants under this section. The conference
substitute clarifies the definition of pet to
include certain companion animals, while
also providing protections for other animals
such as horses, service animals, and emo-
tional support animals. Further, this section
expands federal domestic violence and stalk-
ing protections to include crimes targeting
pets, horses, service animals and emotional
support animals.
(39) Data on conservation practices
The Senate amendment: (1) creates a se-
cure data collection system through which
the Department, pursuant to established pri-
vacy and confidentiality protocols; (2) allows
for analysis and review of data from various
agencies regarding the impact of covered
conservation practices on crop yields, soil
health, and farm and ranch profitability; (3)
establishes protocols and procedures to allow
for the collection of data from existing De-
partmental databases and for the voluntary
submission of data from producers; (4) estab-
lishes a data warehouse to contain the data
collected under this section that can be
accessed by an academic institution or re-
searcher; and (5) requires the Risk Manage-
ment Agency to work with other agencies to
conduct research and analyze how yield vari-
ability and risk are impacted by certain con-
servation practices. (Section 12504)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that
reconfigures the provision to function as a
report generated by the Secretary after the
identification of available Departmental
data on conservation practices and the effect
of such practices on farm and ranch profit-
ability including effects relating to crop
yields, soil health. The report generated by
the Secretary will summarize the data and
the steps the Secretary will have to take to
provide access to the data to university re-
searchers, including technical, privacy or ad-
ministrative considerations, the safeguards
linked to providing access to data, appro-
priate procedures to maximize research ben-
efits, and recommendations relating to Fed-
eral authorizations needed to allow access to
data. (Section 12618)
In order to increase the knowledge of how
conservation practices or suites of conserva-
tion practices may affect crop yields, soil
health, and other risk-related factors, the
Managers intend for USDA to identify a
compilation of the available data sets within
the Department, including the potential use
of databases created in this act under Sec-
tion 1240H(d) of the Environmental Quality
Incentives’ Conservation Innovation Grants
(CIG) and the Conservation Effects Assess-
ment Project (CEAP) or the database under
the Acreage Crop Reporting Streamlining
Initiative (ACRSI).
During the internal review of the data sets
held by USDA, the Managers encourage the
Secretary to also include any other ongoing
initiatives of a similar nature inside and out-
side of the Federal government and consider
any steps needed to expand or improve the
collection of existing data to benefit the use-
fulness for research and analysis. The Man-
agers also encourage the Secretary to keep
in mind the potential to integrate elements
of activities encouraged under this section
and other data-related initiatives, such as
ACRSI, in order to avoid duplication. Noth-
ing in this section is intended to replace or
interfere with existing efforts and the Man-
agers intend for such efforts as the conserva-
tion modeling under CEAP or the collabora-
tion between the Natural Resources Con-
servation Service and the Risk Management
Agency on existing or future collaborative
research on soil types, cover crops or other
management practices to continue. The
Managers expect any review or analysis of
any personally identifiable information or
data set in this section to adhere and uphold
to the maximum extent Department and
agency privacy and confidentiality protocols
that are in place. The Managers intend for
limited access to apply to a narrow group of
other researchers, such as those in academia.
However, the Managers do not intend to pro-
vide controlled access under this authority
to others directly or indirectly outside of the
Federal government, such as non-govern-
mental organizations.
(40) Marketing orders
The House bill adds ‘‘pecans’’ to the list of
commodities. (Section 9202)
The Senate amendment adds ‘‘pecans’’ and
‘‘cherries’’ to the list of commodities. (Sec-
tion 12505)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12503)
The Managers intend that the term ‘‘cher-
ries’’ includes all processed tart or sour cher-
ries, including frozen and dried cherries
(with or without added sweetener), cherry
juice (concentrate or single strength), and
canned cherries.
(41) Study on food waste
The Senate amendment directs the Sec-
retary to conduct a study to evaluate and de-
termine methods of measuring food waste,
factors creating food waste, particularly of
fresh food products, and whether USDA pro-
grams disrupt existing food waste recovery
and disposal by commercial, marketing, or
business relationships and instructs the Sec-
retary to issue an initial and an annual re-
port. (Section 12506)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision into an amended section where-
in the newly created Food Loss and Waste
Reduction Liaison will conduct the study on
food waste and issue an initial report and ad-
ditional report relating to data collected on
food waste, and efforts to reduce and prevent
such waste. (Section 12504)
(42) Establishment of food loss and waste reduc-
tion liaison
The House bill authorizes USDA to estab-
lish, within the Office of the Secretary, a
‘‘Food Loss and Waste Reduction Liaison’’ to
coordinate federal programs to measure and
reduce the incidence of food loss and waste,
provide information and resources, and raise
awareness of the liability protections for do-
nated foods. (Section 11607)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment direct-
ing the Secretary to conduct a food waste
study, in consultation with the Food Loss
and Waste Reduction Liaison, who will issue
an initial report and additional report relat-
ing to data collected on food waste and ef-
forts to reduce and prevent such waste. (Sec-
tion 12504)
The Managers intend for the results of the
Study on Food Waste to inform the develop-
ment of best practices for food loss and
waste reduction and food recovery efforts
carried out under this section. The Managers
encourage the Food Loss and Waste Reduc-
tion Liaison to continue to monitor and re-
view the volume of food wasted and the re-
sults of the food waste reduction and loss
prevention activities carried out by the De-
partment subsequent to the submission of
the report under subsection (e)(2).
(43) Report on business centers
The Senate amendment requires GAO to
issue a report evaluating each USDA busi-
ness center. Further, the amendment re-
quires that the report examine the effective-
ness of the Department’s business centers,
impacts on budgets and personnel, and rec-
ommendations to improve the operation and
function of those business centers. (Section
12507)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12505)
(44) Information technology modernization
The Senate amendment requires GAO to
issue reports evaluating the Department’s
information technology modernization ef-
forts, and outlines the initial report, the up-
dates, and the comprehensive reports to be
issued. (Section 12508)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute does not adopt
the Senate provision.
(45) Report on personnel
The Senate amendment requires the De-
partment to biannually submit to the House
and Senate Agriculture Committees a report
describing the number of staff years and em-
ployees employed for each agency of the De-
partment. (Section 12509)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12506)
(46) Report on absent landlords
The Senate amendment requires the Sec-
retary to conduct a study on absent land-
lords within one year of enactment. In con-
ducting the study, the Secretary shall con-
sider certain impacts of absent landlords on
land value, soil health, and economic viabil-
ity and provide recommendations on how to
mitigate these impacts. (Section 12510)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12507)
(47) Restriction on use of certain poisons for
predator control

sodium cyanide (M–44 devices) to kill preda-
tory animals only in accordance with Wild-
life Services (WS) Directive Number 2.415 of
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service, dated February 27, 2018, and the im-
plementation guidelines attached to that Di-
rective. (Section 12511)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute does not adopt
the Senate provision.
(48) Century farms program
The House bill establishes a program under
which the Secretary recognizes any farm
that a state program or similar agricultural
organization recognizes as a century farm, or
a farm as defined under section 7 CFR
4284.902, and farms that have been in contin-
uous operation by the same family for at
least 100 years. (Section 11610)
The Senate amendment establishes a Na-
tional Century Farms Program to recognize
state programs and farms that have been in
continuous operation by the same family for
at least 100 years. (Section 12512)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10026 December 10, 2018
Congress on the volume of live dogs imported
to the U.S. (Section 11612)
The Senate amendment contains a com-
parable provision but excludes the inclusion
of the importation of personal pets. (Section
12513)
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment
strengthening the coordination efforts be-
tween the Departments of Commerce, Health
and Human Services, and Homeland Security
to enable the Secretary to collect, compile,
and disseminate this data to Congress in
order to better understand the public health
implications of importing dogs into the
United States. (Section 12509)
The Managers recognize that little is
known about the volume of live dogs im-
ported into the United States, whether as
personal pets or animals seeking adoption or
purchase by American households. Animal
and zoonotic diseases pose serious risks to
the U.S., and greater understanding of the
pathways these diseases could be entering
the U.S., such as via imported live dogs, is
warranted.
The Managers instruct the Secretary to de-
velop a report on the importation of live
dogs into the United States to be submitted
to the House Committee on Agriculture and
the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutri-
tion and Forestry no later than 1 year after
the date of enactment of this Act. The Sec-
retary of Commerce, the Secretary of Health
and Human Services and the Secretary of
Homeland Security shall provide to the Sec-
retary of Agriculture all available data and
information relating to the importation of
live dogs into the U.S to complete the re-
port.
(50) Promise zones
The Senate amendment codifies the Tribal
Promise Zones program and provides for the
continuation of currently existing Tribal
Promise Zones to leverage public-private in-
vestment. (Section 12515)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment striking
the section addressing competitive enhance-
ment in federal awards to tribal promise
zones. (Section 12510)
(51) Precision agriculture connectivity
The House bill highlights the importance
of precision agriculture and the need so agri-
culture cost can be lowered by 2050, and es-
tablishes a Task Force for Reviewing the
Connectivity and Technology Needs of Preci-
sion Agriculture to identify gaps in rural
technology and make policy recommenda-
tions to help address these issues. (Sections
6801 & 6802)
The Senate amendment: (1) highlights the
importance of precision agriculture and the
need so agriculture cost can be lowered by
2050; (2) establishes a Task Force for Review-
ing the Connectivity and Technology Needs
of Precision Agriculture in the U.S.to iden-
tify gaps in rural technology and make pol-
icy recommendations to help address these
issues; (3) ensures that no provider of
broadband internet access service is required
to duplicate the reporting of data; (4) holds
that the Task Force and the ‘‘Commission’’
(FCC) shall not interpret the use of the term
‘‘future programs of the Commission’’ to in-
clude universal service programs under the
Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254);
and (5) requires an agricultural producer rep-
resenting tribal agriculture to be on the
Task Force. (Section 12516)
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment clarifying
the definition of the term ‘‘broadband Inter-
net access service’’. (Section 12511)
As the USDA develops financing, policy
and other aspects related to rural broadband
development, the Managers request USDA
take into account Sec. 2110 of the FAA Ex-
tension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016.
This will ensure communication towers pro-
viding broadband services in rural areas that
meet the specifications described in Section
2110 are properly marked and entered into a
FAA database to protect the safety of aerial
applicators, aerial firefighters, public health
applicators, medevac units, law enforcement
and other low-flying aircraft.
Section 12511 requires the Federal Commu-
nications Commission (FCC), in collabora-
tion with the Department, to form a task
force to evaluate the best ways to meet the
broadband needs of precision agriculture in
the United States. The task force is focused
on identifying and measuring gaps in
broadband coverage, and developing policy
recommendations to promote rapid, ex-
panded deployment of broadband in agricul-
tural areas.
The Managers believe many rural busi-
nesses do not have access to broadband serv-
ices. Both the FCC and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, through the Rural Utilities
Service (RUS), provide Federal support to
bring broadband to rural areas. In rural
areas, broadband has the potential to enable
precision agriculture for farmers and ranch-
ers by integrating emerging technologies and
global position systems (GPS) to assist in
the most efficient use of their land.
The Managers direct the Commission and
the Department to review House Report 115–
837 for additional details about the history,
purpose, and implementation of this section.
(52) Improved soil moisture and precipitation
monitoring
The Senate amendment allows the Sec-
retary to consider findings from additional
drought monitoring stations and to establish
new stations, to improve the accuracy of the
U.S. Drought Monitor utilized in deter-
mining grazing disaster assistance for live-
stock producers, and authorizes $5 million in
appropriations for FY2019–2013. (Section
12517)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment simpli-
fying the Secretary’s efforts from those im-
posed by the Senate provision, and instructs
the Secretary to coordinate with the Direc-
tor of the National Drought Mitigation Cen-
ter and the Administrator of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to
enhance the collection of data to improve
the accuracy of the United States Drought
Monitor, review the type of data utilized by
the Drought Monitor and the geographic cov-
erage of data sites, and make improvements.
(Section 12512)
(53) Dairy business innovation initiatives
The Senate amendment requires the Agri-
cultural Marketing Service to establish at
least three regionally located dairy product
and business innovation initiatives to pro-
vide grants and nonmonetary assistance to
dairy businesses, provides direction for the
selection of initiatives, entities eligible to
host initiatives, activities of the initiatives,
distribution of funds and reporting require-
ments, and authorizes $20 million in appro-
priations for each fiscal year. (Section 12519)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment that
streamlines the establishment and selection
of the initiatives, amends language related
to eligible and ineligible entities, stream-
lines the eligible types of assistance that are
allowed, edits the priorities to be considered
for the awarding of grants, and simplifies the
reporting requirements. (Section 12513)
(54) Report on funding for the national institute
of food and agriculture and other extension
programs
The Senate amendment instructs that no
later than 2 years after the 2017 Census of
Agriculture is released under the Census of
Agriculture Act of 1997, the Secretary sub-
mit to Congress a report describing the fund-
ing necessary to adequately address NIFA’s
needs, activities, and ability to provide ade-
quate services for the growth and develop-
ment of the economies of rural communities
based on the changing demographic in the
rural and farming communities in the var-
ious States, paying particular attention to
carrying out activities relating to small and
diverse farms and ranches, veteran farmers
and ranchers, value-added agriculture, di-
rect-to-consumer sales, and specialty crops.

(55) Prohibition on slaughter of dogs and cats
for human consumption
The House bill: (1) adds a new section 30 to
the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit a person
from knowingly slaughtering a dog or cat for
human consumption, or knowingly shipping,
transporting, moving, delivering, receiving,
possessing, purchasing, selling, or donating a
dog or cat to be slaughtered for human con-
sumption, or dog or cat parts for human con-
sumption; (2) sets forth that such prohibition
shall apply only with respect to conduct in
or affecting interstate or foreign commerce,
or within the special maritime and terri-
torial jurisdiction of the United States; (3)
establishes that any person who violates this
section shall be subject to imprisonment for
not more than 1 year, or a fine of not more
than $2,500, or both; and (4) provides that
this section does not limit any State or local
law or regulations from protecting the wel-
fare of animals, or prevent a State or local
governing body from adopting and enforcing
more stringent laws or regulations. (Section
11613)
The Senate amendment: (1) sets forth that
no person may knowingly slaughter a dog or
cat for human consumption, or knowingly
ship, transport, move, deliver, receive, pos-
sess, purchase, sell, or donate a dog or cat to

Labels’’ (81 Federal Register 33742), has on
consumer perception regarding the ‘‘added
sugar’’ statement required to be included on
panels by the final rule with respect to pack-
aged food in which no sugar is added during
processing, including pure honey and maple
syrup. (Section 9203)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House bill with an amendment that incor-
porates language permitting the food label-
ing requirements under section 403(q) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21
U.S.C. 343(q)) to not require that the nutri-
tion facts label of any single ingredient
sugar, honey, agave, and syrup, including
maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for
sale as a single ingredient food bear the dec-
laration ‘‘Includes Xg Added Sugars.’’ (Sec-
tion 12516)
The Managers take note of numerous sur-
veys highlighting high incidence of con-
sumer confusion resulting from a mandatory
declaration specifying ‘‘added sugar’’ on nu-
trition facts panel labels on single ingredient
products such as pure honey and pure maple
syrup. While the Managers are willing to
consider future proposals by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) to specify per-
cent daily value in relation to the sugar con-
tent in these single ingredient products, the
Managers’ intent is to stop FDA from requir-
ing any form of a mandatory declaration of
‘‘added sugar’’ content on single ingredient
products. The Managers further suggest that
future efforts by the FDA to regulate added
sugar aspects of the nutrition facts label
should be informed by research documenting
consumer interpretation of proposed label
statements.
(57) Expedited exportation of certain species
The Senate amendment instructs the Di-
rector of the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)
to issue a rule proposing to amend FWS re-
quirements pertaining to export permissions
for certain species. The rule is to consider es-
tablishing expedited procedures for export-
ing sea urchins and sea cucumbers intended
for human and animal food. (Section 12601)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment amending
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) regulations
relating to export permission requirements
for green sea urchins, only, to facilitate
their exportation, and requires data on the
conservation and management of green sea
urchins be provided to relevant government
entities. (Section 12617)
(58) Baiting of migratory game birds
The Senate amendment: (1) provides defini-
tions for normal agricultural operation,
post-disaster flooding, and certain agricul-
tural practices related to rice production; (2)
requires the Secretary of the Interior, in
consultation with the Secretary of Agri-
culture, to revise agency regulations clari-
fying that certain practices for rice pro-
ducers, when carried out as part of a normal
agricultural operation, do not constitute
baiting; and (3) directs the Secretary to issue
reports related to the provisions of the sec-
tion. (Section 12602)

(67) Eligibility for operators on heirs property
land to obtain a farm number

defining that land as a farm, and requires
the Secretary to identify alternative forms
of eligible documentation that a farm oper-
ator may provide in seeking the assignment
of a farm number. (Section 12623)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision. (Section 12615)
The Managers recognize that farm opera-
tors on land that has been passed down
through multiple generations without formal
probate proceedings may not have clear title
to the land. The Managers intend for this
section to ensure operators of such land,
commonly referred to as heirs’ property, who
provide certain documentation to the Sec-
retary are eligible to receive farm numbers
for the purposes of accessing programs of-
fered by the Farm Service Agency, Natural
Resources Conservation Service, and Risk
Management Agency. In determining States
that have enacted or adopted the Uniform
Partition of Heirs Property Act, the Man-
agers intend that USDA consider ‘‘State’’ to
mean any of the 50 States, the District of Co-
lumbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
the Virgin Islands of the United States,
Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands, Republic of
Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, and
the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
(68) Farmland ownership data collection
The Senate amendment instructs the Sec-
retary to collect, and not less frequently

analysis on farmland ownership, tenure,
transition, and entry of beginning farmers
and ranchers and socially disadvantaged
farmers and ranchers. (Section 12625)
The House bill contains no comparable pro-

ate provision with an amendment merging
the Senate provision with Section 2506 of
Title II, and House Section 7604. (Section

The Senate amendment repeals section 713
of the National Oilheat Research Alliance
Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 6201 note; Public Law
106–469), allowing it to become permanent
law, and inserts new section 708 addressing
limitations on the obligations of funds. (Sec-

The House bill contains no comparable pro-
vision.
The Conference substitute adopts the Sen-
ate provision with an amendment extending
the covered period to 10 years. (Section 12531)
(70) Reauthorization of rural emergency medical
services training and equipment assistance
program
The Senate amendment inserts a short
title for the section, adds ‘‘or to residents of
rural areas’’, reauthorizes the program
through FY2019–2023, and strikes subsections
(b) through (f) and inserts: (b) provides that
eligible applicants shall be emergency med-
ical services agencies; (c) allows funds to be
used to train medical emergency personnel,
conduct training courses, recruit personnel,

for agricultural retailers from the U.S. Occu-
pational Safety and Health Administration’s

The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute does not adopt
the House provision.
(72) Commission on farm transitions—Needs for
2050
The House bill establishes a commission
and sets an organizational framework, to be
known as the Commission on Farm Transi-
tions—Needs for 2050 to conduct a study and
issue a report on a variety of issues impact-
ing the transition of agricultural operations
from established farmers and ranchers to the
next generation of farmers and ranchers.
(Section 11205)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment clari-
fying the applicable exemptions to the Fed-
eral Advisory Committee Act, and termi-
nating the commission on September 30,
2023. (Section 12609)
(73) Restoring certain exceptions to United
States Grain Standard Act
The House bill allows certain grain han-
dling facilities to restore a prior exception
with an official agency designated under the
rule entitled ‘‘Exceptions to Geographic
Areas for Official Agencies Under the
USGSA’’ published by the Department of Ag-
riculture in the Federal Register on April 18,
2003 (68 Fed. Reg. 19137) if certain criteria are
met. (Section 11401)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment restor-
ing the nonuse of service exception to the ge-
ographic boundary provisions of the United
States Grain Standards Act and allows a
grain handling facility that lost a nonuse of
service exception after October 1, 2015, to no-
tify the Federal Grain Inspection Service to
restore the prior exception. (Section 12610)
The Managers remain concerned with the
Department’s implementation of the U.S.
Grain Standards Act provisions that pro-
vided for a ‘‘written agreement’’ exception
program, which replaced the former ‘‘non-
use of service’’ exception program. In
USDA’s notice of the final rule to implement
‘‘Reauthorization of the United States Grain
Standards Act’’, 81 Fed. Reg. 49855 (July 29,
2016) USDA indicated its intention to ‘‘con-
tinue to honor’’ the 95 current agreements
for agencies to operate outside of their as-
signed geographic territories. However, Fed-
eral Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) Direc-
tive 9290.18, which was issued to provide in-
structions on how to implement the new re-
quirements, contradicted the intention ex-
pressed in the notice of final rule and created
uncertainty for grain handling facilities.
Specifically, FGIS permitted unilateral ter-
mination of these agreements by an incum-
bent designated agency—a practice that Con-
gress did not intend, did not agree with, and
subsequently prevented through appropria-
tions language.
Unilateral termination created uncer-
tainty for grain handling facilities—the pri-
mary customers of the officially designated
inspection agencies. The conference sub-
stitute reinstates the ‘‘non-use of service ex-
ception and establishes a new policy that
precludes unilateral termination of these ex-
ception agreements. The Managers believe
that it is important for grain handling facili-
ties and the excepted official agency to have
input into this process and that FGIS should
not permit one party to terminate an excep-
tion agreement.
The Managers do not intend for the res-
toration of exceptions to require a formal
rulemaking process. The Managers intend to
provide a near term option for grain han-
dling facilities to go back to a previously ap-
proved by the Department non-use of service
exception agreement, provided that the
former excepted official agency agrees. Grain
handling facilities would have 90 days from
enactment to notify the Secretary of its pre-
ferred date to restore the exception and
within 90 days of this notification, the Sec-
retary must restore this exception. The Man-
agers do not intend for the Secretary to wait
90 days to restore an exception. The Man-
agers urge FGIS and the Secretary to work
with the grain handling facilities and ex-
cepted agencies to expedite this process. The
Managers intend that if an official agency
loses its designation, any exceptions that
agency has are terminated by the Secretary.
If that agency regains its designation the
Secretary may restore the exceptions it had.
The Managers expect the Department to
work closely with and give considerable
weight to the input provided by the cus-
tomer that previously utilized these excep-
tions when taking into account whether or
not to restore the exception.
The Managers expect the Department to
issue an updated directive noting the re-
stored exception category and the process to
reinstate exceptions that had been termi-
nated. The Managers expect FGIS to care-
fully review requests to reinstate an excep-
tion when one or more parties to the pre-
vious exception have changed ownership and
to reinstate the exception as appropriate.
(74) Conference report requirement threshold
The House bill amends the section to raise
the threshold for conferences excluded from
the report from those costing less than
$10,000, to those costing less than $75,000.
(Section 11603)
The Senate amendment contains no com-
parable provision.
The Conference substitute adopts the
House provision with an amendment reduc-
ing the threshold to $50,000. (Section 12611)
(75) National agriculture imagery program
The House bill: (1) instructs the Secretary,
working through FSA, to institute a na-
tional agriculture imagery program to annu-
ally acquire aerial imagery during agricul-
tural growing seasons from the continental
United States; (2) requires that the aerial
imagery acquired under this section shall
consist of high resolution processed digital
imagery, be made available in a format that
can be provided to Federal, State, and pri-
vate sector entities, be technologically com-
patible with geospatial information tech-
nology, and be consistent with the standards
established by the Federal Geographic Data
Committee; and (3) authorizes appropria-
tions of $23 million for fiscal year 2019 and
each fiscal year thereafter. (Section 11604)

struction or adverse modification of the crit-

Additional Report Language
Section 12520 Authorization of protection oper-
ations for the Secretary of Agriculture and
others
The Managers intend for the Department
to exercise the protection authorities grant-
ed in section 12520 when warranted, including
to individuals serving in Acting Secretary or
Deputy Secretary roles, consistent with
threat assessments and applicable guidelines
or requirements.
Section (a)(2) grants the authority to pro-
vide protection that is incidental to the pro-
tection provided to the Secretary or Deputy
Secretary. Such authority should be used
only when: (1) extenuating circumstances
occur that pose an articulable threat to such
individual; and (2) the security of the Sec-
retary or Deputy Secretary would not be
jeopardized in protecting other qualified in-
dividuals. Such extenuating circumstances
may include, for example, a car accident,
where individuals traveling with the Sec-
retary have suffered physical harm and the
Secretary’s protection would not be jeopard-
ized by protecting other qualified individ-
uals. The Managers do not intend for the
number of security personnel accompanying
the Secretary or Deputy Secretary to in-
crease because of any potential need to pro-
tect any additional persons in extenuating
circumstances.
The Managers are wary of increasing secu-
rity costs. The Department has represented
to the Managers that it does not anticipate
spending additional resources over its cur-
rent budget and that in exercising this au-
thority, it does not intend to automatically
provide protection to additional Department
officials. Although this authority is being
provided, the Managers do not expect for the
Department to alter the current level of pro-
tection or the number of officials protected,
unless warranted.
The Managers further intend for the term
‘‘continuous protection’’ to mean protection
at all times when there is an articulable
threat of physical harm, as assessed through
threat assessments, including at a personal
residence and during periods of personal,
non- official activities.
The Managers intend for the report re-
quired by subsection (e) to describe the indi-
viduals to whom protection was provided
under this authority, the extent and fre-
quency of such protections, and measures
undertaken to determine the necessity of
protection. The Department shall provide
the Committee on Agriculture of the United
States House of Representatives and the
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and
Forestry of the United States Senate with
timely briefings, upon request, regarding the
use of this authority.
