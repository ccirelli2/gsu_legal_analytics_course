HONORING DAVID E. WHITEHEAD
HON. RUSS FULCHER
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Saturday, December 14, 2019
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the work of an esteemed engi-
neer and inventor in Idaho, David Whitehead.
Modern engineering has changed the way we
live—not only in Idaho—but across the world
and in no small part because of the team at
Schweitzer Engineering and Mr. Whitehead.
Schweitzer Engineering was started in 1982
and shipped the first digital protective relay
and today provides products and services for
electrical utilities, healthcare, government, and
highly specialized facilities. In 1994, Dave
joined Schweitzer Engineering, and worked his
way up to the position of Chief Executive Offi-
cer, and has over 70 patents to his name. On
December 14th, Mr. Whitehead will be award-
ed an honorary Doctorate of Engineering by
the University of Idaho at the December Com-
mencement Ceremony. I join the communities
of Idaho in honoring his hard work, dedication,
and passion in the world of technology. It’s
work like this, and people like Dave White-
head, that has propelled the United States to
be the most technologically advanced country
in the world.
