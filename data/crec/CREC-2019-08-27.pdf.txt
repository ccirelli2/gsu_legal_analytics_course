HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF ROBERT PAUL ROBERTS
HON. MARK E. GREEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Robert Paul Rob-
erts, born August 22, 1922 in Lexington, Ten-
nessee.
Mr. Roberts graduated from Lexington High
School in 1941 and attended the University of
Tennessee-Martin in 1941 through 1942 when
the nation was swept into World War II.
About one year after Pearl Harbor, Mr. Rob-
erts entered active duty in the U.S. Army on
December 5, 1942. Roberts served in the 84th
Infantry Division/9th Army Company. He
served in Holland, Belgium, and Germany, in-
cluding battles and campaigns in the Rhine-
land. He landed in Omaha Beach in the fall of
1944.
Mr. Roberts returned home on the Queen
Elizabeth II and was honorably discharged on
February 21, 1946 in Ft. McPherson, Georgia.
Upon his return, he worked as a farmer and
a brick and stone mason, helping to build
many homes, schools, and churches in West
Tennessee.
Mr. Roberts is a decorated veteran, having
earned the World War II Victory Medal, the
European African Middle Eastern Service
Medal, and a Bronze Star American Service
Medal.
Mr. Roberts is married to Betty Wood. They
have six children, eleven grandchildren, eight-
een great grandchildren, and a loving church
family.
Madam Speaker, I commend this great
American on another year lived. I ask that my
colleagues in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives join me in congratulating him and
thanking him for his service to our nation.

RECOGNIZING KENNICE ALEX OF
LOS ANGELES
HON. NORMA J. TORRES
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the accomplishments of
Kennice Alex in 40 years of service to the
California Highway Patrol and the Los Angeles
Communications Center.
‘‘Wow! Thank You!’’ & ‘‘There she goes!’’
These are just a few expressions Kennice
Alex hears from her co-workers on a daily
basis. But before you can truly understand
these expressions, you must first hear the
many accomplishments of a woman who
began her career with the California Highway
Patrol 40 years ago.
Kennice is a native of Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia. She was born on September 26th, and
has raised two amazing daughters: Tiffany
and Brittany. While doing so, she was able to
nurture and love three additional children, and
is currently assisting in raising her grandson,
all within Los Angeles. In addition to spending
time with her family, Kennice enjoys many ac-
tivities such: Water Aerobics, Zumba, and
AARP Soul Steppers. Not only has she volun-
teered at different food banks in Los Angeles,
she has also worked with the Lakers organiza-
tion, helping feed the homeless on Thanks-
giving Day. Her volunteer work does not stop
there. She has donated items and worked with
the Dream Center assisting victims of Hurri-
cane Katrina; recruited coworkers, dubbed
‘‘Chippies Angeles,’’ to donate items at the
Louis Dantzler Preparatory Academy Middle
School; and raised money for breast cancer
patients at the City of Hope.
Kennice began her career with the Cali-
fornia Highway Patrol on July 23, 1979. At
work, Kennice is well-respected and referred
to as ‘‘Ms. Kennice’’. She was part of the last
training class to work on cards and one of the
first to work on computers, as Los Angeles
Communications Center served as the Pilot for
CHP going live on Computer Aided Dispatch.
During her tenure, Kennice served as a union
representative for 26 years. While in this posi-
tion, she attended numerous meetings in Sac-
ramento with state legislators to discuss allo-
cating funds for programs in public safety and
911 issues. During the many incidents
Kennice has worked over the years, the 1199
Officer-involved shooting of Officers Martinez
and Szabo is one she will never forget. While
on duty, Kennice received the call for help
from the Officers, and immediately began to
work diligently to ensure both Officers re-
ceived immediate assistance from all field per-
sonnel and allied agencies. Unbeknownst to
Kennice and her beat partner, the outcome of
this incident would leave Officer Martinez fa-
tally wounded and Officer Szabo severely in-
jured. Kennice remained calm and profes-
sional under the most stressful situation a dis-
patcher can ever face. Throughout her career,
she has also worked numerous events such
as the 1984 Olympics, the 1991 LA Riots, the
Northridge Earthquake, the OJ Simpson Pur-
suit and trial, the 2000 Democratic National
Convention, and the Y2K changeover, just to
name a few.
Throughout the years, Ms. Kennice has be-
nevolently and continuously met the needs of
her peers. She was one of the main coordina-
tors in creating the Relaxation room at our
Communications Center, where she continues
to maintain and purchase supplies. She gen-
erated ‘‘Team CHP’’ where she and coworkers
help raise awareness and funds by partici-
pating in charity events such as the Revlon
Breast Cancer Walk, the Multiple Sclerosis
Walk, and several Chips for Kids toy drives.
Ms. Kennice has not only dedicated her
time and talent but has given us 40 illustrious
years of hard work and dedication to the com-
munity and the California Highway Patrol.
RECOGNIZING THE NORTH AMER-
ICAN GAY AMATEUR ATHLETIC
ALLIANCE GAY SOFTBALL
WORLD SERIES IN KANSAS CITY,
MISSOURI
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I proudly
rise today to celebrate the North American
Gay Amateur Athletic Alliance (NAGAAA) Gay
Softball World Series this year being held in
Kansas City, Missouri. On behalf of myself
and Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District, we
are honored and overjoyed to have been se-
lected as the 2019 host of the Gay Softball
World Series.
In 1977, teams of athletes from New York
and San Francisco, met to form the organiza-
tion that would become NAGAAA and orga-
nize the inaugural Gay Softball World Series.
Today, over four decades later, the NAGAAA
is an international sports organization com-
mitted to providing and promoting opportuni-
ties for LGBTQ+ communities to participate in
amateur athletics across the United States
and Canada. In 2019, more than one thou-
sand NAGAAA teams competed across seven
divisions of play in forty-six cities throughout
North America. The organization is focused on
creating a safe and inclusive environment
where its athletes can compete and be them-
selves.
Kansas City has a longstanding tradition of
LGBTQ+ activism and advocacy, which was
kindled in 1966 when the city hosted the Na-
tional Planning Conference of Homophile Or-
ganizations. After the conference, the city be-
came a leader on the national stage for the
movement for LGBTQ+ civil rights, spear-
headed by the Phoenix Society for Individual
Freedom. The Phoenix Society for Individual
Freedom was committed to ‘‘improving the
legal, social, and economic status’’ of mem-
bers of the LGBTQ+ community while pro-
viding a safe space for LGBTQ+ Kansas
Citians to live freely. In the face of discrimina-
tion and inequality, LGBTQ+ individuals found
refuge and community in Kansas City.
Kansas City, with its history of championing
LGBTQ+ rights and culture, is extremely proud
that the NAGAAA selected us to host the Gay
Softball World Series this year. Today, Kansas
City continues to be a metropolis of LGBTQ+
culture nationwide. Through cornerstone insti-
tutions such as the Kansas City Center for In-
clusion, Empowering Queer Activists and
Leaders (EQUAL), and the Mid-America Gay
and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, to name
a few, the city fosters a welcoming and sup-
portive atmosphere for the uplifting of
LGBTQ+ individuals. LGBTQ+ arts thrive in
Kansas City as well via the Heartland Men’s
Chorus, performances at Hamburger Mary’s
and Missie B’s, and at the annual KC LGBT
Film Festival. In April, the AIDS Walk of Kan-
sas City is held to raise awareness for the dis-
ease, and in June, the entire city celebrates

Pride. As a proud host of the Gay Softball
World Series, Kansas City looks forward to
continuing its rich history of supporting the
LGBTQ+ community.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
the North American Gay Amateur Athletic Alli-
ance for their admirable work with the
LGBTQ+ community nationwide and cele-
brating the 2019 Gay Softball World Series in
Kansas City. We are indebted to the NAGAAA
which has changed the lives of LGBTQ+ indi-
viduals for the past forty-two years and left an
indelible mark on our country and commu-

COMMEMORATING THE CITY OF
SPRINGFIELD, TENNESSEE, ON
ITS BICENTENNIAL ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. JOHN W. ROSE
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the City of
Springfield, Tennessee, in honor of its 200th
anniversary. Springfield is the county seat of
Robertson County, located just north of Nash-
ville and just south of the Tennessee-Kentucky
border.
With a little over 16,000 citizens, Springfield
has regularly demonstrated exactly what it
means to be a tight-knit community. This town
is built on a solid foundation of hard work, ag-
ricultural acumen, and family values, and it
has continued to show these unwavering at-
tributes over the course of its long history.
Although Springfield was not incorporated
until 1819, the first General Assembly of Ten-
nessee gave a county seat identified as
Springfield to Robertson County in 1796. Two
years later, in 1798, the town was established
under this name.
Since the early eighteenth century, agri-
culture has played a large role in Springfield’s
development, and it continues to provide many
employment opportunities for its citizens.
Thanks to its rich soil, Springfield thrives in the
production of hay, corn, and wheat, but is best
known for its production of tobacco. In fact, in
1928, Springfield was labeled as the ‘‘Home of
the World’s Finest Dark Fired Tobacco.’’
I hope that my House colleagues will join
me in celebrating this bicentennial achieve-
ment of Springfield, Tennessee. The town and
its residents have continued to show the
strong faith and values of Tennessee since
the days when its first courthouse was built of
hand-hewn logs. I wish Springfield and its citi-
zens much prosperity and happiness over its
next 200 years and beyond.

RECOGNIZING DOUG GIBSON AS
CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH
HON. MIKE LEVIN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I
am honored to name Doug Gibson, of
Encinitas, as my Constituent of the Month for
his 23 years of leadership as the Executive Di-
rector and Principal Scientist of Nature Collec-
tive, formerly known as San Elijo Lagoon Con-
servancy.
Residents of North County may remember
that, not so long ago, our beautiful lagoons
and river valleys were not valued for their bio-
diversity and were threatened by development
and pollution. Their outlets to the ocean were
blocked and invasive plant species were grow-
ing out of control. Few fish or invertebrates
could survive in the murky waters. Today, they
have largely been restored to their natural
states. They provide critical habitats for native
plants and animals as well as wetlands for mi-
grating birds.
It has taken years of stable leadership, hard
work, and a shared commitment by profes-
sionals, local citizens, elected officials, and
supportive organizations to restore the ten
beautiful wetlands in North County San Diego
and South Orange County. They enhance our
coastline—from the Los Penasquitos Lagoon
in the south—to the San Juan Creek in the
North.
Under Gibson’s leadership, the Nature Col-
lective is guiding to completion the $120 mil-
lion restoration of the 1,000-acre San Elijo La-
goon Ecological Reserve. Forty miles of
streams have been restored. An annual
breaching of the inlet has been established to
keep the lagoon healthy. More than three
thousand school children in the Nature Collec-
tive’s nationally recognized school program re-
ceive field trips throughout the Escondido wa-
tershed. Walkers and joggers can access
seven miles of trails from Cardiff-by-the-Sea,
Solana Beach, Encinitas, and Rancho Santa
Fe, and new trail connections are coming
soon.
Gibson’s contribution goes beyond the San
Elijo Lagoon. For decades, he has collabo-
rated on the planning of large restoration
projects in seven north San Diego County wa-
tersheds, including Buena Vista Lagoon, San
Dieguito Lagoon, San Elijo Lagoon, and Carls-
bad Hydrologic Unit. He has chaired the San
Diego County Wetlands Task Force and
chaired five coastal counties for the Southern
California Wetlands Recovery Project.
There is no doubt that Gibson’s dedication
to protecting our environment has improved
the quality of life for families in Southern Cali-
fornia and uplifted our communities. I am
deeply grateful for his hard work, and I am
proud to recognize him as the Constituent of
the Month.

HONORING VIOLET BARTON
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Violet Barton, a doctoral candidate at
UC Merced who has been awarded the Ful-
bright Scholarship. While receiving this highly
competitive scholarship, Violet lived in El Sal-
vador to research the socioeconomic, racial,
and gender inequality present in the country.
During her time in El Salvador, Violet con-
nected closely to her culture as a Latina
woman and worked towards uplifting the com-
munity. Violet spearheaded the creation of the
first ever indigenous Nahuat spiritual guide
leadership program and coordinated with oth-
ers to identify and train future spiritual leaders.
She has also recently completed her level four
Nahuat language training at the University of
Central America, furthering her understanding
and study of the culture.
Violet’s passion for her research and the
communities she serves has distinguished her
as a true pioneer in her field. During her year
abroad, Violet was selected to serve as a pan-
elist at the annual Latin American Studies As-
sociation Conference in Boston, where she
presented some of her ongoing research find-
ings. In addition to the Fulbright Scholarship,
Violet received the coveted UC Merced Miguel
Velez Scholarship alongside a $10,000 fellow-
ship from the UC Office of Multi Campus Re-
search Programs.
While earning these countless honors for
her academic excellence, Violet has distin-
guished herself as a student leader who works
tirelessly to better the lives of her community.
Violet received the Outstanding Graduate Stu-
dent Award in 2018, the UC Merced Social
Justice Award in 2017 and 2018, and during
that same timeframe, was nominated for UC
Merced’s Outstanding Student Leadership for
three consecutive years.
Violet’s successes do not stop at her profes-
sional and academic achievements. Violet and
her daughter, Danielle Bermudez, made Ful-
bright history as the first mother and daughter
to receive the Fulbright Scholarship as grad-
uate students during the program’s 72-year
history. Together, they exemplify the pio-
neering spirit of UC Merced and the diversity
that embodies California’s San Joaquin Valley.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in honoring Violet Barton for her out-
standing leadership, scholarship, and service
to her community. I join Violet and her family
as they celebrate her incredible accomplish-
ments and wish her the best as she completes
her PhD at UC Merced.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF FRANKLIN AUGUSTUS
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND
OF LOUISIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the life and legacy of Mr. Franklin Au-
gustus, a stunt pilot and avid flyer. Mr. Augus-
tus passed away on Friday, August 16, 2019
at the age of 69.
Mr. Augustus was an acrobatic air show
pilot and a member of a New Orleans-based
group that honored the Tuskegee Airmen. A li-
censed pilot who had been flying since the
age of 19, he once described himself as the
‘‘world’s only black civilian air-show acrobatic
pilot’’ in a 1988 Times-Picayune Newspaper
article. Mr. Augustus performed hundreds of
daredevil aerial maneuvers at shows and often
visited schools to speak with young students
to encourage them to explore aviation.
In addition to being a stunt pilot and avid
flyer, Mr. Augustus was a longtime community
activist, a U.S. Army veteran, the president of
the Lake Charles Tuskegee Airmen Chapter
and a Reserve Deputy for the New Orleans
Parish Sheriff’s Office.
Mr. Augustus was a treasure to us all. He
lived a fulfilled life doing what he loved to do
for so many years. We are forever grateful to

HONORING THE LIFE OF PETER
VANG
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life and career of Mr. Peter Vang.
Peter passed away on Friday, May 18, 2019
in Clovis, California. He was a beloved and
well-respected member of the community, and
he will be missed by all who had the pleasure
of working with him.
Peter was born on January 20, 1960 in
Laos and immigrated to the United States with
his family as a refugee after the Vietnam War.
He was an embodiment of the American
Dream. Peter and his family came to settle in
the United States to start a new beginning. His
own experiences as a refugee motivated Peter
to help those in the Southeast Asian commu-
nity assimilate to life in the United States.
Peter loved the United States and became a
naturalized citizen. He was very proud of this
accomplishment.
Peter served as the Executive Director of
the Lao Veterans of America, Inc., in Fresno,
California where he helped the Lao and
Hmong soldiers who fought in the Special
Guerrilla Unit (SGU) during the Vietnam War.
Peter was a driving force in assisting my office
with the creation of the Hmong Burial legisla-
tion that became Public Law 115–141 on
March 23, 2018.
Peter was a hard-working individual who
dedicated his life to serving others. During his
career, Peter worked for the Fresno County
Department of Social Services for over 21
years, until his retirement in 2015. He also
spent many years with the Lao Family Com-
munity of Fresno. In addition to his profes-
sional career, Peter served on numerous com-
munity boards and committees and received
awards and recognitions during his lifetime. It
was most fitting and appropriate that I ap-
pointed Peter to the Fresno County Equal Op-
portunities Commission (EOC), where he
served with distinction as a commissioner for
22 years. His service to the community will not
be forgotten.
Peter was preceded by his mother, See
Yang and by his son, Richard Vang.
Peter is survived by his son, Billy Vang who
is currently serving in the U.S. Army, stationed
in Okinawa, Japan, Billy’s wife, Ryoko Vang
and their child, Haruka Vang; his daughter,
Sarah Vang; his daughter, Mindy Ruz, her
husband, Anthony and their children, Valerie
and Audrey Ruz; his daughter, Sylvia Phillips,
her husband, Matthew and their children, An-
drew and Charlotte Phillips; his father,
WaCheng Vang; brother, Yeu Vang; sisters,
Kaying Moua, Mee Vue and Betty Vang-Do, a
long with his nephew and nieces. Peter was a
wonderful son, brother, father, uncle and
grandfather.
I will remember Peter’s good humor, his will-
ingness to always help, his calming demeanor
and his smile. He was a great friend and advi-
sor. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
join me today in honoring the life and career
of Peter Vang, a hero to his family, a wonder-
ful role model for his children and grand-
children, his siblings and friends and an exem-
plary member of the community.

TRIBUTE TO JAMES ‘‘JIM’’
ALBERT CULLUM, JR.
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today I rise in honor of jazz legend Jim
Cullum, Jr. who passed on August 11, 2019.
Mr. Cullum hails from my hometown of San
Antonio. For 60 years he exemplified what it
means to be an artist. He is survived by his
longtime companion, Donna Cloud; sister,
Mary Conoly Hester; children, Bonnie Cullum,
Blanquita Sullivan, Lené Conner-Foley, Chris
Cullum, James Cullum, Katie Cullum, and
Catlin Cloud; and six grandchildren. Although
the San Antonio and Jazz community will
mourn the loss of Jim Cullum, Jr., his impact
will endure for many years to come.
James ‘‘Jim’’ Albert Cullum, Jr. was born on
September 20, 1941 to James Albert Cullum
and Conoly Prendergast Cullum. At an early
age he was drawn to music, listening to his fa-
ther’s records and who was a well-respected
jazz clarinetist and saxophonist. In 1953, the
family moved to San Antonio from Dallas.
In 1963, the Cullum family established the
Landing Jazz Club in the basement of the Nix
Hospital, becoming the first nightclub on San
Antonio’s historic Riverwalk. For decades, the
Landing played six nights a week until the
passing of Jim Cullum, Sr. Shortly after, the
band renamed itself the Jim Cullum Band.
Since then, the band performed over 300 jazz
masses across the United States. The band
and its members became ambassadors of the
City of San Antonio, and played in venues like
the Carnegie Hall, Austin City Limits, the
White House, and the Kennedy Center.
Jim Cullum carried his performances
throughout the world and taught music work-
shops locally. He served as the president of
the San Francisco Traditional Jazz Foundation
and created the Cullum Riverwalk Jazz radio
program, syndicated on National Public Radio
broadcasting. The weekly program reached
across 200 stations for 25 years.
Cullum was a historian at heart. He dedi-
cated much of his time advocating for the
preservation of San Antonio’s historic sites. He
was known to live by the Golden Rule, holding
strong convictions of integrity and respect. No-
tably, he inspired many to pursue their interest
in music and would bring light into every room
he occupied.
A mentor, artist, and activist are just a few
words to describe such a remarkable indi-
vidual. Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand
and recognize this brilliant bohemian who
dedicated his life to music and community. He
will be greatly missed.

HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Eli Pannell, a senior from Fulton
High School, who won the Illinois High School
Association’s Class 1A State Finals Boys
Wrestling Tournament.
Eli Pannell finished his final year at Fulton
High school with 34 victories, a record single-
season. He won the finals by pinning his op-
ponent in 5 minutes 3 seconds. Due to his vic-
tory he not only won the State Finals, but
holds multiple records at Fulton. As a former
athlete, I appreciate the fortitude Eli displayed
to achieve his dream of being a state cham-
pion and commend him for his determination
and attitude. Eli is an example of the impor-
tance of dedication and a strong work ethic. I
am proud there is such young talent in our
community, and to see him represent Fulton
so well throughout the state.
It is because of student leaders such as Eli
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I
would like to again formally congratulate Eli
Pannell on his Class 1A State Finals title in
Wrestling.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CENTEN-
NIAL OF THE WALDORF EDU-
CATION SYSTEM
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 100th anniversary of
the Waldorf education system.
The first Waldorf school was established in
1919 in Stuttgart, Germany to reflect the prin-
ciples of education outlined by Rudolf Steiner,
an Austrian philosopher, artist, and scientist.
These principles aim to nurture the needs of
growing children from preschool through
twelfth grade and enable them to fully develop
their intellectual, artistic, emotional, and phys-
ical skills. A Waldorf education allows children
to experience music, theater, literature, and
writing in unique ways that help them cultivate
their imagination and creativity and truly be
confident of their place in the world.
The Waldorf Education system plays an im-
portant role in our community. Rudolf Steiner
School of Ann Arbor, one of the over 160 Wal-
dorf schools across North America, opened its
doors in 1980, beginning as a school for
grades one through four. Since then, the
school has significantly transformed. Today,
Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor offers a
complete pre-k to 12th grade program and
continues to encourage students to take risks,
be passionate, and strive to reach their per-
sonal goals. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann
Arbor is truly dedicated to inspiring our na-
tion’s next generation and preparing them to
tackle life with confidence, self-knowledge,
and a true understanding of the world.

TRIBUTE TO GRACIA MOLINA
ENRIQUEZ DE PICK
HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker,
I stand today to remember Gracia Molina
Enriquez de Pick, who passed away on Au-
gust 11th at the age of 91.
A fierce feminist, educator, and philan-
thropist, Gracia will be remembered for her
work in both Mexico City and San Diego. She
was a tireless activist whose incredible con-
tributions to San Diego and the world will not
be soon forgotten.
Gracia was born into a politically active fam-
ily in Morelia, Mexico. As a teenager, Gracia
had the opportunity to meet Diego Rivera and
Frida Khalo, whose words—‘‘the importance of
social responsibility mandates fighting for
those who cannot defend themselves’’—be-
came a lesson Gracia would return to many
times during the course of her work.
Before moving to San Diego, Gracia fought
for women’s suffrage while living in Mexico
City in the early 1950s. Gracia was known for
taking a literal soapbox to the city’s open-air
markets and advocating for the right to vote to
anyone who would listen. Mexican women
were granted full citizenship and suffrage in
1953. While living in Mexico City, Gracia met
Richard Allen Pick, whom she would later
marry and relocate with to San Diego in 1957.
Gracia earned her Bachelor of Arts degree,
teaching credentials, and her Master’s degree
from San Diego State University and went on
to teach junior high school in the National City
neighborhood of San Diego. She later became
a faculty member at Mesa College, where she
helped found one of the nation’s first Chicano
Studies programs. Gracia went on to teach at
Third College (later Thurgood Marshall Col-
lege) at the University of California, San
Diego.
In addition to teaching, Gracia was involved
with politics in San Diego. She served as the
Chicana Caucus Chair of the National Wom-
en’s Political Caucus and the National Council
of La Raza (now UnidosUS). She was a pub-
lished author, whose 2008 book ‘‘Mujeres en
al Historia & Historias de Mujeres’’ explored
the history of indigenous women in Mexico.
Later in life, Gracia turned to philanthropy.
She donated money to scholarships at UC
San Diego and Mesa College and helped fund
the construction of the Logan Heights library
branch.
Gracia is survived by two sons and a
daughter. She will be remembered by her life
of service and her commitment to uplifting her
communities.
TRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL ASSO-
CIATION FOR THE ADVANCE-
MENT OF COLORED PEOPLE
PASADENA BRANCH
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People (NAACP) Pasa-
dena Branch upon its centennial anniversary.
Established on September 8, 1919, the
NAACP Pasadena Branch was founded when
a small group of citizens gathered at the re-
quest of John Wright, founder, NAACP Pasa-
dena Branch, to address the needs of Pasa-
dena’s minority population. As the recipient of
the national NAACP’s 16th charter, the Pasa-
dena Branch emerged during the NAACP’s ini-
tial period of membership growth and meteoric
rise to national prominence. The Pasadena
Branch’s founding mission was to serve as the
voice of all people who were denied the basic
dignities rightfully due to human beings, espe-
cially African American residents in Pasadena.
Over the past century, the national NAACP
has proven itself as the country’s premier civil
rights organization, fulfilling its mission of en-
suring the educational, political, social, and
economic equality of minority groups in the
United States and eliminating prejudice based
on race. Among its many national achieve-
ments, the NAACP played crucial roles in the
establishment of the Fair Employment Prac-
tices Committee in 1941, the integration of the
U.S. Armed Forces, the passage of the Civil
Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968, and the
Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Locally, the NAACP Pasadena Branch fol-
lowed the national organization’s course of ac-
tion by petitioning for school and municipal
employment, home ownership, and access to
public swimming pools for African Americans.
Under the leadership of Ruby McKnight Wil-
liams in the 1970’s, the Pasadena Branch also
supported two national precedent-setting
school integration cases in the Supreme
Court, paving the way for a more just and in-
clusive education system in our public
schools.
Today, the Pasadena Branch continues its
commitment to racial justice and equality
through community engagement, partnering
with local organizations to find solutions for
issues such as affordable housing, a livable
minimum wage and law enforcement matters.
To inspire and prepare the next generation of
leaders, activists, and engaged citizens, the
Pasadena Branch organizes the Afro-Aca-
demic, Cultural, Technological, and Scientific
Olympics (ACT–SO) to encourage and stimu-
late academic and cultural achievement
among high school students. In addition, the
branch awards the Maurice Morse Scholarship
to high achieving African American students in
the Pasadena area pursuing higher education.
I am honored to recognize the NAACP
Pasadena Branch for 100 years of outstanding
service to the community and its commitment
to eliminating racial barriers. I ask all Members
to join me in congratulating the Pasadena
Branch for its remarkable achievements.

Tuesday, August 27, 2019

Mrs. Latimer was born on May 31, 1946, in
Alum Creek, West Virginia and was a proud

the wife of Horn Lake Mayor Allen B. Latimer.
She and Allen shared a 42-year long mar-
riage. Throughout her life in Horn Lake, she
worked for the Federal Reserve Bank, Sacred
Heart School, and the City of Southaven.
Left to cherish her memory is her husband,
Allen B. Latimer of Horn Lake, MS; her step-
daughter Collen Latimer Sears; her two grand-
children; as well as many other beloved family
and friends.
Joan’s life was one of service, grace, love

Governor Blanco was a giant whose life and

ernor Blanco was a trailblazer whose work
and dedication to the state of Louisiana re-
mains unquestionable. Her legacy of leader-
ship during the plight of Hurricane Katrina will

Louisianans.
It has been an honor to work with Governor
Blanco during my career, and I am grateful for
her service. I send my sincere condolences,
prayers, and strength to the Blanco family dur-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1077
August 27, 2019
have such a historically significant establish-
ment in Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District.
Located in the Brookside neighborhood of
Kansas City at 63rd Street and Brookside
Boulevard, the historic shopping district was
founded on September 1, 1919. Headlining
the Country Club District Bulletin as ‘‘the first
group of neighborhood shops’’, it brought a
sense of utility and practicality. Construction
for the Brookside Shopping District began be-
fore World War I and would be completed
over the next decade. An innovative under-
taking that proudly followed the model of other
developments taking place across the United
States, particularly Yorkship Village, New Jer-
sey. Like the historic Yorkship Village of 1918,
the Brookside Shopping District emerged
steadfast in its goal to meet the needs of the
community it served. In its founding, the dis-
trict consisted of grocery and drugstores, med-
ical offices, a community center, as well as the
first southside police and fire stations, pro-
viding all the necessary resources for the
community in a neighborhood-focused model.
In the same spirit, one hundred years later,
this welcoming and vital collection of busi-
nesses serves as a hub of a community and
exemplifies a model neighborhood center.
To this day, the Brookside Shopping District
continues to add to Kansas City’s rich histor-
ical fabric by providing community members
with a charming, diverse place to shop and
experience the city’s history. Brookside is
home to over eighty shops, restaurants, and
offices; all unique while keeping with the origi-
nal neighborhood allure and design. Moreover,
in an effort to further promote the interests of
individuals and property owners alike, the
Brookside Business Association, originally the
63rd and Brookside Business Association, was
founded in 1939. The association’s efforts
have ensured the continued improvement of
the district, making it a better place to live and
work.
Today, the Brookside Business Association
is a voluntary organization that preserves the
history of the Brookside Shopping District and
neighborhood, maintains an aesthetically
beautiful area for all to enjoy, and ensures that
the historic community center withstands the
test of time for future generations to visit and
appreciate.
Madam Speaker, please join me in cele-
brating the Brookside Shopping District’s tre-
mendous milestone of one hundred years of
service to the people of Kansas City and rec-
ognizing the district as a model for what good
urban planning and stewardship can provide
to its citizens.

RECOGNIZING BEVERLY LEE OF
LOS ANGELES
HON. NORMA J. TORRES
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the accomplishments of
Beverly Lee in 40 years of service to the Los
Angeles Communications Center, or LACC.
A Public Safety Operator at LACC is re-
sponsible for answering any and all 911, pub-
lic information, and allied agency calls in the
88 cities with in Los Angeles County. LACC is
the largest dispatch center in the state and
Los Angeles County and answers an average
of 7,000 calls a day, and over 10,000 calls a
day during holidays, special events, or catas-
trophes.
Beverly Lee’s journey at LACC began on
July 23, 1979. Her younger brother was a dis-
patcher at LACC, and he encouraged Beverly
to apply and test for a position. Beverly
worked hard during her training and passed
probation; the rest is history.
Beverly’s career is historic in many ways.
She was part of the last training class to docu-
ment critical information on cards and the first
to learn the computer-aided dispatch system.
Throughout her 40-year career, she has han-
dled innumerable high-priority emergency calls
proficiently and calmly, being the voice of help
in many hopeless moments. She was an inte-
gral part of rendering safety, service, and se-
curity to the public during the 1984 Olympics,
1991 LA Riots, 1994 Northridge Earthquake,
2000 Democratic National Convention, Y2K
computer changeover, numerous LA Lakers
Championships, the LA Kings 1st Champion-
ship, and many other notable emergencies.
She has spent an untold number of holidays
away from family and friends to assist others
that need her help.
Beverly has an excellent work ethic and dis-
plays it daily. She physically, mentally, and
emotionally exceeds her job expectations and
does it with a smile. She is a strong and dedi-
cated supporter of LACC’s training program,
and her guidance has led to many
supervisorial and managerial promotions. She
has donated food, clothing, and monetary gifts
to the homeless and to Hurricane Katrina Vic-
tims, and is an active member of ‘‘Team
CHP’’, supporting the Revlon Breast Cancer
Walks and CHIPS for Kids. Her infectious
laugh contributes to the morale of LACC, and
her willingness to go above and beyond is
truly an inspiration.
Beverly never imagined having a 40-year
career at LACC, but has maintained her goal
of having an excellent work ethic and a grate-
ful attitude. She says the most rewarding gift
of working at LACC has been the friendship,
loyalty, and support she has experienced
here. Beverly’s heart and attitude are an ex-
ample to us all.

HONORING THE IMPACT OF
SOWING SEEDS OF HOPE
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to highlight the important work of
Sowing Seeds of Hope, a faith-based non-
profit 501(c)(3) organization based in Perry
County, Alabama. The organization was
founded in 1999 by a group of mission-driven
people, drawn together by a worthwhile vision
for improving their community. Twenty years
later, Sowing Seeds of Hope has grown by
leaps and bounds, and now boasts a com-
mitted Executive Director, Mrs. Frances Ford,
a hard-working staff, a board of directors and
a task force of members committed to improv-
ing the quality of life for residents of this rural
county in the Black Belt.
One focus of Sowing Seeds of Hope has
been providing low-income residents in the
area with access to affordable prescription
drugs. Rising prescription drug prices can
often be prohibitively expensive for the un-
and under-insured, but Sowing Seeds of Hope
has worked to fill in those gaps by providing
assistance to those in need.
Sowing Seeds of Hope has a longstanding
partnership with Samford University’s
McWhorter School of Pharmacy which pro-
vides outreach opportunities within the Perry
County community to emerging pharmacy stu-
dents. This includes access to diabetes sup-
port groups, cardiovascular risk reduction re-
search, hypertension clinics and opportunities
to assist qualifying constituents to sign up for
Medicare.
Sowing Seeds of Hope has worked dili-
gently and successfully to advocate for the es-
tablishment of a DaVita Dialysis Center in
Marion, Alabama. Since its establishment, the
DaVita Dialysis Center has provided crucial
care to the community. Thanks to the center,
citizens no longer have to drive thirty minutes
to an hour to receive treatment, helping count-
less individuals to lead healthier, fuller lives.
On the educational front, Sowing Seeds of
Hope hosts ‘‘Seed Camp,’’ which is a week-
long summer camp held on the campus of
Judson College. During ‘‘Seed Camp,’’ school-
aged children from across the Black Belt are
exposed to an array of stimulating subjects in-
cluding science, math, arts, cooking, recre-
ation and character education.
Additionally, Sowing Seeds of Hope offers
social services, including parent training semi-
nars, census counting initiatives and job place-
ment services, along with many other re-
sourceful programs. Their cornerstone offering
is the ‘‘Self-Help Housing Program’’ which is
truly unlike any other program in the state of
Alabama. The program provides a pathway for
low-income families to secure their own
version of the American dream of homeowner-
ship. This is made possible through low-inter-
est USDA mortgages and the homeowners
providing ‘‘sweat equity’’ by helping build their
own home with the assistance of community
members. Nearly 20 families have transitioned
from substandard housing to high quality, af-
fordable homes thanks to the Self-Help Hous-
ing Program.
The work being done by Sowing Seeds of
Hope is integral to building stronger commu-
nities, economically and morally. In a county
that faces extreme adversity, this nonprofit
serves as a beacon of hope, letting the com-
munity know that there are people that believe
in them and their abilities and are willing to in-
vest in a brighter future, not only for individ-
uals and families, but for the overall good of
the entire community.
Let the extraordinary efforts of this organiza-
tion continue to inspire others to be engaged
in compassionate community service, making
this state and country a better place, one day
at a time.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF KENNETH ABRAHAMIAN
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and pay tribute to the life of Mr. Ken-
neth Abrahamian. Kenneth was a distin-
guished military veteran and community mem-
ber in Fresno, California. He will be greatly
missed by those who had the pleasure of
knowing him.
Kenneth was born on November 21, 1923 to
Abraham and Aurora Abrahamian, Armenian
immigrants who came to the United States in
search of the American dream. He was raised
in Rolinda, California, where hard work was in-
stilled in him from a young age. Kenneth grad-
uated from Central Union High School in 1941
and began working at the Mare Island Naval
Shipyard in Vallejo, California. He worked on
building WWII submarines, before enlisting in
the United States Navy at the age of 18. He
served on the USS Spangler and USS Ajax.
After returning home from military service,
he met and married the love of his life, Isa-
belle Zadurian. They were happily married for
72 years and were parents to three children.
Kenneth began to farm during the day and at-
tended night school to become a plumber.
Throughout his career, he worked on numer-
ous projects throughout the Central Valley,
such as the San Louis Project, Balsam Mead-
ows Hydroelectric Project and was a proud
member of Local 246 for 70 years. However,
as his farming operation expanded, he eventu-
ally returned to farming full time.
Kenneth was active in the Kearney Park
community. He forged many lifelong friend-
ships and was well-liked and respected. Ken-
neth was a proud member in his church, Holy
Trinity Armenian Apostolic Church. Madam
Speaker, I would like to note the Abrahamian
family were dear friends of my parents and
me. As a young boy, I have fond memories of
spending time with their family and growing up
with their children. It was also a pleasure to be
able to be a part of what Kenneth called ‘‘a
trip of a lifetime,’’ in which he traveled to
Washington, DC, for the Central Valley Honor
Flight. My office also worked to secure his
well-earned medals from his time in the serv-
ice.
Kenneth was preceded in death by his in-
fant son, and brothers, Gabriel, Leon, and
Richard. He is survived by his wife, Isabelle,
their children Jeanette, Patricia, and Kenneth,
his grandchildren, great-grandson and many
beloved friends and family members.
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to pay tribute to Mr. Kenneth
Abrahamian. It is my honor to join his family
and many friends in celebrating his life.

IN HONOR OF NICK BUONICONTI
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise in
honor of my friend Nick Buoniconti, the hu-
manitarian and football legend who contributed
to two Miami Dolphins Super Bowl wins in the
1970s. He passed away on July 30, 2019, at
the age of 78.
Mr. Buoniconti grew up in Springfield, Mas-
sachusetts, before enrolling in Notre Dame,
where he began his football career. Small for
the N.F.L., he began playing for the American
Football League (A.F.L.) in 1962. An ambitious
student as well as an excellent athlete, he
studied at the Suffolk University School of Law
in Boston during his tenure with the Patriots,
graduating with his law degree in 1968.
Mr. Buoniconti was traded to the Miami Dol-
phins in 1969. After the A.F.L. and N.F.L.
merged, he helped the Dolphins win the Super
Bowl VII, capping off a season in which the
team went undefeated. The Dolphins contin-
ued to dominate the next year, winning the fol-
lowing Super Bowl as well. Mr. Buoniconti
played with the team through 1976, when he
retired from professional football.
In 1985, Mr. Buoniconti’s son Marc sus-
tained a spinal cord injury in a college football
game that left him paralyzed from the neck
down. Mr. Buoniconti left his job at U.S. To-
bacco to focus on his son’s health and support
the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, of which
Marc Buoniconti currently serves as president.
The Miami Project is a Center of Excellence at
the University of Miami Miller School of Medi-
cine, where I have seen the groundbreaking
research it has supported in the fields of spi-
nal cord and traumatic brain injuries. Mr.
Buoniconti and his family also founded the
Buoniconti Fund to Cure Paralysis, which has
raised over $500 million in support of the
Miami Project’s research objectives.
Nick Buoniconti dedicated his life to excel-
lence, both in his football career and in his
work with the Miami Project. His influence will
be felt in Miami for years to come. We will re-
member him with love and pride.

RECOGNIZING LEAGUE OF WOMEN
VOTERS WATER CHALLENGE
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the League of Women Voters of
JoDaviess County for winning the Water Qual-
ity Challenge put on by the United States En-
vironmental Protection Agency. The League of
Women Voters won this challenge by showing
how an edge-of-field sensor system could sup-
port farmers in reducing nitrogen loss from
their fields.
The League of Women Voters worked to
combat one of the most challenging water
quality problems in our nation. In doing so,
they identified creative ways to use low-cost
tools to understand our resources and better
advise nutrient management decisions. The in-
stalled sensors provide real-time data to best
inform and guide farm-scale management de-
cisions. They showed innovation, passion, and
a drive to help our environment. Participation
in this challenge strengthened the connections
between scientists, advocates, and farmers in
JoDaviess County and Northwest Illinois. The
prize will be used to continue to build a model
of cooperative problem-solving and improve
water quality in the Driftless Area of Northwest
Illinois.
It is because of community leaders such as
the League of Women Voters of Illinois that I
am especially proud to serve lllinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would
like to again formally congratulate the Illinois
League of Women Voters on their initiative in
the Water Quality Challenge put on by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

INTRODUCTION OF THE UNI-
VERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN
AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDU-
CATION ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill similar to one I have introduced
in six previous Congresses, the Universal Pre-
kindergarten and Early Childhood Education
Act of 2019. My bill would establish and ex-
pand prekindergarten programs in public and
public charter schools for three- and four-year-
old children. The District of Columbia has
made considerable strides since I first intro-
duced this bill, but today’s bill is still needed
for the nation to fill a gap in the ‘‘Every Stu-
dent Succeeds Act,’’ which addresses elemen-
tary and secondary education, but ignores the
prekindergarten years, the most critical years
for children’s brain development.
My bill seeks a breakthrough in public edu-
cation by providing funding for states to add
prekindergarten for children at three and four
years of age, like kindergarten programs for
five-year-olds now routinely available in public
schools. This bill would eliminate major short-
comings of unevenly available ‘‘day care’’ and,
importantly, would take advantage of the safe
facilities required in public schools. Unless
early education becomes a necessary part of
a child’s education, it almost surely will con-
tinue to be unavailable to the majority of fami-
lies with children.
My bill provides federal funds to states,
which must be matched by at least 20 percent
of a state’s own funds; to establish or expand
universal, voluntary prekindergarten in public
and public charter schools for three- and four-
year-olds, regardless of income. The classes,
which would be full-day and run throughout
the entire school year, must be taught by
teachers who possess equivalent or similar
qualifications to those teaching other grades in
the school. The funds would supplement, not
supplant, other federal funds for early child-
hood education. The unique money-saving as-
pect of my bill is that it uses the existing pub-
lic-school infrastructure and trained teachers
to make early childhood education available to
all, saving billions of dollars for its implementa-
tion.
The success of Head Start and other pre-
kindergarten programs, combined with new
scientific evidence concerning the importance
of brain development in early childhood, vir-
tually mandate the expansion of early child-
hood education to all children today. Early
learning programs have been available only to
the affluent, who can afford them, and to
some low-income families in programs such
as Head Start, which would be unaffected by
my bill. My bill provides a practical way to uni-
versal, public preschool education for the ma-
jority of families. The goal of the bill is to af-
ford the benefits of early childhood education

to the American working poor, lower-middle-
class and middle-class families, most of whom
have been left out of this essential education
for their children.
We cannot afford to allow the most fertile
years for childhood development to pass
unenriched. My bill responds both to the great
needs of parents who seek early childhood
education, as well as to today’s brain science,
which shows that a child’s brain development
begins much earlier than had been previously
understood.
Considering the staggering cost of day care,
the inaccessibility of early childhood education
and the opportunity that early education offers
to improve a child’s chances of success,
schooling for three- and four-year-olds is over-
due. The absence of viable options for work-
ing families demands our immediate attention.
My bill reflects what jurisdictions throughout
the nation increasingly are trying to accom-
plish. The District of Columbia, for example,
has achieved an extensive integration of early
childhood education as part of a larger effort
to improve D.C. public schools. A recent re-
port highlighted the economic benefits of early
childhood education, emphasizing its role in
expanding job opportunities and decreasing
the amount of money spent on programs to
address teen pregnancy and crime.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.

CELEBRATING THE 45TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE TORPEDO FAC-
TORY ART CENTER
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
ask the House of Representatives to join me
in celebrating the 45th anniversary of the Tor-
pedo Factory Art Center in Alexandria, Vir-
ginia. The arts are very important to the Eighth
District of Virginia, and play a crucial role in
our economic growth, community develop-
ment, and educational opportunities.
The U.S. Naval Torpedo Station in Alexan-
dria opened a century ago and has served
many unique roles in its lifetime. During World
War II it was used as a munitions plant before
being turned into a storage facility. In 1969,
the City of Alexandria bought the building for
use by its residents.
The President of The Art League of Alexan-
dria, Marian Van Landingham, proposed con-
verting the space into art studios in 1974.
Today, 45 years later, the Torpedo Factory Art
Center continues to be a thriving creative
community in the City of Alexandria. The cen-
ter hosts over 500,000 visitors every year and
is the nation’s largest collection of working-art-
ists’ open studios under one roof. It is a sig-
nificant part of the City of Alexandria’s history
and, I hope, its future.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons I ask
the House of Representatives to join me in
congratulating the Torpedo Factory Art Center
on reaching this milestone anniversary, and in
thanking all those who have contributed their
time and talent to the Torpedo Factory Art
Center.
RECOGNIZING BEVERLY LEE OF
LOS ANGELES
HON. NORMA J. TORRES
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the accomplishments of
Beverly Lee in 40 years of service to the Los
Angeles Communications Center, or LACC.
A Public Safety Operator at LACC is re-
sponsible for answering any and all 911, pub-
lic information, and allied agency calls in the
88 cities within Los Angeles County. LACC is
the largest dispatch center in the state and
Los Angeles County and answers an average
of 7,000 calls a day, and over 10,000 calls a
day during holidays, special events, or catas-
trophes.
Beverly Lee’s journey at LACC began on
July 23, 1979. Her younger brother was a dis-
patcher at LACC, and he encouraged Beverly
to apply and test for a position. Beverly
worked hard during her training and passed
probation; the rest is history.
Beverly’s career is historic in many ways.
She was part of the last training class to docu-
ment critical information on cards and the first
to learn the computer-aided dispatch system.
Throughout her 40-year career, she has han-
dled innumerable high-priority emergency calls
proficiently and calmly, being the voice of help
in many hopeless moments. She was an inte-
gral part of rendering safety, service, and se-
curity to the public during the 1984 Olympics,
1991 LA Riots, 1994 Northridge Earthquake,
2000 Democratic National Convention, Y2K
computer changeover, numerous LA Lakers
Championships, the LA Kings 1st Champion-
ship, and many other notable emergencies.
She has spent an untold number of holidays
away from family and friends to assist others
that need her help.
Beverly has an excellent work ethic and dis-
plays it daily. She physically, mentally, and
emotionally exceeds her job expectations and
does it with a smile. She is a strong and dedi-
cated supporter of LACC’s training program,
and her guidance has led to many
supervisorial and managerial promotions. She
has donated food, clothing, and monetary gifts
to the homeless and to Hurricane Katrina Vic-
tims, and is an active member of ‘‘Team
CHP’’, supporting the Revlon Breast Cancer
Walks and CHIPS for Kids. Her infectious
laugh contributes to the morale of LACC, and
her willingness to go above and beyond is
truly an inspiration.
Beverly never imagined having a 40-year
career at LACC, but has maintained her goal
of having an excellent work ethic and a grate-
ful attitude. She says the most rewarding gift
of working at LACC has been the friendship,
loyalty and support she has experienced here.
Beverly’s health and attitude are an example
to us all.

TRIBUTE TO AGUSTIN SILVAS
‘‘GUS’’ CHAVEZ
HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in honor of Agustin Silvas ‘‘Gus’’
Chavez, who passed away surrounded by
friends and family on August 18th. He was 76
years old.
Agustin, affectionately known as Gus, was
an exemplary community leader and activist
who worked tirelessly for the Latino commu-
nity in San Diego, California. He advocated for
the importance of education as the most effec-
tive way to achieve economic success and
self-sustainability.
Born in Texas, Gus arrived in San Diego in
1963 after joining the United States Navy,
where he served as a Hospital Corpsman at
Balboa Naval Hospital. It was during Gus’s
time in the Navy that he first began to work
within the San Diego community and found his
passion for activism through education and so-
cial justice work.
After he was honorably discharged from the
Navy in 1966, Gus earned his Associate of
Arts degree from San Diego City College and
later his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science
from San Diego State University. Throughout
his education, Gus worked with several stu-
dent associations to fight for equal access to
education. His work led to the founding charter
of the Latino student group Movimiento
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA), as
well as the Brown Berrets and MAPA.
In 1969, Gus co-founded the Chicano Fed-
eration of San Diego, a group dedicated to im-
proving the lives of people in the Mexican
American community in San Diego. The Chi-
cano Federation started as a way to provide
valuable resources and services to the Latino
community. Today the organization offers child
care programs, nutrition assistance programs,
and affordable housing for families and sen-
iors across all underserved communities in
San Diego.
Gus served as the Director of the Edu-
cational Opportunity Program at San Diego
State University for 30 years. Throughout his
tenure, Gus took personal interest in students.
He constantly motivated them to reach new
heights and celebrated their accomplishments.
I loved his sense of passion and excitement at
the success of his students. I always felt a kin-
dred spirit with Gus and his enthusiasm for lift-
ing every student he worked with to their full
potential.
Gus never stopped advocating for edu-
cational equity and educational access for all,
particularly on behalf of first-generation stu-
dents from marginalized communities. He firm-
ly believed in the value of service and
mentorship, and instilled that same sense of
purpose into countless students.
I send my deepest condolences to his family
and friends. I take comfort in knowing that
Gus leaves behind a legacy of service and
empowerment.

TRIBUTE TO THE EXTRAORDINARY
LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR.
GEORGE T. FRENCH, JR.
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor Dr. George T. French,
Jr., the 14th President of Miles College, on his
twenty-three years of exemplary service to
Miles College and his recent appointment as
President of Clark Atlanta University. Under
the impressive leadership and oversight of Dr.
French as President since 2005, Miles College
has met unprecedented fundraising goals, has
more than doubled its existing campus size
through land acquisition and, most importantly,
has continued to fight for and implement the
values upon which it was founded—providing
its students with quality, first-class higher edu-
cation. A man of steadfast and unwavering
faith, Dr. French’s experience as a pastor in
the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church has
lent him strength and purpose as he has navi-
gated his impressive career.
Miles College was established over one
hundred years ago in 1898 in Fairfield, Ala-
bama. The college is a historically black col-
lege, whose mission has always been to pro-
vide top-tier higher education to the African
American community and to educate the
minds of future local, national and global lead-
ers. Miles College has deep roots in the Chris-
tian Methodist Episcopal Church, whose guid-
ing principles helped to shape the school’s
mission and curriculum. Miles College also
played a major role in Birmingham’s struggle
for civil rights. When the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference was scouting a city in
which to test methods of peaceful protest, Bir-
mingham was decided upon in large part be-
cause members of Miles College were already
engaging in activism.
A native of Louisville, KY, Dr. French joined
Miles College with a strong educational back-
ground, having earned his Bachelor of Arts in
Political Science from the University of Louis-
ville. He was then competitively accepted to
the University of Richmond Law School before
being recruited by Miles Colleges’ former
President Albert Sloan to join Miles College as
the Director of Development. Dr. French com-
pleted his final year of law school at Miles Law
School where he earned his Juris Doctor. He
received his Ph.D. in Higher Education from
Jackson State University in 2018.
As Director of Institutional Planning and De-
velopment at Miles College, Dr. French
oversaw the offices of Alumni Affairs, Federal
Contracts and Grants, Title III, Institutional Re-
search and Effectiveness, Congressional Rela-
tions and Public Relations. He was also pri-
marily responsible for fundraising, a task he
met handily. As part of the Capital Campaign
Fund Drive, Dr. French raised twelve million
dollars, making it the largest drive in the his-
tory of Miles College.
During his fourteen-year tenure as President
of Miles College, Dr. French has worked to
strengthen the college’s academic standing
and offerings. Under his direction, faculty has
secured some of the largest grants in the col-
lege’s history, and the initiative of ‘‘culture,
class and civility’’ has been put into action, in
the classroom and throughout all other initia-
tives. During his presidency, Miles College re-
ceived a federal grant to become a Center for
Academic Excellence in Intelligence. As a sen-
ior member of the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence, I am especially
proud of the work of Miles College within the
Intelligence Community. During visits from the
Director of the Office of National Intelligence
to campus presentations before two Directors
of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the stu-
dents and professors at Miles College bril-
liantly personified why diversity in the Intel-
ligence Community is so important. In addi-
tion, Miles College was rated by HBCU Digest
as one of the ‘‘Top Three Most Underrated
Historically Black Colleges and Universities.’’
Under his impressive leadership, Dr. French
has also increased Miles College’s allocation
to education and educational support services
by 11.03 percent. The school’s total operating
budget has increased significantly as a result
of Dr. French’s superior fundraising abilities
and has realized a 32.28 percent increase in
operating revenue thanks to state and federal
grants and contracts aimed at reducing stu-
dent debt. Dr. French’s administration has also
worked to progressively increase student ac-
cess to education funding through a 54.31
percent increase in awarded Pell Grants.
Dr. French has also kept an eye to the fu-
ture, acquiring the North Campus, a forty-one-
acre site whose inclusion doubles the size of
Miles College’s existing campus. He has seen
the college successfully accredited by the
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools
Commission on Colleges, an affirmation that
will stand through 2023.
In addition to his exemplary work at Miles
College, Dr. French has been a true servant
leader within the broader Birmingham commu-
nity, boasting numerous awards and accom-
plishments. In 2011, Dr. French was appointed
Treasurer of the Birmingham Civil Rights Insti-
tute, and in 2013 he was named the Bir-
mingham Spotlight ‘‘Man of the Year.’’ He cur-
rently serves on the Regions Financial Diver-
sity Advisory Council and as an officer of the
Birmingham Business Alliance Executive Com-
mittee. Dr. French was invited by former Presi-
dent Barack Obama to a meeting at the White
House and, per the recommendation of U.S.
Congressional leaders including Reps. NANCY
PELOSI, John Boehner and TERRI SEWELL, was
appointed to serve on the National Advisory
Committee on Institutional Quality and Integ-
rity, an entity which serves to advise the Sec-
retary of Education. Dr. French was also ap-
pointed by the U.S. Congress to serve on the
U.S. Department of Education Negotiated
Rulemaking Committee, which was estab-
lished ahead of proposed regulations for the
Federal Student Aid programs authorized
under title IV of the Higher Education Act of
1965.
On a personal note, I have had the great
honor of knowing and working with Dr. French
for over a decade. He has been an exemplary
President of Miles College, an outstanding
mentor and a dear friend. I know that Miles
College stands tall today as one of the ‘‘Crown
Jewels of Alabama’s 7th Congressional Dis-
trict’’ because of Dr. French’s visionary leader-
ship, fundraising prowess and inspiring and in-
fectious charisma. Thank you for your twenty-
three years of supreme service to Miles Col-
lege and congratulations to you for the out-
standing legacy that you will leave here. I am
forever grateful for our friendship and for the
amazing partnership that my congressional of-
fice has enjoyed with Miles College. From
growing the college financially and literally to
all of the outstanding academic programs and
athletic events, you will leave this institution a
stronger and better place. For that I say, ‘‘Well
done,’’ my friend. I know that your brilliance,
love of learning, faith and determination has
and will continue to serve you well in your new
endeavor as the incoming President of Clark
Atlanta University.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me, the Miles College family, the Birmingham
community and the State of Alabama, in pay-

August 27, 2019
Born in Honduras, Mr. Portillo dedicated his
life to defending and advising Central Amer-
ican immigrants. He founded the Francisco
Morazan Honduran Organization in 1996. The
organization advocates to improving conditions
for Central American immigrants and extend-
ing Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for
Central Americans, Venezuelans, and Haitians
living in the United States. Until his death, Mr.
Portillo served as president of this organiza-
tion and the Coalición de Organizaciones
Latinas Unidas por una Reforma Migratoria.
Mr. Portillo received multiple awards for his
work, including the 2018 Pride Hispanic Prize.
His dedication to public service and immigra-
tion reform changed our South Florida com-
munity for the better. We will remember him
with love and honor him by continuing his
work for immigrant rights.
RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF SAWYER INTER-
NATIONAL AIRPORT
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 27, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize Sawyer International Air-
port upon the occasion of its 20th Anniversary.
Through its outstanding service and commit-
ment to excellence, Sawyer has become an
indispensable part of Michigan’s First District.
With the expansion of the U.S. Air Force fol-
lowing World War II, a small airstrip near Mar-
quette, Michigan, was chosen as the site for a
new base. After signing a 99-year lease on
the land, the K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base offi-
cially opened on May 8, 1959. For nearly 40
years, the base hosted thousands of airmen
until its eventual closure in September 1995.
In its place opened Sawyer International Air-
port, a public-use airport owned and operated
by the County of Marquette. Its first incoming
commercial flight landed on September 22,
1999.
Since that first flight, more than two million
commercial airline passengers have been
served by Sawyer, with more than a hundred
thousand flyers going through the airport each
year. Sawyer has also constantly worked to
improve and expand over the last two dec-
ades—shaping the airport into the first-rate op-
tion for businesses and travelers that it is
today. In addition to its passenger air service,
Sawyer’s campus is home to over five dozen
businesses with more than 1,200 employees.
It should be no surprise that Sawyer was
named the 2019 Airport of the Year by the
Michigan Department of Transportation, while
Airport Manager Duane DuRay was named
Airport Manager of the Year. Day after day,
Sawyer International Airport demonstrates its
commitment to connecting those in the U.P.
with the rest of the world, while allowing those
from around the globe to visit and experience
the best that Michigan has to offer.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Sawyer International Airport for 20 years
of success and service. Michiganders can take
immense pride in knowing that the First Dis-
trict is home to such an outstanding institution.
On behalf of my constituents, I wish Sawyer
all the best in its future endeavors.
