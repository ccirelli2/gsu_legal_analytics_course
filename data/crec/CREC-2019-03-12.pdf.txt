f
END HUNGER NOW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, in
September 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by
two major hurricanes, Irma and Maria,
both of which caused catastrophic dam-
age, displaced thousands of families,
and killed almost 3,000 American citi-
zens. Adding insult to injury, the
Trump administration organized an
embarrassingly slow and ineffective re-
sponse during Puerto Rico’s time of
need.
Last July, FEMA released a report
acknowledging many of their short-
comings in responding to Hurricane
Maria. And I am sure we all remember
images of the President tastelessly
throwing paper towels at families dur-
ing his relief visit, as if he were shoot-
ing free throws at a basketball game.
It has been a year and a half since
Hurricane Maria, and Puerto Rico has
made incredible strides to rebuild, but
many, many families are still strug-
gling. These are American citizens who
pay taxes and who work hard, just like
mainland Americans, but for some rea-
son, the Trump administration is hav-
ing a hard time empathizing.
When I think of all the ways the
Trump administration has attacked
low-income and working families, I
can’t say I am surprised.
Last week, The Washington Post re-
ported that Puerto Rico was forced to
start cutting its Nutrition Assistance
Program, NAP, benefits. Puerto Rico’s
food assistance program is funded by a
capped block grant separate from
SNAP. While other Federal nutrition
programs like WIC and school meals
operate in Puerto Rico the same as in
other States and territories, Puerto
Rico remains disadvantaged because
their Nutrition Assistance Program
funds are static.
In order to receive nutrition assist-
ance in Puerto Rico, you have to have
a lower income—to receive less assist-
ance—than someone who lives on the
mainland. It also limits the program’s
flexibility to respond to changes in de-
mand. When the hurricane struck, ad-
ditional funds had to be given to NAP
to accommodate more participants.
These forced cuts will reduce Puerto
Rico’s food assistance benefits by 25
percent for 1.3 million people. That is
43 percent of Puerto Rico’s population.
While it is true that this cut will re-
store the overall benefit amount to
where it was before the hurricane, we
must remember that these participants
often need more assistance, given the
circumstances. It is not easy to rebuild
your entire life on an empty stomach.
Mr. Speaker, on more than one occa-
sion, House Democrats have asked for
an additional $600 million to help Puer-
to Rico through this rough patch, only
to be shut down by the President and
his misplaced, ill-informed prejudices
toward Puerto Rico. Even Leader
MCCONNELL seems to be helping the
President do his dirty work by refusing
to take up the supplemental appropria-
tions bill that we sent to the Senate
during the shutdown in January, prob-
ably because it would force them to ad-
dress relief funds for Puerto Rico.
Pulling out the rug from beneath
Puerto Rico does not solve the prob-
lem; it creates a bigger one. This won’t
disappear. That is why I urge my col-
leagues in the U.S. Senate to appro-
priate an additional $600 million for
Puerto Rico’s Nutrition Assistance
Program.
I also urge my colleagues in the
House to support these funds and speak
out on this issue. The least we can do
is empathize with our fellow Americans
who are recovering from a natural dis-
aster.
It doesn’t happen overnight. It
doesn’t take months. It takes years to
recover from the devastation that Hur-
ricane Maria caused, and Puerto Rico
has continued to fight and advocate for
disaster funds, unlike States on the
mainland.
Time is running out, and we can’t
allow these cuts to continue. This is a
moral question for all of us here in this
Chamber. This is about how are we
going to treat our fellow citizens in
Puerto Rico.
It is all on us to act. It is all on us to
end hunger now.

H2650 March 12, 2019
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, during Na-
tional Agriculture Week, to celebrate
American farmers and farm families.
This nationwide effort recognizes and
celebrates the abundance provided by
American agriculture. It also reminds
citizens that agriculture is a part of all
of us and plays a critical economic and
food security role.
Thursday is National Ag Day, which
began in 1973 as a way to increase pub-
lic awareness of agriculture’s role in
society. National Ag Day encourages
every American to understand how
food and fiber products are produced;
appreciate the role agriculture plays in
providing safe, abundant, and afford-
able products; value the essential role
of agriculture in maintaining a strong
economy; and acknowledge and con-
sider career opportunities in the agri-
culture, food, and fiber industries.
In the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania, we are fortunate to have more
than 58,000 farmers. These men and
women are the lifeline of the Common-
wealth, as agriculture is our number
one industry.
Our farmers produce a safe and abun-
dant food supply, including our dairy
farmers, who produce the milk that is
stocked in the cases of our super-
markets and in lunchrooms across
America.
My bill, the Whole Milk for Healthy
Kids Act, would further expand milk
choices in our schools. It would allow
for whole milk, both flavored and
unflavored, to be offered in school cafe-
terias.
Mr. Speaker, milk was once a staple
in the diets of our students, but con-
sumption in schools has dramatically
decreased since the Healthy, Hunger-
Free Act of 2010—which demonized
milk fat, which is where nutrition and
flavor is—was implemented.
Milk is the number one source of
nine essential nutrients in the diets of
many young Americans. We can pro-
vide the foundation for a solid, healthy
lunch in our schools that also tastes
great and students will want to drink.
When students don’t consume milk,
they are not getting nutrients such as
calcium, potassium, and vitamin D.
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the
Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, and
National Agriculture Week is the per-
fect time to sign on to this important
legislation.
Mr. Speaker, we know that farmers
feed; nutrition matters; and agri-
culture plays a critical role in modern
society. I would like to thank all
Americans who work tirelessly in the
ag sector. On behalf of a grateful Na-
tion, we thank you.
CYBERSECURITY SKILLS INTEGRATION
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of
H.R. 1592, the Cybersecurity Skills In-
tegration Act.
As co-chair of the House Career and
Technical Education Caucus, I am
proud that we continue to provide the
resources necessary to have a domi-
nant and prosperous workforce. For in-
stance, this past July, we authorized
the Carl D. Perkins Act to advance ca-
reer and technical education.
We must continue developing a 21st
century workforce to meet the tech-
nical demands our country is facing
now and into the future. That is why,
together with my friend, Congressman
JIM LANGEVIN, we have introduced a
bill to help protect our sensitive data
and critical infrastructure from bad ac-
tors.
Our legislation directs the Depart-
ment of Education to create a com-
prehensive grant program that inte-
grates cybersecurity education into
new and established postsecondary
CTE programs.
With more than 16 critical infrastruc-
ture sectors in our country, we must
prepare our next generation of learners
to have the most sophisticated and
comprehensive educational programs
to protect our Nation’s most dire as-
sets, systems, and networks.
I urge my colleagues to support this
bill, and I thank Mr. LANGEVIN for his
work and leadership on this issue.
f
EPA’S DECISION ON REDWOOD
CITY SALT PONDS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. SPEIER) for 5 minutes.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I am out-
raged, but not surprised, that the polit-
ical appointees in the EPA’s Wash-
ington, D.C., office have decided that
the Redwood City salt ponds in my dis-
trict do not include waters of the
United States under the Clean Water
Act.
This administration has completely
hijacked the jurisdictional process
away from the experts on the ground,
putting politics ahead of science. No
surprise.
Stunningly, after experts at the
EPA’s Region 9 had drafted a deter-
mination in 2016 that came to a com-
pletely opposite conclusion, the EPA
trampled on that evidence-based deter-
mination.
The administration was, no doubt,
counting on the fact that the draft
would not be released to the public.
Well, I am not willing to allow that to
happen.
Let the RECORD reflect that, after
being designated an EPA special case,
Region 9 experts conducted an exten-
sive review of the property and finally
concluded that 1,270 acres within the
Redwood City salt ponds property are,
in fact, waters of the United States for
the following reasons.
First, the tidal channels within the
property were part of the traditionally
navigable waters of the San Francisco
Bay and were not converted to ‘‘fast
land’’ or ‘‘dry solid upland’’ prior to
the enactment of the Clean Water Act.
This is because waters that have been
severed from tidal influence but are
regularly inundated are not fast lands.
Secondly, the salt ponds in their cur-
rent condition have been shown to be
navigable in the past and could be used
in interstate or foreign commerce with
reasonable improvements, such as re-
moving levees. In fact, large portions
of former salt ponds in proximity to
the site have been restored to tidal
marshes.
Third, the salt ponds are impound-
ments of water otherwise defined as
waters of the United States.
Finally, the salt ponds have signifi-
cant nexus to the traditionally navi-
gable waters of the adjacent San Fran-
cisco Bay, providing food and habitat
to certain species of microorganisms,
invertebrates, and birds.
The most recent EPA determination
directly contradicts the findings of Re-
gion 9 experts, but it is completely in
line with this administration’s record
of gutting environmental protections
in the name of corporate interests.
I realize that this administration
struggles to recognize any body of
water that is not a murky, scum-filled
swamp, but I refuse to let this 180-de-
gree political flip-flop occur without
public disclosure. Believe me, the deci-
sion by Administrator Wheeler is a
flop. That is why I am submitting this
draft determination in its entirety for
the public record.
DRAFT REDWOOD CITY SALT PONDS JD
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This document constitutes the U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) deter-
mination of the federal jurisdictional status
of the Redwood City Salt Ponds for purposes
of the Clean Water Act (CWA). This CWA ju-
risdictional determination applies to the
Redwood City Salt Ponds property (‘‘Red-
wood City Salt Ponds’’ or ‘‘the Property’’)
depicted in Figure 1. The Property is ap-
proximately 1,365 contiguous acres adjacent
to Westpoint Slough, a part of San Francisco
Bay, located near Seaport Boulevard, Red-
wood City, San Mateo County, California.
Within the boundaries of the subject area,
approximately 95 acres of the Property are
not ‘‘waters of the United States’’ where
they are above the High Tide Line on the
outer side of the perimeter levees bounding
the Property, and above the Ordinary High
Water Mark on the levee interiors. These
non-jurisdictional areas consist of levees,
building pads and other features converted
to fast land before passage of the CWA.
The remaining estimated 1,270 acres within
the subject area are ‘‘waters of the United
States’’ as defined by the CWA, because: (1)
the tidal channels within the Redwood City
Salt Ponds were part of the traditionally
navigable waters of San Francisco Bay, and
were not converted to fast land prior to en-
actment of the CWA; (2) the salt ponds in
their current condition have been shown to
be navigable in fact, and are susceptible to
use in interstate or foreign commerce with
reasonable improvements; (3) the salt ponds
are impoundments of waters otherwise de-
fined as waters of the United States; and (4)
the salt ponds have a significant nexus to
the traditionally navigable waters of the ad-
jacent San Francisco Bay.

March 12, 2019
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEG-
ACY OF THE HONORABLE RICH-
ARD DALE NICHOLS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, it is
with great sadness that I speak today
about the passing of the great Kansan
and former Member of the United
States Congress, my friend, Mr. Rich-
ard Dale Nichols.
Dick was born in southeast Kansas
and honorably served his country in
World War II as a member of the
United States Navy. Upon returning to
Kansas, he attended Kansas State Uni-
versity and was a fellow Beta Theta Pi
fraternity brother.
After graduation, Dick entered the
banking industry and, ultimately, set-
tled down in McPherson, Kansas, where
he served as president and then as
chairman of the board for Home State
Bank & Trust.
In 1990, Dick was elected to the
United States Congress, representing
the Fifth Congressional District of
Kansas. Two years later, following the
census, Dick’s district was eliminated,
and he returned to life as a business-
man, but he never gave up his passion
and love for our country.
Dick served as president of the Kan-
sas Bankers Association, was active in
the local Chamber of Commerce, and
was a fellow Rotarian. He was a proud
husband, father, and grandfather, and
his outgoing, optimistic personality
gained him new friends wherever he
traveled.
I had the opportunity to get to know
Dick and will always be grateful for
the time and energy he spent helping
me find my way to Washington, D.C.
When I was back in McPherson, I al-
ways enjoyed chatting with him about
Kansas State athletics, fellow Beta fra-
ternity brothers, and Republican poli-
tics.
Our thoughts and prayers are with
Dick’s wife, Linda, and the entire Nich-
ols family as they mourn the loss of a
great Kansan and a great man. He will
certainly be missed.
RESTORING INTEGRITY OF SUPPLEMENTAL
NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I
stand in support of Secretary Sonny
Perdue and the Department of Agri-
culture’s proposed rule to restore the
integrity of the Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program and imple-
ment the program as a safety net, not
a way of life.
In 2019, too many able-bodied men
and women remain on the sidelines of
our workforce. Recent data published
by the U.S. Federal Reserve in Feb-
ruary indicate a historically robust
economy yet sluggish labor force par-
ticipation rates, indicating a continued
reluctance by some to engage in the
workplace.
b 1015
According to data from USDA, we
have more families accepting SNAP
dollars today than we did at the height
of the financial crisis of 2008.
Despite major economic gains and to-
day’s record low unemployment; too
many States are allowing people to opt
out of work, leaving employers to
spend valuable resources searching for
men and women to fill our many va-
cant jobs.
By requiring able-bodied adults with-
out minor dependents who are seeking
SNAP benefits to work at least 20
hours a week while participating in
training or educational programs, we
are ensuring these men and women are
no longer disengaged from the labor
market, but finding a way back to the
workforce and long-term self-suffi-
ciency.
This Nation’s economy is as strong as
it has been in my professional lifetime.
We must continue to encourage indi-
viduals to become self-sufficient and
find new employment opportunities.
For too long, too many States have
bypassed the rules and allowed able-
bodied adults to neglect valuable job
training and educational opportunities.
Employers across the country have
good-paying jobs that can help individ-
uals move out of poverty and regain
their independence and integrity.
It is time we restore SNAP to its in-
tended purpose, help men and women
move back into the workforce, and
take a major step in closing the work-
force participation gap.
CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to discuss the progress made over the
past two years to close the digital di-
vide.
Access to a reliable internet connec-
tion remains a significant challenge in
rural America and across my district.
Society is becoming more and more re-
liant on broadband, whether for access
to educational resources, telemedicine,
or precision agriculture technology.
At the end of 2016, more than 26 mil-
lion Americans did not have access to
high speed internet. However, in a re-
cent draft report circulated by Chair-
man Pai, that number dropped to just
over 19 million at the end of 2017, with
many of these new connections being
in rural America. According to that re-
port, fiber was deployed to another al-
most 6 million homes by the end of
2018, which is the largest number ever
recorded.
Reducing regulatory burdens for de-
ployment has helped to incentivize in-
vestment. Our local providers are
working hard to leverage Federal pro-
grams, private dollars, and savings
from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to fur-
ther deploy broadband infrastructure
to rural communities, better con-
necting our farmers, small businesses,
and families. Companies like
Rockhouse Motion, a digital media
company in Geneseo, Kansas, or Rollin
J Boutique in Phillipsburg, Kansas,
both in my district, are able to thrive
thanks to that internet connection.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud our efforts at
the FCC, the USDA, and Congress to
make broadband access in rural Amer-
ica both affordable and reliable. I also
encourage my colleagues to continue
working to ensure that Americans have
access to an internet connection no
matter where they live.

CELEBRATING GIRL SCOUTS ON
THEIR 107TH ANNIVERSARY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN) for 5
minutes.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the
Girl Scouts of the United States as it
celebrates its 107th birthday today.
On this day in 1912, Juliette Gordon
Low founded this organization for, in
her words, the girls of Savannah and of
all America and of the world.
As you might be able to tell from the
pictures next to me, Girl Scouts holds
a very special place in my life.
Girl Scouts prepares girls to em-
power themselves, promotes compas-
sion, courage, confidence, character,
leadership, entrepreneurship, and ac-
tive citizenship.
You see, my life has been shaped, as
have many other girls and women
throughout this country, in large part
by the lessons I learned through scout-
ing. From my great-grandmother, to
my grandmother, to my mother, to
myself, Girl Scouts and the values that
they taught me and the strengths that
Girl Scouts helped me to achieve have
helped carry me through life.
For more than a century, the Girl
Scouts have taught girls to be go-get-
ters, innovators, risk-takers, and lead-
ers.
Today, with a record number of
women serving in the U.S. Congress,
there are also a record number of Girl
Scouts. Fifty-eight percent of the
women in the U.S. House of Represent-
atives are Girl Scouts and 73 percent of
female U.S. Senators are Girl Scouts.
Though there are hundreds of Girl
Scout alums in both houses of Con-
gress, there are three of us who earned
scouting’s highest honor: myself, Con-
gresswoman LAUREN UNDERWOOD, and
Senator TAMMY DUCKWORTH.
This award, the Gold Award, is given
to high schoolers after they identify an
issue in their community, investigate
it, build a team, build a plan, and im-
plement it. These 1- to 2-year take-ac-
tion projects must have sustainable
impacts on the community. They can
be petitions to add playgrounds to
local parks, recycling campaigns,
building emergency kits, and on and on
and on, but the one thing they have in
common is a sustainability require-
ment. They simply can’t be a one shot.
They must create lasting change.
Girl Scouts teaches its members to
look for the root cause of a problem,
not simply the symptoms.
The Gold Award is the highest
achievement in all of Girl Scouts.
Congress isn’t the only place as well
that Girl Scouts have gone into public

service. Three Secretaries of State,
Condoleezza Rice, Madeleine Albright,
and Hillary Clinton, were all Girl
Scouts, and virtually every single fe-
male astronaut has also been a Girl
Scout.
Today, more than 50 million women
alive have participated in Girl Scouts
growing up. I am proud to say that for
the Girl Scouts of western Oklahoma,
there are today 14,000 girls who are
members. Worldwide, Girl Scouts has
2.6 million current girl and adult mem-
bers.
Although Girl Scouts is perhaps best
known for the entrepreneurial skills it
introduces through the cookie pro-
gram, it does so much more to develop
leadership skills in girls. It teaches
them how to advocate for themselves,
for others, and it gives them a voice be-
ginning at a very young age.
Programs introduce girls to science,
technology, engineering, art, and
mathematics, or STEAM, often paths
where girls might not otherwise be en-
couraged or supported to go on their
own. Those STEAM programs intro-
duce girls to these important areas and
help them to move through challenges.
Girl Scouts can also learn about the
outdoors through going on long treks,
camping, kayaking, mountain biking,
and countless other activities, all while
learning how to minimize their impact
on the environment.
Bottom line, Girl Scouts teaches
girls the skills they need and they
might not get elsewhere about healthy
relationships, soft skills, financial lit-
eracy, nutrition and health.
All of these journeys are designed by
girls and for girls, following evidence-
based approaches that ensure they fit
girls and foster their growth.
I am honored today to rise to cele-
brate the Girl Scouts on their 107th an-
niversary as a fourth generation Girl
Scout and Gold Award recipient.
f
SOCIALISM LEADS TO HUMAN
MISERY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, a prominent American socialist pol-
itician recently proclaimed that ‘‘cap-
italism is irredeemable.’’
Mr. Speaker, capitalism, better
known as free enterprise, is based on
freedom and liberty, not government
dictate.
The claim that freedom and liberty
should give way to government control
and dictatorship is astonishing, sad,
and alien to the America that I know.
It is a betrayal of the freedom and
liberty Americans have fought and died
for, a freedom that has given America
the best gross domestic product, the
most wealth of any nation in history.
In sum, the argument that free enter-
prise is bad and irredeemable is the
height of economic hubris, economic
ignorance, and economic stupidity.
Mr. Speaker, it is one thing for an ar-
gument to be economically ignorant
and stupid, it is another thing for it to
be dangerous to human life. In that
vein, the argument that socialism is
better than free enterprise is not only
a betrayal of America’s foundational
principles of freedom and liberty; it is
also dangerous and must be dealt with
quickly and severely.
History is replete with examples of
dead or dying nations that have paid a
heavy price for succumbing to socialist
politicians who care more about per-
sonal and dictatorial power, who care
more about being the boss, than the
welfare of their own people.
For those who refuse to learn from
history, I suggest reading George Or-
well’s prophetic book ‘‘Animal Farm.’’
It explains all you need to know about
how and why socialism fails and who
rules in a Socialist society.
Venezuela’s economic and humani-
tarian catastrophe is a present-day,
glaring lesson that warns all tempted
by the siren song of socialism.
Thousands of Venezuelans are dying
from malnutrition, disease, and lack of
food and medicine. The result: deadly
riots.
In 2018 alone, a staggering 7,523 civil-
ians were murdered due to clashes with
military and state police forces.
Mothers are forced to choose which
child to feed and which child goes hun-
gry.
In 2017, the average Venezuelan lost
24 pounds because they could not get
the calories necessary to maintain
their body weight. Today, there are
Venezuelans searching for food in trash
cans who are fortunate if they can eat
once a day.
As Venezuelans lose hope, suicide
rates have skyrocketed to almost twice
the global suicide rate.
Venezuela’s socialist economy has
collapsed. 2018’s inflation rate soared
to 80,000 percent. Nearly 90 percent of
the population is living below the pov-
erty line.
Even electricity is unreliable, as Ca-
racas suffers from sporadic total power
failures, casting Venezuela’s capital
city into darkness.
Worse yet, Venezuela’s socialism pro-
motes crime and lawlessness by des-
perate citizens. According to a 2018 re-
port by the World Economic Forum,
Venezuela is the second most dan-
gerous country in the world, with Cara-
cas coming in as the second most dan-
gerous city overall with 111 homicides
per 100,000 residents.
Venezuela’s suffering even extends
beyond its borders, as thousands of ref-
ugees flee to neighboring countries
that cannot take care of them.
Venezuela is a man-made catastrophe
brought about by tyrannical dictators
and self-proclaimed bosses that are al-
ways the result of socialist policies.
Mr. Speaker, America must learn
from Venezuela, a country that suc-
cumbed to evil socialist sales pitches
even though history proves socialism
has failed every single time.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues
and America to reject socialism lest
America go down the same path of fi-
nancial self-destruction as Venezuela.
Finally, Mr. Speaker, I urge America
to reject self-proclaimed dictators and
bosses who seek to deprive America of
our hard-fought and hard-won freedom
and liberty.

THE PRESIDENT IS UNFIT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise. I do so today because I
love my country and I believe in what
it stands for.
Because I love it and believe in what
it stands for, I believe that my country
is worth liberty and justice for all. I
believe it is worth government of the
people, by the people, for the people. I
believe that it is worth the belief that
all persons are created equal and en-
dowed by their creator with certain in-
alienable rights, among them, life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Our country is worth it. And because
our country is worth making real these
great and noble American ideals, I do
not believe that an unfit President
should be allowed to stay in office.
If we acknowledge that the President
is unfit, if we say that he is causing
harm to society, then we have to honor
Article II, section 4 of the Constitution
of the United States of America, which
calls for the impeachment of an unfit
President who is causing harm to soci-
ety.
This is where I stood some many,
many weeks ago, this is where I stand
now, and I stand here because I love
my country.

CONGRATULATING TOM DORSETT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I rise to salute Mr. Tom
Dorsett of Yadkin County in North
Carolina’s Fifth District. Mr. Dorsett
is about to retire from his very suc-
cessful business, Dorsett Technologies,
which, since 1977, he has grown into the
innovative and thriving business it is
today.
Mr. Dorsett, his wife, Jo, and their
excellent employees have built the
business from a small heating and air-
conditioning supply and service busi-
ness to one of the most innovative
businesses in the area. Today, the com-
pany specializes in automation for
buildings and municipal water and
wastewater systems.
Municipalities across the country use
Dorsett Technologies’ InfoScan soft-
ware to control systems for energy, se-
curity, and water. The company has
even supplied the U.S. Army, Air
Force, and NASA with its cutting-edge
technology.

March 12, 2019
Along the way, the company and the
Dorsetts personally have been out-
standing philanthropists for virtually
every good cause and nonprofit in
Yadkin County. Their support ranges
from the Yadkin County Arts Council
to the Yadkin County Rotary Club, the
United Methodist Church, United Way,
Chamber of Commerce, Yadkin Chris-
tian Ministries, and the Yadkin County
Community Foundation.
Mr. Dorsett is a visionary. Under-
standing the need to develop young
people for the jobs of the future, Mr.
Dorsett has led the effort to promote
robotics education in the school sys-
tem, giving and raising money for the
program, which has become one of the
most popular in the area. The Dorsetts
were also lead gift givers for the
Yadkin Arts Council, which renovated
an area of the downtown into a very
successful arts center a few years ago.
He is a renaissance man, but he and his
family seek no recognition for the posi-
tive things that they do; although, rec-
ognition is much deserved.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Dorsetts for
being such positive role models and for
their generous support of the
Yadkinville community. We wish them
well in their retirement.

PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT AWARD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, today, I
rise to recognize and congratulate one
of the distinguished finalists for the
Prudential Spirit of Community
Awards, Millard South High School
senior, Carly Renken, from Gretna, Ne-
braska.
Carly is a cofounder of the nonprofit
Special Musicians, which conducts
music sessions for over 40 kids with
special needs in the Omaha metro area.
The organization is designed to provide
an inclusive, safe, and fun learning en-
vironment; teaches basic music theory;
features instrument playing, singing,
and dancing; and culminates with a
performance in front of friends and
family members.
In 1995, Prudential Financial
partnered with the National Associa-
tion of Secondary School Principals to
create a program that focused on the
importance of community service and
volunteer work to inspire other Ameri-
cans to help those in need. More than
29,000 students across the country par-
ticipated in the 24th annual Prudential
Spirit of Community Awards program.
I ask that you all join me in recog-
nizing Carly for her passion and service
and thank Prudential Financial for
taking the time to encourage our
youth in the pursuit of selfless sac-
rifice.
CONGRATULATING TREY MYTTY
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, today, I
rise to support a constituent of mine
who was recognized this past January
as the 2019 Dealer of the Year by the
American Truck Dealers.
Trey Mytty is the President and CEO
of Truck Center Companies, which is
headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, lo-
cated in my congressional district.
Truck Center Companies has eight
dealerships, including parts and service
facilities in Nebraska, Kansas, and
Iowa, representing seven trucking fran-
chises. Of the nearly 575 employees, al-
most 25 percent of his staff are mili-
tary veterans or active in the Reserves
or National Guard.
In 1990, while in high school, Mr.
Mytty began his career with Truck
Center Companies, then known as
Omaha Truck Center. He started out
by washing trucks and ensuring the
workplace was clean. After earning his
degree from the University of Ne-
braska-Lincoln and working his way
through the ranks, Trey became the
dealer principal and the owner of
Truck Center Companies.
The 2019 Dealer of the Year is a na-
tional award recognizing a commercial
truck dealer who exhibits exceptional
performance in their dealerships and
performs distinguished community
service. Trey was chosen, in part, for
his support of Make-A-Wish Nebraska
by sponsoring an annual golf outing.
To date, the dealership has raised over
$2.6 million, with a goal of $3 million in
2019.
In addition, Mr. Mytty and Truck
Center Companies donate to multiple
area technical schools, and the com-
pany has developed a 16-week training
program to integrate young profes-
sionals into the truck retail industry.
Earlier this year, Mr. Mytty began a
2-year role as president of the Daimler
Trucks North America Dealer Council,
demonstrating his selfless leadership
to his fellow truck dealers.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all of the
constituents of Nebraska’s Second Dis-
trict, please join me in congratulating
Trey Mytty on being named the 2019
Truck Dealer of the Year. I wish him,
his family, and the dealership staff at
Truck Center Companies continued
success and a prosperous future.
RECOGNIZING SHERRY WRIGHT
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, in honor of
Women’s History Month, I would like
to recognize a constituent of the Sec-
ond District of Nebraska, Sherry
Wright, the first African American
woman to receive a military commis-
sion from the University of Nebraska-
Omaha’s ROTC program.
As a single mother, Sherry earned a
bachelor’s degree in social welfare and
a graduate degree in urban studies and
human resource planning from UNO,
upholding high academic standards.
In September of 1975, Sherry noticed
some ROTC members on campus and
admired their willingness to serve, pro-
tect, and honor our country. It was in
that exact moment that Sherry knew
what she wanted to do, so she joined
the Air Force ROTC that very day.
She worked as an air terminal oper-
ations officer and a squadron transpor-
tation officer, monitoring and direct-
ing airfield operations, security, and
ground transportation. After serving in
the Air Force, Sherry worked for 30
years in the United States Post Office,
totaling 35 years of government serv-
ice.
Now retired, Sherry’s selflessness and
consideration for children has moti-
vated her to create programs that edu-
cate and empower today’s youth. She
has also taken children on educational
field trips. At her own expense, she
flew children to Disney World so that
they could experience an airplane ride
for the first time and know that there
is a world outside of their neighbor-
hood.
She founded and organized the In-
crease the Peace campaign, an organi-
zation to challenge youth to think
about peace and what they can do to
help their communities through writ-
ing and art. She has been an active
board member of the Greater Omaha
Neighborhood Coalition, the Drew Med-
ical Health Clinic, the city of Omaha’s
Human Relations Board, and the
Omaha Housing Authority board.
Not only is Sherry a published au-
thor of the book, ‘‘Somethin’s in My
Water,’’ she is an Outstanding Service
for Women of Color Award nominee and
a recipient of the Navy of the State of
Nebraska and the UNO Woman of Color
Award as well. She was also made an
admiral of the Nebraska Navy by
former Governor Dave Heineman.
Mr. Speaker, Sherry continues to
lead by example and live through
Christ as she serves and cares for her
neighbor. Her willingness to serve our
country and her local community
makes her a positive role model, hum-
ble individual, and empowering com-
munity activist.

HONORING MAURA DUGGAN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it
is with a heavy heart that I rise today
to honor the life and memory of an
amazing Bucks County resident, Maura
Duggan, whom we recently lost after a
courageous battle with cancer.
Maura was a longtime resident of
Newtown, in Bucks County, Pennsyl-
vania. She married her husband, Thom-
as Duggan, in 1991, and, together, they
raised three amazing children: Patrick,
Collin, and Carlie.
Maura was beloved by her family and
her friends and was known for her ad-
venturous spirit, her unwavering kind-
ness, and her ability to appreciate the
small things and to find joy in every-
day life.
Mr. Speaker, we, as a House, send our
deepest condolences to the Duggan
family. I am grateful to them for shar-
ing Maura’s life with all of us in Bucks
County.
Maura touched so many lives and
helped so many people. She is now en-
joying her eternal reward for living her
life serving others.

HONORING MARION SLACK
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker,
just under 1 year ago, I stood in this
very spot to recognize the outstanding
work of Mary’s Cupboard, a food pan-
try in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It
is with a heavy heart that I rise today
to mourn the passing of one of the
founders of Mary’s Cupboard, Marion
Slack, who passed away at the age of
96.
Marion, a longtime resident of Mid-
dletown Township in Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, lived a life of devotion
to her family, to her community, and
to her Catholic faith. Marion truly em-
bodied what it meant to live out one’s
faith each and every day.
Inspired after meeting Mother Te-
resa, she established Mary’s Cupboard
more than 40 years ago in Levittown,
an emergency food center. A parish-
ioner at Queen of the Universe Parish,
Marion was previously recognized as
Catholic Woman of the Year by the
Knights of Columbus.
Mr. Speaker, our entire community
stands by her children: Mary Ellen,
Maureen, Eileen, and Ann Marie, along
with the entire Mary’s Cupboard fam-
ily.
Marion is now enjoying her eternal
reward for a life of service, and her leg-
acy of service to Bucks County will
last for generations.
TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS ALLIANCE
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
had the pleasure of meeting with advo-
cates from the Tuberous Sclerosis Alli-
ance here in Washington, D.C., last
week. It was great speaking with them
to express my strong support for the
continuation of funding for the Tuber-
ous Sclerosis Complex Research Pro-
gram in the fiscal year 2020 Depart-
ment of Defense Appropriations Act.
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, or TSC,
is a genetic disorder that can cause
tumor growth in vital organs in the
human body. It occurs in approxi-
mately 1 in 6,000 births.
I am proud to share the story of the
Miller family, constituents of mine
from Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
Nearly 5 years ago, Lindsey and her
husband, Dave, welcomed their daugh-
ter, Ellie, into the world. While Ellie
was born with TSC, she has not let it
stop her from being just like every
other kid. She is developmentally on
track, she enjoys preschool with her
friends, and she sees her doctors regu-
larly at the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia.
However, there is no way to cur-
rently gauge how TSC will affect Ellie
in the years to come. That is why fund-
ing for the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
Research Program is so vitally impor-
tant.
This program has my full support,
and I encourage all of my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to support it as
well. I thank my colleagues, Mr.
MULLIN from Oklahoma and Mr.
LOEBSACK from Iowa, for their leader-
ship on this issue.
Again, I ask all of my colleagues to
join me in this very worthy cause on
behalf of all dealing with this across
our Nation.

PRAYER
Rabbi Claudio J. Kogan, University
of Texas Rio Grande Valley School of
Medicine, Edinburg, Texas, offered the
following prayer:
God, source of all living things, we
ask Your blessings upon these rep-
resentatives of the people who have de-
voted their lives to our welfare.
Strengthen them with Your courage;
inspire them as they answer the Proph-
et Isaiah’s call to feed the hungry and
to clothe the naked, to lift up those in
this land and in all lands who cannot
stand on their own.
Bless them with the capacity to hear
and to listen. May this body, which
hosts rigorous and robust debate, em-
brace diversity without division, unity
without uniformity. May this House
promote justice, moral clarity, ethical
living, righteousness, and acts of kind-
ness.
As an immigrant who came to this
country 20 years ago and became an

the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GON-

There was no objection.
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor my good
friend, Rabbi Claudio J. Kogan.
Rabbi Kogan has devoted his life to
being a spiritual leader in the Jewish
faith and a leader in our community.
Rabbi Kogan is currently the director
of the University of Texas Rio Grande
Valley School of Medicine’s new Insti-
tute for Bioethics and Social Justice.
Since June 2018, Rabbi Kogan has led
the School of Medicine’s efforts on eth-
ical and social issues that affect south
Texas and the Nation.
Rabbi Kogan is a physician and an
ordained rabbi. He earned his medical
degree from the University of Buenos
Aires School of Medicine and a mas-
ter’s of bioethics from the University
of Pennsylvania.
Rabbi Kogan has also spent time as a
member of the Institutional Review
Board at the Yale University School of
Medicine.
Previously, he served as rabbi at
Temple Emanuel in my district in
McAllen, Texas, and continues to serve
as a chaplain for various law enforce-
ment agencies and hospital systems in
the area.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to
have Rabbi Kogan and his family join
us here today in the people’s House.

MAKE FULL EQUALITY A REALITY
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend

Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker,
no American should face legal dis-
crimination because of who they are or
who they love.
As a Nation, we have made stunning
progress toward realizing this dream of
full equality and acceptance for our
LGBTQ family, friends, and neighbors.
But despite our success, including re-
pealing Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell and
achieving marriage equality as the law
of the land, there is more work to do.
In many States across this country,
LGBTQ individuals remain vulnerable
to discrimination, with little recourse.
Unlike other groups protected by civil
rights laws, LGBTQ Americans can be
fired from their jobs, evicted from
their apartments, or refused service at

The current patchwork of State laws
is not enough.
That is why I am proud to join with
my colleagues to again introduce the
Equality Act to ensure protections al-
ready extended to other protected
classes are equally available to LGBTQ
Americans.
It is time we prohibit discrimination
on the basis of sexual orientation and
gender identity in education, employ-
ment, housing, credit, Federal jury
service, public accommodations, and
the use of Federal funds.
Let’s make full equality a reality for
all of us.

CONGRATULATING CRANE
SYSTEMS
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, in honor of National
Vending Day, it is appropriate to cele-
brate the millions of Americans who
get beverages, snacks, and unlimited
items from vending machines.
Crane Merchandising Systems of
Williston, South Carolina, managed by
Rich Tucker, is a leading full-service
vending solutions provider and employs
over 700 associates. Crane is one of the
largest employers of the Barnwell
County region, and I am grateful for
their success creating jobs.
The automatic merchandising indus-
try in America promotes an economic
impact of nearly $25 billion with 150,000
employees. Not only does the industry
meet the needs of consumers around
the world, it also contributes $7.21 bil-
lion in wages to the economy and pays
$3.5 billion in taxes.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
f
ROBOCALL TELEMARKETING AND
SPOOFING
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
thank you for allowing me to speak
against robocall telemarketing and
spoofing.
Our constituents, whether Repub-
lican, Democratic, or independent, are
tired of being harassed by tele-
marketers and spoofers. People deserve
to have their privacy and to be left
alone. However, robocall scams are at
an all-time high.
That is why I have introduced H.R.
1575, to crack down on abusive, annoy-
ing, and illegal robocalls.
Data shows that, in 2017, the FCC re-
ported more than 4.5 million robocall
complaints, an increase of more than 1
million from the previous year. More
than 300,000 complaints were registered
in the State of New Jersey alone.
This act helps protect consumers by
ensuring that robocallers and
scammers are prosecuted to the full ex-
tent of the law. That is why I ask for
support of H.R. 1575.
f
NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise
here today in recognition of National
Agriculture Week.
Back home in Georgia’s 12th District
and across the Peach State as a whole,
agriculture is the number one industry.
This week is about recognizing farmers
and ranchers nationwide who sacrifice
their blood, sweat, and tears to secure
the safest, most abundant food supply
in the world.
I grew up on a farm, and since being
elected to Congress, I have had the dis-
tinct honor of serving on the House Ag-
riculture Committee. I could not be
prouder of what we have accomplished,
especially getting the 2018 farm bill
over the finish line.
It is without a doubt that agriculture
touches all our lives in one way or an-
other.
Many farmers in my district and
across Georgia are hurting from the re-
cent devastation caused by Hurricane
Michael. I am doing all I can to ensure
that they receive necessary and ade-
quate financial assistance ahead of the
upcoming planting season. I know my
Senate colleagues are working to get
this done as well, but the urgency of
this simply cannot be overstated.
Rural America needs us to act now.
Madam Speaker, again, I thank all
our farmers who work hard every day
to feed and clothe this great Nation
and the world.
f
AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE IS A
RIGHT
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
today, I rise to tell the story of three
very special young men from my dis-
trict.
Edward Roman and his twin brother,
Edwin, were diagnosed with a heart
condition that has put them through
multiple surgeries. Both worked at the
Village Trattoria restaurant in Sum-
mit, New Jersey, where they met
Quinn Butler, a senior at Summit
High.
When Quinn learned of what they
were going through, he set up a
GoFundMe site that raised $119,000 in 2
weeks.
It is a story of good people coming
together to say they will not let a
neighbor down, but it is also a story of
how our healthcare system lets us all
down.
A community should not have to
raise $100,000 to keep someone from
going into debt due to a medical condi-
tion. Two young men worried about
staying alive should not have to worry
about negotiating with hospitals and
insurance companies to stay solvent.
Every American deserves the secu-
rity of knowing that affordable
healthcare is a right that will follow us
wherever we go, wherever we live and
work, whatever misfortune may befall
us.
Madam Speaker, our friends and
neighbors will always do what they
can. Now it is up to the Congress to do
what we must.
f
CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to high-
light a fatal disorder that has been im-
pacting deer populations in 24 States,
including Pennsylvania, chronic wast-
ing disease.
Chronic wasting disease is progres-
sive and always fatal. Deer, elk, mules,
and moose are impacted by this dis-
ease. First, they have difficulty mov-
ing, and the most obvious and con-
sistent sign is significant weight loss
over time.
Madam Speaker, I made an amend-
ment to the 2018 farm bill that gives
priority status to chronic wasting dis-
ease under the research portion of the
bill, and I will be introducing legisla-
tion to help identify and address the
root causes of chronic wasting disease.
This past Saturday, my colleague
and friend, Congressman JOHN JOYCE,
and I were at the East Freedom Fire
Hall with 300 hunters. At this event,
chronic wasting disease was at the
forefront.
While the science is developing, a
cure is still years away and needs con-
siderable funding to make it a reality.
It is my hope that, through research,
we can successfully cure chronic wast-
ing disease.

TRUMP BUDGET AND GATEWAY
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I won-
der if President Trump intended for his
budget to be a joke. After all, he enti-
tled it ‘‘Better America’’ but proposed
massive cuts to education programs,
the Special Olympics, Medicare, Med-
icaid, and AIDS programs.
Nothing about that will make Amer-
ica better. In fact, it will make life
worse for millions of Americans.
Trump also likes to call himself the
Builder President, but his budget in-
cludes not a single penny to fund the
country’s most critical infrastructure
project, the Gateway project.
Gateway is a nationally significant
project to replace the crumbling tun-
nels that run under the Hudson River

and connect New York and New Jersey.
It is a critical project to truly build a
better America. After all, Gateway is
the linchpin of Amtrak’s Northeast
Corridor, which supports 30 percent of
the Nation’s jobs and produces 20 per-
cent of our GDP.
The Gateway project isn’t just about
connecting New York and New Jersey.
It is about ensuring the stability of the
national economy and the free flow of
workers from North Carolina to Maine.
Trump can’t be the Builder President
if he doesn’t build anything.

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE
TO KNOW
(Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, last week, on the floor of this
Chamber, I released a transcript of the
interview of Bruce Ohr from our inves-
tigation into apparent wrongdoing at
the FBI and DOJ. At that time I said I
would make additional transcripts
from the committee’s investigation
public, and I am here today to keep
that promise.
As I stated then, our interview tran-
scripts were pertinent to a congres-
sional investigation, but the 115th Con-
gress ended, the investigation was
closed, and copies were shared with
certain Members of Congress.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD the link
www.dougcollins.house.gov/page so the
American people can review the tran-
script of Lisa Page.
The American people deserve to
know what transpired in the highest
echelons of the FBI during that tumul-
tuous time for the Bureau.
Out of an abundance of caution, the
transcript has a limited number of nar-
rowly tailored redactions, relating only
to confidential sources and methods,
nonpublic information about ongoing
investigations, and nonmaterial per-
sonal information.
I will continue to work to release as
many transcripts as possible. The
American people deserve transparency.
f
VENEZUELA
(Ms. SHALALA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, last
weekend, I traveled to the Colombia-
Venezuela border to see firsthand the
catastrophic humanitarian and public
health crisis caused by the criminal
Maduro regime.
I met with refugees at a hospital in
Colombia and heard their harrowing
stories of being on the verge of death
due to malnutrition, treatable diseases,
and a lack of medical care for high-risk
pregnancies.
People with HIV cannot access
antiretroviral drugs, as the govern-
ment supplies dwindle and the Maduro
regime continues to reject humani-
tarian aid. And now this crisis is
spreading.
I met with Colombian officials who
are doing everything they can to sup-
port 1.5 million refugees crossing the
border. They can’t do it alone. We must
increase aid to countries like Colombia
for public health.
Madam Speaker, our response to the
crisis must include supporting the Ven-
ezuelan community that has already
contributed to the richness of south
Florida and the United States. Thou-
sands of Venezuelans claiming political
asylum in this country are stuck in
limbo because of unnecessary delays in

HONORING LOUISE WILLIAMS
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker,
March is Women’s History Month, and
I am proud to honor some remarkable
women in my district this month.
Today, I would like to honor Judge
Louise Williams, who was elected in
1973 as the first female district judge in
Lancaster County. She served for 26
years, and also was the first female
Black district judge in Pennsylvania.
But she did so much more than that.
She was a member of the Lancaster
City Council for three terms, served as
council president during two of those
terms, and she was also appointed to
the State Board of Pardons, where she
became the first victims advocate,
serving 18 years there. She was in-
volved in many other community orga-
nizations, including terms as president
of the Lancaster NAACP, and of Girls,
Inc. of Lancaster County.
Ms. Williams was a trailblazer for
women in our community and always
found ways to give back to our commu-
nity and encourage others. She is one
of the most respected civic figures in
our district. It is an honor to recognize
her today.
f
FREEDOM AND EQUALITY FOR
ALL
(Ms. HILL of California asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Ms. HILL of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise in support of the Equal-
ity Act.
As the first LGBTQ woman in Con-
gress from the State of California and
the second openly bisexual woman to
serve in Congress overall, I could not
be prouder to support this landmark
legislation.
Throughout my run, I got so many
questions about why I chose to be hon-
est about my sexuality. I am married
to a man, I am from a purple, histori-
cally Republican, district, and every-
one said it would be easier for me to
hide who I am. But the reality is that
representation matters, especially for
the LGBTQ community, when so many
of our basic rights are still at risk.
Through my work on the issue of
homelessness, I have seen how dis-
proportionately our community is af-
fected by discrimination still. The
Equality Act will provide basic protec-
tions in terms of employment, housing,
education, and more. Everyone should
have a fair chance to earn a living and
provide a home for their families with-
out fear of harassment or discrimina-
tion.
I could not be prouder to be part of a
new generation of leaders who will be
the ones to finally pass the Equality
Act and fight for true freedom and
equality for all.
f
AMERICA’S WORKFORCE
(Mr. PENCE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, as we
work to strengthen America’s roads,
bridges, and highways, it is important
that our workforce keeps pace with our
infrastructure improvements.
Seventy percent of the Nation’s
freight is carried by commercial
trucks, yet, as our economy strength-
ens, motor carriers are having dif-
ficulty finding the drivers they need to
handle the growing capacity.
While most States, including Indi-
ana, allow drivers to obtain a commer-
cial driver’s license at 18, they are pro-
hibited from driving in interstate com-
merce until they are 21 by Federal law.
To address this issue, I cosponsored
legislation to alleviate the shortage of
commercial drivers back home, helping
our farmers, manufacturers, retailers,
and small businesses to keep Hoosiers
working, eating, building, selling, and
growing.
The DRIVE-Safe Act will help Indi-
ana’s freight continue to move, while
preserving the safety of our highway
system.
Madam Speaker, I look forward to
working with my colleagues on the
Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee to help fill these des-
perately needed jobs and provide young
Hoosiers with the opportunity to enter
the industry.
f
PRESIDENT’S BUDGET
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I
rise to highlight the budget proposed
by the President of the United States.
A budget is a statement of our values
as a Nation—a moral document—what
we prioritize and what we hope to ac-
complish. The President released his
budget proposal yesterday and, while I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2657

cannot say I am surprised, President
Trump’s budget, once again, shows his
disregard for the values of the health
and well-being of families across Amer-
ica.
Just 3 months after signing the farm
bill, President Trump proposes a 14.8
percent cut to USDA’s—agriculture’s—
annual budget. This would hinder the
Department’s ability to implement the
bipartisan farm bill Congress just
passed overwhelmingly.
With sharp cuts to the Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education
Program and elimination of the Value
Added Producer Grants, these cuts will
hurt farmers in the Virgin Islands, as
well as other places in our country.
Far from building a stronger Nation,
the President’s budget would devastate
the pillars of economic security for
farmers, seniors, and families across
America. I wholeheartedly reject this
destructive budget request.
f
FREEDOM AND EQUALITY FOR
ALL
(Ms. WEXTON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, early
this year, I made the decision to hang
the transgender flag in front of my of-
fice. It was meant to be a small and
simple gesture of solidarity.
Overnight, my office was flooded
with messages of gratitude. The flag
outside of my office had gone viral.
Folks from all over called, emailed,
wrote, and DM’d my office to thank me
for doing it.
But today, we all have an historic op-
portunity to support substantive legis-
lation that will be transformative for
millions of Americans.
The Equality Act is a bipartisan bill
that will provide comprehensive, Fed-
eral nondiscrimination protections for
LGBTQ individuals in employment,
housing, credit, education, and much
more, because today our LGBTQ broth-
ers and sisters can marry the person
they love on Sunday and, for that rea-
son alone, be evicted from their hous-
ing or fired from their jobs on Monday.
That isn’t right, but the Equality Act
can fix it.
To my colleagues, let’s extend the
full promise of this Nation to every
LGBTQ American. Let’s pass the
Equality Act.
f
GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in celebration of the Girl
Scouts of the United States.
On this day in 1912, the Girl Scouts of
America was officially launched in Sa-
vannah, Georgia, with a meeting of
just 18 girls. Now, 107 years later, the
Girl Scouts have engaged and inspired
generations of young women and em-
powered millions to serve their com-
munities.
More than 50 million women are
alumni of the Girl Scouts: 58 percent of
the women who serve in Congress were
Girl Scouts, and 72 percent of the
women who serve in the Senate were
Girl Scouts as young women.
My daughters and I have been lucky
enough to be a small part of this rich
history, and, for the past 5 years, I
have served as a Girl Scout leader for
my daughter’s troop. Two-and-a-half
million girls and adults nationwide
participate in this tremendous pro-
gram.
In my time as a Girl Scout leader, I
have gotten to know so many bright
and talented young women, to learn
from them and with them, and to use
the tools and lessons of the Girl Scouts
to instill within these future leaders a
fundamental belief in the power of
service, the value of character, and the
importance in our community.
As storied as this organization’s past
is, it will always be focused on the fu-
ture. That is the purpose of Girl
Scouts.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO
IRAN—MESSAGE FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–20)
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message
from the President of the United
States; which was read and, together
with the accompanying papers, referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
and ordered to be printed:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Iran
that was declared on March 15, 1995, is
to continue in effect beyond March 15,
2019.
The actions and policies of the Gov-
ernment of Iran continue to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to
the national security, foreign policy,
and economy of the United States.
For this reason, I have determined
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared with respect
to Iran and to maintain in force com-
prehensive sanctions against Iran to
respond to this threat.

CALLING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY
AND JUSTICE FOR THE ASSAS-
SINATION OF BORIS NEMTSOV
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and agree to the
resolution (H. Res. 156) calling for ac-
countability and justice for the assas-
sination of Boris Nemtsov, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 156
Whereas Boris Nemtsov was a Russian
statesman who, over 25 years of public serv-
ice, served as a Member of Parliament, Gov-
ernor of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, and
First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia;
Whereas throughout his life, Boris
Nemtsov showed an unwavering commitment
to the ideals of democracy, freedom, and the
rule of law, and to upholding the rights and
dignity of Russian citizens;
Whereas Boris Nemtsov was a powerful
voice in opposition to the authoritarianism
and corruption of Vladimir Putin’s govern-
ment, publicizing its abuses, leading street
protests against election fraud and the war
on Ukraine, and successfully advocating for
international sanctions on human rights vio-
lators;
Whereas Boris Nemtsov was co-chairman
of a leading opposition party, won election
to the Yaroslavl Regional Duma in 2013, and
was planning to run for the Russian Par-
liament in 2016 and challenge Vladimir Putin
for the Presidency in 2018;

Moskvoretsky Bridge near the Kremlin in
Moscow;
Whereas, on March 7 and 8, 2015, Russian
authorities arrested five individuals, all of
them natives of the Chechen Republic, on
suspicion of carrying out the assassination,
while a sixth suspect allegedly blew himself
up during the attempted arrest;
Whereas the defendants were tried at the
Moscow District Military Court, which on
June 29, 2017, found them guilty of carrying
out the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, and
on July 13, 2017, sentenced them to different
prison terms;
Whereas at the time of the assassination,
the now-convicted gunman, Zaur Dadayev,
was serving as a Lieutenant in the Internal
Troops of the Interior Ministry of the Rus-
sian Federation and as Deputy Battalion
Commander in the ‘‘Sever’’ (‘‘North’’) Regi-
ment stationed in the Chechen Republic,
under the command of the Internal Troops
Commander, General Viktor Zolotov, and
the Kremlin-backed head of the Chechen Re-
public, Ramzan Kadyrov;
Whereas Ramzan Kadyrov has called Lieu-
tenant Zaur Dadayev a ‘‘true patriot’’ and
has publicly referred to Boris Nemtsov as an
‘‘enemy of Russia’’;

8, 2015, President Vladimir Putin awarded
Ramzan Kadyrov the Order of Honor;
Whereas according to reports published in
the RosBusinessConsulting (RBC) newspaper
on January 20, 2016, General Alexander

indicting Major Ruslan Geremeyev, Bat-
talion Commander in the ‘‘Sever’’ (‘‘North’’)
Regiment of the Internal Troops of the Min-
istry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Fed-
eration stationed in the Chechen Republic
and a close associate of Ramzan Kadyrov and
Russian State Duma Member Adam
Delimkhanov, as an organizer in the assas-
sination;
Whereas according to reports published in
Novaya Gazeta newspaper on December 9,
2016, operatives of the Federal Security Serv-
ice of the Russian Federation in the Chechen

as a witness, reporting to their superiors
that on the sole occasion they attempted to
do so, ‘‘nobody opened the door’’;
Whereas despite requests from the legal
team representing Boris Nemtsov’s family,
the Investigative Committee of the Russian
Federation and the Moscow District Military
Court have refused to question high-ranking
persons of interest, including Ramzan
Kadyrov, General Victor Zolotov, and Adam
Delimkhanov;
Whereas the Investigative Committee of
the Russian Federation has, to this day, not
issued any indictments against the orga-
nizers or masterminds of the assassination of
Boris Nemtsov, with the exception of Major
Ruslan Geremeyev’s driver, Ruslan
Mukhudinov, who is named alongside ‘‘other
unidentified persons’’;
Whereas the Investigative Committee of
the Russian Federation and the Moscow Dis-
trict Military Court have refused to classify

repeatedly disallowed questions relating to
political motives behind the assassination;
Whereas the Federal Protective Service of
the Russian Federation has refused to re-

next to the Kremlin is ‘‘not a protected ob-
ject’’;

rity and Cooperation in Europe held a public
event to discuss the need for OSCE oversight

Whereas the United States and the Russian

dent of the Parliamentary Assembly of the

Resolved, That the House of Representa-

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res.
156, as amended, a resolution calling
for accountability and justice for the
assassination of Boris Nemtsov, cur-
rently under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this resolution. I am proud to
have authored this measure with the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL),
my colleague and the ranking member
of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The
measure before us today condemns the
assassination of Boris Nemtsov.
Nemtsov was a brave advocate for de-
mocracy in Russia, calling for free
elections and an end to the massive
corruption at the Kremlin. I remember
when he visited here and I had him in
my office. We took pictures. Just the
other day, we were looking at them.
He certainly was a champion of free-
dom in Russia and, for it, met his de-
mise. The fact that he was calling for
free elections and an end to the mas-
sive corruption in the Kremlin put him
right in Vladimir Putin’s crosshairs.
Now, he joins a long list of brave
journalists, human rights activists,
and political opponents murdered by
Putin’s henchmen in their quest to si-
lence all criticism of the Kremlin and
stamp out any perceived threat to
Putin’s authoritarian regime.
When I met Boris Nemtsov here in
Washington in my office, he talked
about his vision for Russia, free from
Putin’s grip on power, with open, fair
elections, independent media, and a
strong civil society. In the words of
John McCain, Boris Nemtsov ‘‘would
not be oppressed by unjust laws or vio-
lence or by violence and fear . . . he
lived for love and justice and truth.’’
He was incredibly brave to take on
these issues in a country where opposi-
tion to Putin often amounts to a death
sentence. Just a few months after our

conversation, as I mentioned before, he
was murdered in cold blood in Moscow.
Now, it has been 4 years since his
death, but there has been no proper in-
vestigation of his assassination and the
coverup and zero accountability for
those responsible. That is certainly an
outrage.
This resolution condemns the Krem-
lin’s systematic targeting of its polit-
ical opponents and calls on the admin-
istration to impose sanctions on those
responsible for Nemtsov’s murder and
coverup.
It also requires the administration to
deliver to Congress a thorough report
on Nemtsov’s assassination. That is a
critical part of this legislation because,
sadly, the administration, in my opin-
ion, hasn’t done nearly enough to stand
up to Russia and call out Putin’s thug-
gery.
So it is up to Congress to assert
American leadership on this issue. I
strongly support this bipartisan, bi-
cameral measure, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

DEAR CHAIRMAN ENGEL: I am writing with
respect to H. Res. 156, ‘‘Calling for Account-

similar legislation, and request your support
for such a request.
Finally, I would appreciate your response

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for con-
sulting with the Foreign Affairs Committee

Nemtsov’’ for agreeing to forgo a sequential
referral request so that the resolution may

Chairman.
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in
strong support of H. Res. 156, which I
was proud to cosponsor, calling for jus-
tice in the 2015 murder of Russian op-
position leader Boris Nemtsov.
On the evening of Friday, February
27, 2015, Boris Nemtsov was shot in the
back and killed by cowards just outside
of the Kremlin in Moscow.
Mr. Nemtsov was an important figure
in Russia because he stood up to Vladi-
mir Putin and the Russian Federation
as he called for democracy in a country
dominated by oppression.
Before his assassination, Mr.
Nemtsov was planning to run for Presi-
dent in 2018 against Vladimir Putin.
One can only think of what Russia’s fu-
ture could have been today with Mr.
Nemtsov as its leader.
Since that day in February 2015, sus-
pects have been charged and sentenced
for murder, but we still don’t have all
the answers or truly know why Mr.
Nemtsov was killed. However, we do
know that there has never been any
questioning of additional suspects or
any investigation into evidence that
the convicted gunman was a member of
a Russian unit that was stationed and
backed by Chechen dictator and thug
Ramzan Kadyrov.
Furthermore, Russia continues to
put up roadblocks to outside investiga-
tors from the European Union and the
OSCE to prevent more investigations
into the sequence of events that fateful
night. Four years after his murder,
Boris Nemtsov and his family are still
without answers or the justice that
they deserve.
The House resolution uses the voice
of Congress to hold his killers and their
accomplices accountable. Specifically,
this resolution condemns the Putin re-
gime for targeting political opponents
and using the Russian Government to
cover up the murder of Mr. Nemtsov. It
also calls on the U.S. Government to
use its capabilities to identify those
who support the murderers and to im-
pose strict sanctions for their actions.
Last February, on the anniversary of
his death, we saw a fitting tribute to
Mr. Nemtsov’s calls for freedom and de-
mocracy when the street in front of the
Russian Embassy here in Washington
was renamed the Boris Nemtsov Plaza.
We can take another important step
towards justice by passing this impor-
tant resolution.
I thank my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle for bringing this up in
such a bipartisan way.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI), who is a very
new and valued member of the Foreign
Affairs Committee.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman from New York
(Mr. ENGEL), chairman of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs, and I thank
my friends on the other side for leading
on this important resolution.
When Boris Nemtsov was gunned
down 4 years ago on a bridge just a few
hundred feet from the Kremlin, we saw
once again what a dangerous place
Putin’s Russia is for anybody with the
courage to speak truth to power.
We saw again that while Russia has
fierce and formidable security agencies
that will track down anyone who dares
criticize the Kremlin anywhere in the
world, when one of those critics is
killed, somehow they can never find
the killer.
We know that whoever gave the order
to kill Boris Nemtsov, one man, Vladi-
mir Putin, is responsible for building a
state where those who champion free-
dom are always punished and those
who kill them never are.
This resolution says that we will al-
ways remember Boris Nemtsov and the
truth about what happened to him and
who is responsible.
It urges the Russian Government to
hold accountable the authors of the
crime and says that, until that hap-
pens, we will sanction them under the
Magnitsky Act.
It singles out Ramzan Kadyrov, the
brutal ruler of Chechnya, and urges the
administration to ensure that he can
no longer do business anywhere outside
Russia.
By passing this resolution, we will
make clear that you can kill a man but
not the ideas that he fought for; that a
good person who lived and died for a
good cause will be honored for all time,
while the people who killed him will go
down in history, if they are remem-
bered at all, as utterly worthless.
And we will be saying something else
very important: that the United States
is not in conflict with Russia or with
the Russian people. On the contrary,
we are in solidarity with the vast ma-
jority of Russians, who, like Boris
Nemtsov, want a country that is free of
corruption, a country where nobody is
above the law.
Our argument is only with the lead-
ers who deny them that, but those
leaders won’t be around forever. Boris
Nemtsov’s legacy will outlast them,
and so will our desire to partner with
the Russia that shares his values and
vision.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

H2660 March 12, 2019
Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to
thank Chairman ENGEL and the rank-
ing member, Mr. MCCAUL, for offering
up this important resolution which
seeks justice for Boris Nemtsov’s bru-
tal murder.
At a time when we are seeing the
Russian people protesting tighter re-
strictions on their access to the inter-
net, we should not forget the brave
leadership of Mr. Nemtsov, a man who
stood up to the oppressors in Russia
and advocated bravely for freedom. We
should honor his memory by con-
tinuing to seek justice for his assas-
sination.
It is also important to note, Madam
Speaker, the strong bipartisan showing
in this Chamber of, really, any Russian
resolution that comes up because we
are united, as the prior speaker said,
with the Russian people in fighting op-
pression, as we have for so long and we
will continue to do.
I urge all Members to support this
legislation.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, in clos-
ing, let me say, it is critical that we
speak out against strong men and dic-
tators throughout the world. We need
to demand justice for those unable to
do so themselves.
As we have mentioned, Boris
Nemtsov was brutally murdered for
bravely standing up to Putin and his
corrupt regime. The Kremlin is being
complicit in covering up the assassina-
tion and failing to conduct a proper in-
vestigation.
By passing this measure, we show
Putin, his cronies, and dictators
throughout the world that the U.S.
Congress is watching, and we will not
stay silent.
Madam Speaker, I strongly support
this resolution. I urge my colleagues to
join me, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
ENGEL) that the House suspend the
rules and agree to the resolution, H.
Res. 156, as amended.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, on that

The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-

CRIMEA ANNEXATION NON-
RECOGNITION ACT
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 596) to prohibit United States
Government recognition of Russia’s an-
nexation of Crimea, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 596
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Crimea An-
nexation Non-recognition Act’’.
SEC. 2. PROHIBITION AGAINST UNITED STATES
RECOGNITION OF THE RUSSIAN
FEDERATION’S CLAIM OF SOV-
EREIGNTY OVER CRIMEA.
(a) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy
of the United States not to recognize the
Russian Federation’s claim of sovereignty
over Crimea, its airspace, or its territorial
waters.
(b) PROHIBITION.—In accordance with sub-
section (a), no Federal department or agency
may take any action or extend any assist-
ance that implies recognition of the Russian
Federation’s claim of sovereignty over Cri-
mea, its airspace, or its territorial waters.
(c) WAIVER.—The President may waive the
prohibition in subsection (b) on a case-by-
case basis if the President determines that it
is vital to the national security interests of
the United States to do so.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 596,
the Crimea Annexation Non-recogni-
tion Act, as amended, currently under
consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I thank this bill’s
author, who is a valuable member of
the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr.
CONNOLLY from Virginia.
Madam Speaker, I also thank the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL),
our ranking member, for working with
us on this bipartisan legislation.
Madam Speaker, Vladimir Putin has
left no doubt about his intentions to
expand Russian influence, undermine
democracy, and splinter the alliances
and agreements that have long kept
Russia in check.
We have seen these through Russia’s
direct attacks on our democratic insti-
tutions, including our own—remember
the Presidential election of 2016—
through a pernicious and widespread
misinformation campaign designed to
distort reality and foment confusion
and, in no clearer way, through its ille-
gal occupation of parts of Ukraine and
parts of Georgia.
It is shocking in the 21st century to
see a country trample on a neighbor’s
sovereignty and seize territory by
force. It goes against everything we
have worked for since World War II to
build a Europe that is whole, free, and
in peace.
It has been 5 years since Russian
forces moved into Crimea and staged a
sham election in an attempt to give
their occupation a gloss of legitimacy,
but there is nothing legitimate about
it—absolutely nothing.
The United States must never accept
Putin’s attempts to seize territory by
force, and this legislation would en-
shrine into our laws a nonrecognition
of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. This
bill would prevent our government
from taking any action that even im-
plies American recognition of this bla-
tantly illegal land grab.
This bill also sends a strong message
to our Ukrainian friends that we stand
shoulder to shoulder with them as they
continue to resist Russian efforts to
fracture their country. This is espe-
cially important in light of recent
events in which the Russian Navy
intercepted Ukrainian patrol boats in
Ukrainian waters, capturing the ves-
sels and their crew by force.
Vladimir Putin is a bully and a thug.
His troops may hold Crimea in a stran-
glehold, but we need to be clear that
Crimea will always be part of Ukraine,
not part of Russia. This measure will
put that rejection permanently into
our laws. I am pleased to support it.
Madam Speaker, I ask all Members
to do likewise, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today with
the majority, also in strong support of
H.R. 596, the Crimea Annexation Non-
recognition Act. I am proud to cospon-
sor this legislation, which clearly
states that America will not recognize
Russian sovereignty over Crimea.
Ukraine continues to face significant
challenges from Russia, from their
meddling, and from their aggression. In
Congress, we know the true intentions
of Vladimir Putin when it comes to
Ukraine. Vladimir Putin and his cro-
nies in the Kremlin are tearing Europe
apart.
Russian-backed separatists continue
their shelling of Ukrainian military
positions in Eastern Ukraine, which
has killed civilians in many areas.
Additionally, Russia recently vio-
lated Ukraine sovereignty and terri-
torial integrity when it fired upon and
captured three Ukrainian vessels and
24 sailors. Russia continues to hold
these sailors on bogus charges that
they violated Russian borders, even
though the Kerch Strait is determined
to be neutral waters.
b 1245
While Russia maintains that Ukrain-
ian soldiers were threatening the con-
struction of the Crimean bridge, which
is currently under construction be-
tween the territory of Russia and Cri-
mea, we know this is fake news from
Putin and his thugs.
We need to continue to send a strong
message to the Russians that the
United States does not and will not

recognize their claim of sovereignty
over Crimea, not now and not ever.
I commend Secretary Pompeo for
making the Crimea Declaration last
July that articulated this policy of the
United States, and I believe Congress
should have a voice in this as well.
Madam Speaker, the bill is simple. It
states that the policy of the United
States Government is to never recog-
nize sovereignty over Crimea, and it
prohibits all U.S. Government agencies
from taking any action with respect to
acknowledging that Russia has any
claims over the territory.
As Vladimir Putin seeks to impose
his iron-fisted will over former Soviet
republics, we must continue to stand
with our allies to counter that aggres-
sion.
I commend the work of my friend
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and my
friend from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) for their
leadership on this issue. By reaffirming
congressional support for Ukraine’s
territorial integrity and by holding
Russia accountable for its continued
violation of Ukraine sovereignty, I be-
lieve we will continue to stand with
Ukraine legislatively and most effec-
tively from here and into the future.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), the author of
this bill and a very valued member of
the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I
thank my dear friend from New York
(Mr. ENGEL), the distinguished chair-
man of our committee, for his support.
I thank my dear friend from Illinois
(Mr. KINZINGER), the Republican man-
ager today, for his support. And I sa-
lute my friend from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT)
who has steadfastly cosponsored this
resolution in previous Congresses to
make a powerful bipartisan statement.
I rise today, Madam Speaker, in sup-
port of H.R. 596, the Crimea Annex-
ation Non-recognition Act, which we
introduced together, as I said, with Mr.
CHABOT of Ohio.
This bill states unequivocally that it
is the policy of the United States not
to recognize the Russian Federation’s
claim of sovereignty over Crimea, its
airspace, or its territorial waters. Fur-
thermore, the bill prohibits the United
States Government from taking any
action that could possibly apply rec-
ognition of Russian sovereignty over
Crimea.
Putin’s forcible and illegal annex-
ation of Crimea, the first forcible sei-
zure of territory in Europe since World
War II, undermines Ukrainian sov-
ereignty and threatens the stability of
Europe. Acquiescence on the part of
the United States would threaten the
security of all sovereign nations. Who
is next? Moldova, Georgia, the Baltic
States?
It is the longstanding policy of our
country not to recognize territorial
changes elected by force, as dictated by
the Stimson Doctrine established in
1932 by then-Secretary of State Henry
Stimson, a Republican under a Repub-
lican President, Herbert Hoover.
We upheld that doctrine with the
issuance of the Welles Declaration in
1940, which stated emphatically that
the United States would not recognize
the illegal annexation at that time of
the Baltic States by the Soviet Union.
That policy remained in effect for 50
long years. Some thought it quixotic.
For more than those 50 years, we stood
by those Baltic republics of Estonia,
Lithuania, and Latvia, sometimes in
the face of ridicule. Today, they are
independent nations and members of
the NATO alliance.
The collective wisdom of the pre-
vious and current administrations,
Congress, our European allies, and the
American public is that similar prin-
ciples must be adopted with respect to
Crimea.
Crimea was Putin’s original violation
in Ukraine, and we have limited credi-
bility objecting to Russia’s subsequent
invasion of the Luhansk and Donetsk
areas of that country. If we do not take
a stand with respect to Crimea, then
we are just quibbling over the price.
What has happened in Ukraine—Rus-
sia’s forcible and illegal annexation of
Crimea, invasion of the eastern part of
the country, and continued occupa-
tion—has precipitated an international
crisis, and the resulting conflict has
claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Russia has subjected Crimeans who
refuse Russian citizenship to discrimi-
nation in accessing education,
healthcare, and employment, and Rus-
sian authorities have attacked travel
rights and the free press. The matter of
rejecting the forcible and illegal attack
on sovereign territory is so important
that we should be satisfied with noth-
ing less than absolute clarity about our
position, which is that we support
Ukraine’s sovereignty over Crimea.
The Obama administration estab-
lished a nonrecognition policy toward
Russian sovereignty over Crimea and
levied sanctions against individuals
and entities enabling Russia’s illegal
occupation. Our allies in Europe have
stood with us, shoulder to shoulder, in
emphasizing and enforcing those sanc-
tions.
Congress codified the Obama Crimea
sanctions and has repeatedly used the
power of the purse to prohibit the use
of government funds for any action
that could possibly recognize de jure or
de facto illegal annexation of Crimea.
The fiscal year 2016 National Defense
Authorization Act included similar
language to that contained in our bill
today, in order to prohibit the use of
defense funds in a manner that could
be construed as recognition of Russian
sovereignty over Crimea. That lan-
guage has remained in the NDAA ever
since.
In the Countering America’s Adver-
saries Through Sanctions Act, Con-
gress reiterated its support for the
Stimson Doctrine and its application
to the illegal invasions by Russia and
occupations of Abkhazia and South
Ossetia in Georgia, Crimea and Eastern
Ukraine, and the Transnistria region in
Moldova.
The United States must lead the way
in refusing to recognize or legitimize
Russia’s illegal acts and its forcible an-
nexation of Crimea. That is why I am
so proud to offer this bill, along with
Mr. CHABOT, that expresses the will of
Congress as loud and as clear as we
can, and I urge my colleagues unani-
mously to support it.
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), a senior member of
the Committee on Foreign Affairs and
the primary cosponsor of this bill.
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise
in support of H.R. 596, the Crimea An-
nexation Non-recognition Act, and I
thank my good friend from Virginia,
Representative Gerry Connolly, for his
work and his leadership on this legisla-
tion and many other pieces of legisla-
tion that we have worked on in a bipar-
tisan manner in this House.
They say there is no bipartisanship
here, whether it is under Democratic or
Republican control, and we found a
way to make that happen on the For-
eign Affairs Committee over the years.
As a senior member of the House For-
eign Affairs Committee and the prin-
cipal Republican cosponsor of this leg-
islation, let me state clearly and em-
phatically that the United States—and
the world, for that matter—must never
recognize Vladimir Putin’s reckless
Crimean land grab, which is all too
reminiscent of Soviet Cold War tactics.
This bill not only definitively sets
out U.S. policy that we will not recog-
nize Putin’s bogus claims of sov-
ereignty over Crimea, but it will also
prohibit our government from taking
any actions that might imply our rec-
ognition of Russian claims.
Representative CONNOLLY and I first
introduced this legislation back in 2014,
shortly after Putin seized Crimea. De-
spite the intervening years, we must
never grow accustomed to Russian con-
trol over the peninsula. That is one
reason that makes this legislation even
more vitally necessary, because over
time, the world sometimes does grow
accustomed to things. We must never
let that happen with Putin’s grab of
Crimea.
Last May, Putin opened a bridge over
the Kerch Strait, which separates Rus-
sia from Crimea, in an attempt to bet-
ter link it, to grab it and keep it. The
bridge is too low for many large ves-
sels, which has reduced economic ac-
tivity at Ukrainian ports on the Sea of
Azov, thus further harming Ukraine.
Even more concerning, in November,
Putin’s thugs illegally seized three
Ukrainian naval vessels and their
crews at the entrance to the Kerch
Strait.
Plain and simple, Putin’s illegal an-
nexation of Crimea, as well as his ad-
ventures around the Kerch Strait and
in Eastern Ukraine, have no place in a
modern, democratic Europe. We must

not abandon Ukraine to Putin’s bul-
lying.
That is why I am pleased to cospon-
sor this legislation along with my
friend, Mr. CONNOLLY, which is but a
step toward a once-again free Crimea.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill so that we
will never recognize Russian domina-
tion over the Crimean peninsula.
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I
have no more speakers. I am prepared
to close. I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD a February 27, 2019, statement
by Secretary Pompeo on Crimea and
Ukraine.
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesperson
[For Immediate Release—February 27, 2019]
STATEMENT BY SECRETARY POMPEO
CRIMEA IS UKRAINE
Five years ago, Russia’s occupation of
Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula fueled an esca-
lation of Russian aggression. Russia at-
tempted to upend the international order,
undermined basic human freedoms, and
weakened our common security. The world
has not forgotten the cynical lies Russia em-
ployed to justify its aggression and mask its
attempted annexation of Ukrainian terri-
tory. Russia’s use of force against a peaceful
neighbor must not be tolerated by reputable
states. The United States reiterates its un-
wavering position: Crimea is Ukraine and
must be returned to Ukraine’s control.
The United States remains gravely con-
cerned by the worsening repression by Rus-
sia’s occupation regime in Crimea. During
the past five years, Russian occupation au-
thorities have engaged in an array of abuses
in a campaign to eliminate all opposition to
its control over Crimea. As part of this cam-
paign, Russia has arbitrarily detained and
wrongfully convicted individuals for peaceful
opposition to the occupation, and in some
cases has forcibly transferred these individ-
uals from occupied Crimea to Russia. The
United States calls on Russia to release all
of the Ukrainians, including members of the
Crimean Tatar community, it has impris-
oned in retaliation for their peaceful dissent.
This includes Oleh Sentsov, Oleksandr
Kolchenko, Volodymyr Balukh, Ruslan
Zeytullayev, and approximately 70 others.
We call on Russia to cease all its abuses im-
mediately, to end its occupation of Crimea,
and, in the meantime, to comply with its ob-
ligations under international law, including
the law of occupation.
In the Crimea Declaration of July 25, 2018,
the United States reaffirmed its refusal to
recognize the Kremlin’s claims of sov-
ereignty over Crimea. The United States also
condemns Russia’s illegal actions in Crimea
and its continued aggression against
Ukraine. The United States will maintain re-
spective sanctions against Russia until the
Russian government returns control of Cri-
mea to Ukraine and fully implements the
Minsk agreements. The United States reiter-
ates its unbending support for Ukraine’s sov-
ereignty and territorial integrity, within its
internationally recognized borders, including
its territorial waters.
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker,
the Secretary writes: ‘‘In the Crimea
Declaration of July 25, 2018, the United
States reaffirmed its refusal to recog-
nize the Kremlin’s claims of sov-
ereignty over Crimea. The United
States also condemns Russia’s illegal
actions in Crimea and its continued ag-
gression against Ukraine. The United
States will maintain respective sanc-
tions against Russia until the Russian
Government returns control of Crimea
to Ukraine and fully implements the
Minsk agreements. The United States
reiterates its unbending support for
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity, within its internationally
recognized borders, including its terri-
torial waters.’’
Madam Speaker, in our history, we
have always seen the impact that our
Nation has on others. When we stand
up, we help them achieve a better to-
morrow. We must continue to help
Ukraine achieve that better future for
its citizens, particularly one that is
free from Russian aggression.
Recently, we sent the USS Donald
Cook to transit through the Kerch
Strait as a show of solidarity with
Ukraine. Actions like these, and sup-
port for this bill, will further send the
message to Vladimir Putin that the
U.S. will never waver in our support for
those who seek to push back against
Russian oppression and coerced influ-
ence.
This is a great bill that shows the
unity between Republicans and Demo-
crats in this House, the legislative
body, and the administration. I urge all
Members to support this legislation,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, in closing, let me
say that we need to take a strong stand
against Vladimir Putin and his aggres-
sive behavior in Eastern Europe. This
legislation would reaffirm in American
law that Russia’s annexation of Crimea
is illegal and that the United States
will never recognize its legitimacy.
I hope the other body will act on this
measure soon after we pass it, and I
hope the administration will signal its
willingness to sign this legislation.
There are too many questions swirling
around when it comes to Russia, too
many times that we don’t seem to be
calling Vladimir Putin out for what he
has done. I think that it is something
that we really need to look at very
carefully, and I would hope the White
House would do that.
Signing this bill will not put these
concerns to rest, but it would help
show that the United States won’t just
roll over and accept Russia’s land grabs
and egregious violations of inter-
national law.
I thank the gentleman from Virginia
(Mr. CONNOLLY) for his work on this
bill, and I thank the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) for his work on the
bill. I am happy to support it, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
ENGEL) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 596, as

VLADIMIR PUTIN TRANSPARENCY
ACT
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and pass the
bill (H.R. 1404) to strengthen the
United States response to Russian in-
terference by providing transparency
on the corruption of Russian President
Vladimir Putin, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1404
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Vladimir
Putin Transparency Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) According an Intelligence Community
Assessment dated January 6, 2017, ‘‘Russian
President Vladimir Putin ordered an influ-
ence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presi-
dential election. Russia’s goals were to un-
dermine public faith in the US democratic
process . . . Moscow’s influence campaign
followed a Russian messaging strategy that
blends covert intelligence operations—such
as cyber activity—with overt efforts by Rus-
sian Government agencies, state-funded
media, third-party intermediaries, and paid
social media users or ‘trolls.’ ’’.
(2) According to the Washington Post, offi-
cial, public reports from the Russian govern-
ment put Putin’s average annual income be-
tween 2011 and 2016 at approximately $112,000.
But outside experts nevertheless have al-
leged that Putin’s true net worth is in the
billions—suggesting his extensive corruption
and connection to money laundering and
other activities undertaken order to enrich
Putin unjustly and to hide his true financial
condition from the public.
SEC. 3. ASSESSMENT EXPOSING THE CORRUP-
TION OF VLADIMIR PUTIN.
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that the United States should do
more to expose the corruption of Vladimir
Putin, whose ill-gotten wealth is perhaps the
most powerful global symbol of his dishon-
esty and his persistent efforts to undermine
the rule of law and democracy in the Russian
Federation.
(b) ASSESSMENT.—Not later than 180 days
after the date of the enactment of this Act,
the Director of National Intelligence, in co-
ordination with the Secretary of Treasury
and the Secretary of State, shall submit to
the appropriate congressional committees an
assessment, based on all sources of intel-
ligence, on the net worth and financial and
other assets of Russian President Vladimir
Putin and his family members, legitimate as
well as illegitimate, including—
(1) the estimated net worth of Vladimir
Putin and his family members;
(2) a description of their legitimately and
illegitimately obtained assets, including all
real, personal and intellectual property,

GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on the bill
under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida?
There was no objection.
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, every American has
the right to a secure democracy where
their voice matters. As Members of
Congress, our national security must
be a top priority. We must investigate
and expose Russia’s financial networks
and cut off any illegal funding that
supports criminal attacks against the
United States of America. This bipar-
tisan legislation is a crucial first step
to ensure that the rights of the Amer-
ican people matter more than dark and
corrupt Russian money.
It has been said that money talks,
but it is our job to keep it from speak-
ing over the American people. Last
week the House of Representatives
passed H.R. 1, historic reforms to get
big money out of politics. But we
haven’t done nearly enough to prevent
foreign powers and foreign money from
attacking our democracy.
Russia, the country that once had
the ability to provide a decent life for
its people, has chosen to strip their
wealth as they watch their wealth dis-
appear overseas into hidden accounts.
These corrupt oligarchs are a cau-
tionary tale on how working people can
be cheated if left unchecked. These cor-
rupt bands of individuals, led by Vladi-
mir Putin, have mounted a massive
asymmetric attack against the United
States.
America has the greatest military in
the world, but the Russians have fig-
ured out that if they have any chance
at victory, they must fight us another
way: undermine our elections, spread
fear and unrest, and sow discord
through racism and other divisive tac-
tics.
What they don’t understand, Madam
Speaker, is that we take pride in our
democracy. We may have policy dif-
ferences, and we might have policy dis-
agreements, sometimes quite strongly,
but we all know that our democratic
form of government, a government of
the people, by the people, and for the
people is our greatest strength and
weapon against any foe. We do believe
in this country that every voice mat-
ters.
Foreign nationals are banned from
contributing to U.S. elections, but
multiple Kremlin-connected Americans
have funneled millions of dollars into
political action, wielding massive in-
fluence in our democracy, and Vladi-
mir Putin is the king of this corrupt
money.
Putin’s protests are generally deliv-
ered with a smirk and accusations of
fake news, but his discomfort with re-
vealing his assets is clearly simmering
below the surface. It is telling that
after Ms. STEFANIK and I introduced
this legislation, we were both attacked
by Russian state media.
What is Putin afraid of?
Perhaps the former KGB operative is
well-aware of the poor long-term pros-
pects for gangsters and autocrats who
are unmasked before their impover-
ished countrymen, or he fears uncover-
ing his shadowy networks that prop up
dictators and human rights abusers
around the world in his quest to sub-
vert world order. Likely, he and his
cronies are desperate to obscure their
billions in an attempt to shield them-
selves from sanctions.
But, Madam Speaker, no matter the
root of his fear, our obligation is to
shine a light on his illicit networks. It
is time that we hold him accountable.
This legislation will expose the corrupt
finances being used to fund attacks
against our democracy.
Madam Speaker, in closing, I call
upon the words of our 35th President:
‘‘Let every nation know, whether it
wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay
any price, bear any burden, meet any
hardship, support any friend, oppose
any foe in order to assure the survival
and the success of liberty.’’
Madam Speaker, I urge the passage
of this legislation, and I reserve the
balance of my time.

Hon. ADAM SCHIFF,
Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee
on Intelligence, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing con-
cerning H.R. 1404, the ‘‘Vladimir Putin
Transparency Act.’’ As a result of your hav-
ing consulted with the Committee on Finan-
cial Services concerning provisions in the
bill that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction,
I agree to forgo action on the bill so that it
may proceed expeditiously to the House
floor. The Committee on Financial Services
takes this action with our mutual under-
standing that, by foregoing consideration of
H.R. 1404 at this time, we do not waive any
jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation, and that
our Committee will be appropriately con-
sulted and involved as this or similar legisla-
tion moves forward. Our Committee also re-
serves the right to seek appointment of an
appropriate number of conferees to any
House-Senate conference involving this or
similar legislation and request your support
for any such request.
Finally, I would appreciate your response
to this letter confirming this understanding
with respect to H.R. 1404 and would ask that
a copy of our exchange of letters on this
matter be included in the Congressional
Record.
Sincerely,
MAXINE WATERS,

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is to advise you
that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has
now had an opportunity to review H.R. 1404,
the ‘‘Vladimir Putin Transparency Act,’’
which falls within our shared Rule X juris-
diction. I appreciate that you have consulted
with us on this legislation. The Foreign Af-
fairs Committee has no objection to consid-
ering this bill on the House floor. To expe-
dite that consideration, the Foreign Affairs
Committee is willing to waive referral, with
the understanding that we do not thereby
waive any future jurisdictional claim over
the legislation or its subject matter.
In the event a House-Senate conference on
this or similar legislation is convened, the
Foreign Affairs Committee reserves the
right to request an appropriate number of
conferees to address any concerns with this
bill or related provisions that may arise in
conference.
Please place this letter into the Congres-

PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE, HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES,
March 8, 2019.
Hon. MAXINE WATERS,
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Hon. ELIOT ENGEL,
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS AND CHAIRMAN
ENGEL: I write in reply to your letters re-
garding H.R. 1404, the Vladimir Putin Trans-
parency Act. I appreciate your willingness to
work cooperatively on this legislation.
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill
fall within the jurisdiction of the Commit-
tees on Financial Services and Foreign Af-
fairs; and that your Committees will not
take up H.R. 1404 formally. I further agree
that your Committees’ inaction regarding
the bill will not waive any future jurisdic-
tional claims over matters addressed in H.R.
1404 which fall within your Committees’ ju-
risdiction under Rule X of the Rules of Pro-
cedure for the House of Representatives for
the 116th Congress.
At your request, I lastly will ensure that
our exchange of letters is included in the
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of the bill. Thank you again for your
cooperation regarding the legislation. I look
forward to continuing to work with both of
you as the measure moves through the legis-
lative process.
Sincerely,
ADAM B. SCHIFF,
Chairman.
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, today I rise in
strong support of H.R. 1404, the Vladi-
mir Putin Transparency Act.
According to the 2017 Intelligence
Community Assessment produced by
the CIA, NSA, the FBI, and an indict-
ment issued by the Attorney General
in 2018, it is clear that Russian actors
conspired to interfere and influence
U.S. political processes and the Presi-
dential election in 2016. This assess-
ment stated that ‘‘Russian President
Vladimir Putin ordered an influence
campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S.
Presidential election. Russia’s goals
were to undermine public faith in the
U.S. democratic process.’’
Madam Speaker, the Russian Govern-
ment has been known to employ a sys-
tem of corruption and illicit financial
ties as a tool for consolidating its do-
mestic political control and projecting
power abroad to weaken not only the
United States but other democratic
countries as well.
That is why I proudly co-sponsored
H.R. 1404. The bill would require that
within 180 days of enactment, the Di-
rector of National Intelligence, in co-
ordination with the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Secretary of State,
shall submit a congressional report on
the personal net worth and assets
owned by Russian President Vladimir
Putin.
The report would also include ac-
counts, holdings, shell companies, and
intermediaries, and identify senior
Russian political figures and oligarchs
who facilitate corrupt practices. Vladi-
mir Putin and his corrupt allies seek to
weaken democracies globally by con-
solidating political control through un-
ethical means, and they must be
brought to account for their actions.
This bipartisan legislation is an im-
portant step to ensuring the security of
our elections and upholding democracy
around the world. I urge my colleagues
to support this commonsense bill. I
also want to thank my colleague, Rep-
resentative VAL DEMINGS, for her lead-
ership on this issue. I am proud to
work across the aisle with her to pass
this important bill.
Madam Speaker, in closing, as I have
noted in my remarks, this is important
bipartisan legislation. It is about
transparency, it is about account-
ability, and it is about standing up to
the corrupt practices of Russian Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin. This is bipar-
tisan, commonsense legislation, and I
urge my colleagues to support this bill
on the floor.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, in
closing, H.R. 1404 will shine a light on
Vladimir Putin’s financial networks
that have stripped the Russian Federa-
tion of its resources and left the Rus-
sian people in poverty. It will also em-
power Congress, the intelligence com-
munity, and our allies to crack down
on cross-border corruption.
I want to thank my colleague on the
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, Representative STEFANIK, for
joining me in this important legisla-
tion.
Additionally, I want to thank the
hardworking staff on both sides of the
aisle on the Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence and the Foreign
Affairs Committee for their input on
this critical legislation.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.
DEMINGS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1404, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

KEEPING RUSSIAN ENTRAPMENTS
MINIMAL AND LIMITING INTEL-
LIGENCE NETWORKS ACT
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules
and pass the bill (H.R. 1617) to direct
the Director of National Intelligence to
submit intelligence assessments of the
intentions of the political leadership of
the Russian Federation, and for other
purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1617
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Keeping
Russian Entrapments Minimal and Limiting
Intelligence Networks Act’’ or the ‘‘KREM-
LIN Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Russia continues to engage in informa-
tion warfare and political interference in the
West, including by undermining democratic
systems and exploiting economic and ethnic
tensions within member countries of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
(2) Such activities constitute a threat to
the United States and to its allies.
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the Countering America’s Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (Public Law 115–44)
authorized the United States Government to
impose sanctions in response to actions by
countries, including Russia, that undermine
the security of the United States;
(2) the United States should sustain its
contribution to the newly deployed enhanced
forward presence of the North Atlantic Trea-
ty Organization (NATO) in Poland, Lith-
uania, Latvia, and Estonia and encourage
Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany
to continue their important leadership roles
in the military presence of NATO in those
countries;
(3) the United States has defensive inten-
tions in pursuing such sanctions and such en-
hanced military posture in Europe, and does
not seek to threaten Russian territory;
(4) the United States does not seek to be an
enemy of the Russian people;
(5) the United States desires a peaceful,
economically prosperous relationship with
Russia based on democratic principles where
freedom and the rule of law are upheld for
all; and
(6) the United States is committed to de-
fending these fundamental beliefs against
any Russian aggression.
SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT FOR INTELLIGENCE AS-
SESSMENTS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days
after the date of the enactment of this Act,
the Director of National Intelligence, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of State and
the Secretary of Defense, shall submit to the
appropriate congressional committees each
of the assessments described in subsection
(b).
(b) ASSESSMENTS DESCRIBED.—The assess-
ments described in this section are the fol-
lowing with respect to the current intentions
of the political leadership of the Russian
Federation and based on intelligence ob-
tained from all sources:
(1) Potential military action against mem-
bers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO).
(2) Potential responses to an enlarged
United States or NATO military presence in
eastern Europe or to increased United States
military support for allies and partners in
the region, such as the provision of addi-
tional lethal military equipment to Ukraine
or Georgia.
(3) Potential areas where the Government
of the Russian Federation could exploit
weaknesses and divisions among the govern-
ments of its Western adversaries.
(c) FORM.—Each assessment required under
subsection (a) may be submitted in classified
form but shall also include an unclassified
executive summary, consistent with the pro-
tection of intelligence sources and methods.
(d) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES.—In this section, the term ‘‘appropriate
congressional committees’’ means—
(1) the Permanent Select Committee on In-
telligence, the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs, and the Committee on Armed Services
of the House of Representatives; and

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members have 5 legislative days to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1617.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1617, the Keeping Russian
Entrapments Minimal and Limiting In-
telligence Networks Act, or the KREM-
LIN Act.
The intelligence community is
united in its assessment that Russia
attempted to sabotage the 2016 U.S.
election and that America is not alone
in facing these dangers and attacks. In
fact, recent reports indicate that Rus-
sia continues to engage in information
warfare and political interference in
the West that threatens the health of
democratic institutions within member
countries of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, otherwise known as
NATO.
Among many examples, the Russian
Federation is linked to cybercrimes in
Ukraine and Germany, disinformation
campaigns here in the United States,
intelligence support for pro-Russian
Bulgarian candidates, and financing for
pro-Russian parties in France.
The bipartisan KREMLIN Act which
I introduced with my friend, Congress-
man CHRIS STEWART of Utah, acknowl-
edges the active threat of foreign inter-
ference on the United States and our
NATO allies.
Specifically, this legislation would
require the Director of National Intel-
ligence to submit three intelligence as-
sessments to Congress. These assess-
ments must analyze:
First, potential military action by
Russia against members of NATO;
Second, potential responses by Rus-
sia to an enlarged U.S. or NATO pres-
ence in Eastern Europe;
Third, potential areas where the Rus-
sian Government could exploit weak-
nesses and divisions among the govern-
ments of NATO and her allies.
Most importantly, the KREMLIN Act
recognizes that Russian meddling with
our allied NATO countries constitutes
a direct threat to the United States.
By providing the appropriate con-
gressional committees with these com-
prehensive assessments, we will be bet-
ter prepared to thwart efforts in the fu-
ture that aim to weaken international
democratic institutions.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

DEAR CHAIRMAN ENGEL: I write in reply to
your letter regarding H.R. 1617, the ‘‘KREM-

work cooperatively on this legislation.
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill
fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee
on Foreign Affairs; and that the Committee
on Foreign Affairs will not take up H.R. 1617
formally. I further agree that your Commit-
tee’s inaction regarding the bill will not

Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in favor of
H.R. 1617, and I am proud to cosponsor
this bill with my friend, Mr.
KRISHNAMOORTHI.
The Keeping Russian Entrapments
Minimal and Limiting Intelligence
Networks Act, also known as the
KREMLIN Act, is a commonsense bill
that directs the intelligence commu-
nity to conduct an assessment on the
leadership of the Russian Govern-
ment’s plans and intentions, as my
friend RAJA has said, especially in re-
gards to NATO.
Madam Speaker, with some ques-
tioning Washington’s commitment to
the transatlantic alliance, this bill also
serves as a reminder to our allies of the
U.S. Congress’ commitment to NATO.
b 1315
NATO is indispensable. As a former
military officer, I know firsthand how
true that is. It is also as important
today as it has ever been. Under-
standing the threats that the Kremlin
continues to challenge to this impor-
tant alliance is of utmost importance.
In particular, the bill seeks assess-
ments in three areas:
First, any potential military action
against NATO members;
Second, potential reaction to the ex-
pansion of NATO; and,
Third, potential weaknesses and
areas of division against NATO allies.
Learning the Russian Government’s
intentions in these areas will better en-
able the United States Government to
counter any attempts to undermine
this critical alliance that we call
NATO.
I thank the Speaker, urge passage of
H.R. 1617, and reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam
Speaker, I have no further speakers
and am prepared to close.
Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker,
once again, very briefly, this is a com-
monsense piece of legislation. It is a bi-
partisan piece of legislation. Impor-
tantly, it improves our national secu-
rity. It improves the ability of our in-
telligence agencies to do the critical
work that they do.
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam
Speaker, for the health of our democ-
racy, I strongly urge my colleagues to
support this bipartisan KREMLIN Act,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
KRISHNAMOORTHI) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R.

Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of

Act. This bill would update the Federal
Records Act and the Presidential
Records Act to ensure that agencies
save records created through electronic
messages, including emails. This bill

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2667
March 12, 2019
mandating that all Federal agencies
manage and preserve their email
records electronically.
Agencies are already supposed to be
saving emails electronically. In 2012,
the Archivist and the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget
issued a directive that required agen-
cies to do so. This bill would help en-
sure that email records from Federal
agencies and the White House are all
preserved.
According to a September 2018 report
from the National Archives and
Records Administration, approxi-
mately 35 percent of agencies continue
to print and file hard copies of email
messages. This means that these
records are more likely to get lost, and
they are harder for the agency to re-
trieve during records searches under
the Freedom of Information Act.
This bill would put into statute what
agencies are already required to do
under a directive issued by the Archi-
vist and the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget in 2012. Agen-
cies are required, under the directive,
to save all permanent electronic
records electronically by the end of
2019. Putting this requirement to save
email records electronically into stat-
ute would show agencies to take this
issue seriously.
This bill would also require the Ar-
chivist to establish standards for the
preservation and management of Presi-
dential email records and to certify,
annually, that the White House has
records management controls in place
that meet those standards. The Archi-
vist would be required, under this legis-
lation, to report 1 year after the Presi-
dent leaves office on whether the con-
trols used by the President met the re-
quired standards.
This bill has been introduced and
passed by the House under multiple ad-
ministrations. This is not a partisan
bill for sure. It is a good government
bill.
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members
to support this bill, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1582, the Electronic Mes-
sage Preservation Act.
The American people, Madam Speak-
er, as you know, have the right to
know what is going on in their govern-
ment. Preservation of Federal records
is essential to that right. The Federal
Government must preserve Federal
records, regardless of the form or tech-
nology used to create those records in
order to remain accountable to the
American people.
Over the last two decades, tech-
nology has advanced. Electronic com-
munication has permeated all parts of
the Federal Government. The Elec-
tronic Message Preservation Act re-
quires the Federal Government to pre-
serve those electronic records in elec-
tronic format. It just makes sense.
For decades, many Federal agencies
have used what we call the print-to-file
method of electronic record preserva-
tion. That is right; Federal employees
were actually encouraged to print out
emails to archive the paper copies in-
stead of just archiving them electroni-
cally.
Paper-based records, as you know,
Madam Speaker, really are inefficient,
prone to record loss, and difficult to
manage. A poorly managed, paper-
based system can also increase the
costs of recordkeeping for the Federal
Government and the American tax-
payers.
The Office of Management and Budg-
et and my good friends over at the Na-
tional Archives, under the leadership of
David Ferriero, have been working to
modernize Federal recordkeeping. They
issued a joint directive that requires
agencies to preserve emails and other
electronic records in electronic format.
Under that directive, all Federal agen-
cies should be preserving electronic
records in an electronic format by the
end of this year.
This bill, Madam Speaker, just codi-
fies that requirement in a joint direc-
tive and expands the scope of the elec-
tronic message preservations to in-
clude the Presidential records, as my
colleague opposite has already noted.
The bill also requires agencies to re-
port on compliance with the electronic
record preservation requirements,
which will allow Congress to under-
stand the progress towards these goals.
Madam Speaker, I would like to
thank Chairman CUMMINGS for working
on this important issue. I encourage all
of my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
If anything, I am surprised, perhaps
shocked, that we have had to put the
matter of electronic recordkeeping
into statutory form to make sure it
has happened.
We are deep into the electronic era,
and perhaps, when you put a matter
into statutory form, it finally is a mat-
ter of law and it gets people’s atten-
tion. I certainly hope so.
Madam Speaker, I am prepared to
yield back unless the gentleman has
something more to say.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I
want to thank the gentlewoman for her
deliberative process and the way that
she has managed that. I thank her.
I think this is one of the rare mo-
ments where you have true bipartisan
support on something that is just com-
mon sense. We need to be doing that.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise in
support of the Electronic Message Preserva-
tion Act. I introduced this bill with the goal of
modernizing the Federal and Presidential
Records Acts.
This bill would require the Archivist of the
United States to issue regulations mandating
that all federal agencies manage and preserve
their email records electronically.
This bill would help ensure that email
records from federal agencies and the White
House are preserved.
According to a September 2018 report from
the National Archives and Records Administra-
tion, approximately 35 percent of agencies
continue to print and file hard copies of email
messages.
This means that these records are more
likely to get lost and that they are harder for
the agency to retrieve during records searches
under the Freedom of Information Act.
This bill would put into statute what agen-
cies are already required to do under a direc-
tive issued by the Archivist and the Director of
the Office of Management and Budget in
2012.
In 2016, the National Archives issued a doc-
ument for agency records officers titled, ‘‘Why
Agencies Need to Move Towards Electronic
Recordkeeping.’’ The National Archives identi-
fied a number of reasons including long term
cost savings, information security, and more
efficient and effective implementation of the
Freedom of Information Act.
This bill would also require the Archivist to
establish standards for the preservation and
management of email records that are presi-
dential records and to certify annually that the
White House has records management con-
trols in place that meet those standards.
Under this bill, the Archivist must report one
year after the president leaves office on
whether the controls used by the president
met the required standards.
This legislation would provide accountability
to encourage every president to have the con-
trols in place that are necessary to preserve
emails and other electronic records.
This bill has passed the House with bipar-
tisan support several times before, including
last Congress. I urge my colleagues to support
the bill again today and I hope the Senate will
act on the bill and send it to the President’s
desk before the end of the year.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from the District of
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House
suspend the rules and pass the bill,
H.R. 1582.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

SEC. 12. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS.
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the
purpose of complying with the Statutory
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of
the House Budget Committee, provided that
such statement has been submitted prior to
the vote on passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON)
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. MEADOWS) each will control 20
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia?
There was no objection.
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Federal Advisory Com-
mittee Act Amendments.
Representative LACY CLAY, my good
friend from Missouri, has introduced
this bill each Congress for a decade
now. The bill passed in each of the pre-
vious two Congresses, and it passed the
House last year without opposition.
The Federal Advisory Committee Act
was originally enacted in 1972. It is in-
tended to ensure that committees that
provide advice to Federal agencies and
the President operate with trans-
parency.
The bill we are considering today
would strengthen FACA to make Fed-
eral advisory committees more trans-
parent and to make agencies more ac-
countable in how they select members
for these committees.
Agencies often avoid the require-
ments of FACA by conducting advisory
committee business through sub-
committees. This bill makes it clear
that FACA applies to subcommittees
as well as parent committees. The bill
also clarifies that a committee set up
by a contractor is subject to FACA if it
is formed under direction of the Presi-
dent or an agency.
Under the Federal Advisory Com-
mittee Act Amendments, agencies
would be required to disclose how advi-
sory members are chosen and whether
they have financial conflicts of inter-
est. They would also be required to dis-
close if they are appointed to provide
their own expertise and who they work
for if they are representing a specific
interest.
Last Congress, this legislation was
approved without opposition by the
Committee on Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs in the Senate.
Chairman RON JOHNSON and his staff
were very helpful in pushing this bill
through the Senate.
The bill we are considering today in-
cludes changes made following negotia-
tions we engaged in during the process.
These are changes to address concerns
raised last Congress by the Department
of Health and Human Services and
technical corrections from the General
Services Administration.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS,
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Washington, DC, March 11, 2019.
Hon. ELIJAH CUMMINGS,
Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Reform,
Rayburn House Office Building, Washington,
DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN CUMMINGS: In recognition
of the desire to expedite consideration of
H.R. 1608, ‘‘Federal Advisory Committee Act
Amendments of 2019,’’ the Committee on
Ways and Means agrees to waive formal con-
sideration of the bill as to provisions that
fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the
Committee on Ways and Means.
The Committee on Ways and Means takes
this action with the mutual understanding
that we do not waive any jurisdiction over
the subject matter contained in this or simi-
lar legislation, and the Committee will be
appropriately consulted and involved as the
bill or similar legislation moves forward so
that we may address any remaining issues
within our jurisdiction. The Committee also
reserves the right to seek appointment of an
appropriate number of conferees to any
House-Senate conference involving this or
similar legislation.
Finally, I would appreciate your response
to this letter confirming this understanding,
and would ask that a copy of our exchange of
letter on this matter be included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration
of H.R. 1608.
Sincerely,
RICHARD E. NEAL,
Chairman.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM,
Washington, DC, March 12, 2019.
Hon. RICHARD E. NEAL,
Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your
letter regarding H.R. 1608, the Federal Advi-
sory Committee Act Amendments of 2019. As
you know, the bill was referred primarily to
the Committee on Oversight and Reform,
with an additional referral to the Commit-
tees on Ways and Means.
I thank you for allowing the Committee on
Ways and Means to be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of the bill to expedite
floor consideration. This discharge in no way
affects your jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the bill, and it will not serve as
precedent for future referrals. In addition,
should a conference on the bill be necessary,
I would support your request to have the
Committee on Ways and Means represented
on the conference committee.
I would be pleased to include this letter in
the Congressional Record during floor con-
sideration in order to memorialize our un-
derstanding.
Sincerely,
ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS,
Chairman.

Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H.R. 1608, the Federal Advisory Com-
mittee Act Amendments of 2019. I
thank the sponsor of this legislation,
my colleague from Missouri (Mr.
CLAY). In spite of the fact that he is
not wearing his stylish red glasses
today, I want to acknowledge the great
work that he has done. He has been a
tireless advocate on this important re-
form over many Congresses.
H.R. 1608 will help improve the gov-
ernance and transparency of Federal
advisory committees. The Federal ad-
visory committees are groups of ex-
perts and stakeholders who provide ad-
vice and recommendations to Federal
policymakers.
Currently, Madam Speaker, there are
over 1,000 advisory committees that are
covered by the transparency and ac-
countability requirements in the Fed-
eral Advisory Committee Act. But
many more advisory committees are
exempt from the law and may not re-
ceive the same level of scrutiny, due to
a lack of transparency of their own op-
erations.
The gentleman from Missouri (Mr.
CLAY) has been right in working tire-
lessly to make sure that advisory com-
mittees covered under the law are re-
quired to report on their operational
costs. Those reports show advisory
committees cost the Federal Govern-
ment, many times, over $300 million
annually, Madam Speaker.
We need to make sure that we are
getting the most from the hardworking
American taxpayers’ dollars. The 1972
act does not do enough to ensure trans-
parency and openness to the Federal
decisionmaking process.
This bill provides the needed trans-
parency for how committee members
are selected and how committee activi-
ties function. I encourage all my col-
leagues to support this particular legis-
lation.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.
CLAY).
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, I thank
my friend from the District of Colum-
bia for her generosity in time and con-
sideration, as well as my colleague and
friend from North Carolina (Mr. MEAD-
OWS), who supports the legislation also.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Federal Advisory Com-
mittee Act Amendments of 2019.
As was mentioned, I introduced this
bill in previous Congresses, and it most
recently passed the House by voice
vote in 2017, without opposition.
This legislation fits well with the
theme of Sunshine Week, as the House
joins together to address the need for
more transparency in our government.
The Federal Advisory Committee
Act, or FACA, as it is known, was
originally enacted in 1972, as was men-
tioned, to ensure that the advisory
groups that provide counsel to the ex-
ecutive branch operate with trans-
parency.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2671
March 12, 2019
Advisory committees provide the
government with recommendations on
a wide range of issues of importance to
the American public. For example, ad-
visory committees to the Department
of Health and Human Services provide
advice about critical issues such as
human trafficking. The National Advi-
sory Committee on the Sex Trafficking
of Children and Youth in the U.S.
makes recommendations on Federal
programs, such as best practices to
provide housing for children and youth
who are victims of trafficking. The in-
dividuals on that committee are trust-
ed to have experience relevant to the
issues facing these children and share
their reports with child welfare agen-
cies that provide direct services around
the country.
The bill we are considering today
would strengthen FACA to make Fed-
eral advisory committees more trans-
parent and make agencies more ac-
countable in how they select and use
their committees.
Under current law, agencies are able
to avoid the requirements of FACA by
conducting advisory committee busi-
ness through subcommittees, as Ms.
NORTON mentioned.
This bill makes it clear that FACA
applies to subcommittees as well as
their parent committees. The bill also
clarifies that a committee set up by a
contractor is subject to FACA if it is
formed under the direction of the
President or its agency.
Under FACA, agencies will be re-
quired to disclose how advisory com-
mittee members are selected; whether
they have financial conflicts of inter-
est; if they are appointed to provide
their own expertise; and who they work
for, if they are representing a specific
interest.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I hope
that the Senate will take it up quickly
and send it to the President.
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I thank the gentleman for his
thoughtfulness. I have often said there
are two ways things get done here in
Washington, D.C.: slow and never. Let’s
hope that this is one of those times
where it is just slow and that we get
the Senate to act on it.
I would inform the gentlewoman
from the District of Columbia that I
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close.
But before I do that, I want to thank
the staff on both sides of the com-
mittee. Oftentimes, we get up here and
get to deliberate this, but it is the
staffs who do the hard work. I thank
our staff in the minority and, cer-
tainly, the majority staff for their hard
work.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I must say that my friend from Mis-
souri has been indefatigable in trying
to get this bill passed. It looks like it
received some notice, at least the last
time, in the Senate.
I have joked with my friend that
maybe if he got somebody else to intro-
duce it, we could get the bill passed.
But he keeps trying. If at first you
don’t succeed—
I believe that because he has under-
stood that these advisory committees
are very important and sometimes
amount to enacting legislation, so im-
portant are some of them to our proc-
ess, that he has to keep plugging away
until we get it done. I thank him for
doing so.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
ADAMS). The question is on the motion
offered by the gentlewoman from the
District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that
the House suspend the rules and pass
the bill, H.R. 1608.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS.
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the
purpose of complying with the Statutory
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of
the House Budget Committee, provided that
such statement has been submitted prior to
the vote on passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON)
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. MEADOWS) each will control 20
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia?
There was no objection.
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
H.R. 1654, the Federal Register Mod-
ernization Act, is a good-government
bill that will reduce waste and save
taxpayer money. I thank my good
friend from North Carolina, Represent-
ative MEADOWS, for his work on this
important measure.
The bill would modernize the Federal
Register to take advantage of modern
technology and increase efficiency. The
bill would give the Office of the Fed-
eral Register the flexibility to publish
the Federal Register electronically.
It also allows agencies to stop send-
ing unnecessary paper copies of docu-
ments when they send materials to be
published in the Federal Register. That
one step alone could save significant
sums of money that could be used more
efficiently to address the needs of the
American public.
H.R. 1654 also makes certain tech-
nical changes, of course, to a statute
that was originally written in 1935 and
does need some updating.
This is exactly the kind of legislation
Congress should be passing. It is bipar-
tisan; it is noncontroversial; and it
would make modest improvements to
bring the Federal Government into the
digital age so that information is more
accessible to the public.
I urge my colleagues to support this
bill.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Democratic governments must be
transparent and accountable to the
American people. Recordkeeping laws
are vital to both. In support of trans-
parency and accountability, the Fed-
eral Register Act of 1935, as my friend
from the District of Columbia men-
tioned earlier, was created, and it actu-
ally created the Federal Register.
The Federal Register, a lot of people
are not aware, is a daily publication of
government information, such as Presi-
dential documents, rules, proposed
rules, and public notices. The Federal
Register provides official notice of a
document’s existence to the public.
The Federal Register also provides
the building blocks for the Code of Fed-
eral Regulations, which makes it easier
for the public to find Federal regula-
tions by compiling them all in one
place.
In 1994, the Government Publishing
Office began publishing the Federal
Register online. When I got here, I ac-
tually got a paper copy of these Fed-
eral Registers, and I didn’t know what
to do with them. I mean, they were
just reams and reams.
The gentlewoman from the District
of Columbia is right. This is a good-
government, efficient way, hopefully,
that gives the Federal Register the
ability to save American taxpayer
money.
That online Register now includes
navigational aids and links to related
content, and it is fully searchable and
downloadable.
Congress has previously taken steps
to make the Federal Register more ef-
ficient. In 2017, Congress passed the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2673
March 12, 2019
Federal Register Printing Savings Act.
That law saved taxpayer dollars by ac-
tually requiring the GPO to provide
only printed copies to Member offices
that subscribe or request a copy of a
specific issue.
H.R. 1654 continues in this spirit of
reform with a commonsense change for
the GPO and other agencies and gives
them greater flexibility to make sure
that we can save with online publica-
tions.
This bill also eliminates the require-
ments that agencies provide the Na-
tional Archives with multiple copies of
the documents submitted to the Fed-
eral Register. That requirement made
sense when paper copies were mailed or
delivered for publication, but now
agencies can simply do that by sending
duplicate copies electronically to com-
ply with the law.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this particular piece
of legislation. I thank the gentle-
woman for her support, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I think it should be
noted that all the bill does is give flexi-
bility, flexibility to publish the Fed-
eral Register electronically, so I sus-
pect that there will still be paper cop-
ies.
But apparently, the Office of the Fed-
eral Register doesn’t think it can go
online with the Federal Register, so
that is very disturbing this late into
the digital age.
I regard this bill, the bill of my good
friend, I regard it as not prescient, be-
cause it should have happened a long
time ago, but absolutely necessary, and
I commend him for this bill.
Madam Speaker, I am prepared to
yield back. Unless my good friend has
something further today, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for her com-
ments, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from the District of
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House
suspend the rules and pass the bill,
H.R. 1654, as amended.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, on

The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-

f
TRIBUTE TO DANNY WEISS
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise
to pay tribute to a dedicated and deep-
ly respected member of my staff, my
departing chief of staff, Danny Weiss.
For nearly three decades, Danny has
brought wise counsel and energetic
leadership to the House of Representa-
tives. He has committed nearly his en-
tire career to this institution, inspired
by his great respect for its history and
empowered by his bold vision for its fu-
ture.
Danny, the Congress and the country
are stronger for the innovation, inge-
nuity, and insight that you have
brought to this body.
Danny served in the office of my dear
friend, Congressman George Miller—
Mr. Chairman—for more than 25 years,
including decades as his chief of staff.
In every position he has held in the
Congress, Danny has been vital in ad-
vancing a serious, substantive, and suc-
cessful agenda to improve the lives of
hardworking families across America.
He has worked to expand oppor-
tunity, fighting for affordable quality
healthcare, childcare, and education,
and for healthier communities to his
work on the: House Select Committee
on Children, Youth, and Families;
House Natural Resources Committee,
and House Education and Labor Com-
mittee.
Danny has worked to expand justice
by defending the rights and well-being
of children, a mission he continued at
the helm of Common Sense Media; and
he has worked to expand progress to
safeguard clean air, clean water, and
preserve the beauty of God’s creation.
And we are grateful for his leadership
to elevate and amplify the issue of the
climate crisis.
We are grateful that Danny agreed to
return to the Congress at a pivotal mo-
ment for America. His efforts were
vital to our Caucus’ strength and
unity, as Democrats developed our For
the People agenda and won a historic
midterm victory. My office is grateful
for his masterful work orchestrating
the transition in the Speaker’s office.
Danny’s service has entailed sac-
rifice, not only from him, but from his
entire family. We are grateful for the
patience, love, and support from his
wife, Anne, and his daughters, Cath-
erine and Maria.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to please join me in thanking my dis-
tinguished chief of staff, Danny Weiss.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), the
chairman of the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, you
know Danny came to Congress a year
after I did. He must have been under-
age at the time, as you can see the dif-
ference in our appearance, but he was
working on what was then the House
Interior Committee, Natural Re-
sources.
He is a veteran, as am I, of many
years of working with George Miller in
the perpetual water wars in California.
I am going to say Danny didn’t get
that one fixed.
But then when we took back over
after the election in 2006, and we did
some of the best things we have ever
done for college affordability and Pell
grants in the Education and Labor
Committee, Danny was right there
working on that.
We made loans forgivable through a
public service. We limited the length of
time you would have to pay them if
you were in a low-income job. We
greatly increased Pell grants, and we
paid for all that by stopping subsidized
private bank loans with guarantees
that they will never lose any money.
Unfortunately, we have lost a little
ground since then, but I think this
Congress might recapture those things
and will look back to the work he did
then to make higher education more
affordable.
Madam Speaker, we had a couple of
Members say: Oh, he was so good to me
when I didn’t know anything and I
came in.
He was a mentor not only to staff,
but to Members, and a good friend to
me over many years. I hope Danny en-
joys his next iteration, whatever it is.
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs.
BUSTOS), the former co-chair of the
Democratic Policy and Communica-
tions Committee.
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Danny Weiss for his
service to Speaker PELOSI, to our
House Democratic Caucus, and to our
country.
Danny is one of the many staff mem-
bers who has worked tirelessly for the
people’s House. He has never viewed his
service on Capitol Hill as a temporary
stint. This was his life’s work and a
true call to public service.
Most recently, as the Speaker said, I
worked with Danny during my tenure
as co-chair of the Democratic Policy
and Communications Committee dur-
ing the last session of Congress.
As then-Leader PELOSI’s chief of
staff, Danny helped our Caucus develop
our For the People agenda to clean up
corruption in Washington, lower
healthcare costs, and rebuild our coun-
try through investments in our infra-
structure. Developing this agenda was
no easy task, and as anybody like
Danny knows, it is just as hard to keep
Members of Congress on message—I
thought that was funny—but Danny
tried his hardest.
With Danny’s efforts and with his
persistence, we were successful and
gained a historic majority and a record
number of women in the 116th session
of Congress. To say that Danny was in-
strumental in our efforts would be an
understatement.
His career will also be defined by his
undying belief that this body and each
and every one of us can make a dif-
ference in the lives of the people whom
we serve. Danny knows that even amid
the chaos and the sensational head-
lines, we all have the power to be a
force of good in this world.
I would like to join my colleagues in
thanking Danny Weiss for not just his
years of service, but for always keeping
his eye on the prize and on the purpose
and for his dedication to this institu-
tion.
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to yield to the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) to close for us,
the chairman of the Education and
Labor Committee.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
providing me the opportunity to say
some kind words about Danny Weiss.
I want to recognize Danny as a true
model of a public servant. From River-
dale, New York, he wasted no time
coming to Washington and leaving an
impressive mark right here. For almost
28 years, he has provided invaluable
service to the House of Representa-
tives.
As we have heard, we know firsthand
that Danny has been very effective in
the House of Representatives because
of his mastery of complicated issues
that we face as Members of Congress.
As chief of staff—first to Leader PELOSI
and now to Speaker PELOSI—Danny has
given wise counsel to me and my staff
and, as we have heard, to many other
Members on issues that arise from time
to time that need special attention
that Danny always provided.
I would be remiss if I didn’t note
Danny’s exemplary service to the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, under
George Miller. Sitting here a few min-
utes ago, Danny asked me not to em-
barrass him—nice try.
We talked to George, and George in-
formed me that early on he was on the
fence about hiring Danny, but over an
Italian dinner with Danny’s mother,
Cora Weiss, George was informed rath-
er emphatically that her son, Danny,
would be a great hire and one of the
best decisions that he ever made.
George believes that mother knows
best, and the rest is history. Thanks to
Danny’s mom, we have all been blessed
with his decades of public service to
the House of Representatives.

So (two-thirds being in the affirma-

The result of the vote was announced

A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
f
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
the Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of
H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act, and ask for its
immediate consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, if the request cannot be en-
tertained, I urge the Speaker and ma-
jority leader to immediately schedule
the Born-Alive bill so we can stand up
and protect the sanctity of human life,
and I ask all Members to join in that
request.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not recognized for debate.
f
MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR
TORNADO VICTIMS
(Mr. ROGERS of Alabama asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, I would ask to draw the
House’s attention to a terrible disaster
that occurred in Alabama and Georgia
on Sunday, March 3.
At 4 o’clock in the afternoon, we had
an F–4 tornado with winds exceeding
170 miles per hour touch down in Ala-
bama and stay on the ground a mile
wide. For the next 70 miles, it plowed
through Alabama and into Georgia.
This tornado took the lives of 23 in-
nocent Alabamians and injured 90 peo-
ple. It destroyed, just in Alabama
alone, more than 120 homes, and then
went into Georgia and did enormous
property damage.
It is my hope that we, first of all,
take note of the fact that the first re-
sponders in both of our States did an
exemplary job in the search and rescue
during the first 2 days following the
storm trying to find all those who had
been lost and, since then, in the recov-
ery mode.
The money and attention that this
country and this Congress have in-
vested in our first responders having
the training and equipment they need
to deal with these disasters, whether
they are man-made or natural, was
demonstrated again in this horrible
disaster.
At this time, Madam Speaker, I
would like to ask a moment of silence
for us to ask God’s grace and blessings
on these families as they try to recover
from this horrible disaster.
f
THE PRESIDENT’S BUDGET
(Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam
Speaker, I had a saying when I was
chair of New Jersey’s appropriations
committee: Show me your budget, and
I will show you your priorities.
So let’s take a look at what the
President’s budget prioritizes:
An additional $8.6 billion for his mis-
guided, hate-fueled wasteful wall;
A 5 percent increase in the already
bloated Pentagon budget, including
money for his childish space force; and
Making tax cuts for the rich perma-
nent, the same cuts that exploded the
deficit.
Now let’s look at what he apparently
does not value:
Medicare, $845 billion in cuts;
Medicaid, $241 billion in cuts; and
SNAP—that is meals for families
that have fallen on hard times—$220
billion in cuts.
He also clearly doesn’t prioritize:
The environment, 31 percent cut from
the EPA;
Education, $207 billion cut from stu-
dent loan programs; or
Infrastructure, 22 percent cut from
the Department of Transportation.
Madam Speaker, any way you look at
the budget, it is clear: This President
needs to get his priorities in order.
f
PAYING TRIBUTE TO ROBERT
PIOLI
(Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Madam
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an
American hero, Robert Pioli, of Mari-
etta, Ohio.
Only 19 years old when Pearl Harbor
was attacked, he stepped up to fight for
his country. Robert requested to be a
bombardier because it had the shortest
training, and he was ready to fight.
In April of 1944, his B–17 was hit over
Hungary. He was captured by the Nazis
and became a POW, first sent to Poland
and then eventually to Moosburg, Ger-
many.
It was in Moosburg, in April 1945,
that tanks under General Patton rolled
over the gates and liberated the camp.
Then came what Lieutenant Pioli said
was the most memorable and dramatic

moment of his life: The American flag
was slowly raised over the town of
Moosburg. There wasn’t a dry eye in
the camp.
Robert recently passed away, peace-
fully, with his family at his side.
I am honored to have gotten to know
this brave American and his family. He
didn’t like to be called a hero, but that
doesn’t change the fact that he cer-
tainly was one.
God rest in peace, Robert Pioli.
f
AVIATION SAFETY
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I serve on the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, and I have done so since the
heinous act of 9/11.
I have a great deal of faith in the
aviation industry of this Nation, but I
want to offer my deepest sympathy to
the people of Ethiopia and Indonesia.
In the instance of the Ethiopian
flight, some eight Americans died.
Ethiopian Americans have been calling
my office saddened by the fact that
some of their relatives, who are very
special to them, lost their life.
I called, earlier today, for the
grounding of the 737 Max 8 not because
I don’t have faith in America’s genius,
but because I believe people are num-
ber one and first. Pilots count, fight at-
tendants count, and passengers count.
It is time for the FAA to remove
their fear and to be able to assess a
temporary grounding of this aircraft so
that all of the systems can be checked,
even the one that is automatic that the
pilot is to release, which is alleged did
not happen, but to release in order to
save lives.
These planes, this aircraft, should be
grounded now, and I will be sending a
letter to the FAA to demand that.

HONORING DAN JENKINS
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I
would like to take this time to honor a
great man and even better friend, Mr.
Dan Jenkins, who passed away last
Thursday at the age of 90.
Many of us know Mr. Jenkins as a
sports and literary icon. He wrote for
‘‘The Washington Post’’, ‘‘Sports Illus-
trated’’, ‘‘Golf Digest’’, and the list
goes on.
He won countless awards and au-
thored more than 20 books, all the
while representing our shared alma
mater, Texas Christian University.
He was a true sports phenomenon,
and he greatly impacted my life. In
fact, he played a role in my decision to
attend and play baseball at TCU. He
was a vital member of the Horned
Frogs golf team and has always been a
regular at TCU sporting events.
Just recently, the school named the
press box at Amon G. Carter Stadium
after him. At 90, you may wonder what
kept Mr. Jenkins going all these years.
The answer is that he never stopped
writing. He was quoted as saying: ‘‘I
want to keep my mind active. I don’t
believe in retirement. Everybody who
retires too early dies too early.’’
Sadly, no matter what age Mr. Jen-
kins left this Earth, it would have been
too soon.
I join the Fort Worth community in
mourning an absolute legend in sports
and in the media, but I take comfort in
knowing his legacy will carry on for
generations to come.
I hope you join me in praying for Mr.
Jenkins’ wife, June; his sons, Danny
and Marty; and his daughter, Sally,
during this difficult time.
May God bless their family, and most
importantly: Go Frogs.
In God we trust.
f
CONGRATULATING GOOSE ISLAND
AND BISHOP ENGLAND GIRLS
BASKETBALL TEAMS
(Mr. CUNNINGHAM asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to acknowledge the re-
markable accomplishments of both the
Bishop England High School girls bas-
ketball team and the Goose Creek High
School girls basketball team, who are
South Carolina’s State champs in the
class AAA and AAAAA, respectively.
The Lady Gators rallied from behind
to defeat Spring Valley with just sec-
onds left in the game. Senior Mary
Davis scored two free throw points to
send the Goose Creek girls ahead. And
then, with less than half a second on
the clock, Shayla Nelson swatted a
last-second attempt to defeat them.
The very next day, the Lady Bishops
beat Keenan High School for their
sixth state title in the last 8 years,
captured on the front page of ‘‘The
Post and Courier’’ back home in
Charleston.
I would say that that makes for quite
a sports dynasty. It was a great season
for Lowcountry basketball. And as a
former high school basketball player
myself, I could not be more impressed
and proud of the Bishop England and
the Goose Creek girls basketball
teams. Onward towards next season.
f
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
JAMES ‘‘JAMIE’’ PARKER
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to remember the
life of James ‘‘Jamie’’ Parker, who
passed away on Monday, February 25,
at the age of 65.
Upon his passing, Mr. Parker had
worked for 10 years as the editor for
‘‘Bryan County Now’’ as well as the
night editor for the ‘‘Savannah Morn-
ing News.’’
He reported on nearly everything
happening in Richmond Hill, from
sporting events to city council hear-
ings, tear-jerking accidents, and sto-
ries where individuals made heart-
warming contributions to their com-
munity.
His friends remember Mr. Parker not
only as a trustworthy journalist re-
porting on these stories, but also a
great friend and having a heart as big
as the country.
Deeply dedicated to his community,
he attended more local sporting events
than anyone else in town.
My thoughts and prayers are with his
family, friends, and the entire Rich-
mond Hill community during this dif-
ficult time.
f
CELEBRATING OAKLAND LIT-
ERACY COUNCIL’S 35TH ANNI-
VERSARY
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Speaker, I am proud to rise today in
celebration of the 35th anniversary of
the Oakland Literacy Council.
Since the Oakland Literacy Council
was formed in 1984, volunteers have
helped thousands of adult learners im-
prove their literacy skills with the
simple method of one neighbor helping
another.
The dedicated and trained volunteers
of the Oakland Literacy Council pro-
vide free basic literacy and English
language instruction to adults who live
in Oakland County, Michigan.
For 35 years, the efforts of the Oak-
land Literacy Council have helped resi-
dents, students, and workers improve
their English language skills so that
they may communicate with their
child’s teacher, enhance their skills for
a GED or to become a citizen of the
United States, and improve their read-
ing to receive promotions at work.
I commend the tireless work of the
Oakland Literacy Council as it con-
tinues to improve the lives of Oakland
County residents and strengthen the
fabric of our southeastern Michigan
community.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-

eastern Washington and continues to
work tirelessly on behalf of family-
owned markets and grocery stores
throughout our State.
The winner of this award must exem-
plify the true characteristics of a lead-
er. With a passion for the independent
grocery industry, Jan Gee fits that de-
scription to a ‘‘T.’’ She has mentored
and empowered women colleagues, in-
spiring and encouraging many to take
on leadership positions.
I have known Jan since my days in
the Washington State legislature. She
is so deserving of this award because of
her hard work, not only for small busi-
nesses but for helping to support the
next generation of female leaders, en-
trepreneurs, and small business owners
in Washington State.
I appreciate all that Jan has done
and congratulate her on being recog-
nized with the Woman of the Year
award.
God bless you, Jan.
f
CALL FOR FISCAL CONSERVATISM
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to call attention to an obstacle
that has stood before this Nation for
many years, but that has recently risen
to new and alarming heights.
Last month, the United States na-
tional debt topped $22 trillion for the
first time in our history. This is $3 tril-
lion higher than our annual GDP and
equates to over $67,000 in debt to be
borne by each and every American.
I understand this debt is the cul-
mination of choices that all seemed re-
sponsible in the moment. My col-
leagues and I entered public office to
serve the country. And, too often, it is
tempting to fix society by throwing
money at our problems. However, this
tactic mortgages future generations for
the benefit of the present.
Congress has a duty to serve not only
their own generation but generations
to come, and we must exercise pru-
dence to balance the desires of the
present with the needs of the future.
This $22 trillion problem will require
strong resolve from strong leaders.
Our Nation looks to us, this Con-
gress, to correct the spending mistakes
of the past, and I look forward to work-
ing with you all to clear a path for our
future.
f
ADJOURNMENT
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I move
that the House do now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; accord-
ingly (at 3 o’clock and 8 minutes p.m.),
under its previous order, the House ad-
journed until tomorrow, Wednesday,
March 13, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-
hour debate.
BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF PAYGO
LEGISLATION
Pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-
You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO), Mr. YAR-
MUTH hereby submits, prior to the vote
on passage, for printing in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD, that H.R. 1582, the
Electronic Message Preservation Act
would have no significant effect on di-
rect spending or revenues, and there-

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER

BUDGET PROPOSAL
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
yesterday the White House released its
budget proposal for fiscal year 2020. Un-
derstanding the President’s key prior-
ities and vision for Federal spending is
critical to the success of the entire
funding process here in Congress.
Republicans agree that we need to re-
main focused on important goals, such
as the continued rebuilding of our mili-
tary, keeping up the fight against
opioid abuse, and addressing the ongo-
ing security and humanitarian crisis at
our southern border.
As the senior Senator from Ken-
tucky, I was especially encouraged to
see the President’s commitment to our
Nation’s veterans front and center, in-
cluding a request to fully fund con-
struction of the new Robley Rex VA
Medical Center in my hometown of
Louisville.
Together with my Senate colleagues,
I look forward to carefully reviewing
the administration’s priorities as this
year’s funding process moves ahead.
NOMINATIONS
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, building on last week’s progress,
the Senate will consider two more of
President Trump’s outstanding judicial
nominees, in addition to another exec-
utive branch nominee, this week.
The first item of business is the nom-
ination of Paul Matey of New Jersey to
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr.
Matey holds degrees from Scranton and
Seton Hall Universities, as well as
clerkships on our Nation’s Federal
courts. He has served the people of his
State in the Office of U.S. Attorney in
New Jersey and has built an impressive
record.
I hope my colleagues will join me in
voting to advance and confirm Mr.
Matey and these other distinguished
nominees so the Senate can fulfill our
responsibility to the American people.
MEDICARE FOR ALL
On a final matter, here is a quote: ‘‘I
think the $33 trillion price tag for
‘Medicare for all’ is a little scary.’’
That came from a Democratic Member
of Congress who happens to sit in a
leadership role. She sounds worried,
and I don’t blame her.
The new House Democratic majority
has wasted no time—no time at all—
rolling out one half-baked socialist
proposal after another. Apparently, the
remarkable job growth, wage growth,
and new opportunities pouring into
communities across America have
failed to persuade my Democratic
friends of a simple reality: Things go
pretty well when government gets its
foot off the brake and lets American
families live their lives without oppres-
sive supervision from Washington
Democrats. Apparently, that is just in-
conceivable, because the outlandish,
government-driven proposals to take
over one economic sector after another
continue to roll in.
We have all heard about the Green
New Deal—the far left’s master plan to
hurt American energy independence,
disrupt millions of workers’ liveli-
hoods, put entire industries out of busi-
ness, and let Washington regulators re-
design every building in America,
while letting China and other countries
off the hook. That is just for starters.
We have all heard about the price tag
as estimated by the one research outfit
that has actually taken a shot at hang-
ing some numbers on all the vague, pie-
in-the-sky language. They calculated
the total could exceed $90 trillion.
But let’s not lose sight of the other
party-defining, socialist pivot many
Democrats are rushing to embrace:
Medicare for None. Yes, Democrats

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1770 March 12, 2019
have taken the pulse of the American
people, and here is what they have de-
cided: They have decided that Amer-
ican seniors want their Medicare
hollowed out until the only thing left
is the name. They have decided that
middle-class families are eager—
eager—to be kicked off their health in-
surance plans and forced into a one-
size-fits-all government alternative.
Oh, and they have decided that tax-
payers up and down the income scale
are clamoring—just clamoring—to send
much more of their money to the IRS.
No choices. No options. No alter-
natives. No more Medicare as we know
it. Every single American has to obedi-
ently take a seat and buckle up for the
Democrats’ wild ride toward govern-
ment-run health insurance.
The sequel to ObamaCare and its
soaring premiums is coming soon to a
Democratic press conference near you.
This time, they want to turn the entire
system over to those bureaucrats and
make it unlawful—unlawful—to possess
competing private coverage. That
sends quite a message, doesn’t it? My
colleagues are so confident American
families will love their new govern-
ment-mandated healthcare plan that
they feel compelled to outlaw any com-
petition.
It has already been quite an experi-
ence watching liberal leaders grapple
publicly with the question of whether,
in fact, their movement is seriously
going to double down on these socialist
policies.
Michael Bloomberg said this sort of
proposal ‘‘would bankrupt us for a very
long time.’’ Speaker PELOSI herself had
to wonder publicly, ‘‘How do you pay
for that?’’ Well, if you are Vermont or
Colorado—two places that have flirted
with the idea of single-payer
healthcare—there is a simple answer:
You don’t pay for it because you can’t.
In 2014, when Vermont grappled with
a proposal to implement a State-run,
single-payer system, the Governor’s of-
fice was forced to conclude from its
own analysis that the cost of the pro-
gram would nearly double State spend-
ing in its first year of implementation
and could lead to $100 million deficits
within 5 years. That was in Vermont.
In 2016, Colorado Democrats put for-
ward a ballot measure to pursue this in
their State. Once again, the program’s
costs were projected to exceed the en-
tire State’s budget. So voters rejected
it. In Colorado, 80 percent of them re-
jected it, to be exact.
Those are just two States, but this is
exactly the kind of broken mathe-
matics that Democrats are now hoping
to force on our entire country—an esti-
mated $32 trillion over the first 10
years, at least. That is more than the
government has laid out in the last 8
years, combined, on everything—on ev-
erything.
I am sure we will be advertised the
same old leftwing talking points about
millionaires and billionaires magically
paying for all of it. How often have we
heard that? As I have noted before, it is
just not possible. There are not enough
millionaires and billionaires in the en-
tire country to pay the tens of trillions
of dollars this takeover would require.
Even if the IRS seized every cent
Americans earned beyond $1 million—
all of it, took all their money—it
wouldn’t even cover half the hole this
proposal would leave in the Treasury.
That is why one economist wrote that
‘‘the simple fact is that Medicare-for-
all would require a dramatic shift in
the federal tax structure and a sub-
stantial tax increase for almost all
Americans.’’ Almost all Americans.
Even leading Democrats can’t help
but laugh at this stuff. This was Gov-
ernor Andrew Cuomo of New York de-
scribing this idea in the context of his
own State. This is what the Demo-
cratic Governor of New York said:
No sane person will pass it . . . you’d dou-
ble everybody’s taxes. You want to do that?
So parts of the Democratic Party
here in Congress are running towards a
policy that even the stalwart liberal
Governor of New York derides as out-
of-this-world expensive and imprac-
tical. No wonder some Democrats are
worried about the radical rumblings
within their party.
Fortunately, the American people
don’t have to worry a bit—at least not
for now. This craziness will never get
through the U.S. Senate.
Madam President, I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. SCHUMER. By the end of this
week, the Senate must vote on the res-
olution to terminate the President’s
declaration of a national emergency.
There are three very clear reasons to
vote to terminate. First, there is no
factual basis of an emergency at the
border. The President made that clear
when he said he didn’t need to do this.
If we allow Presidents to declare emer-
gencies for such nonemergency-type
situations because they want to do it,
we are headed down a very bad road.
Second, the emergency would can-
nibalize funds intended for our brave
men and women in uniform in order to
pay for the wall, including military
construction, and maybe even military
pay and pensions.
The bottom line is, we hear from the
other side how we have to make sure
we give our soldiers what they need.
We completely agree, but all of a sud-
den, when there is this wall, we take it
away from the soldiers; we take it
away from military readiness. That is
not a trade most Americans would
make.
Third and most important is the dan-
ger to our Constitution. The emer-
gency declaration is an injury to this
great Constitution under which we
live. It claims powers for the Presi-
dency that were explicitly given to
Congress. It distorts the separation of
powers, and it sets a dangerous prece-
dent for future Presidents.
The bottom line is, one of the things
the Founding Fathers gave the most
thought to was the balance of power
and how to prevent an overpowerful
and overleaning executive branch. That
is why they gave Congress the power of
the purse. Are we going to reverse 220
years of a balance of power because a
President is demanding a wall that
Congress couldn’t get him, that Mexico
couldn’t pay for? It goes far beyond the
wall, whether you are for or against it.
It goes far beyond all these other
issues. It goes to the very nature of our
government, and it will set us on a
path that historians will come back
and look at as a very bad turning point
for America.
BUDGET PROPOSAL
Madam President, yesterday the
Trump administration released its an-
nual budget. These Trump budget re-
quests have become so outlandish, so
removed from reality, that even Repub-
licans in Congress can’t work with that
budget and can’t treat them seriously.
They are essentially statements of
principle from an administration that
doesn’t care about governing. What
does it care about? What are its prior-
ities? That is what they talked about
because I bet they know not a single
Republican would vote for the budget.
We looked at the budget and what it
would mean for my home State of New
York. The President’s budget would
cut millions of dollars from the Depart-
ment of Justice programs that hire po-
lice officers, provide their equipment,
and combat the opioid epidemic. The
budget would cut millions from New
York’s educational programs that
would help schools throughout our
State, including those schools on mili-
tary bases. It would hurt afterschool
programs and STEM initiatives teach-
ing our young people about science and
math. The cuts to NIH would devastate
New York’s hospitals, particularly
rural hospitals, and would cut back on
our great medical research. We are all
living longer and healthier, in part, be-
cause of the medical research done by
NIH. Hardly anyone wants to cut that.
The President did.
The cuts to Medicaid would affect 6.5
million New Yorkers who rely on it. I
think that story can be repeated for
just about every State. New York is a
very diverse State, with large urban,
rural, and suburban populations, and
every one of them is hurt across the
board from safety and security to edu-
cation and healthcare, to infrastruc-
ture and economic development. The
Trump budget would be a gut punch to
New York’s middle class. The same is
true for the Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1771
March 12, 2019
Setting aside, for the moment, the
humanity of these cuts, this budget re-
veals the depth of President Trump’s
hypocrisy on several of his signature
issues. Donald Trump campaigned for
President promising not to cut Medi-
care, Medicaid, or Social Security. In
2015, he tweeted:
I was the first & only potential GOP can-
didate to state there will be no cuts to Social
Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee
copied me.
Let’s look at President Trump’s
budget. It cuts Medicare by $845 billion,
cuts Medicaid by $1.5 trillion. I under-
stand the challenges of the office some-
times prevent Presidents from achiev-
ing precisely what they campaigned on,
but this is literally the opposite of
what Donald Trump said in his cam-
paign. No one is forcing his hand. He is
proposing this.
Candidate Trump? No cuts to Medi-
care and Medicaid. President Trump?
Cut those promises by more than $2
trillion.
This budget says: ‘‘Promises kept.’’
Balderdash—balderdash—when it
comes to Social Security, Medicare,
and Medicaid. Promises kept? Donald
Trump said he wouldn’t cut Medicare
or Medicaid. The budget slashes them
brutally. How can they dare say
‘‘promises kept’’ on probably the most
significant domestic-side programs we
have when they slash them?
You don’t even need a long memory
to find out the hypocrisy of the Presi-
dent in this budget. Only a few months
ago, the President spoke to the Amer-
ican Farm Bureau, promising a bright
future for American farmers. Yet his
administration proposed cutting the
Department of Agriculture in the
midst of implementing a new farm bill
by 15 percent.
In his first address to a joint session
of Congress, President Trump called
education the ‘‘civil rights of our
time.’’ Yesterday, he proposed cutting
the Department of Education by 12 per-
cent. Promises kept? Balderdash.
One of the few bipartisan moments
during the President’s most recent
State of the Union was when he
pledged to ‘‘defeat AIDS in America
and beyond.’’ The President’s budget,
however, cuts the program that seeks
to eliminate AIDS around the globe by
22 percent. Promises kept? Balderdash.
Of course, the President famously
promised Mexico would pay for the bor-
der wall. His budget asks the American
taxpayers to shell out $8.6 billion for
the wall. Promises kept? Balderdash.
On the cover of the President’s budg-
et are emblazoned the words ‘‘Promises
Kept.’’ He must really believe no one
will read beyond the cover page be-
cause this budget document is a list of
broken promises by President Trump,
one after the other. What he says to
the public and what he puts out in his
budget are in two different worlds.
Promises kept? He said he wouldn’t cut
Medicare or Medicaid. He cuts them.
Promises kept? He said he would bol-
ster our farmers. He cuts the farm bill
15 percent. Promises kept? Mexico will
pay for the wall—not in this budget.
The American taxpayers pay for it.
It is just pathetic that in this world
in which we live, a President can be so
hypocritical and contradictory by say-
ing one thing and then having his
budget do the exact opposite.
I have a challenge to my friend Lead-
er MCCONNELL, another challenge, be-
cause he seems to duck about every
issue we have. Put President Trump’s
budget on the floor of the Senate. You
are putting the Green New Deal on the
floor of the Senate. Put this budget on
the floor of the Senate. Let’s see if a
single Republican votes for it.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Madam President, this morning, the
President tweeted a quote from a guest
on ‘‘FOX & Friends’’ who called cli-
mate change fake science. Here is the
quote: ‘‘There is no climate crisis,
there’s weather and climate all around
the world, and in fact, carbon dioxide is
the main building block of life.’’
There is weather and climate all
around the world. Really, the President
endorsed that quote. Just about every
scientist who has studied it knows cli-
mate change is the greatest challenge
facing our planet. Anyone who lives
with these dramatic changes in weath-
er, whether it is through California
wildfires, whether it is through floods
in the Middle West and Upstate New
York, whether it is Miami streets
flooding near the coast over and over
again, everyone knows things are
changing dramatically. It is not just
the normal cycle I lived through the
first 50 years of my life. We all know it
is happening, and what does the Presi-
dent do? Not only does he deny it—it is
worse—he acts on it in the wrong direc-
tion.
He has rolled back commonsense en-
vironmental protections, opened up
more Federal lands for oil and gas, and
announced the United States would
leave the Paris accord. In the budget,
President Trump proposes to cut more
than one-third of EPA’s funding and
cuts other programs that combat cli-
mate change. Communities across the
country are staring climate change in
the face. Ask any farmer. They will tell
you their growing seasons have
changed. They will tell you about
record droughts. They will tell you in
the Mountain West about rebuilding
from devastating wildfires and home-
owners along the coasts picking up the
pieces after hurricanes and storms
have ripped through their States. It is
just shameful. It is embarrassing the
President continues to deny science
and peddles these lies—absolutely
shameful. I hope my Republican col-
leagues will stand up to the President
and call out this nonsense. So far they
haven’t been willing to contradict the
President’s lies about climate change.
That needs to change.
We challenge our Republican friends
to join the resolution by Senator CAR-
PER, myself, and others. It says three
simple things: One, climate change is
real. Do you believe that, all of my Re-
publican friends? Can you answer yes
or no? Two, it is caused by human ac-
tivity. And, three, we need to do some-
thing to stop it, to stop the dramatic
change in global warming.
Why are our Republican friends so si-
lent on this? That is perhaps the major
issue of our day. When history looks
back, it is not going to look kindly on
them. What are they afraid of—the oil
industry? What are they afraid of—the
facts? What are they afraid of—right-
wing orthodoxy, often funded by the
Koch brothers, who don’t want to
admit to climate change? It is a shame.
It is a shame.
BUYBACKS
Madam President, on buybacks, I
have come to the Senate floor several
times over the past year to sound the
alarm about the explosion of corporate
stock buybacks. Corporate executives
have been leaning on them more and
more to satisfy shareholders who tend
to be wealthy. The top 80 percent of all
shares are owned by the top 10 percent
of America; that is even including pen-
sion funds.
After the Trump tax bill, last year
buybacks reached their highest re-
corded level—over $1 trillion in a single
calendar year. That is not money going
to workers. That is not money going to
communities. That is not money going
into research to make better products.
That is simply going to the wealthy
CEOs and shareholders without other
real benefit to the country.
Based on an analysis of America’s
largest companies, for 466 of Standard
& Poor’s 500, the equivalent of 92 cents
out of every dollar went to stock
buybacks or dividends—92 percent.
That has never happened before. Sure-
ly, there are more productive ways for
corporations to allocate capital. Sure-
ly, those numbers suggest an overreli-
ance, if not an obsession, with stock
buybacks in an attempt to raise stock
prices.
This unhealthy development is not
good for the long-term interests of
companies or for America. Just yester-
day, a major American corporation saw
its outlook downgrade because it is
spending tens of billions of dollars on
corporate stock buybacks at the ex-
pense of investment and research and
development. But some just refuse to
look at the plain facts.
Over the weekend, the Wall Street
Journal editorial board criticized Con-
gress—Members of both parties, in
fact—for even expressing concerns
about the level of stock buybacks that
we have seen recently.
Here is what the Journal editorial
board wrote:
Repurchasing shares is simply one way a
company can return cash to owners if it
lacks better ideas for investment. Tax re-
form increased corporate cash flow by cut-
ting tax rates and letting companies repa-
triate their cash held overseas.
First of all, it is notable that the
Wall Street ed board basically admits
that the Trump corporate tax cuts

have fueled the explosion of stock
buybacks. But, second, and more im-
portantly, the Wall Street Journal
makes no mention of the record
amount that corporate America has
announced in buybacks since the tax
bill passed—$1 trillion—or the many
things corporations could invest in
with their spare cash.
One thing the Journal never talks
about is how income distribution is
getting worse and worse and how the
wealthiest at the top own more and
more of our wealth and our income
while the middle class is more and
more worried about the future and
even about paying their bills now.
What about workers’ wages?
Wouldn’t America be better off if work-
ers were paid more? Income distribu-
tion is the worst it has been in decades.
Why not reward workers for increases
in productivity with higher wages?
Productivity has gone up over the last
decade—I think since about 2000—and
workers haven’t gotten that gain, even
though they have produced a lot of it.
What about pension funds? Listen to
this. There are large numbers of cor-
porate America that have not met the
obligation of their pension funds—what
they promised the workers they would
pay to them in their retirement—and,
instead, are using the money for cor-
porate buybacks. How many of the
S&P 500 have underfunded pension
plans but are still authorizing billions
of dollars for share repurchases? I
think America would like to know
that. In my view, I believe corporate
America would have a hard time refut-
ing that it is unconscionable for cor-
porations to buy back billions in stock
while letting its pension fund wither,
breaking a promise to its workers,
many of whom have spent decades and
decades and decades working hard for
their company and looking forward to
a retirement with an amount of money
that will not make them rich but at
least allows them to live decently.
The Wall Street Journal makes no
mention of any of these options. They
said that buybacks are simply ‘‘one
way a company can return cash to own-
ers if it lacks better ideas for invest-
ment.’’
Well, if that is the case, a lot of com-
panies are willfully ignorant. When 92
percent of profits are going to
buybacks and dividends, corporations
must be trying really hard not to think
about workers, pensions, or R&D. To
think about the maldistribution of in-
come, to think how wealth is
agglomerating to the top—it is all bad
for America, both economically and po-
litically, in the long term.
I refuse—refuse—to accept that cor-
porate America’s sole responsibility is
to maximize return for executives and
wealthy shareholders. The American
economy has to work for workers and
communities. The Wall Street Journal
just defends the status quo as things
get worse and worse and worse in terms
of middle-class workers’ viability, get-
ting gains from their productivity in-
creases, and income distribution. It is a
crisis in America.
No matter what the Wall Street
Journal editorial board thinks, this
topic deserves the Senate’s attention.
If they don’t believe our solutions on
buybacks are the answer, what is their
solution to income maldistribution?
They said the tax cuts would work. I
remember the President saying that
every worker will get a $4,000 increase.
Where is that? Almost all of that
money is going to wealthy share-
holders and corporate CEOs as the
buyback mania, if you will—92 per-
cent—continues.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, be-
fore I get to my main topic, I just want
to briefly respond to something the
Democratic leader, the Senator from
New York, said regarding the tax cuts
bill that passed in 2017.
The Democrats, none of whom voted
for it, obviously, have not ceased to
criticize the passage of that tax relief
bill, notwithstanding the significant
economic progress that we have seen as
a result of its passage, coupled with re-
lief from regulations and other policies
that have been implemented by this
President in working with the Con-
gress.
There is historic economic data to re-
port. We have record unemployment
rates all across the country. We have
seen record wage increases.
The Senator from New York talked
about how this hasn’t benefited work-
ing Americans. That couldn’t be fur-
ther from the truth. If you look at the
data, it is very clear that wage rates
are growing. They are growing at the
fastest rate in over a decade. Today, we
actually have more jobs available in
this country than we do people looking
for jobs. That is also a historic first
and something that has been happening
now for many months in a row.
We have record low unemployment,
record high wages, and growth in the
economy that we haven’t seen in over a
decade either—3.1 percent in a calendar
year, fourth quarter over fourth quar-
ter. That is the first time we have seen
north of 3 percent growth in our econ-
omy since 2005. So if you look at the
evidence, it is pretty clear that the tax
relief bill that was passed by the Con-
gress and signed into law by the Presi-
dent in late 2017 is having the desired
effect.
With respect to the arguments that
were made that this is what is contrib-
uting to the debt and the deficit, just
last week there was a piece in the Wall
Street Journal by a former colleague of
ours, Senator Phil Gramm from Texas,
who pointed out the Congressional
Budget Office has adjusted its projec-
tions when it comes to growth in the
economy since the tax bill passed.
In 2017, when it was in the process of
being passed, the CBO was projecting 2
percent growth in 2018 and 1.7 percent
growth in 2019. They have now modified
those projections to 2.9 percent in 2018
and 2.7 percent in 2019.
What that means is—an additional
percentage point of growth means
higher government revenues. In fact,
the CBO has adjusted their projections
with respect to government revenues
upward to about $1.2 trillion over the
next decade. Government revenues of
$1.2 trillion would be about 80 percent
of what the projected cost of the tax
bill was, about $1.5 trillion. At the
time, we projected we would see addi-
tional economic growth as a result of
passing tax reform and allowing indi-
viduals and businesses, whether they
are organized as C corps or whether
they are organized as passthroughs, to
benefit from these provisions and
changes in the Tax Code—faster cost
recovery and lower rates—that would
encourage them to invest, grow, and
expand their operations. That is ex-
actly what has happened.
As a result of that, according to the
CBO and based on their projections,
you have seen government revenues
going up and up by over $1 trillion.
Again, that is almost 80 percent and
pays for the cost of the tax bill that
the Democrats are so quick to criticize
as contributing to the deficit and the
debt.
So I would argue that if you look at
the facts—facts are stubborn things—if
you look at the record, if you look at
the data, and if you look at the statis-
tics, they all point to the impact of tax
reform and other pro-growth policies
that have been implemented by the
Trump administration and this Repub-
lican Congress; they are having the de-
sired effect. We are seeing increases in
wages. Obviously, we are seeing a tre-
mendous impact on growth and on jobs
in this economy, and that is good for
American workers.
Obviously, when you reduce tax
rates, hopefully, that benefits every-
body, but when you have a growing, vi-
brant, and robust economy, that lifts
all folks. Everybody benefits from that,
and we are seeing the effects of that as
a result of this policy.
I know the Democrats all voted
against it, so I suppose they have every
reason to try to criticize it, but, again,
if you look at the facts, if you look at
the record, and if you look at the ac-
tual data, you get a very different con-
clusion from the one that they are try-
ing to put forward and advance.
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Madam President, last week, we con-

to languish in limbo for months be-
cause Democrats will not agree to
move the nominee forward outside of
the lengthy cloture process.
As Senators, we have to take our
confirmation responsibility seriously,
and sometimes that means that we op-
pose a candidate who raises serious
concerns about his or her suitability
for the position for which he or she has
been nominated. What it should not
mean—what it should not mean—is
that we reflexively slow-walk qualified
candidates simply because we don’t
like the President who is doing the
nominating. But that is what Demo-
crats have done over the past 2 years,
over and over and over. Again and
again, the President has put up a quali-
fied candidate the Democrats don’t
really object to, and, again and again,
they have forced the leader to file clo-
ture on the nomination, delaying con-
firmation for weeks or months.
How do we know the Democrats
didn’t have genuine objections to a lot
of these candidates? We have the
Democrats’ votes to prove it. Nearly
half of the recorded cloture votes in
the 115th Congress received the support
of 60 or more Senators when it came to
a vote. More than one-third of the re-
corded cloture votes ultimately re-
ceived 70 or more votes in support.
That means that more than one-third
of the time, 17 or more Democrats
voted in support of ending debate on a
nomination and moving forward to a
vote. Yet, in each of those instances,
Democrats delayed the nomination
from coming to a vote by forcing the
leader to file cloture.
In one particularly egregious in-
stance of objection, Democrats forced
the Senate to spend more than an en-
tire week considering four district
court judges, even though not one sin-
gle Democrat voted against their con-
firmation. That is right. Not one single
Democrat voted against their con-
firmation. These judges could have
been confirmed in minutes by a voice
vote. Instead, Democrats forced the
Senate to spend more than an entire
week considering the nominations, a
week that could have been spent on the
many issues—serious issues that are
facing this country—or a week that
could have been spent on nominations
that actually needed to be debated on
the Senate floor.
During the 115th Congress, Senate
Democrats forced 128 cloture votes on
President Trump’s nominees—128 clo-
ture votes. Do you want to know how
many cloture votes Republicans forced
during President Obama’s first Con-
gress, his first 2 years in office?
Twelve.
In our democracy, you win some elec-
tions and you lose some elections. That
is the way it goes. Sometimes you are
a big fan of the person in the White
House and sometimes you are not.
That is the nature of free elections.
That is the nature of life in a democ-
racy.
But 2-plus years on, Democrats still
can’t accept that they lost the 2016
Presidential election. They have spent
the past 2 years doing everything they
can to oppose the President, even if the
American people get hurt as a result.
There is a reason that Senators, dur-
ing previous administrations, have not
objected to votes on a President’s
nominees, even when they didn’t like
the President. It is because Senators
have generally recognized that a Presi-
dent needs to fill vacancies in the exec-
utive branch so that the work of the
government can get done. Senators
have also tended to think that a Presi-
dent duly elected by the American peo-
ple deserves to be able to staff the ad-
ministration that the American people
have chosen.
Democrats have apparently decided
that it is more important for them to
be able to express their antipathy to
President Trump than for the govern-
ment to be able to get its work done.
Democrats’ unprecedented obstruc-
tion has also eaten up time that the
Senate could have been spending on
other priorities—from growing our
economy to making healthcare more
affordable, to helping Americans save
for education and their retirement.
I would like to suggest to my Demo-
cratic colleagues that 2 years is long
enough for throwing a tantrum over
the 2016 Presidential election. It might
be time to accept the election results
and to work with Republicans to con-
firm the President’s nominees in a
timely fashion. After 2-plus years of
Democratic obstruction, I am not hold-
ing out a lot of hope, but there is al-
ways a chance that Democrats will de-
cide that it is time to stop playing par-
tisan games and to start focusing on
the business of the American people.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.

SCOTT of Florida). Without objection,

NOMINATION OF PAUL B. MATEY
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise
today to speak on the nomination of
Paul Matey, who has been nominated
by President Trump to a New Jersey
seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit.
The Constitution actually charges
this body with a sacred obligation.
This body is charged by our Founders
and by our Constitution with providing
advice and consent on the individuals
the President nominates to serve on
the Federal courts.
Over the last century, the United
States has developed a process for car-
rying out that duty of evaluation, eval-
uating those nominees, but just a cou-
ple weeks ago, the body broke a cen-
tury-old precedent. Until then, the
Senate had never ever confirmed a ju-
dicial nominee over the objections of
both home State Senators. I looked
into this through the Congressional
Research Service, and they didn’t find
a single example where that has ever
happened.
During the last century before the
Trump administration, you could
count on one hand the number of times
the Senate had confirmed a judicial
nominee when even one home State
Senator had objected. That happened
four times during the 1980s and once
during the 1930s. That is it. But with
the nominees now coming to the Sen-
ate floor, to this body, it is breaking a
longstanding, bipartisan tradition and
has jettisoned that rule and that idea.
This has already happened—ignoring
the objections of one home State Sen-
ator—five times.
Now that is happening in a doubling-
down capacity. The Senate confirmed
Eric Miller to the Ninth Circuit a cou-
ple weeks ago, and he was opposed by
both of his home State Senators, my
friends PATTY MURRAY and MARIA
CANTWELL. This was the first time in a
century that this body has disregarded
the objections of both duly-elected
Senators, who know their States, who
know their communities. It was a
breakdown of this longstanding, bipar-
tisan tradition, this idea that this body
is different from the majoritarian body
in the House; that in this body, we be-
lieve home State Senators should have
a say on the nomination of judges. Not
that they are in line ideologically—
clearly, when you have a Republican
President, you are going to see Repub-
lican-appointed judges. But this break-
down has now undermined this tradi-
tion that in the Senate, we find a way
to come together and work together on
this sacred duty of putting people into
that third branch of government.
What worries me now is this week,
the Senate is on the brink of doing it
again. Senate Republicans are moving
to confirm an individual to the Third
Circuit over the objections of both
home state Senators—in this case, both
home State Senators from New Jersey,
Senator MENENDEZ and me. So this mo-
ment is personal to me, but more im-
portantly, I want to sound the alarm
yet again and not just sit as a by-
stander to history and let this Senate
tradition be eviscerated.
When I first got to the Senate, I
made it known that I really wanted to
be a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. It took me years to get on that
committee. I am so proud to be on a
committee that has an incredible
record of doing bipartisan work, wheth-
er it was the bill we passed out of com-
mittee to protect Robert Mueller or
just last Congress when we worked to-
gether across the aisle to do com-
prehensive criminal justice reform.
I know the history of that com-
mittee. I have been watching it since I
was much younger and had a lot more
hair. I knew that this committee—as
Senator DURBIN so eloquently de-
scribed last week in our markup com-
mittee—this is a committee whose

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1774 March 12, 2019
Members have worked together to con-
front many great challenges. But now
we find ourselves in a perilous position
where important guardrails that were
put in place to properly vet judicial
nominees are being thrown by the way-
side.
The latest development in the Senate
is disregarding the blue-slip tradition,
which over the last century has en-
abled home State Senators to have a
meaningful role in the nomination
process.
In late January of this year, the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee held a mark-
up meeting for 44 judicial nominees.
Folks around here were literally call-
ing it the monster markup. At that
meeting, I told Chairman GRAHAM, just
as I had told Chairman GRASSLEY last
year, that the White House had not
meaningfully consulted with me or
Senator MENENDEZ ahead of that mark-
up. In fact, I pointed out, the White
House had not offered to even arrange
a meeting between Mr. Matey and me
or Senator MENENDEZ. We didn’t get an
offer of a meeting before the nomina-
tion. We didn’t get an offer of a meet-
ing before the confirmation hearing.
We didn’t get an offer of a meeting be-
fore the markup.
Chairman GRAHAM said he would
make sure that Mr. Matey and I would
be able to meet before the full Senate
voted on his nomination, and we did. I
really appreciate that and Senator
GRAHAM being a man of his word. But
when I met with Mr. Matey last week,
our conversation was refreshingly hon-
est because we both knew it was just a
courtesy. We knew this process was
completely backward. Two home State
Senators had just been rendered com-
pletely irrelevant in the selection of a
circuit court judge from their State.
I ask any of my colleagues to imag-
ine this: that a person to the circuit
court from their community—and Mr.
Matey is from my city—that you don’t
even have a chance to meet with them,
have a discussion, ask them questions.
If it weren’t for my presence on the Ju-
diciary Committee, where I got 5 min-
utes to question him, this person would
have sailed through without any con-
sultation with two home State Sen-
ators. I ask my colleagues how they
would feel if this happened to them.
This breaking of a century-old prece-
dent has made it clear that we are
going to keep on breaking it. This is
something that is now going to become
a part of this body. Are we all really
comfortable with the implications of
that?
The Republicans on the Judiciary
Committee just voted out two Second
Circuit nominees over the objections of
their home State Senators—again, his-
torically unprecedented—and three
more nominees to the Ninth Circuit
with the very same problem are about
to come before this committee.
Senate Republicans seem to be intent
on dismantling the century-old process
for the vetting of judicial nominees.
This is being done methodically—tak-
ing it apart piece by piece, whatever it
takes to push through these nominees.
The pendulum does swing in this
place. I was told by Senators whom I
respect—I still remember coming here
and sitting down with some of the
statesmen in this area on both sides of
the aisle. I still remember conversa-
tions with Senator Harkin, who is no
longer here, and Senator McCain tell-
ing me to respect the traditions of this
body, to understand that this body, as
our predecessors said, should be the
cooling of the partisan rage or passions
of the time; that we should preserve
those parts of this institution that cre-
ate comity, that force us to come to-
gether. But the wound that is being
created right now goes to the ability of
any Senator in this body to truly rep-
resent their State.
Look, the pendulum is going to
swing. Eventually, there is going to be
a Democratic President. This body will
shift again. Every single Senator,
should they stay in this body, is prob-
ably going to see the time when, be-
cause of what we are doing today, they
will have no say whatsoever when it
comes to their constitutional duty of
advice and consent.
My message to my colleagues is this:
The feeling I had last week when I met
with Mr. Matey is a feeling that every-
one in this Chamber is going to have at
some point if we do not stop this now.
If we continue down this path, you will
find yourself rendered irrelevant in the
selection of judicial nominees from
your State. You were duly elected by
the people of your State, and there
won’t be a thing you can do to stand up
for their interests in this process.
This will be a sad chapter if we allow
it to be written into our history. It
doesn’t have to be this way. We could
go back in this process. We could say:
You know what, this guy is qualified.
Why don’t we go back and have the
process done the right way—have the
White House sit down with their home
State Senators and see if they can
work out a deal, as it was done before,
to make sure we have a role in the
process the Founders designed.
The guardrails we have established in
this body have an important purpose:
to enable the Judiciary Committee and
Senators to properly vet judicial nomi-
nees, to ensure that those nominees are
not just qualified to serve but that
they are more in the mainstream, not
ideologues, and to ensure that they
have a good judicial temperament.
We cannot walk away from the long-
standing Senate practice of respect for
the views of home State Senators
about the judges who will serve in their
State. I urge my colleagues to vote no
on this nomination because of the
trashing of the processes that have
been a time-honored way of doing
things in the Senate. But let me be
clear. This is about more than just the
dismantling of the Senate procedures.
As a Senator, I do have a perspective
on the nature of some of the nominees
who are being put forward to serve on
our courts, and I want to take a mo-
ment to speak to that.
The Constitution charges this body
with vetting the President’s judicial
nominees for good reason. It is our
duty as Senators to provide a check
and balance on those nominations to
ensure that people who serve as Fed-
eral judges can be fair and impartial. It
is our duty to help protect the inde-
pendence of the judiciary. But over and
over, we are seeing that President
Trump is selecting nominees precisely
because they will bring an ideological
agenda to the bench.
This will be seen as we soon consider
the nomination of Neomi Rao to the
DC Circuit Court. Ms. Rao is a prime
example of how the administration is
working to politicize our Federal
courts to achieve far-right policy ob-
jectives that do not sit in the main-
stream of America. The examples of
this are not just rhetoric; the examples
of this are clear.
The DC Circuit Court often gets the
last word on legal challenges to impor-
tant regulatory protections. Who is the
person the President has chosen to sit
on this court? Ms. Rao has dedicated
much of her career as a law professor
and as a Trump administration regu-
latory czar to tearing away critical
protections for American citizens.
During her time in the Trump admin-
istration, Ms. Rao has overseen efforts
to roll back an array of Federal protec-
tions, from fair housing to clean air
and water, from women’s rights to
LGBTQ rights, from food safety to
workers’ rights, to so many areas that
impact Americans of all backgrounds
and all aspects of American life. She
has also criticized landmark decisions
by the Supreme Court. Other Trump
nominees have not gone as far as she
has. She literally criticized Brown v.
Board of Education, Lawrence v. Texas,
and Roe v. Wade.
Worse still, Ms. Rao has been unwill-
ing to make the firm commitment to
recuse herself from legal challenges to
regulations that her office reviewed
while she was a Trump administration
regulatory czar. This is fundamental to
the independence of our judiciary.
If you compare her position to others
within the Trump administration, you
will see that other judicial nominees,
including President Trump’s prior
nominee to the DC Circuit, have
pledged to recuse themselves from
matters they worked on in the execu-
tive branch, but Ms. Rao is refusing to
do the same.
Given her long track record of oppos-
ing critical Federal protections, the se-
rious concerns about independence and
recusal, Ms. Rao is the wrong person to
sit on the DC Circuit Court, and I urge
my colleagues to vote no on the nomi-
nation as well.
Most importantly, I urge my col-
leagues—all of my colleagues, Demo-
crats and Republicans—who do not
want to be rendered irrelevant in the
selection of judges from their States to

ate.
I thank you for the time.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this
week, the Senate will continue to fill
vacancies across the Federal bench.
This afternoon, we will vote to con-
firm Paul Matey to be U.S. Circuit
Court Judge for the Third Circuit, and
then we will move to the nomination of
Neomi Rao for a seat on the DC Circuit
Court of Appeals—the seat that was va-
cated by Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Throughout her career, Ms. Rao has
served in all three branches of govern-
ment. She clerked for Justice Clarence
Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court and
Judge Harvie Wilkinson on the Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals. She also
worked here in the Senate on the Judi-
ciary Committee for then-Chairman
Orrin Hatch.
She has worked as Associate Counsel
and Special Assistant to President
George W. Bush and in her current po-
sition as Administrator for the Office
of Administration and Regulatory Af-
fairs—one of the most important and
least understood Federal Agencies.
In addition to her outstanding career
in public service, Ms. Rao was also an
associate professor at the Antonin
Scalia Law School at George Mason
University and is a leading scholar in
the field of administrative law.
Knowing her impressive background,
it was no surprise to see that the
American Bar Association, once hailed
by the minority leader as the ‘‘gold
standard by which judicial candidates
are judged,’’ rated her as ‘‘well quali-
fied.’’
When considering this particular
seat, it is hard to imagine anyone bet-
ter prepared. The DC Circuit Court of
Appeals has sometimes been referred to
as the ‘‘second highest court in the
land’’ and is unique because its case-
load is disproportionately weighted to-
ward administrative law and litigation
involving the Federal Government.
Despite her outstanding qualifica-
tions, our Democratic colleagues have
attempted to tank Ms. Rao’s nomina-
tion over decades-old writings. That
sounds pretty familiar, although, as I
recall, Justice Kavanaugh was excori-
ated for things in his high school year-
book. At least we have moved on to
college when it comes to Ms. Rao.
During her confirmation hearing last
month, critics reverted back to that
Kavanaugh playbook and began criti-
cizing her for things she wrote in col-
lege rather than asking her productive
questions about maybe what she has
learned since that time or how her
views may have changed or how she
has functioned as head of the OIRA or
how her office has reduced regulatory
costs by more than $23 billion. Instead,
critics chose to focus on her decades-
old writings in college.
Over the years, Ms. Rao has done
what we have all done: She has grown
and learned from her experiences. She
has repeatedly said that she no longer
holds the views that she wrote about
back in college.
I believe we should judge a nominee
not by views they expressed in high
school or college but what they have
done since that time as mature adults
and professionals. So just add me to
the long list of people who believe
Neomi Rao should be confirmed for the
DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Two dozen former Supreme Court
clerks who worked alongside Rao sent
a letter to the Judiciary Committee,
touting her qualifications. They said:
Many of us have worked in government, at
both the federal and state levels, some for
Democrats and some for Republicans. . . .
While our professional and personal paths
may have diverged, one of things we have al-
ways shared is admiration for Neomi. We are
confident she will serve our country well on
the DC Circuit.
We have seen similar letters from her
classmates at both Yale and the Uni-
versity of Chicago Law School, as well
as a group of more than 50 of her
former law students.
Her former students wrote:
Our views span the political spectrum; we
have differing positions on the role and work
of the Federal judiciary; and we have gone
on to work in law firms, government, public
interest organizations, and judges’ chambers.
Yet despite her differences, we all agree that
Professor Rao would make an outstanding
addition to the bench. We have no doubt
that, if confirmed, she would be a brilliant
and fair arbiter of the cases that came before
her.
I agree.
I supported Ms. Rao’s nomination in
the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I
will once again look forward to sup-
porting her nomination when the full
Senate votes on her nomination this
week.
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
Mr. President, on another matter,
this Saturday will mark the 268th
birthday of James Madison, the Father
of the Constitution and an ardent advo-
cate for open government.
It is no coincidence that near his
birthday each year, we also celebrate
something called Sunshine Week—a
time to promote transparency in gov-
ernment and access to public informa-
tion.
I have always been proud of the fact
that Texas is known for having one of
the strongest and most robust freedom
of information laws in the country. As
attorney general of Texas for 4 years,
it was my privilege to enforce those
laws.
We strive to maintain an open and
honest government. Not only does it
keep citizens in the know, it also helps
keep government accountable.
As we all know, Justice Brandeis fa-
mously said: ‘‘Sunlight is said to be the
best of disinfectants.’’ When I came to
Washington, I wanted to bring that
same Texas sunshine to the national
level.
During my time in the Senate, I have
made government transparency a pri-
ority, and I have pressed for more
openness in the Federal Government
through commonsense legislation.
Over the last decade-plus, my closest
ally in that effort has been my friend
and colleague from Vermont, Senator
PAT LEAHY. Some people consider us to
be the odd couple when it comes to this
topic because Senator LEAHY is on the
other end of the political spectrum.
As a conservative, I think if people
act in government as if their actions
are going to be known and available to
the people they work for—the tax-
payers—it really changes their behav-
ior. It doesn’t require Congress or the
government to pass more regulation or
more laws to get them to do what they
know they should do if they knew that
what they were doing was going to be
made public; hence, my support for the
Freedom of Information Act and public
information law.
Senator LEAHY and I have worked so
well together because we understand
that this is not a Republican or Demo-
cratic issue. We both recognize that
whether it is a Republican administra-
tion or a Democratic administration,
everyone wants to trumpet their suc-
cesses and hide their failures. That is
just human nature. But in order for our
government to run well and the Amer-
ican people to trust that it is running
well, we need transparency and the ac-
countability that goes along with it.
Safeguarding our right to public in-
formation is the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act, or FOIA. FOIA serves not as
a weapon but as a shield, protecting
the American people from a govern-
ment that may seek to abuse its power
or conceal fraud and abuse.
In the more than 50 years since FOIA
was first enacted, we have seen a tug of
war taking place in both Republican
and Democratic administrations, with
some favoring more openness and oth-
ers favoring less. That is why it is so
important that we fight here in the
Senate to ensure that the balance
doesn’t tilt away from transparency.
This is a great opportunity both to
reflect on the important steps we have
taken in the past and to recommit our-
selves to the ongoing important work
that we still need to do.
I believe the most significant legisla-
tion Senator LEAHY and I shepherded
during our work together is the FOIA
Improvement Act, which became law in
2016. It required government Agencies
to operate under a presumption of
openness when considering whether to
release government information.
It also aimed to reduce the overuse of
exemptions to withhold information
from the public and to minimize the
bureaucracy in the FOIA request proc-
ess by requiring the creation of a single

portal through which individuals can
submit a request to any Agency.
On top of that, that legislation re-
quired Agencies to proactively disclose
documents that are likely to be of pub-
lic interest in order to increase access
to government documents outside the
often bureaucratic and onerous FOIA
request process. In other words, we
built upon the work of our Founding
Fathers and what they recognized hun-
dreds of years ago: A truly self-gov-
erning people depends upon an in-
formed citizenry to hold their elected
leaders accountable.
While that was a big step in improv-
ing government accountability, our
work, of course, is not done. I continue
to look for new opportunities to im-
prove the Freedom of Information Act
process and to ensure that it remains
robust and workable for all of our citi-
zens.
I will continue to advocate for poli-
cies in the Senate that build on a more
transparent government and bring
more of that Texas sunshine to Wash-
ington, DC. I hope this Sunshine Week
we can all grow even more committed
to the mission of open and honest gov-
ernment that serves its people and not
itself.

TRIBUTE TO SAM MAMET
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, today
I rise to recognize a great citizen of the
State of Colorado and a dear friend of
mine, Sam Mamet. Sam is retiring at
the end of March after 40 years of
working with the Colorado Municipal
League. CML is an organization that is
dedicated to representing the best in-
terests of cities and towns throughout
the State of Colorado.
In 1979, shortly after receiving a mas-
ter’s in public administration from the
University of Colorado at Boulder, Sam
began his tenure at CML. For 26 years,
he worked diligently to make sure that
local communities had the proper tools
to better serve themselves.
In 2005 he was appointed executive di-
rector of the organization. From this
unique position, Sam was at the fore-
front of developing the organization’s
policies and executing vital programs
with the overarching purpose of help-
ing those who oversee communities be-
come more effective leaders. It is clear
to the people of Colorado that Sam has
excelled in this position from day one.
It is unlikely you will find someone
in Colorado government or politics who
doesn’t know Sam or hasn’t worked
with Sam, and there is no shortage of
recognition for the incredible work he
has done. If you need proof, you can
look through the abundance of awards
he has received, including a lifetime
achievement award from the Colorado
City & County Management Associa-
tion earlier this year. It is also not sur-
prising that Sam has his own day, Sam
Mamet Day, on February 4, which was
dedicated by the city of Greenwood Vil-
lage as a thank-you for his years of sin-
cere dedication to them. These are just
a few of the many examples of appre-
ciation that showcase the passion and
zeal Sam has for the cities and commu-
nities across our great State.
I can’t stress enough how Colorado
communities have benefited and how
the State of Colorado has benefited
from the work of Sam Mamet. His
years of persistence and dedication in
his work have had a tremendous and
monumental impact. His work tran-
scends beyond partisanship, and I
think that is the most important thing
to talk about. When you see Sam
Mamet, you don’t think of left or right
or red or blue. You see nonpartisanship
in the work he does.
He cautions leaders to avoid demean-
ing an issue or individual on the other
side, something so important in to-
day’s political environment, and to
focus more on cultivating policies that
will simply benefit each and every
community based on the specific needs
and requirements of the people. We
need more leaders like Sam.
Sam has long believed public service
is the highest calling. He recognizes
the gravity the position holds and why
it is so important that public servants
are given the tools necessary to better
the streets and neighborhoods and
communities they belong to. This is
what each and every citizen expects of
their leaders and what he has dedicated
his life to accomplish.
‘‘Empowered Cities and Towns,
United for a Strong Colorado,’’ is
CML’s vision statement, and Sam is
the embodiment of these words. Each
and every day he worked to give the
cities and towns around him the tools
and knowledge to empower them, and
for 40 years he helped to unite a strong-
er Colorado. While CML and the local
municipalities they serve will be losing
an exceptional, talented, and impas-
sioned civil servant, I have every con-
fidence Sam will continue to better the
lives of the people of Colorado in his
work going forward.
On a personal note, there are many
times when Sam and I were on the
same side of an issue and were able to
work together and accomplish great
things. There were also times when
Sam and I were on opposite sides of an
issue, and some of my most glorious
defeats were at the hands of Sam
Mamet. As legislation went down in
flames of glory, thanks to work he was
able to lead, I never took it personally
because Sam Mamet never took it per-
sonally. I remember meeting Sam
through my father and his work on the
city council years ago. When a leader
like Sam steps down, he will be missed.
He has big shoes to fill, but I know
Kevin Bommer, the next executive di-
rector, will do an outstanding job.
I know we all wish for Sam to stay
involved in his next endeavors that will
continue to benefit our great people of
Colorado. Thank you.
With that, I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 94
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, the
entire Senate Democratic caucus and I
are introducing a resolution that sim-
ply asks the Department of Justice to
do what it is supposed to do—defend
the duly enacted laws of this country.
This resolution shouldn’t be nec-
essary, but last year, as 19 States
joined Texas in challenging the con-
stitutionality of the Affordable Care
Act, Attorney General Jeff Sessions re-
fused to defend the ACA in court and,
in fact, filed a brief arguing that sev-
eral vital protections of the law should
be ruled unconstitutional, including
protections for Americans living with
preexisting conditions.
In making his decision not to defend
a duly enacted law, Jeff Sessions him-
self acknowledged that he was going
against a ‘‘longstanding tradition of
defending the constitutionality of duly
enacted statutes if reasonable argu-
ments can be made in their defense.’’
Guess what. There are many reason-
able arguments for the ACA. Even con-
servative lawyers who previously ar-
gued against the ACA agree. One attor-
ney filed an amicus brief in opposition
to the Department of Justice’s position
calling it ‘‘dangerous,’’ ‘‘beyond the
pale,’’ and ‘‘effectively [usurping] legis-
lative power.’’
The Justice Department lawyer who
authored the brief opposing the ACA,
Chad Readler, was just rewarded with a
confirmation to a lifetime position to
the Sixth Circuit. In fact, Mr. Readler’s
circuit court nomination came on the
exact same day that he filed the brief
on behalf of the Department of Justice.
Talk about yet another Trump nomi-
nee who auditioned for his position.
The Justice Department’s actions
were blatantly political and had a spe-
cific outcome in mind: accomplishing
through the courts what Republicans
have tried and failed to achieve
through the legislative process; that is,
repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Three career attorneys at the De-
partment of Justice withdrew from the
case in protest of their Department’s
failing to defend the ACA.
In December, a Federal court in
Texas sided with the Trump adminis-
tration, Texas, and 19 other States in
declaring the entirety of the ACA un-
constitutional. Of course, this will be
appealed.
The Fifth Circuit—one of the most
conservative appellate courts in the
country—will hear the case next. The
case is destined for consideration by
the Supreme Court, wherein Trump-ap-
pointed Justices Gorsuch and
Kavanaugh will cast two deciding votes
on whether to uphold the ACA or cast
it aside. I shudder to think which way
they are likely to go.
The outcome of this case will have a
profound impact on virtually every
American, especially the 133 million
people living with preexisting condi-
tions.
This is not a game. Lives are at
stake. Without the ACA’s protections,
millions of Americans living with con-
ditions as common as diabetes, obesity,
heart disease, or cancer could be
charged exorbitant premiums or denied
insurance coverage altogether.
The stakes in this ongoing court bat-
tle are incredibly high. Our resolution
simply asks the Department of Justice
to do its job, defend the ACA as a duly
enacted act of Congress, and stand up
to protect Americans living with pre-
existing conditions.
Although many of my Republican
colleagues profess to support protec-
tions for those with preexisting condi-
tions, not a single one of them has
signed on to support this resolution.
Under new leadership, the Depart-
ment of Justice can do the right thing.
During his confirmation hearing, newly
confirmed Attorney General Bill Barr
indicated he was open to reassessing
DOJ’s decision to oppose the ACA in
court. We shall see.
With this resolution, my Democratic
colleagues and I urge him to reexamine
the Department’s position, consider
the monumental impact this case
would have on millions of Americans,
and stand up for the 133 million Ameri-
cans living with a preexisting condi-
tion.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent that the Judiciary Committee
be discharged from further consider-
ation of S. Res. 94 and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration;
further, that the resolution be agreed
to, the preamble be agreed to, and the
motions to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no

action is very consistent with the Re-
publican Party’s hostility to the ACA
and their belief that healthcare is a
privilege reserved only for those who
can afford it.
To recap, Republicans voted dozens
of times over the past 9 years to repeal
the ACA in its entirety. The Senate
came within one vote in July 2017 of re-
pealing the law—one vote.
The majority leader and my Repub-
lican colleagues from South Carolina
and Louisiana proposed—and came
close to passing—a bill that would have
gutted the ACA and cut hundreds of
billions of dollars from Medicaid.
As part of their huge tax cut for the
rich and corporations, Donald Trump
and congressional Republicans elimi-
nated the individual coverage require-
ment of ACA, driving up premiums
across the country.
So the assault on healthcare con-
tinues. The American people are pay-
ing attention, and Republicans will be
held accountable.
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
come to the floor today to ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed
to the consideration of the Senate Res-
olution that is at the desk, expressing
the sense of the Senate that efforts to
create a one-size-fits-all government-
run healthcare system referred to as
‘‘Medicare for All’’ should be rejected.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent that the resolution be agreed
to, the preamble be agreed to, and the
motions to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no
intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii.
Ms. HIRONO. Reserving the right to
object, this resolution is a cynical at-
tempt to divide Democrats where no di-
vision exists. The Democratic Party is
united behind the principle that
healthcare should be affordable and ac-
cessible to all. As far as I am con-
cerned, healthcare is a right, not a
privilege reserved for those who can af-
ford it.
Medicare for All is one way to get to
universal healthcare that is affordable
for everyone, but it is not the only
way. While Democrats are working to
build on the success of the Affordable
Care Act to cover even more Ameri-
cans, Senate Republicans have tried
time and again to eliminate coverage
for tens of millions of Americans. This
is particularly evident in the Presi-
dent’s budget—a budget that would
make over $2 trillion in cuts to Medi-
care and Medicaid, programs that pro-
vide healthcare coverage to one out of
every three people in our country.
I call on my Republican colleagues to
join us to improve the ACA and expand
coverage to more Americans rather
than trying to repeal the Affordable
Care Act time after time.
It is unfortunate that my colleagues
would rather offer this distraction than
acknowledge that millions of Ameri-
cans rely on Medicare, Medicaid, and
the ACA for healthcare. In offering this
resolution, Republicans continue to do
nothing except propose cuts to all
three critical programs.
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
would just point out that what my
friend and colleague from Hawaii de-
scribed as a distraction is one of the
key points of the Democratic Party.
Medicare for All, as they call it, is
part of the so-called Green New Deal,
which would bankrupt the country,
which is unaffordable, unworkable. The
fact is, this Medicare for All proposal,
which so many of the Democrats have
signed on to, would cost a minimum of
$33 trillion and maybe a lot higher
after what we have heard from the
Presidential candidate, BERNIE SAND-
ERS, as to the things he wants to do
going beyond just Medicare for All.
We know that taxes would increase
significantly under their proposal. We
know that for Americans who have
health insurance right now through
their work, over 150 million Americans
would lose that. We know that for peo-
ple on Medicare, it would make their
ability to use Medicare much harder.
Then, of course, there would be the
issue of rationing for care—the lines
and the time to wait.
There was an article in the New York
Times, an opinion piece by David
Brooks, on Friday, talking about why
the so-called Medicare for All will not
work, and it made reference to
healthcare in Canada.
I would say to the Presiding Officer
that as a Senator who is also a sur-
geon, I operated on people from Canada
in my practice prior to becoming a U.S.
Senator and while practicing in Wyo-
ming. People in Canada—where the
healthcare is paid for by taxes but is
free—I have taken care of people who
couldn’t afford to wait the amount of
time it would take to get their free op-
eration.
The article in the New York Times
on Friday made reference to the fact
that the waiting times are so long that
after you are actually seen by the pri-
mary care provider in Canada, the wait
time to get to see an orthopedic sur-
geon is 9 months—9 months. The
Democrats are proposing something
that has given the people of Canada a
waiting time of 9 months.
So what we see under this Medicare
for All proposal—and I have just intro-
duced today this Senate resolution say-
ing that Medicare for All should be re-
jected, and there should also be a rejec-
tion of the tax increases, the loss of
choice, and the long lines that will
come from this Democrat-sponsored
proposal for Medicare for All.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii.
Ms. HIRONO. Very briefly, I simply
want to ask my Republican colleagues
whether they believe that healthcare
should be accessible and affordable for
all. Apparently, they do not, because
they have offered absolutely nothing to
make sure healthcare is accessible and
affordable for all.
In fact, in their continuing efforts to
sabotage the Affordable Care Act and,
in fact, eliminate the Affordable Care
Act, they would rather have a
healthcare system where millions of
Americans are without healthcare at
all.
I yield the floor.

ator from Maryland.
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH AND THE EQUAL
RIGHTS AMENDMENT
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this
month we celebrate the storied history
of incredible women in our country. We
recognize the sacrifices made and the
battles fought to ensure a future where
our daughters and granddaughters are
born into a world of equality and limit-
less opportunity.
Throughout Women’s History Month,
we mark the historic strides women
have taken to advance our culture, our
sciences, our States, and our Nation.
As we recognize these achievements,
we must also assess and advocate for
the work still to be done, including the
ratification of the Equal Rights
Amendment, the ERA. Ratifying the
ERA would be a major milestone on
the road to equality. Not only would
ratification enshrine equal rights for
women in the Constitution, it would
also honor all of those who have fought
for justice along the way.
One such inspiring woman is civil
rights activist Juanita Jackson Mitch-
ell. A Baltimore native, Mrs. Mitchell
fought to end legally sanctioned seg-
regation in her community while she
simultaneously reached out to young
people and mobilized them into civic
engagement. After she received her law
degree from the University of Mary-
land, she was the first African-Amer-
ican woman to practice law in our
State, and she worked tirelessly on a
number of cases to provide more job
opportunities for African Americans.
As the President of the NAACP in Bal-
timore, she advocated for integration
and later convinced the city to hire
Black social workers, librarians, and
police officers, which bolstered the
community by helping to bring an end
to long-held systemic prejudices.
As a community activist and cham-
pion of women’s rights, Mrs. Mitchell
exhibited true bravery in her engage-
ment with her community. She fear-
lessly paved the way for other women
to join the movement. She worked with
the Kennedy and Johnson administra-
tions to find solutions for systemic so-
cial and educational discrepancies in
communities of color. Mrs. Mitchell

understood the importance of rep-
resentative democracy and of empow-
ering those who could make differences
in their communities. Juanita Mitchell
is a shining example of why a constitu-
tional amendment to guarantee wom-
en’s rights is long overdue.
The ERA, which Congress approved
in 1972, guarantees equal protection
under the law regardless of one’s sex.
At that time, Congress imposed a 7-
year deadline—later extended to 10
years—for the States to act. By the
time this artificial deadline expired in
1982, 35 States had approved the Equal
Rights Amendment—three short of the
38 States necessary to add it to the
Constitution. Since then, two more
States have approved the amendment,
which leaves us just one State shy of
reaching the goal. Congress must act
to authorize additional time for the re-
maining States to consider the amend-
ment.
Earlier this year, I and the senior
Senator from Alaska, Ms. MURKOWSKI,
introduced a bipartisan Senate resolu-
tion, S.J. Res. 6, to reopen consider-
ation of the ERA. It may come as a
shock to many that in a country to
which the world looks as being an ex-
ample of liberty and justice, our Con-
stitution does not guarantee women
the same rights and protections as
men. That is why this bipartisan reso-
lution is imperative as we urge Con-
gress and the remaining States to fin-
ish what we started nearly 50 years ago
to ensure equality under the law for all
women.
In the early 20th century, women
were disenfranchised and had little or
no legal, financial, or social opportuni-
ties to pursue. Property ownership,
jobs, and economic equality were privi-
leges women did not have. Today, a
century later, more women have en-
tered the workforce than ever before.
Women are filling leadership roles at
unprecedented levels, and we are fi-
nally on the verge of ratifying the
ERA. This change has boosted our
economy, strengthened our families,
and brought our society to new heights
of innovation, enlightenment, and op-
portunity. We see that change is not
only possible, it is essential to real-
izing our greatest potential as a na-
tion.
While ratifying the Equal Rights
Amendment is critical to giving
women in our country the rights they
deserve, it is not, in and of itself,
enough. I will continue to fight for the
ERA but also for women’s economic op-
portunities and reproductive rights.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NOMINATION OF NEOMI J. RAO
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, there are many reasons to care
about our Federal judiciary. It touches
all of us in our everyday lives even
though we often fail to appreciate its
enormous impact. No court of appeals
in the United States is more important
than the DC Circuit, and so few of the
nominees whom we will consider in
this body will be more important than
Neomi Rao to the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the DC Circuit.
It has a unique jurisdiction that
makes it the court to most frequently
hear challenges to the Federal Govern-
ment’s public protections. It considers
issues of national consequence, ranging
from workers’ rights, nondiscrimina-
tion policies, consumer protections,
immigration policies, money in poli-
tics, reproductive rights, access to
healthcare, environmental justice,
antitrust cases, and regulatory action,
like the possible grounding of an un-
safe airplane by the FAA.
I have called on the FAA to ground
the 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9. I have asked
the airlines to do it voluntarily. If the
FAA does the right thing, as it should,
and orders these planes grounded, its
decision may be challenged in the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit,
and the safety of our skies and our air-
line passengers will hang in the bal-
ance. This is just one example of how
the DC Circuit can matter not only to
the lives of people within a particular
geographic area but to, literally, the
entire United States.
When I ask nominees questions that
are designed to elicit their views, their
opinions, their past positions, and their
present policies, I expect direct, candid
answers, but I received just the oppo-
site from Neomi Rao on some of the
critical, bedrock issues that are impor-
tant to all of us in this Chamber when
judging a nominee.
I asked Neomi Rao whether she
thought Brown v. Board of Education—
a pillar of our jurisprudence—was cor-
rectly decided. She declined to answer.
She said she felt it was inappropriate
for a nominee to the court to be giving
views on specific cases. I asked her for
her views and her position on that
case. She declined to give them. She
also declined to give them on Roe v.
Wade and on Griswold v. Connecticut.
One of my Republican colleagues on
the Judiciary Committee also has res-
ervations about Neomi Rao’s opinions
in some of these cases. He fears that
Ms. Rao actually supports a woman’s
right to choose and supports the legal
doctrine of substantive due process.
Unlike me, he met Ms. Rao in private,
and he got straightforward answers
about her views on those cases and on
the underlying legal theories. She
passed his test, the President’s litmus
test, and the test of those outside
groups—extreme rightwing, conserv-
ative groups—that have been given au-
thority as a result of the President’s
outsourcing of these decisions to, in ef-
fect, decide on the nominees to our
highest Court.
She passed the test established by
the President—that he would appoint
judges who would overturn Roe v.
Wade.
But as abhorrent and objectionable
as I find many of her views and her
failure to give straightforward an-
swers, she has also written a number of
very troubling articles and op-eds
about her views on women’s rights and
women’s healthcare. We have in this
Chamber a term called ‘‘confirmation
conversion,’’ and I thought Ms. Rao
would completely disavow and abandon
those pieces.
In an op-ed about date rape, she
wrote: ‘‘If [a woman] drinks to the
point where she can no longer choose,
well, getting to that point was part of
her choice.’’ In another op-ed criti-
cizing aspects of feminism, Rao wrote
that women ‘‘must be thoroughly edu-
cated about the consequences of their
sexuality in order to prevent such
problems’’ as date rape. From early in
her career, these writings indicate that
she believes women bear a major part
of responsibility for date rape.
These writings are from early in her
career, and I thought she would com-
pletely break with them and reject
them, but she failed to do so. Only
after the hearing did she disavow them,
without directly apologizing, and that
kind of confirmation conversion is in-
herently unbelievable.
Undermining her credibility even
more are the actions she took later in
her career—after those writings and be-
fore she was nominated.
She serves as the head of the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs,
also known as OIRA. Her job is to re-
view all regulatory actions—all of
them—proposed by the administration.
In that capacity, Ms. Rao approved re-
scinding guidance provided to schools
on how to address and prevent campus
sexual assault. Under the new rules,
sexual assault survivors would be re-
quired to undergo live cross-examina-
tion by their attacker’s representative.
In the course of an administrative pro-
ceeding, there would be cross-examina-
tion by the attacker’s lawyer or other
representative. Schools would be re-
quired to use a higher standard of proof
for claims of sexual misconduct.
Under this administration’s own
analysis, these rules would have a pro-
found, chilling effect on the number of
campus sexual assault investigations
that are conducted. That is the reason
they are proposing the new rules—to
discourage survivors from coming for-
ward to seek justice.
It is not only Rao’s early writings
that stigmatize and blame women sur-
vivors of sexual assault; the recent
policies she approved and authorized
institutionalize these really regret-
table and unacceptable views. Her
deeply troubling positions on sexual as-
sault and her victim-blaming rhet-
oric—which she tried to excuse ini-
tially as the reckless musings of a col-
lege student rather than breaking with
them and rejecting them—place the

rights of women and others at risk. We
should deny her confirmation.
Equally important, she has also used
that position at OIRA to restrict repro-
ductive rights.
Let’s be clear. One of the important
features of the Affordable Care Act is a
requirement that health insurers cover
contraceptives as an essential health
benefit—no charge to consumers be-
cause it is an essential health benefit.
Last year, the Trump administration
issued rules that would allow any and
all private companies to deny contra-
ception coverage if the CEO had a
moral or religious objection. Two Fed-
eral courts found that the rules were il-
legal because they violate the due
process clause—the legal process re-
quired by law to implement the new
rules—and that objection was found to
be an inadequate justification for, in
effect, violating the rights of women
who would seek that kind of care at no
charge. As the head of OIRA, Neomi
Rao not only approved of the substance
of the new rules but was so committed
to implementing them that she signed
off on an illegal process to do so.
That is not all Neomi Rao has done
to, in effect, discourage and deter re-
productive health. The Department of
Health and Human Services recently fi-
nalized a new title X regulation. Under
this rule, ‘‘Any organization that pro-
vides or refers patients for abortions is
ineligible for title X funding to cover
STD prevention, cancer screenings, and
contraception.’’ As with any rule,
OIRA had to conduct a cost-benefit
analysis in order to approve that rule,
and I am deeply troubled by Rao’s
views and actions on reproductive
rights that led her to approve that rule
and encouraged and condoned the rule
and its disastrous effects on women’s
rights and healthcare.
We are living in an era fraught with
abuses of power, under a President who
has shown nothing but disdain for the
rule of law. In this dark and dangerous
era, it is all the more important that
we have someone willing to set limits
on executive power to prevent an impe-
rial Presidency.
In fact, Ms. Rao is a proponent of a
fringe theory on executive power
known as the unitary executive theory.
She believes that the President, as the
head of the executive branch, holds ab-
solute control over executive power.
As recently as 2014, she outlined the
implications of this theory in the Ala-
bama Law Review. According to her,
the President must be able to remove
at his sole discretion all principal offi-
cers, including the heads of inde-
pendent Agencies.
She has criticized the Supreme
Court’s decision in Morrison v. Olson,
which upheld the independent counsel
statute in effect at that time. In her
view, the President must be able to fire
at will anyone in the executive branch.
In her view, that includes special pros-
ecutors tasked with investigating
wrongdoing by the President.
In 2016, she was interviewed on Hugh
Hewitt’s radio show. She was asked
whether she believes the current spe-
cial counsel regulations have similarly
restrictive effect on executive power
and whether the President can direct
the actions of the Attorney General or
Acting Attorney General. Her view?
The Constitution vests all executive
power in the President. He can direct
his subordinates. He can fire the spe-
cial counsel.
I hoped that during her confirmation
proceedings, she would disavow those
views. I asked her whether she thought
the President could fire Robert
Mueller, the current special counsel.
She refused to answer my question.
That extreme view of Presidential
power is deeply alarming when it is
held by a member of one of the most
important courts in the country, which
may review decisions of that special
counsel to subpoena the President or
potentially indict the President or
take other actions in the course of an
investigation.
I am more than alarmed; I am
strongly opposed to this nomination. I
hope my colleagues will join me in vot-
ing no on final confirmation.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I

S. 556
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
recently reintroduced the Account-
ability through Electronic Verification
Act this Congress, as I have in previous
Congresses. This commonsense bill
would require all employers to use E-
Verify programs, which in turn would
ensure that they are employing noth-
ing but a legal workforce.
As most Americans have realized, the
immigration debate here in the Con-
gress today—and for a long time—has
become highly partisan and obviously
has been controversial. Of course,
worst of all, it has become completely
unproductive.
I believe there is a sliver of hope,
however, and that is through the pas-
sage of an E-Verify program that
makes E-Verify mandatory.
Whether you are a Democrat or a Re-
publican, whether you are for open bor-
ders or you want secure borders, we all
ought to agree that enforcing the law
and protecting Americans is a bipar-
tisan goal.
In 1986, the Immigration Reform and
Control Act made it, for the first time,
a Federal crime to employ undocu-
mented workers. Ten years later, in
1996, Congress created a new tool to
verify employment eligibility known
as E-Verify.
Today, E-Verify is a voluntary pro-
gram that gives employers a web-based
tool to verify the identify and employ-
ment eligibility of new employees.
I have worked to renew and expand
the program for use in all 50 States and
to allow for information-sharing be-
tween Federal Agencies, including the
Department of Homeland Security.
Participating employers then tap
into a user-friendly, free electronic
system that cross-matches documents
provided by employees on their I–9
forms with Federal records available to
show the U.S. Citizenship and Immi-
gration Services, the Social Security
Administration, and the Department of
Homeland Security. So the records of a
worker applying for a job can be com-
pared with government records to
know whether somebody is legally in
the country.
Today E-Verify provides instant veri-
fication for more than 750,000 employ-
ers and businesses all across America.
In fact, my Senate office uses E-Verify
when hiring employees whom the tax-
payers pay for, but I am responsible for
their employment. My Senate office
uses E-Verify when hiring our staff,
and I have found it to be quick and
easy to use.
At my annual 99 county meetings
that I have throughout Iowa, I regu-
larly hear about the growing economy,
rising wages, and the vitality on Main
Streets. Iowa now ranks first in the
Nation for the lowest level of unem-
ployment. That also means there are
growing challenges for employers in
my State to hire the workforce needed
to grow and expand. I will bet a lot of
my colleagues hear that in their re-
spective States as well.
We need to make sure hiring prac-
tices don’t harm U.S. workers or those
authorized to work in the United
States. That is why I reintroduced the
bill I announced in the first words of
my speech today, the accountability
through electronic verification bill.
This legislation will help businesses
comply with immigration laws by cer-
tifying the legal status of their work-
force. The bill will permanently au-
thorize the E-Verify Program, and re-
quire employers to use the program to
determine workers’ eligibility. It
would then make every employer have
to use it, except as contrasted for the
last couple of decades on a voluntary
basis.
For decades, E-Verify has served as a
proven tool for employers that want to
use it. It has helped to reduce incen-
tives for illegal immigration and safe-
guard job opportunities for Americans
and other legal workers. Expanding the
system to every workplace will im-
prove accountability for all businesses
and take another very important step
toward putting American workers first.
Current law requires all contractors
doing work for the Federal Govern-
ment to use E-Verify, repeating for a
third time now the mandatory aspect
of this compared to the voluntary as-
pect of the present law.
States that have passed laws man-
dating the use of E-Verify also may re-
quire employers to participate, for ex-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1781
March 12, 2019
across the country, and with Iowa lead-
ing the way, policymakers have a re-
sponsibility to ensure the growing
economy has the workforce it needs to
continue to do the growth of the last
few years.
As the former chairman of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, I worked ex-
tensively to protect the integrity of
employment visas and work permits
for foreign workers. A top priority
must be to ensure immigration policies
aren’t displacing American workers or
depressing wages.
Making E-Verify a permanent and
mandatory requirement for all U.S.
employers will bring across-the-board
certainty to hiring practices through-
out our country. Certifying the legal
status for prospective hires makes
common sense, and having in place the
tools at one’s fingertips makes it a
simple, convenient solution.
E-Verify is a proven tool to encour-
age legal immigrants to apply for un-
filled jobs and to deter illegal immigra-
tion and human trafficking.
In addition to making E-Verify per-
manent and mandatory within 1 year
of enactment, my bill will increase
penalties for employers who illegally
hire workers unauthorized to work in
our country. The bill will also require
employers to check the status of all
current employees within 1 year using
the E-Verify system and terminate em-
ployment of those found unauthorized
to work in the United States.
This bill establishes a demonstration
project in rural areas without internet
capabilities to assist small businesses.
Finally, the bill will require the So-
cial Security Administration to im-
prove its efforts to detect identity
theft using Social Security numbers.
Expanding E-Verify will help restore
integrity and trust in our Nation’s im-
migration system by curbing incen-
tives for hiring persons unauthorized
to work in America.
I was pleased to hear my colleague,
now-Chairman GRAHAM of the Judici-
ary Committee, highlight the benefits
of E-Verify in a Judiciary Committee
hearing held last week. He is right. Na-
tionwide E-Verify would go a long way
to relieve concerns about illegal immi-
gration and workforce displacement.
Let me repeat. This bill will not
change immigration law. All it does is
ensure that businesses are complying
with existing Federal law through a
quick, cost-efficient, and proven online
method of proving that people are le-
gally in the country and legally able to
work here.
It is a simple first step toward tack-
ling larger issues within immigration;
in other words, bringing credibility to
our immigration system where credi-
bility has been lost because for the last
20 or 25 years, we in Congress have been
telling the American people we are
going to control the border and people
can only come here legally, and we
haven’t done it.
We have to do things to build up
credibility if we are going to deal with
issues like what do you do about the 10
or 11 million people who are unauthor-
ized to live and unauthorized to work
in America.
Some people say: Well, you are going
to load them up and get them out of
the country, but that isn’t realistic,
and it wouldn’t be humanitarian. To
deal with that issue, we have to have
credibility for the whole immigration
system, and E-Verify will help that,
along with everything we are doing to
control the borders, and we have to do
more to control the borders.
Again, to repeat, this is a simple first
step to tackling larger issues within
immigration. Best of all, it has the
support of the American people.
A recent Zogby poll showed that
mandatory E-Verify enjoys widespread
support from voters. Seventy-four per-
cent of all voters polled support man-
datory E-Verify. In fact, the support is
very bipartisan. The poll showed that
roughly 55 percent of Democrats, 78
percent of Independents, and nearly 91
percent of Republicans support the idea
of E-Verify.
Support for Nationwide E-Verify
isn’t just nonpartisan, it is supported
by Americans across all ethnic bound-
aries. Fifty-eight percent of Hispanic
voters, 52 percent of Black voters, and
74 percent of Asian voters polled all
support E-Verify.
I will close with this. Perhaps it is
time that Congress and both parties
take a very deep breath and listen to
the American people instead of to our
own echo chambers.
Before we discuss expanding guest
worker programs or discuss com-
prehensive immigration reform, let’s
first codify E-Verify and restore the
American people’s trust in our immi-
gration system.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

SIDY). Without objection, it is so or-

MILITARY WIDOW’S TAX ELIMINATION BILL
Mr. JONES. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent.
Mr. President, I rise today to talk
about something that, quite frankly, I
find to be completely abhorrent, and
that is the short-changing of our Na-
tion’s military widows when it comes
to survivor benefits they paid for and
earned. It is something that I was dis-
mayed to learn is happening to some
65,000 surviving spouses of American
military servicemembers—including
more than 2,000 Alabamians—who were
killed in action or died as a result of
service-connected causes.
After suffering the loss of a loved
one, military widows and their families
can find themselves unexpectedly los-
ing out on vital survivor benefits they
had planned to receive in these tragic
circumstances. That is because, under
current law, surviving spouses are enti-
tled to receive VA dependency and in-
demnity compensation benefits, or
what is known as DIC.
Some families go a step further. Like
many families in the private sector,
many go a step further by voluntarily
paying into the Defense Department’s
Survivor Benefits Plan, which acts like
an additional life insurance policy.
Again, they are entitled to the DIC
benefits, but they pay for additional
coverage should there be a tragic acci-
dent or tragic death, which acts like an
additional life insurance policy. That
policy is something these families vol-
untarily pay into, and like any other
life insurance plan you or I might buy,
they expect to get the benefits they
have paid for.
For those who are entitled to receive
these benefits from both programs,
they are subject to what has been
known as the widow’s tax. Again, this
is only for those folks who are getting
benefits from both programs—the DIC
and the survivor’s benefit programs.
That is because our law prohibits wid-
ows from receiving their full benefits
from both programs. That is the wid-
ow’s tax. Instead, their SBP annuity is
prorated because their DIC payment is
subtracted from it. They don’t get the
full benefit of both programs when one
gets subtracted from the other.
Simply put, it is really a way for the
Federal Government to save a few
bucks by simply ripping off military
widows whose family paid extra to re-
ceive these additional benefits. They
voluntarily paid extra to receive these
benefits.
This isn’t just a problem facing Ac-
tive-Duty families. It is far bigger,
folks, because it impacts anyone who
has a service-connected death.
To put that in context, in Alabama
alone, there are over 60,000 Department
of Defense retirees whose families
could be impacted by the widow’s tax if
the veteran were to pass from a serv-
ice-connected cause.
Now, I understand that we have to be
careful stewards of taxpayer dollars. I
am fully aware of that. But give me a
break when it comes to military
spouses and widows. This is a benefit
that families paid for out of their own
pockets. If they are not getting the
money, then, it begs the question: Who
is?
No surviving spouse should be faced
with this kind of unexpected and com-
pletely unfair cut to the benefits they
ought to be able to count on in these
heartbreaking circumstances.
No surviving spouse should have to
fight for what their families are owed—
in the wake of family tragedy, no less.
Again, this is what they are owed. This
is the thing they have paid for in more
ways than one.
No surviving spouse should have to
mount a massive lobbying effort in the
Capitol of the United States, of this
great country, to get folks to under-
stand that this is wrong and we need to

fix it. Every year, there is a campaign
to fix this program. Yet, it doesn’t get
done.
Instead, these families should be fo-
cusing on helping their families begin
to heal and find strength. They should
be given the space and time to breathe.
It is an absolute shame that this is
even a problem we need to address.
That is why I have introduced bipar-
tisan legislation with several of my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle—
Senators COLLINS, TESTER, CRAPO, and
31 others—to repeal the law that pre-
vents these families from receiving
their just due.
The Military Widows Tax Elimi-
nation Act of 2019 reflects our belief
that people who put their lives on the
line for our country deserve to know
their families will be taken care of if
something, God forbid, ever happens to
them.
Our bill has support from the Gold
Star Wives of America, the VFW, the
Military Officers Association of Amer-
ica, the National Military Family As-
sociation, the Tragedy Assistance Pro-
gram for Survivors, and so many oth-
ers. In fact, some of the most dedicated
activists from the Gold Star Wives are
watching today from the Gallery right
now, including Crystal Wenum, Harriet
Boyden, and Donna Eldridge. I thank
them all for their leadership and for
their continued contributions to our
country.
This legislation has been introduced
in previous sessions of Congress, but it
has yet to pass—in large part because
of concerns about the cost. As I said,
while I certainly understand that there
is going to be a cost associated with
this, we are talking about a benefits
plan that these families paid for on
their own accord. It is their money
that went into this fund, not taxpayer
money and not money that is appro-
priated every year. It is their money,
and they deserve to get it back.
I think we can all agree that ending
the widow’s tax is the right thing to do
for our military families. Why don’t we
finally get it done in this, the 116th
Congress? Let’s show our troops and
their families that we support them
not just in word but in deed. Let’s show
these surviving spouses and their chil-
dren that we stand with them long
after their loved ones have made the
ultimate sacrifice for this country and
long after we know that they, too, have
made a sacrifice in the name of this
country. Let’s right this wrong and fi-
nally pass the Military Widows Tax
Elimination Act.
I urge my colleagues to do the right
thing. It is never ever too late to do it.
Even though this has been tried before,
it is never ever too late to do the right
thing and support this bill.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask

CHINA
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President,
China is no doubt a Communist coun-
try. It also has the largest population
on Earth, which means it has the larg-
est consumer market on Earth. It is a
growing economy, although it has had
a significant slowdown in the previous
couple of years. It is a $400 billion mar-
ket for the United States currently, in
our trade, and it is a significant place
of trade when dealing with agriculture
in particular.
We have a lot of issues and dif-
ferences with China, but we should be
able to work out those differences long
term, as we do with every other nation.
We have to resolve some of these
things.
I am proud that the administration is
full force taking on the issue of China.
Over the past couple of decades, every
administration has tried to work out
some kind of ongoing conversation
with China on trade, and all of them
have been somewhat successful, but
significant issues are still prevailing.
This administration has had a singular
focus on trade in dealing with China
and trying to resolve those issues with
them, and I hope it is successful long
term. I hope that we will be very spe-
cific in how we actually handle that
strategy and that at the end of it, we
will still be openly trading and reduc-
ing some of those barriers.
It is a Communist country. It doesn’t
always play by the rules. It also uses
some of the rules to its own advantage
in ways unlike any other country. For
instance, when they joined the WTO—
the World Trade Organization—they
self-declared themselves as a ‘‘devel-
oping nation.’’ Developing nations are
able to waive a lot of the World Trade
Organization rules because they are de-
veloping. May I remind this body that
China is the second largest economy in
the world—second only to ours? They
are not a developing nation. They have
used the rules of WTO to call them-
selves developing so they do not have
to live up to the international standard
of basic trade.
On March 22, 2018, President Trump
signed a Memorandum on Actions by
the United States related to what is
called a 301 investigation. They are tar-
geting what the White House calls
‘‘economic aggression’’ from China. Let
me give some specifics on that.
China uses joint venture require-
ments on any foreign investment. They
want to have ownership in those com-
panies actually doing business there.
They put pressure on technology firms
to transfer their technology to China if
they are going to actually sell to
China. The result of that is that they
may not take the product that is man-
ufactured there, that those original
companies sell back to the United
States, but they will take that infor-
mation and then actually sell to other
parts of the world from that stolen in-
formation from a technology transfer.
Akin to that, China maintains unfair
licensing practices. Typically, in other
parts of the world, our intellectual
property that we have is guarded by
that nation, or we actually have a li-
censing agreement with them that is
fair market value. Not so with China.
They put pressure on entities and actu-
ally cheat and steal our intellectual
property at times. That doesn’t happen
with every company but especially cer-
tain types of firms, where, long term,
China wants to produce it on their own
rather than buy it from other coun-
tries. If that production is done in
China, China will take the intellectual
property, and the plan is clearly to
then take that intellectual property
and use it for themselves in the days
ahead.
China is notorious for supporting
cyber intrusions to take the informa-
tion that they can’t get, especially
from American companies or Western
companies. If there is a design they are
interested in, whether that be an air-
plane or 3D printing or whatever it
may be that is designed somewhere
else, they reach in and try to hack and
steal it. This is not recent; this has
been going on for quite a while. In 2014,
the Department of Justice indicted five
Chinese military actors for cyber espi-
onage against multiple U.S. corpora-
tions. Recently, in 2017, the Depart-
ment of Justice charged three Chinese
nationals with hacking and theft of
trade secrets. And it goes on and on.
Just in the past couple of weeks, the
World Trade Organization has agreed
with the United States in our com-
plaint against China and how they han-
dle agriculture subsidies. Agriculture
subsidies from any country are limited
in that country, but China uses large
ag subsidies through their farmers and
ag companies to subsidize those prod-
ucts with state taxes. Let me give an
example of that. Thirty-two percent of
the return for rice in China is a govern-
ment subsidy back to rice farmers.
I have heard folks say: Well, in the
United States, we also have a farm pro-
gram. We have a farm bill. We provide
subsidies as well.
That is true, but our rice farmers
have a 2-percent subsidy. Chinese rice
farmers have a 32-percent subsidy.
The World Trade Organization agreed
with us on this, and they have deter-
mined that China is in violation and
the United States can retaliate on
that.
China is using that policy and abus-
ing that policy on subsidizing. It is not
only causing problems in China and
with trade with China and their pric-
ing, what they sell for, it is also caus-
ing uncertainty worldwide. Let me give
a for-instance. Cotton farming. Okla-
homa is big in cotton farming, but
China has oversubsidized cotton for
years through its cotton farmers, and
so they are overproducing what they
need or what they can sell. Currently,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1783
March 12, 2019
60 percent of the world’s cotton sup-
plies are stacked up in China, just in
piles, not being used anywhere, but be-
cause China is subsidizing people to
produce it, they are overproducing it in
mass quantities. They have nowhere to
send it, and they are just stacking cot-
ton up in piles. The same thing with
wheat. Forty percent of the world’s
wheat supplies are currently piled up
in stacks in China. That destabilizes
worldwide wheat prices and worldwide
cotton prices because no one knows
what China is going to do with that
massive stack. WTO has considered
them to be in violation for that, and we
are allowed to reach back and retali-
ate.
The United States is not the only one
watching China’s trade policies and
how they actually interact and the
subsidies they give; the rest of the
world sees this same issue with China.
They would engage with us more to co-
operate and push back on China, but
currently, we have so many steel and
aluminum tariffs on our friends around
the world that they are not engaging
with us to the level they could be to
have a clear focus against China.
We need to not isolate our friends but
gather friends and say that China and
their policies are clearly a worldwide
issue, and it needs to be resolved.
Worldwide collaboration is going to be
the only way that we are going to real-
ly isolate an economy as large as
China.
I encourage our administration to re-
solve trade issues worldwide and re-
solve tariff issues with our friends
worldwide. Instead of saying it is a na-
tional security threat with Canada and
Mexico and others, and so we need to
have steel and aluminum tariffs, see
the real national security threat that
we have from China, and gather a coop-
erative group and focus on that one
area.
One of those areas is those 301 tariffs
that I mentioned before. Any tariffs
that go into place must first and fore-
most not hurt American consumers,
American companies, and American
workers. My concern is that 301 tar-
iffs—as they have grown—will hurt and
are currently hurting American con-
sumers, American employees, and
American companies.
The 301 tariffs—these are products
that are manufactured in China. They
are often designed so the engineering,
the marketing, all of those things, the
design of those—the intellectual prop-
erty is here in the United States. Com-
panies in the United States look for
manufacturing expertise. They find ex-
pertise in certain types of products,
like electronics, lighting, and other
things, where there is a lot of that
manufacturing and expertise—in
China. It is a natural thing to say:
There is a large body of groups and in-
dividuals and technology that is al-
ready there to do it. Let’s do the manu-
facturing there and the design and en-
gineering here.
It makes sense just on the supply
chain function.
This administration has laid down
tariffs—so far, three different tiers of
tariffs.
The first tier. Every American com-
pany was allowed to say ‘‘Is there any
other place that can do it?’’ and to ask
for exclusions through that process. If
they could find exclusions, they could
petition the government and get out of
it.
The second tier. They were also al-
lowed to ask for exclusions through the
process, to ask for basically a waiver,
to say: This is the best place to do it.
There is no other competition. There is
no one pressuring us not to do it here.
But when the third and largest tier
came out—$200 billion in products—no
exclusion process was given for these
American companies. A 10-percent tar-
iff was laid down on these companies.
Here is what that means. If you are a
company that produces a consumer
electronic or lighting or one of the
other resources that is manufactured
in China, most of the people you are
selling it to—you made a contract a
year or two ago on what the price
would be.
Whether selling to Lowe’s or Home
Depot or Walmart or Best Buy or what-
ever it may be, you made a deal about
how much you are going to sell that
product for and how much you are
going to sell. With a 10-percent tariff
laid down, who pays that tariff? It is
not going to be the end user initially
because the contract has already been
made. It is not going to be the Chinese
manufacturing location. It is going to
be the companies doing the production
in the United States. The American
workers and the American companies
pay the brunt of all of those, and, by
the way, there is no way to file an ex-
emption on this group. For $200 billion
worth of products, Americans are actu-
ally facing the brunt of that.
So far, Americans have paid $12 bil-
lion in tariffs. It is not punishing the
Chinese; it is punishing us. By the end
of the year, if this continues, those
contracts will have run out, and they
will be repricing consumer electronics
products all over the country, and the
American consumer will be the one to
pay higher prices on this. So 301 tariffs
disproportionately hurt those in the
middle class and those in poverty who
have fixed incomes. This needs to be
resolved.
First and foremost, there needs to be
a way to have a waiver process. As we
have done in the first two sections,
there is no opportunity to get it out of
the third and largest group. It is a rea-
sonable thing for American companies
to say: How can we actually produce
this?
I have partnered with Senator COONS
in the Senate and Representatives KIND
and WALORSKI in the House, and we put
together a basic bill dealing with im-
port tax relief, dealing with this 301,
laying down for the first time how we
would actually manage tariffs in the
days ahead and what exclusion process
there would be and has to be.
It is reasonable to have a predictable
level to benefit the American con-
sumer, especially those in poverty and
with fixed incomes, and to benefit
American workers. We can’t have tar-
iffs on a foreign country that actually
hurt American workers. That is an
issue we still have to resolve. I am glad
to have a partnership with Senator
COONS to work on that, and we hope to
get that done this year to guard work-
ers for the future.
Along with that, in any trade nego-
tiations, we have what is called trade
promotion authority. We have basic
standards. An example would be envi-
ronmental concerns. We don’t want to
work with another country that is ig-
noring environmental concerns. We are
concerned about where we are in the
environment—the air we breathe and
the water we drink. That is important
to us as Americans because we want to
protect our families. We understand it
pushes up the cost of some products,
but the long-term benefit is greater,
and we are very careful in evaluating
our regulations. When we overregulate
and it drives up costs, we push back on
that, saying that we don’t want to
overregulate and drive up costs, but we
want to have clean air and water.
For the Chinese, that is not so. In
many areas of China, you can’t
breathe, and on a regular daily basis
people wear masks over their faces be-
cause of the exhaust, the fumes, and
the toxic air they breathe, based on
their limitations on the environmental
quality of the air. It is becoming a
worldwide issue because of the amount
of trash the Chinese are allowing to go
into the Pacific Ocean, filling the Pa-
cific Ocean with plastic and trash.
Part of our trade promotion author-
ity and one of the agreements we have
is to lean in and have dialogue with in-
dividuals we trade with, saying that we
want to resolve trade issues, but we
also want to protect our environment,
and we think it is a reasonable thing to
do.
It is reasonable, as Americans, to
place a high value on religious liberty
and human rights. It is part of our
trade promotion authority and, in fact,
an area I worked very hard to get im-
plemented as a part of our trade pro-
motion authority—that when we nego-
tiate trade issues with countries, we
also deal with the basic issue of human
rights and freedom of religion.
We, as Americans, believe that our
religious belief is our most precious
private property, and no government
should be able to step in and steal pri-
vate property. Your most private pos-
session is your faith. Every individual
should have the right to have any faith
they choose, be able to change their
faith, or have no faith at all. That
should be their choice, but that is not
so in China right now.
In fact, in 1999, the State Department
designated China as what is called ‘‘a
country of particular concern.’’ This

S1784 March 12, 2019
deals with the issue of religious free-
dom in their country and China’s ag-
gressive move to limit religious free-
dom in their country. Recently, Presi-
dent Xi has worked toward seculariza-
tion of religion to try to make every-
thing in the country—every area—
equal and the same, stripping away re-
ligious symbols from buildings of all
types, stripping away religious practice
that is not approved by the Govern-
ment of China. This discrimination has
impacted Tibetan Buddhists, Muslims,
Catholics, and Falun Gong practi-
tioners. It has led to the destruction of
houses of worship, demolition of reli-
gious educational institutions, restric-
tions in the practice and study of faith
by people of whatever culture or lan-
guage, restrictions on religious attire,
religious rituals, and imprisonment of
religious leaders and followers.
In fact, right now we are tracking
the imprisonment of a pastor named
Pastor Cao. Pastor Cao and his wife are
American citizens, and his children are
American citizens. He is allowed to
have legal residency in the United
States, but 2 years ago as of this
month, he was imprisoned in China.
Pastor Cao has a hearing coming up
on the 22nd of this month, and we hope
for Pastor Cao and for his family that
hearing happens. It has been postponed
again and again.
On the 22nd of March, we anticipate
the Chinese Government will have his
hearing and will give him a moment to
have this finally resolved. There is no
reason for Pastor Cao to be in prison
right now.
We don’t want to see, in China,
forced reeducation facilities, intimida-
tion, lack of medical attention for peo-
ple of faith. Let’s see for the people of
China what people worldwide have the
opportunity to have—freedom of reli-
gion. In our trade conversations we
think it is highly advisable to engage
in that type of dialogue for people like
Pastor Cao, whose children are looking
forward to holding him in their arms
again and for him to be released.
China is an important part of the
worldwide conversation. They are a
powerful nation. We should be able to
work together on key issues. The Chi-
nese Government needs to determine
how they are going to trade and if they
are a developing country or if they are
really a worldwide leader.
We need to determine how we are
going to do fair trade with them, and
we need to determine who they are
going to be on the world stage, dealing
with human rights and dignity. It is
not all about sameness of a world; this
is about the power of the individual
within the country.
I am sure the people of China are
very proud of their country. We would
love to engage with the people of
China, and we appreciate their engage-
ment with us as we receive thousands
of Chinese students and visitors every
single year.
This is a point where we should re-
solve the trade issues that have been
lingering for decades now, and we hope
we can get to an agreement that is
right, from our administration being
attentive so that the tariffs don’t hurt
our own citizens to the Chinese econ-
omy that is slowing down due to the
ongoing trade conversation. Let’s work
toward the benefit of all of our people
to see if we can’t resolve trade issues
together.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask

ENES KANTER
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have
come to the Senate floor this afternoon
to talk about a young man named Enes
Kanter, who plays basketball for my
hometown Portland Trail Blazers.
I wish I could be here to run through
Saturday’s box score or preview to-
night’s match up against the Clippers,
but, unfortunately, Mr. Kanter is fac-
ing dangers that are far more serious
than the outcome of any basketball
game. His family is now facing those
dangers as well.
Mr. Kanter is from Turkey. His love
of basketball brought him to the
United States in 2009, and he was se-
lected third overall in the 2011 NBA
draft by the Utah Jazz. Enes is a
bright, intelligent, and soft-spoken
guy. He pays attention to what goes on
back home in Turkey; he cares deeply
about his country’s future; and he
rightfully believes that he ought to be
able to express his opinion as he sees it
on these important issues. For that,
Turkey’s President Erdogan has la-
beled Enes Kanter a terrorist.
President Erdogan and his cronies
are too thin-skinned to tolerate Enes
Kanter’s eloquence and inspirational
dissent off the court. Erdogan revoked
Mr. Kanter’s passport based on accusa-
tions that lacked any real proof. Presi-
dent Erdogan has demanded that
INTERPOL issue a red notice on Mr.
Kanter, which means he has to stay in
the United States whenever his team
travels outside the country. It has kept
Mr. Kanter from going to London and
going to Toronto.
As Mr. Kanter himself wrote in a re-
cent Washington Post opinion article,
‘‘I am definitely a target, and Erdogan
wants me back in Turkey where he can
silence me.’’
Following strategies right out of
‘‘The Dictator’s Playbook,’’ Erdogan
has responded like a coward to Mr.
Kanter’s criticism and has tried to si-
lence him by threatening his family—
his family who still lives in Turkey.
Mr. Kanter recently told reporters
that his father would be going on trial
this week, in just a few days, in Tur-
key. The details of that trial are
shrouded in the fog of secrecy—where
authoritarians thrive. Yet Mr. Kanter’s
powerful words cut cleanly through
that fog just a few days ago. When
asked what his father was on trial for,
Enes said for ‘‘just being my dad.’’
Enes is a young man who has already
sacrificed so much. As a teenager, he
moved thousands of miles away from
home to pursue his dream of playing in
the NBA. For the crime of just voicing
his opinions on the future of Turkey—
a nation that is supposedly an Amer-
ican ally—Enes was labeled a terrorist.
Years ago, he cut off contact with his
family because he believed Erdogan
would punish them for speaking with
someone who was critical of Erdogan’s
government. Now, without being able
to contact them, Enes has to live in
constant fear of what is going to hap-
pen to his loved ones back home.
So, as I stand on the floor of the U.S.
Senate, I want to make sure there isn’t
any confusion on two important topics.
First, Mr. Erdogan, the world is
watching how you treat Enes Kanter’s
father this week and in the weeks
ahead. Mr. Erdogan, the world is
watching how you treat Mr. Kanter
both when he is on American soil and
when Enes travels abroad.
Second, the United States cannot and
must not stand idly by while Enes and
his family are subjected to this auto-
cratic torment.
I have called on Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo to raise Mr. Kanter’s
case with his counterparts, and I have
asked our Secretary of State to state
clearly that our country will actively
resist these contrived red notices or ex-
tradition requests. The fact is, our
State Department should be taking all
of the necessary steps to ensure that
Mr. Kanter can travel safely with the
Trail Blazers or to advocate for the
freedom of his people. Enes Kanter is a
young man—an American resident—
who is exercising the right to free
speech that is enshrined in our Con-
stitution. The United States must not
stay silent in the face of such a blatant
attack on free thought and expression.
In my view, this is not exactly an
isolated issue. It is certainly not just a
sports story. The situation ought to be
examined in a broader context—a gov-
ernment that is taking a supposed
NATO ally down an increasingly au-
thoritarian road.
When the Saudis brazenly killed
Washington Post columnist Jamal
Khashoggi in a consulate in Turkey,
Erdogan styled himself a fierce de-
fender of journalists, but this is a clas-
sic situation of actions speaking louder
than words, for Erdogan jails more
journalists than do the Saudis. In fact,
Erdogan jails more journalists than do
the Russians, the Chinese, and more
than any other authoritarian regime
that is out there.
Erdogan does not only target jour-
nalists or independent media outlets,
all of whom knowingly, bravely risk
such oppressive actions when they just
want to report the truth; Erdogan has
thrown peaceful demonstrators into

jail as well. Just last Friday, he
cracked down on people who were as-
sembling peacefully in Istanbul for
International Women’s Day.
It gets worse—worse because Erdogan
is brazen enough to push his assaults
on democratic norms right here on
American soil. Less than 2 years ago,
Erdogan gave the go-ahead for his secu-
rity detail to brutally attack non-
violent demonstrators right here in the
Nation’s Capital. That assault, to em-
phasize the point, took place on Amer-
ican soil—right here, just a short walk
from the White House. Americans
ought to be outraged over this sort of
behavior, especially from a supposed
friend and ally like Turkey.
It has not gone unnoticed that
Erdogan recently doubled down on his
decision to make a major military pur-
chase from Vladimir Putin’s Russia,
and his use of fraudulent INTERPOL
red notices is right out of Vladimir
Putin’s playbook.
It is past time for the State Depart-
ment to stand up to this behavior. The
State Department needs to call this be-
havior out. It is not a far-off threat to
other people the Federal Government
can conveniently ignore. Erdogan’s
abuses are happening right here in our
country, on American soil. People like
Enes Kanter are the victims.
As a younger man back in the day, I
went to school on a basketball scholar-
ship. I often tell people at my townhall
meetings that I wanted to play in the
NBA—a ridiculous idea because I was
too small, but I made up for it by being
quite slow. My abilities on the court
were certainly light years removed
from Enes Kanter’s, but I can tell you,
from playing in college, I certainly re-
member the value of a full-court press.
I am firmly committed and will state
once more that our State Department
must put a full-court press on Turkey
to treat Mr. Kanter—and all of those
who speak out against Erdogan’s to-
talitarian regime—with respect for
their human rights and freedom of ex-
pression.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms.
MCSALLY). Without objection, it is so

BUDGET PROPOSAL
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the
President’s inauguration over 2 years
ago was a historic moment. Though my
candidate didn’t win, I attended it in
my capacity here in the U.S. Senate
and saw a lot of people, but the one
person I saw who was nothing short of
remarkable was Jimmy Carter.
The reason why it was remarkable to
see the former President, who left of-
fice in 1980—39 years ago—was the fact
that most everyone had counted him
for dead. If you will remember, he was
diagnosed with a form of cancer that
was supposedly fatal. People were talk-
ing about making their last trip to
Plains to attend his church on Sunday
and hear his last sermon. I thought it
was over, and most everyone did, too,
but then something amazing happened.
There was a new drug that came along,
and it turned out to be just the right
drug to save his life.
When I saw Jimmy Carter a little
over 2 years ago, I thought to myself: I
never thought I would see him again,
and I never thought I would see him
looking this good.
Those things don’t just happen.
Those drugs aren’t just discovered.
They are the product of a great deal of
work and research and application.
I remember asking Dr. Collins at the
National Institutes of Health what
Jimmy Carter’s story was. He ex-
plained that early research at NIH,
which is the premier medical research
facility in the world, had led to some
new possibilities in treating cancers. It
just so happened that Jimmy Carter’s
cancer was responsive to that drug.
Others have been, too, and I hope that
even more are discovered.
The good news is that the U.S. Sen-
ate and Congress understand this. Do
you know what has happened over the
last 4 years? What has happened over
the last 4 years is a dramatic show of
bipartisanship when it comes to med-
ical research. ROY BLUNT, from Mis-
souri, is in my neighboring State. I, of
course, represent Illinois. He is the
head of the Appropriations sub-
committee that funds the National In-
stitutes of Health. LAMAR ALEXANDER,
from the State of Tennessee, is the
chairman of the authorizing committee
for the National Institutes of Health.
PATTY MURRAY, my Democratic col-
league from the State of Washington,
serves in both the appropriations and
authorization committees and couldn’t
be a stronger advocate when it comes
to medical research. We have a little
team together, the four of us, and we
said we were going to do something or
try to do something each year.
Here is what we set out to do. We set
out to take the appropriations for the
National Institutes of Health and give
it 5 percent real growth every single
year—because Dr. Collins told me: If
you do that, Senator, then the people
who do the research believe that next
year could be a good year, too, to con-
tinue their research, and they will
stick with it, and when they stick with
it, amazing things happen.
So we did. I want to give credit to
Senator BLUNT, Senator ALEXANDER,
and Senator MURRAY. I was happy to be
a part of the effort. For 4 straight
years, we added 5 percent real growth
to the National Institutes of Health. In
total, when you look at all of the in-
crease of that period, there is a 30-per-
cent increase in medical research in a
period of 4 years and more to follow—
more to follow, if we get a chance.
That is why, when we received Presi-
dent Trump’s budget yesterday, it was
such a heartbreaking disappointment.
He has given up in terms of our contin-
ued increases in medical research. In
fact, he wants to cut $5 billion out of
the appropriations for the National In-
stitutes of Health.
Each of us decides why we want to be
here and what is worth fighting for. I
think medical research is worth fight-
ing for. The team that has been fight-
ing for it has been a bipartisan team in
the Senate, and I hope they felt the
same way I did—a feeling of real dis-
appointment in President Trump’s
budget.
I have to tell you that he believes his
wall is the most important thing on
Earth. I believe medical research and
saving lives are among the most impor-
tant things on Earth. As for cutting
money out of medical research—for
whatever reason you are going to use
it—I just have to say to the President
and others that you are in for a fight.
There are a lot of us who are standing
up and representing patients that are
counting on that research to find a
breakthrough and families who are
dealing with Alzheimer’s.
How many friends of mine and how
many families could I tell you about
who have some form of Parkinson’s or
dementia or Alzheimer’s that has
changed the family dramatically? Can
we and should we be looking for more
medical research to delay the onset of
Alzheimer’s and, God willing, to find a
cure some day?
We are reaching a point where this is
going to absolutely take over the med-
ical budget of America if we are not
careful. Shortsighted cuts in medical
research jeopardize those new cures for
cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Parkin-
son’s, Alzheimer’s, and dementia.
The President is just wrong in his
priorities—just wrong. Some of the
other things he has done in the budget
are equally troubling. According to his
budget request, the President wants to
cut $1.5 trillion from Medicaid—$1.5
million from Medicaid.
What is the Medicaid Program? It is
health insurance for poor people. Who
are those poor people? In my State of
Illinois, out of all the babies born in
my State each year, half of them are
paid for by Medicaid. There are low-in-
come moms delivering babies—we hope
healthy babies—because Medicaid as
health insurance is there to help them.
But that isn’t the biggest charge on
the Medicaid Program. The biggest
charge on the Medicaid Program—that
health insurance program—is for your
mom, your grandmother, or your fa-
ther. When they reach that stage in life
where nothing is left, when there is no
savings and maybe a little Social Secu-
rity check, and they have medical
needs, it is the Medicaid Program that
comes through for them.
If we cut what the President is sug-
gesting, $1.5 trillion in Medicaid, which
of those groups do you want to reduce
care for—the mothers with their new
babies or the parents and grandparents
at a stage in life where they have no

place to turn and no savings to turn to?
That is not a good outcome.
Then there was the suggested cut of
$845 billion in the Medicare Program.
Medicare is health insurance for the el-
derly. When you reach age 65, you have
paid into it through your working life
and you have that Medicare insurance
plan. The President cuts $845 billion
out of Medicare.
Does Medicare work? There is one
way to test it. What is the life expect-
ancy of senior citizens today, after
Medicare, compared to their life ex-
pectancy before Medicare? It is dra-
matically different. People are living
longer and more independent lives be-
cause Medicare gives them quality care
when they reach age 65, and President
Trump believes we should cut that pro-
gram by $845 billion. That, to me, is
shortsighted.
When it comes to our health, is there
anything more important? When it
comes to the health of our families, of
seniors, of the disabled, and of women
who are about to have a baby, is there
anything more important than to
make sure that turns out right? It is
hard for me to think of what it might
be.
The cut to the Centers for Disease
Control of $1.3 billion in the Presi-
dent’s budget is another one you just
shake your head at. The Centers for
Disease Control shows up when no one
else will enter the room, when they are
facing diseases that are life-threat-
ening. For the Ebola crisis in western
Africa and the fear that it would
spread throughout that continent and
maybe to the United States, it was the
Centers for Disease Control that
stepped in and said: We are going to
tackle it. We will take it on.
They did, and they did it success-
fully.
We are only one plane ticket away
from some of those diseases making it
into the United States. I want the Cen-
ters for Disease Control to stop them
in their tracks before they come to the
United States, and the President cuts
$1.3 billion.
The SNAP food stamp program is an-
other one—a cut of $220 billion. This is
a program that provides supplements
for food for families. Many of them are
working families who just don’t make
enough money to get by. I can’t tell
you how many food pantries I visited
in Illinois where the people who run
it—many of them volunteers with
churches and charities—say: The peo-
ple who are coming in to see us now are
folks who are working and not making
enough money.
Some of them qualify for food
stamps, and some of them don’t, but
feeding America should be fundamental
in this country; shouldn’t it? Shouldn’t
that be one of the basic things we pride
ourselves on as Americans?
Remember when President Trump
spoke about the aging infrastructure of
America during his campaign? Even
though I wasn’t supporting his can-
didacy, I certainly cheered those re-
marks. Infrastructure is bipartisan.
The roads and bridges in Arizona and
Illinois and in every other State all
need help, and they count on us in Con-
gress to come through with it. Well,
the budget that the President released
this week slashes infrastructure fund-
ing by 22 percent. When we should be
putting more into making a more mod-
ern and more efficient infrastructure
to build our economy, the President
cuts it. He cuts 31 percent from the
Army Corps of Engineers.
Today, I had a visit from the Illinois
corn growers. We are proud. There is a
lot of corn in Illinois, and we are proud
of being No. 2 to Iowa, I might add,
when it comes to corn production. But
do you know what they talked about in
addition to ag programs? They talked
about the locks and dams on the Illi-
nois and Mississippi Rivers. Those are
the avenues of commerce for agri-
culture in the Midwest, and they are
old and getting older and falling apart.
The Army Corps of Engineers are
counted on to modernize them, and the
President cuts 31 percent of their budg-
et—one-third of their budget—and 16
percent of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
The President’s budget completely
ignores the threat of climate change,
cutting the Environmental Protection
Agency by 30 percent.
Here is one that hits home. The
President cut the Great Lakes Restora-
tion Initiative by an outrageous 90 per-
cent. They did a survey a few years ago
and asked the people of Chicago, the
city I am proud to represent: What do
you think is the defining characteristic
of the city?
The overwhelming response was Lake
Michigan. That beautiful lake, a part
of the Great Lakes, is not just a source
of pride, but it is a source of good,
clean drinking water and of recreation
and commerce. We know it is threat-
ened in every direction, from chemical
runoffs to invasive species, and we
fight to make sure those lakes will sur-
vive for another generation. The Presi-
dent cuts the funds for that effort by 90
percent.
These are just a few examples of deci-
sions made in the President’s budget.
Needless to say, I have saved the best
for last. Though he has cut everything
I just talked about—from medical re-
search to protecting our Great Lakes,
to transportation and infrastructure,
to taking care of senior citizens, to
making sure that health insurance is
there for expectant mothers—the
President needs $8.5 billion for his al-
mighty wall, this wall on our southern
border.
We have given the President 120
miles of fencing—new and replacement
fencing—over the first 2 years he was
in office. That is 120 miles to add to the
640 already on our border. Do you know
how many miles have been built, as I
stand here today, for the last 2 years
that we have given the President?
None. It takes a long time to build
these fences, and the President is
learning it the hard way. Yet he wants
to take money out of programs across
the board on the possibility that they
may be built in the future—needed or
not. Congress needs to step up—and I
hope on a bipartisan basis—to assert
our constitutional authority and to
find a bipartisan way to put together a
budget that is much more balanced and
that realizes the real values of Amer-
ica.
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this
week, Senate Republicans are looking
to confirm two more circuit court
nominations, which would make a
total of six circuit court confirmations
this year.
None of these six circuit court nomi-
nees have had any prior judicial experi-
ence. Some have had very little court-
room experience at all.
Four of them have been put forward
over the opposition of Senators in their
home State: Eric Miller, who was op-
posed by both Washington Senators;
Chad Readler and Eric Murphy, who
were opposed by Senator BROWN; and
now Paul Matey, who was nominated
over the objections of both Senators
BOOKER and MENENDEZ.
I believe the Republican majority is
making a serious mistake by aban-
doning blue slips for circuit court
seats. They have set a precedent that
could affect each and every one of our
States.
Already, the Trump administration
has nominated a person for a Ninth
Circuit California seat, Daniel Bress,
who has only lived in California for 1
year since high school and who prac-
tices in Washington, DC.
It is absurd to see a nominee to a
California-based seat with such mini-
mal ties to California. That is what the
Republicans have brought about by
abandoning circuit court blue slips. It
is a big mistake.
This week, Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL plowed right through with a vote
on Paul Matey, President Trump’s
nominee for a Third Circuit seat based
in New Jersey. Mr. Matey had recently
served for 4 years as the general coun-
sel for University Hospital in Newark,
NJ. While Mr. Matey was there, a pa-
tient safety organization gave this hos-
pital annual grades of ‘‘C,’’ ‘‘D,’’ ‘‘D,’’
and ‘‘F’’ for patient safety. The grades
got worse while Mr. Matey was there.
Previously, Mr. Matey had been a
longtime staff member to New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie. He served as
Governor Christie’s chief ethics officer
and deputy chief counsel. Mr. Matey
said he provided a rigorous system of
ethics training, monitoring, and over-
sight for staff members in the Gov-
ernor’s office; yet it is unclear what
steps, if any, he took to ensure that
ethics rules were followed. It certainly
appears that Mr. Matey’s ethics guid-
ance fell way short during the so-called
Bridgegate scandal in 2013. That is
when Christie administration officials
arranged to close lanes on the George
Washington Bridge as retaliation

against a mayor who had not endorsed
the Governor’s reelection. The deputy
chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, was sen-
tenced to 18 months in prison for her
role in this scandal.
In addition to being a former staffer
to a Republican-elected official, Mr.
Matey is a longtime member of the
Federalist Society. But just because a
nominee meets the ideological litmus
tests of the Republican Party and the
Federalist Society doesn’t mean he has
the experience and judgment to be a
good circuit court judge. More likely,
it is a sign the nominee will be an ideo-
logical judge.
New Jersey’s two Senators opposed
Mr. Matey’s nomination, but the White
House and Senate Republicans plowed
right through with this controversial
nominee.
Also this week, Senator MCCONNELL
has scheduled a vote on D.C. Circuit
nominee Neomi Rao. The DC Circuit is
often considered the second most im-
portant court in the land, and typically
the nominees to this court bring with
them a wealth of legal and judicial ex-
perience.
Ms. Neomi Rao has virtually no prac-
tical experience in law. She has never
tried a case in court. She has never ar-
gued an appeal in court. She has never
made an appearance in an American
court, and she has filed one court brief
in her entire career.
How in the world could someone sug-
gest that this woman get a lifetime ap-
pointment to the second highest court
in the land, never having tried a case,
never having argued an appeal, never
having made an appearance in the
court, and having filed only one court
brief in her entire career?
She was a political appointee of the
President, working at the Agency
known as the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs. When she was
there, she set out to rescind a lot of
Federal regulations—regulations, how-
ever, that might have been better left
on the books—that protected workers,
the environment, and Americans facing
discrimination. She was out to put an
end to those regulatory protections.
She has been an academic. She has
written a lot. In the year 2009, she
wrote: ‘‘The President may also decide
not to follow Supreme Court precedent,
and in the rare instance, may decide
against the enforcement of a particular
judgment.’’
That would be considered a radical
statement by most standards. It is a
radical view of Executive power that
Ms. Rao put forward. It flies in the face
of Supreme Court rules and decisions,
where the final word on constitutional
interpretation was decided and estab-
lished two centuries ago in Marbury v.
Madison.
Ms. Rao has also published a number
of articles in college, in which I can’t
even describe to you what she was
thinking. They were shocking and in-
flammatory writings on issues involv-
ing race, sexual orientation, sexual as-
sault, and date rape.
In April of 1993, this woman—des-
tined for the circuit court and a life-
time appointment, where she will use
her judgment on a daily basis to decide
the outcomes of cases and the legal
framework of America—wrote: ‘‘Date
rape exemplifies the attempts of the
nurture feminists to develop an artifi-
cial, alternative world in which women
are free from sexual danger and ‘no al-
ways means no.’ ’’
In October of 1994, she wrote of date
rape survivors: ‘‘If she drinks to the
point where she can no longer choose,
well, getting to that point was part of
her choice.’’
In September of 1994, she wrote that
a group at Yale called the Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Co-Op was ‘‘spreading
myths about AIDS.’’
In November of 1993, she wrote:
Myths of sexual and racial oppression prop-
agate themselves, create hysteria, and fi-
nally lead to the formation of some whining
new group. One can only hope to scream,
‘‘Perspective, just a little perspective, dar-
ling!’’
These are a few examples of writings,
which are difficult to describe in the
fairest terms and inflammatory at the
least.
While she wrote a letter to the Judi-
ciary Committee apologizing for some
of these writings, what does it say
about her values, her thinking, and
whether she should be in this legal po-
sition for the rest of her life?
The bottom line is this. Ms. Rao has
minimal practical experience in the
law. Her legal views are beyond ex-
treme, and her personal views, as re-
flected in her own personal writings,
are deeply troubling.
I would like to say to the President
and those who are in charge of picking
his nominees: Please, isn’t there a good
Republican conservative somewhere in
this area who has actually been in a
courtroom, who has actually made an
appearance in a case, who has maybe
even tried a case, who has maybe even
filed a motion, or who would know a
courthouse if they saw it and not on
television? Is that too much to ask for
a lifetime appointment to the second
highest court in the land?
This nominee may be ideologically
perfect for somebody who decided she
was destined for this court, but this
nomination is not a perfection when it
comes to the legal system in America.
It is an imperfection, which, if ap-
proved by the Senate, is going to be
with us for a lifetime.
I yield the floor.

ator from Massachusetts.
NOMINATION OF NEOMI J. RAO
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I
come to the floor to oppose the nomi-
nation of Neomi Rao to be a judge of
the second most powerful court in the
country.
My decision boiled down to just this
one question: Will Ms. Rao advance
equal justice for all or will she con-
tinue to tilt the courts in favor of the
rich and powerful?
Ms. Rao’s record shows that she will
continue to tilt our courts in favor of
the powerful few and leave everyone
else behind, and that is why I oppose
her nomination, but that is also ex-
actly why she was selected by the
President for this important lifetime
appointment.
In the last 2 years, with the Trump
administration controlling the White
House and Republicans, until January,
controlling both Houses of Congress,
the rich and powerful have had unpar-
alleled access to the Federal Govern-
ment, and they have been terrifyingly
effective at making Washington work
even better for themselves.
Just think of some of their high-pro-
file victories: a tax plan that takes
away money from working Americans
and gives it straight to the biggest cor-
porations and wealthiest individuals,
rollbacks of countless protections to
protect public health, consumer wel-
fare, and environmental safety. Those
are just the policies that people have
been paying attention to.
For decades now, billionaire-funded
rightwing groups have operated in the
shadows to take over our courts by in-
stalling rightwing judges who will put
the interests of giant corporations and
wealthy individuals ahead of everyone
else. For those special interests, Neomi
Rao is the ideal candidate.
In 2017, I came to the floor to oppose
Ms. Rao’s nomination to lead the Office
of Information and Regulatory Af-
fairs—the small but powerful Agency
that reviews and signs off on economi-
cally significant Federal rules. I was
concerned about Ms. Rao’s advocacy
for weakening or handcuffing Federal
Agencies that are there to help protect
the public from giant corporations that
prey on consumers, that mistreat their
workers, and that pollute our environ-
ment.
I worried that confirming her to lead
OIRA would threaten the health and
safety of all Americans. For example,
Ms. Rao attacked the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau—the Agency
that has returned $12 billion to work-
ing families who were cheated—arguing
against its authority to protect con-
sumers from predatory lending prac-
tices.
That was exactly the kind of can-
didate that Big Business and billion-
aires wanted, so the Republican-con-
trolled Senate confirmed Ms. Rao, and
the all-too-predictable happened.
Under Ms. Rao’s leadership, OIRA ap-
proved the EPA’s decision to roll back
important environmental positions,
OIRA rubberstamped changes at the
Department of Labor that allowed cer-
tain employers to hide workplace inju-
ries, and Ms. Rao blocked a proposed
measure from the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission that would
have helped uncover pay discrimina-
tion. The list goes on.
Ms. Rao pairs her pro-corporate
stance with harmful, regressive views
about sexual assault. In college, she
wrote an article placing blame on the

survivors of sexual assault if they
drank alcohol, claiming that such be-
havior was ‘‘part of their choice.’’
At her hearing, she refused to fully
disclaim this line of thought, claiming
she was just recommending certain ac-
tions women could take to make them-
selves less likely to be assaulted.
If that wasn’t worrisome enough, Ms.
Rao also argued in a book review that
public protections for women, for peo-
ple of color, and for Americans with
disabilities are bad because they have
eroded the power of traditional elites,
going so far as to call affirmative ac-
tion the ‘‘bane of all good elitists.’’
For President Trump, congressional
Republicans, and their billionaire bud-
dies, Ms. Rao’s commitment to pro-
tecting the interests of the rich and
powerful over everyone else was a fea-
ture of her tenure at OIRA, not a bug.
Now, as a reward for spending a year
and a half rolling back public protec-
tions and rubberstamping corporate
America’s wish list, the Trump admin-
istration has selected her to be a judge
on the second highest court in this
country.
At the DC Circuit, Ms. Rao would
have even more power to stop Federal
efforts to protect Americans from abu-
sive corporations and billionaires. She
would rule on attempts to protect the
air we breathe and the water we drink.
She would have the power to overturn
protections for workers from unsafe
working conditions, and she would
have the chance to upend rules to pre-
vent big corporations from discrimi-
nating against people of color, LGBTQ
Americans, and other marginalized
communities.
Throughout her career, Ms. Rao has
made very clear what her preferred hi-
erarchy looks like: corporations and
billionaires up at the top, and every-
body else at the bottom.
As a judge on the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals, Ms. Rao will have an oppor-
tunity to practice that philosophy at
an even larger scale.
Madam President, our Federal courts
are supposed to defend equal justice for
all Americans, not cater to the wealthy
and well connected. Neomi Rao’s
record shows that she will continue the
corporate takeover of our courts.
A vote for her is a vote against the
millions of Americans who have al-
ready borne the consequences of the
radical, pro-corporate policies she has
advanced throughout her career. That
is why I believe the Senate should re-
ject her nomination.
NOMINATION OF WILLIAM BEACH
Madam President, I also want to ex-
press my strong opposition to the nom-
ination of William Beach to run the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS’s ac-
curate and impartial analysis is crucial
to policymakers, workers, and busi-
nesses.
In Mr. Beach, President Trump has
chosen someone who has spent years at
so-called think tanks that are funded
by radical rightwing billionaires push-
ing so-called studies that criticize So-
cial Security and support draconian
budget cuts and tax cuts for the richest
Americans—studies that have since
been discredited. That is not whom we
need running one of our country’s most
important statistical Agencies.
Besides Mr. Beach’s radical, pro-cor-
porate background, I want to join
Ranking Member MURRAY in express-
ing my serious concern with my Repub-
lican colleagues’ refusal to confirm
Democratic nominees to other impor-
tant Agencies for workers—the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board and the
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission. This obstruction is a total de-
parture from precedent, and it is pre-
venting these Agencies from protecting
the rights of millions of American
workers to bargain collectively and to
go to work without worrying about il-
legal discrimination and harassment.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent to speak
as in morning business for probably
about 15 minutes, and should Senator
VAN HOLLEN from Maryland—who is
scheduled to arrive—arrive, that I be
able to engage in colloquy with him.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, there is now no doubt that cli-
mate change is happening, that it is
caused by human activity, and that we
must act now to avoid the worse of it.
As science guy, Bill Nye, has said:
‘‘Climate change is happening, it’s our
fault, and we’ve got to get to work on
this.’’
For too long we have seen the fossil
fuel industry and its army of front
groups use manufactured doubt, phony
doubt, as their weapon of choice to ob-
struct any solution. Well, science stud-
ies things, and it even studies doubt. A
scientific study published by Nature
has found that the evidence of human-
caused climate change occurring has
now achieved what scientists call the
five sigma level of certainty.
What does that mean? This scientific
standard means there is 99.9999 percent
confidence that Earth is warming due
to human activity. Put another way,
there is a 1 in 3.5 million chance that
human-caused warming is not occur-
ring.
To compare, you have a 1 in 15,000
chance that you will be struck by
lightning in your life. You have a 1 in
100,000 chance of being born a conjoined
twin, and you have a 1 in 3.5 million
chance the fossil fuel industry’s phony
doubt about climate change is true.
Yet, just one Republican has signed
on to Senator CARPER’s resolution stat-
ing the basics—that climate change is
real and caused by human activity, and
Congress should take action now to ad-
dress it.
In an editorial last week—this one
here—even the middle-of-the-road USA
Today said climate change is ‘‘a true
crisis facing the United States and the
world,’’ that ‘‘fossil fuel polluters keep
using the atmosphere as a free waste
dump,’’ and, finally, that ‘‘[t]he public
is growing impatient.’’
Well, last week, here on the Senate
floor, we actually had something re-
sembling a climate debate break out. It
was a little weird. As a debate, it
coughed and banged and sputtered, and
we didn’t really engage. Many of our
Republican colleagues had a very hard
time mentioning the actual phrase
‘‘climate change.’’ They found it im-
possible to talk at all about the costs
of climate change—the floods, the
fires, the rising seas, the worst yet to
come. No one could mention the 1.5 de-
gree centigrade limit that we need to
meet.
They mostly wanted to have fun
bashing an imaginary Koch brothers-
invented version of the Green New
Deal. However, some did say that they
accepted the science. In particular, I
was happy to see the chairman of the
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee clearly accept that climate
change is real, that it is caused by hu-
mans, and that we have a responsi-
bility to do something about it.
I appreciate that he pointed to the
bipartisan work he and I have done on
carbon capture and removal. I enjoyed
working with him on that legislation,
and I hope we can get its successor bill
passed too. We just had a very good bi-
partisan committee hearing on it, but
put those two bills together, and you
are still nowhere near the scale of ac-
tion that science demands.
Our scientists report that we must
aim for net zero carbon emissions by
the middle of this century to avoid the
worst consequences of climate change.
Carbon capture will be a part of that,
but there is zero chance it alone will be
sufficient, and any plan that falls short
of that mark amounts to its own di-
luted brand of climate denial. Bashing
the Green New Deal doesn’t solve the
problem.
This is a good moment for me to in-
terrupt my remarks because I see the
majority leader on the floor. If I may,
I will yield to him to close out the Sen-
ate and then have myself and Senator
VAN HOLLEN recognized at the conclu-
sion of the majority leader’s com-
ments.

Implementation of this proposed sale will
not require the assignment of any additional
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Australia.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

ing and maneuvering targets. AIM–120 Cap-
tive Air Training Missiles are non-func-
tioning, inert missile rounds used for arma-
ment load training, and which also simulates
the correct weight and balance of live mis-
siles during captive carry on training sor-
ties. The AIM–120C–7, as employed in the Na-
tional Advanced Surface-to-Air System
(NASAMS), protects national assets from
imminent hostile air threats. The AMRAAM
All Up Round is classified CONFIDENTIAL,
major components and subsystems range
from UNCLASSIFIED to CONFIDENTIAL,
and technology data and other documenta-
tion are classified up to SECRET.
2. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific

Australia can provide substantially the same
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification.
4. All defense articles and services listed in
this transmittal are authorized for release

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO HARRY C. LABONDE,
JR.
∑ Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President,
today I recognize the distinguished ca-
reer of Harry C. LaBonde, Jr., who, fol-
lowing decades of service in the State
of Wyoming, is retiring this week.
Harry began his career shortly after
graduating from college with a civil
engineering degree. His first job al-
lowed him to specialize on issues re-
lated to water and wastewater treat-
ment. In 1991, he became the public
works director for the city of Riverton.
He went on to serve in the same posi-
tion for the city of Laramie, until he
later became city manager. For the
past 15 years, Harry worked for the
State of Wyoming, first as Wyoming’s
Deputy State Engineer and, more re-
cently, as director of the Wyoming
Water Development Office.
When at the State Engineer’s office,
Harry was involved with addressing a
backlog of coal-bed methane reservoir
permits in the Powder River Basin and
transitioning the office from paper to
electronic records, which required the
modernization of millions of docu-
ments related to water and permits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1790 March 12, 2019
Wyoming was also facing severe water
shortages due to an extended period of
drought, requiring Harry to make the
difficult decisions resulting from those
shortages.
As director, Harry was instrumental
in carrying out key responsibilities of
Wyoming’s Water Development Office:
developing Wyoming’s water resources
through sound water planning and use.
Water is a precious resource in the
west. It is key to maintaining an excel-
lent quality of life, economic security,
and growth. Through Harry’s leader-
ship, numerous water storage projects
are underway in the State, which will
help Wyoming realize its water storage
potential for today and to serve com-
munities tomorrow. Whether it is
through the reconstruction of the Mid-
dle Piney Dam or the storage enhance-
ment project at Fontenelle Reservoir,
Harry understands the importance of
securing water resources in the State
for future Wyoming generations.
In addition to reservoir planning and
construction, Harry oversaw the devel-
opment of river basin plans, weather
modification projects, addressing wa-
tershed threats from wildfires, and car-
rying out the Small Water Project Pro-
gram. Water affects everyone. Making
sure Wyoming’s water resources are
used efficiently and responsibly for the
benefit of the people of Wyoming is a
responsibility Harry takes very seri-
ously.
Harry’s expertise and the strong rela-
tionships he has fostered throughout
the basins we share with neighboring
States is invaluable. He has contrib-
uted to a number of regional water sup-
ply efforts, including the Colorado
River Basin States Salinity Control
Program. He also serves as Wyoming’s
representative on the Platte River Re-
covery Implementation Program, a co-
operative agreement with Nebraska,
Colorado, and the Federal Government,
to maintain water usage and develop-
ment by implementing conservation
practices for certain endangered and
threatened fish and birds.
We are fortunate Harry chose early
in his professional life to use his skills
and talents to focus on water. He has
dedicated his career to being a water
advocate for the people of Wyoming
and to finding long-term solutions to
securing Wyoming’s water needs. We
are all better for his efforts.
I invite all members of the Senate to
join me in congratulating Harry on his
retirement, and wishing both him and
his family much happiness and success
in the future.∑

TRIBUTE TO STEVE CANNON
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I con-
gratulate Steve Cannon, who is retir-
ing after a 42-year career in Idaho tele-
vision.
Steve Cannon translated his deep in-
terest in weather as a youth into a
longtime career. He retired this month
from his position as weatherman for
KIDK Eyewitness News 3, which has
coverage in my hometown of Idaho
Falls and the Pocatello area. He got his
start in front of the camera in 1977,
when he went to work for the former
KID TV 3, but he began his broad-
casting career in radio, working for a
radio station in Rexburg. Leading up to
his career in weather reporting, Steve
graduated from Idaho Falls High
School, studied journalism at Brigham
Young University, served a mission in
Great Britain, and finished his degree
at Idaho State University.
Steve’s love for his profession and
deep understanding and appreciation
for the people of eastern Idaho show in
his thoughtful reporting. He is known
for his humor, relatability, depend-
ability, and strong work ethic. Steve
has reported with agility and skill, as
he has navigated significant advance-
ments in weather reporting over the
past four decades. Steve’s weather re-
porting has shaped how countless Ida-
hoans have planned their days, and his
attentive reporting has been instru-
mental as he has reported on the major
weather events that have had consider-
able impacts on lives.
In addition to his career, Steve has
given his time and talent in support of
service projects in the community.
This includes his assistance with the
creation of the Idaho Falls Citizen’s
Watch Patrol for the Idaho Falls Police
Department.
I understand that Steve has looked
forward to being able to dedicate all
his time to his family and loved ones
during retirement that begins as his
wife also retires from teaching. I wish
you both well, and thank you for your
outstanding work in our community.∑

REMEMBERING GEORGE
DAUGHERTY
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President,
my home State has truly lost a shining
star. We have lost a devoted West Vir-
ginian, a noble Army Veteran, a gifted
performer, and a dear friend to all.
George Daugherty’s enthusiasm for life
was infectious to anybody who had the
privilege of knowing him, and it is an
honor to recognize his life and legacy.
You could often find George on
Morgantown’s High Street next to the
bronze statue of Don Knotts singing a
rousing chorus of ‘‘Hail West Vir-
ginia.’’ He would usually tack on a
phrase at the end about beating Pitt
that was met with rousing applause
from those who stopped on the street
to cheer him on. He was quite a char-
acter and best known as a musician,
but he made a life for himself by prac-
ticing law.
Despite his musical comedy role in
the Charleston jamboree, George’s pro-
fessionalism working on medical mal-
practice cases never faltered. He said
he never had a bad relationship with a
doctor he sued, and he generally ended
up becoming friends with them. That
was just who he was.
Another key component that made
George the person he was, affecting his
music and life, was his unwavering pa-
triotism. His father was a World War I
veteran and instilled in him the pride
and, of course, the patriotic songs that
George would perform on stage, dressed
in American flag-themed attire. He in-
stilled these values in his children and
grandchildren, encouraging them to be
grateful for our freedom and to always
remember where they have come from,
and our statewide community is better
for it.
It was an honor to call George my
friend, a man who proudly showcased
our State through performances across
the Nation as ‘‘the Earl of Elkview’’ or
‘‘the Duke of Dunbar.’’ He and my
Uncle A. James were dear friends for
many years, and I know he would have
been so very proud to see all that
George did to promote the State we
love. Whether performing on the Cap-
itol City Jamboree and the Mountain
Stage, contributing over 50 years of ex-
cellence and professionalism practicing
law, or giving back to his community,
George represented the best of West
Virginia, which is saying quite a lot.
He was a proud representative of our
beautiful State no matter where life
took him.
What is most important is that he
lived a full life, surrounded by dear
friends and family. It is my hope that
his loved ones are able to find peace,
strength, and support in one another. I
extend my condolences to Mary Jarvis
Currence and their children, Dick,
Nancy, Sallie, and Thomas, their
grandchildren, Kiera, Devlin, Aidan,
Jamie, and Beth, as well as to George’s
many dear friends and extended family.
I know he is looking down on all of you
with a smile. I am honored to join each
of you in honoring George’s memory,
as well as the unwavering love he had
for his family, our great Nation, and
our home State.∑

TRIBUTE TO DAN O’NEILL
∑ Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President,
Robert F. Kennedy once said: ‘‘We
want to make sure that we bequeath to
our descendants a better and safer
world than the one in which we live
today.’’ For nearly four decades, Dan
O’Neill has dedicated himself to cre-
ating that better, safer world for future
generations. As he prepares to step
back from his work and enjoy a much-
deserved retirement, I want to share a
few thoughts about this wonderful indi-
vidual.
As a young man volunteering for an
NGO in Africa, Europe, and the Middle
East, Dan came face to face with some
of the worst that humankind has to
offer: extreme poverty, oppression,
famine, and war. At first, he docu-
mented these horrors in photos, arti-
cles, and journals, until one day when
he decided he couldn’t just watch any-
more. In the face of relentless horror
and carnage, specifically the brutal
genocide in Cambodia and coverage of
the Khmer Rouge Killing Fields, Dan’s
conscience wouldn’t allow him to just

dreds of thousands of Cambodians flee-
ing for their lives and safety. Three
years later, he expanded on that effort
by cofounding Mercy Corps, a global
nongovernmental, humanitarian aid
organization with the goal of alle-
viating suffering, poverty, and oppres-
sion by helping people build just, se-
cure, and productive communities.
Thirty-eight years later, Dan has
traveled the world to meet with polit-
ical and religious leaders; worked on
the ground to establish and run Mercy
Corps programs in some of the least
hospitable places on Earth; and wit-
nessed, firsthand, natural disasters,
human catastrophes, political upheav-
als, war, and famine. The organization
that he created, Mercy Corps, has pro-
vided over $4 billion in lifesaving as-
sistance to more than 220 million peo-
ple in need in at least 122 countries.
Today, amid the world’s most dire
situations, you can always count on
Mercy Corps to be there, building the
foundation for those just, secure, and
productive communities. Where this is
a desperate challenge, you are likely to
find Mercy Corps at work, providing
vital aid and assistance to refugees in
Jordan; giving water to famine-strick-
en families in South Sudan; or bringing
desperately needed public attention to
today’s worldwide refugee crisis. All of
that is, in no small measure, thanks to
Dan O’Neill’s inexhaustible passion and
leadership.
So to Dan O’Neill, who has done so
much, for so many, for so long, I sim-
ply want to say, thank you. I wish him
all the best as he begins this next chap-
ter of his life.∑

RECOGNIZING JUNIOR
ACHIEVEMENT USA
∑ Mr. GARDNER. Madam President,
today I want to recognize Junior
Achievement USA, who are celebrating
their 100th anniversary this year. In
1919, Junior Achievement opened its
doors to young people, with the simple
goal of helping students succeed in
their future careers. This was accom-
plished by helping students develop
skills necessary to make smart choices
in their academic and economic fu-
tures.
Junior Achievement strives to posi-
tively impact students by providing
skills centered on financial literacy,
work readiness, and entrepreneurship.
They focus on preparing tomorrow’s
workforce by bridging the gap between
traditional education and the obtain-
ing of career skills and competencies
needed to succeed beyond a student’s
high school years. Junior Achievement
provides classroom programs, capstone
educational experiences, and entrepre-
neurship summits, all while partnering
with companies who value relevant
hands-on learning.
Headquartered in Colorado Springs,
Junior Achievement impacts a diverse
population in all 50 States. Today Jun-
ior Achievement USA reaches almost 5
million students in over 22,000 class-
rooms across the country. It employs
nearly 1,600 people and approximately
250,000 volunteers help inspire students
along the way.
Throughout its history, Junior
Achievement USA has had an impact
on more than 110 million students,
making them one of the Nation’s most
accomplished organizations dedicated
to providing young people the skills
necessary to plan for the future and
create their own economic success. We
need more organizations like Junior
Achievement that work to empower
young people and help them recognize
the opportunities and realities of life
and work in the 21st century. Junior
Achievement USA has and will con-
tinue to be valued and appreciated for
their significant contributions to the
State of Colorado and to the country as
well.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE
REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY
WITH RESPECT TO IRAN THAT
WAS DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE
ORDER 12957 ON MARCH 15, 1995—
PM 6
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States, together with an accompanying
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Iran
that was declared on March 15, 1995, is
to continue in effect beyond March 15,
2019.
The actions and policies of the Gov-
ernment of Iran continue to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to
the national security, foreign policy,
and economy of the United States.
For this reason, I have determined
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared with respect
to Iran and to maintain in force com-
prehensive sanctions against Iran to
respond to this threat.
DONALD J. TRUMP.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. UDALL (for himself, Mr.
GARDNER, Ms. CORTEZ MASTO,
and Mr. WHITEHOUSE):
S. 738. A bill to require the Federal
Communications Commission to make
the provision of Wi-Fi access on school
buses eligible for E-rate support; to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation.
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, the Fed-
eral Communications Commission
Schools and Libraries program, com-
monly known as E-Rate, has helped
connect our schools and libraries to
high-speed broadband. Recent changes
allowed for schools to pay for Wi-Fi on
campuses, recognizing that students
are using laptops and other devices for
learning. This bill, cosponsored by my
friends Senators GARDNER, CORTEZ
MASTO, and WHITEHOUSE, would allow
schools to receive reimbursement for
Wi-Fi on school buses—an idea inspired
by a New Mexico high school student.
A few years ago, a football player from
Hatch Valley High School in Hatch,
New Mexico told me how, after being
on a bus for hours after a game, he
would sit in the dark parking lot of his
school doing his homework—because he
didn’t have high-speed broadband at
home. Making Wi-Fi available on
school buses is one piece to solving the
homework gap—especially in rural
areas. Adequate internet is an absolute
necessity in this day and age. And I
will continue to work with my col-
leagues to make sure every home in
the country has adequate internet ac-
cess.
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 738
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. E-RATE SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL BUS
WI-FI.
(a) DEFINITION.—In this section, the term
‘‘school bus’’ means a passenger motor vehi-
cle that is—
(1) designed to carry a driver and not less
than 5 passengers; and
(2) used significantly to transport early
child education, elementary school, or sec-
ondary school students to or from school or
an event related to school.
(b) RULEMAKING.—Notwithstanding the
limitations under paragraphs (1)(B) and
(2)(A) of section 254(h) of the Communica-
tions Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254(h)) regarding
the authorized recipients and uses of dis-
counted telecommunications services, not
later than 180 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, the Federal Communica-
tions Commission shall commence a rule-
making to make the provision of Wi-Fi ac-
cess on school buses eligible for support
under the E-rate program of the Commission
set forth under subpart F of part 54 of title
47, Code of Federal Regulations.
By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr.
INHOFE, Mr. BARRASSO, Mr.
WHITEHOUSE, Mr. SULLIVAN, Mr.
BOOKER, Mrs. CAPITO, Mrs.
GILLIBRAND, Mr. CRAMER, and
Mr. VAN HOLLEN):
S. 747. A bill to reauthorize the diesel
emissions reduction program, and for
other purposes; to the Committee on
Environment and Public Works.
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise to
talk about the Diesel Emissions Reduc-
tion Act of 2019, or DERA, which I am
introducing today with Senators
INHOFE, BARRASSO, WHITEHOUSE, SUL-
LIVAN, BOOKER, CAPITO, GILLIBRAND,
CRAMER and VAN HOLLEN.
In today’s hearing, we will be focus-
ing on legislation that reauthorizes a
program that is near and dear to my
heart—the Diesel Emissions Reduction
Act, or DERA. I would like to say
thank you to my DERA co-pilot, Sen-
ator INHOFE. Senator INHOFE has been a
staunch supporter of DERA since day
one. I greatly appreciate his continued
support and the hard work of his staff
on this legislation. I also thank our co-
sponsors from last Congress who have
joined us again this year, Chairman
BARRASSO and Senator WHITEHOUSE.
Chairman BARRASSO and his staff
teamed up with us last Congress to
make DERA work even better, and I
appreciate his strong support. I also
would like to say thank you to our new
cosponsors this year, Senators SUL-
LIVAN, BOOKER, CAPITO, GILLIBRAND,
CRAMER and VAN HOLLEN.
In all my years of public service, it’s
not every day that I’ve seen programs
that generate this much bipartisan
support—but, then again, not many
programs are as effective and common-
sense as DERA.
Our Nation still relies heavily on die-
sel power to transport commuters and
kids, harvest our crops and build our
infrastructure. Today diesel engines
are found everywhere, from our schools
to our ports, and from our highways to
our agricultural fields.
Many of my colleagues have heard
me say that the great thing about die-
sel engines is that they last a long
time. And the bad thing about diesel
engines is that they last a long time.
Diesel engines are reliable and effi-
cient, but older diesel engines are big
polluters. Dirty diesel engine emissions
are some of the biggest contributors to
our Nation’s smog, soot and black car-
bon air pollution. These dirty diesel
emissions harm our health and our cli-
mate.
Because of smart emission standards,
new and retrofitted diesel engines
using American technology are now
much cleaner than older diesel en-
gines—over 90% cleaner. Unfortu-
nately, diesel engines run forever and
there is little incentive for a diesel en-
gine owner to replace an engine before
it breaks down. That’s why today,
more than a decade after diesel emis-
sion standards were implemented by
the EPA, millions of older diesel en-
gines that lack the latest pollution
control technology are still in use and
will remain in use for decades to come.

CORRECTION
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1795
March 12, 2019
Back in 2005, my very good friend,
the late-Senator from Ohio, George
Voinovich, came to me with an idea to
help solve this problem—he came to me
with the idea for DERA. Senator
Voinovich said to me, let’s provide fi-
nancial incentives for people to replace
or retrofit their older diesel engines
with American-made clean vehicle
technology. He told me that we can
dramatically reduce diesel emissions,
protect our health and create jobs here
at home. I said ‘‘Sign me up!’’ And I’ve
been DERA’s strongest supporter ever
since. In 2005, Congress passed DERA
faster than I think we’ve passed any
EPA program ever before. This simple
idea has turned into one of EPA’s most
effective clean air program on the
books today.
For every dollar spent in the DERA
program, our Nation sees $13 in eco-
nomic and health benefits. The emis-
sion reductions have helped States
meet clean air standards and resulted
in more than $12.6 billion in health
benefits alone since the program’s in-
ception.
From requests for electric school
buses, to replacement ferry engines, to
simple diesel retrofits, EPA tells us
that the requests keep coming in—but,
unfortunately, funding for DERA far
exceeds the program’s available funds.
With millions of dirty diesel engines on
our roads, DERA is as important today
as it was when it first started. Now, we
must work together to ensure that
every State, Tribe and territory can
still benefit from this unique program.
At a time when our Nation is looking
for ways to create jobs, have healthier
air and a better climate, cleaning up
dirty diesel engines through DERA
stands out as a prime example of what
works.
Today, I’m proud to continue the bi-
partisan tradition that started more
than 15 years ago with my good friend,
Senator Voinovich. I look forward to
working with my colleagues to pass re-
authorization of DERA this Congress.
Thank you Mr. President.
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and
Ms. COLLINS):
S. 752. A bill to amend the Higher
Education Act of 1965 to provide for
teacher and school leader quality en-
hancement and to enhance institu-
tional aid; to the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. As career
opportunities and the requisite skills
for success adapt to the demands of the
21st century, so too must the instruc-
tion and preparation students receive.
Educators are tasked with designing
educational experiences that rise to
the rigorous State academic standards
and reflect the needs and interests of
our Nation’s diverse student popu-
lation. We have become accustomed to
welcoming the start of the school year
with news headlines describing over-
filled classrooms and districts strug-
gling to fill teacher vacancies. Though
the challenge of teacher and principal
shortages is felt broadly across the
country, with a particularly acute im-
pact on our rural communities, it is an
issue we can remedy.
The reauthorization of the Higher
Education Act is an opportunity to
strengthen the preparation and leaders
and to further support State efforts to
successfully implement the Every Stu-
dent Succeeds Act. It is also an oppor-
tunity to address the fact that schools
in high-need communities are often
staffed by a revolving door of underpre-
pared and inexperienced teachers who
are unable to meet students’ needs.
This in part due to State teacher short-
ages.
This is why I am pleased to introduce
today with my colleague Senator COL-
LINS, the Preparing and Retaining Edu-
cation Professionals Act, or PREP Act.
As schools across our Nation continue
to face growing class sizes, many are
struggling with a shortage of qualified
teachers. Rural communities in par-
ticular are experiencing a dearth of
teachers equipped to meet their grow-
ing needs. The PREP Act aims to cre-
ate high-quality teacher residency pro-
grams to develop a diverse workforce
that is well-prepared to provide the
educational opportunities students
need to be successful in the 21st cen-
tury.
More specifically, this legislation
would expand the definition of ‘‘high
need’’ districts under the Every Stu-
dent Succeeds Act (ESSA) to include
those experiencing teacher shortages in
rural communities and in areas such as
special education, English language,
science, technology, engineering,
math, and CTE, to allow for access to
additional support and improvement. It
would also encourage school districts
to establish partnerships with local
community colleges and universities to
ensure their education programs are
developing future teachers in content
areas where there is currently a short-
age of educators. It would increase ac-
cess to teacher and school leader resi-
dency programs and preparation train-
ing while requiring States to identify
areas of teacher or leader shortages by
subject across public schools and use
that data to target their efforts. Addi-
tionally, the PREP Act bolsters sup-
port for teacher preparation programs
at Minority Serving Institutions
(MSIs) or Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs) to invest in a
diverse and well-prepared educator
workforce.
Improving our Nation’s educational
system is contingent on our ability to
prepare, support, and retain quality
educators. Research shows that better
prepared teachers stay longer in the
profession and are more likely to re-
main in their roles and positively im-
pact young people and their commu-
nities. As we look to reauthorize the
Higher Education Act, I hope that my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle see
the PREP Act as a commonsense op-
portunity to help ensure that students
in every zip code across the country
have the well-prepared teachers and
school leaders they deserve.

S. RES. 104
Whereas United States citizen Robert
Levinson is a retired agent of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, a resident of Coral
Springs, Florida, the husband of Christine
Levinson, father of their seven children, and
grandfather of their six grandchildren;
Whereas Robert Levinson traveled from
Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Kish Island,
Iran, on March 8, 2007;
Whereas after traveling to Kish Island and
checking into the Hotel Maryam, Robert
Levinson disappeared on March 9, 2007;
Whereas, in December 2007, Robert
Levinson’s wife, Christine, traveled to Kish
Island to retrace Mr. Levinson’s steps and
met with officials of the Government of Iran
who pledged to help in the investigation;
Whereas, for 12 years, the United States
Government has continually pressed the
Government of Iran to provide any informa-
tion on the whereabouts of Robert Levinson
and to help ensure his prompt and safe re-
turn to his family;
Whereas officials of the Government of
Iran promised their continued assistance to
the relatives of Robert Levinson during the
visit of the family to the Islamic Republic of
Iran in December 2007;
Whereas, in November 2010, the Levinson
family received a video of Mr. Levinson in
captivity, representing the first proof of life
since his disappearance and providing some
initial indications that he was being held
somewhere in southwest Asia;
Whereas, in April 2011, the Levinson family
received a series of pictures of Mr. Levinson,
which provided further indications that he
was being held somewhere in southwest Asia;
Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry
stated on August 28, 2013, ‘‘The United States
respectfully asks the Government of the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran to work cooperatively
with us in our efforts to help U.S. citizen
Robert Levinson.’’;
Whereas, on September 28, 2013, during the
first direct phone conversation between the
heads of governments of the United States
and Iran since 1979, President Barack Obama
raised the case of Robert Levinson to Presi-
dent of Iran Hassan Rouhani and urged the
President of Iran to help locate Mr. Levinson
and reunite him with his family;
Whereas, on August 29, 2014, Secretary of
State Kerry again stated that the United
States ‘‘respectfully request[s] the Govern-
ment of the Islamic Republic of Iran [to]
work cooperatively with us to find Mr.
Levinson and bring him home’’;
Whereas, on January 16, 2016, the Govern-
ment of Iran released five United States citi-
zens detained in Iran;
Whereas, on January 17, 2016, President
Obama stated that, ‘‘even as we rejoice in
the safe return of others, we will never for-
get about Bob’’, referring to Robert
Levinson, and that ‘‘each and every day but
especially today our hearts are with the
Levinson family and we will never rest until
their family is whole again’’;
Whereas, on January 19, 2016, White House
Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that the
United States Government had ‘‘secured a
commitment from the Iranians to use the
channel that has now been opened to secure
the release of those individuals that we know
were being held by Iran . . . to try and gath-
er information about Mr. Levinson’s possible
whereabouts’’;
Whereas the Government of Iran’s most re-
cent commitment to assist in and the diplo-
matic channel dedicated to locating and re-
turning Robert Levinson have not yielded
any meaningful results;
Whereas, on November 23, 2016, the United
Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Deten-
tion (UNWGAD) issued Opinion No. 50/2016,
concerning Robert Levinson in which the
UNWGAD found Iran responsible for the ar-
bitrary detention of Mr. Levinson;
Whereas, on April 25, 2017, the Department
of State issued a statement noting that ‘‘[o]n
the sidelines of the April 25 meeting in Vi-
enna of the Joint Commission overseeing im-
plementation of the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action, the U.S. delegation raised
with the Iranian delegation its serious con-
cerns regarding the cases of U.S. citizens de-
tained and missing in Iran, and called on
Iran to immediately release these U.S. citi-
zens so they can be reunited with their fami-
lies’’;
Whereas, on March 9, 2018, Department of
State Spokesperson Heather Nauert stated,
‘‘Iran committed to cooperating with the
United States to assist us in bringing Robert
Levinson home and we call on Iran to fulfill
this commitment.’’;
Whereas, on November 26, 2013, Mr.
Levinson became the longest held United
States civilian in our Nation’s history;
Whereas March 9, 2019, marks 12 years
since the disappearance of Robert Levinson
from Kish Island, Iran; and
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion continues to offer a $5,000,000 reward for
information leading to Mr. Levinson’s safe
return: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes that Robert Levinson is the
longest held United States civilian in our
Nation’s history;
(2) notes that repeated pledges by officials
of the Government of Iran to provide their
Government’s assistance in the case of Rob-
ert Levinson have not led to any meaningful
progress in locating or returning Robert
Levinson;
(3) urges the Government of Iran to take
meaningful steps towards fulfilling its re-
peated promises to assist in locating and re-
turning Robert Levinson, including by im-
mediately providing all available informa-
tion from all entities of the Government of
Iran regarding the disappearance of Robert
Levinson to the United States Government;
(4) urges the President to make clear that
the return of Robert Levinson is a priority to
the United States and commit to redoubling
United States Government efforts to secure
the release of Robert Levinson;
(5) urges the President and the allies of the
United States to continue to press the Gov-
ernment of Iran at every opportunity to lo-
cate and return Robert Levinson, notwith-
standing ongoing and serious disagreements
the United States Government has with the
Government of Iran on a broad array of
issues, including Iran’s ballistic missile pro-
gram, sponsorship of international ter-
rorism, destabilization of the Middle East,
and human rights abuses;
(6) notes that in addition to these other se-
rious issues, further delay in locating and re-
turning Robert Levinson remains a signifi-
cant obstacle to improving United States-
Iran relations; and
(7) expresses sympathy to the family of
Robert Levinson for their anguish and hope
that their ordeal can be brought to an end in
the near future.

SENATE RESOLUTION 105—SUP-
PORTING THE DESIGNATION OF
MARCH 2019 AS ‘‘NATIONAL
COLORECTAL CANCER AWARE-
NESS MONTH’’
Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr.
MENENDEZ) submitted the following
resolution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 105
Whereas colorectal cancer is the second
leading cause of cancer death among men
and women combined in the United States;
Whereas, in 2019, it is estimated that
145,600 individuals in the United States will
be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and ap-
proximately 51,020 individuals will die from
the disease;
Whereas colorectal cancer is one of the
most preventable forms of cancer because
screening tests can find polyps that can be
removed before becoming cancerous;
Whereas screening tests can detect
colorectal cancer early, which is when the
disease is most treatable;
Whereas the Secretary of Health and
Human Services estimates that if every indi-
vidual who is 50 years of age or older had
regular screening tests, as many as 60 per-
cent of deaths from colorectal cancer could
be prevented;
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for pa-
tients with localized colorectal cancer is 90
percent, but only 39 percent of all diagnoses
occur at that stage;
Whereas colorectal cancer screenings can
effectively reduce the incidence of colorectal
cancer and mortality, but approximately 1 in
3 adults between 50 and 75 years of age are
not up to date with recommended colorectal
cancer screening;
Whereas public awareness and educational
campaigns on colorectal cancer prevention,
screening, and symptoms are held during the
month of March each year; and
Whereas educational efforts can help pro-
vide information to the public on methods of
prevention and screening and symptoms for
early detection of colorectal cancer: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports—
(A) the designation of March 2019 as ‘‘Na-
tional Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month’’;
and
(B) the goals and ideals of National
Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month; and
(2) encourages the people of the United
States to observe National Colorectal Cancer
Awareness Month with appropriate aware-
ness and educational activities.

SENATE RESOLUTION 107—TO AU-
THORIZE TESTIMONY AND REP-
RESENTATION IN UNITED
STATES V. TAUBERT
Mr. MCCONNELL (for himself and
Mr. SCHUMER) submitted the following
resolution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 107
Whereas, in the case of United States v.
Taubert, Cr. No. 19–21, pending in the United
States District Court for the Northern Dis-
trict of New York, the prosecution has re-
quested the production of testimony from
Erin Kurvers, an employee of the office of
former Senator Al Franken;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and
704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government Act of
1978, 2 U.S.C. §§ 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the
Senate may direct its counsel to represent
current and former Members and employees
of the Senate with respect to any subpoena,
order, or request for testimony relating to
their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of
the United States and Rule XI of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under
the control or in the possession of the Senate
may, by the judicial or administrative proc-
ess, be taken from such control or possession
but by permission of the Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence
under the control or in the possession of the
Senate may promote the administration of
justice, the Senate will take such action as
will promote the ends of justice consistent
with the privileges of the Senate: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That Erin Kurvers, a former em-
ployee of the Office of Senator Al Franken,
and any other former employee of the Sen-
ator’s office from whom relevant testimony
may be necessary, are authorized to testify
in the case of United States v. Taubert, except
concerning matters for which a privilege
should be asserted.
SEC. 2. The Senate Legal Counsel is author-
ized to represent Senator Franken and any
former employees of his office in connection
with the production of evidence authorized
in section one of this resolution.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
behalf of myself and the distinguished
Democratic leader, Mr. SCHUMER, I
send to the desk a resolution author-
izing the production of testimony and
representation by the Senate Legal
Counsel, and ask for its immediate
consideration.
Mr. President, this resolution con-
cerns a request for testimony in a
criminal action pending in New York
Federal district court. In this action
the defendant is charged with making
threats, in the course of telephone calls
to former Senator Al Franken’s office,
to kill and inflict bodily harm upon a
former President of the United States.
A trial is scheduled for March 18, 2019.
The prosecution is seeking testimony
from one of the Senator’s former staff
assistants who heard the statements at
issue. Senator Franken would like to
cooperate with this request by pro-
viding relevant former employee testi-
mony from his office.
The enclosed resolution would au-
thorize that staffer, and any other
former employee of the Senator’s office
from whom relevant testimony may be
necessary, to testify in this action,
with representation by the Senate
Legal Counsel of such staffers and Sen-
ator Franken.

In the 27th whereas clause of the preamble,
strike ‘‘approximately 100,000,000 sharks are
killed annually’’ and insert ‘‘millions of
sharks are killed every year in illegal, unre-
ported, and unregulated fisheries’’.
The preamble, as amended, was

The resolution, with its preamble, as
amended, was agreed to as follows:
S. RES. 91
Whereas wildlife has provided numerous
economic, environmental, social, and cul-
tural benefits during the course of human
history and wildlife conservation will secure
those gifts for future generations;
Whereas plant and animal species play an
important role in the stability of diverse
ecosystems around the world and the con-
servation of that biodiversity is critical to
maintain the delicate balance of nature and
keep complex ecosystems thriving;
Whereas millions of individuals in the
United States strongly support the conserva-
tion of wildlife, both domestically and
abroad, and wish to ensure the survival of
species in the wild;
Whereas the trafficking of wildlife, includ-
ing timber and fish, comprises the fourth
largest global illegal trade after narcotics,
the counterfeiting of products and currency,
and human trafficking and has become a
major transnational organized crime with an
estimated worth of as much as $23,000,000,000
annually;
Whereas increased demand in Asia for
high-value illegal wildlife products, particu-
larly elephant ivory and rhinoceros horns,
has triggered substantial and rapid increases
in poaching of those species;
Whereas the trafficking of wildlife is a pri-
mary threat to many wildlife species, includ-
ing elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers,
pangolins, and sharks;
Whereas many different kinds of criminals,
including some terrorist entities and rogue
security personnel, often in collusion with
corrupt government officials, are involved in
wildlife poaching and the movement of ivory
and rhinoceros horns across Africa;
Whereas wildlife poaching presents signifi-
cant security and stability challenges for
military and police forces in African nations
that are often threatened by heavily armed
poachers and the criminal, extremist allies
of those poachers;
Whereas wildlife poaching negatively im-
pacts local communities that rely on natural
resources for economic development, includ-
ing through tourism;
Whereas assisting institutions in devel-
oping nations, including by providing mate-
rial, training, legal, and diplomatic support,
can reduce illegal wildlife trade;
Whereas wildlife provides a multitude of
benefits to all nations and wildlife crime has
wide-ranging economic, environmental, and
social impacts;
Whereas the African Elephant Status Re-
port 2016 issued by the International Union
for Conservation of Nature revealed that the
elephant population of Africa has recently
seen a dramatic decline, mainly due to
poaching, and the continental population is
now thought to be approximately 415,000;
Whereas, from 2007 to 2012, the number of
elephants killed in Kenya increased by more
than 800 percent, from 47 to 387 elephants
killed;
Whereas, between 2002 and 2013, as a result
of poaching, about 65 percent of the forest
elephant population in Central Africa was
killed and forest elephants lost 30 percent of
the geographical range of forest elephants,
placing forest elephants on track for extinc-
tion in the next decade;
Whereas fewer than 50,000 wild Asian ele-
phants remain and poaching of these popu-
lations is on the rise, with an average of 1
elephant poached every week in Burma, driv-
en by demand for elephant skin products;
Whereas the number of rhinoceroses killed
by poachers in South Africa—
(1) dramatically increased from 13 in 2007
to 1,215 in 2014, an increase of more than 9,000
percent; and
(2) was 769 in 2018;
Whereas—
(1) the 3 species of Asian rhinoceroses also
remain under constant threat of poaching;
and
(2) the total populations of Javan and Su-
matran rhinoceros number fewer than 100 in-
dividuals in the wild;
Whereas fewer than 4,000 tigers remain in
the wild throughout Asia;
Whereas pangolins are often referred to as
the most trafficked mammal in the world;
Whereas all 8 pangolin species spanning Af-
rica and Asia are faced with extinction be-
cause pangolin scales are sought after in the
practice of traditional Chinese medicine and
pangolin meat is considered a delicacy;
Whereas the oceans—
(1) cover 3⁄4 of the surface of the Earth;
(2) contain 97 percent of the water on the
Earth;
(3) represent 99 percent of the living space
on the earth by volume; and
(4) contain nearly 200,000 identified animal
species;
Whereas the global market value of marine
and coastal resources and industries is esti-
mated to be approximately $3,000,000,000,000
per year, representing about 5 percent of
global gross domestic product;
Whereas more than 3,000,000,000 people de-
pend on marine and coastal biodiversity for
their livelihoods;
Whereas an estimated 8,000,000 metric tons
of plastic enter the ocean every year, harm-
ing a wide range of wildlife species;
Whereas illegal, unreported, and unregu-
lated fishing (referred to in this preamble as
‘‘IUU fishing’’) represents a multibillion dol-
lar criminal industry that—
(1) undercuts the economic livelihoods of
legitimate fishermen;
(2) weakens marine animal populations;
(3) could potentially pose a threat to inter-
national security; and
(4) threatens food security for communities
around the world;
Whereas overfishing—
(1) contributes to the rapid depletion of
many species of fish; and
(2) hinders efforts to save and restore glob-
al fisheries and the jobs relating to those
fisheries;
Whereas millions of sharks are killed every
year in illegal, unreported, and unregulated
fisheries, often targeted solely for their fins,
and unsustainable trade is the primary cause
of serious population decline in several
shark species, including scalloped hammer-
head sharks, great hammerhead sharks, and
oceanic whitetip sharks;
Whereas the vaquita porpoise of Mexico,
with fewer than 14 individual porpoises re-
maining, is being driven to extinction;
Whereas penal and financial deterrents
can—
(1) improve the ability of governments to
reduce poaching, trafficking, and IUU fish-
ing; and
(2) enhance the capabilities of those gov-
ernments to manage their resources;
Whereas the United States is developing
and implementing measures to address the
criminal, financial, security, and environ-
mental aspects of wildlife trafficking;
Whereas Congress has allocated specific re-
sources to combat wildlife trafficking and
IUU fishing and address additional threats to
wildlife;
Whereas Congress passed the Eliminate,
Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking
Act of 2016 (16 U.S.C. 7601 et seq.) to
strengthen the response of the United States
to the global wildlife trafficking crisis;
Whereas Congress passed the Save Our
Seas Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–265; 132 Stat.
3742)—
(1) to address land- and sea-based sources
of marine debris; and
(2) to promote international action to re-
duce the incidence of marine debris;
Whereas, in December 2013, the United Na-
tions General Assembly proclaimed March 3
as World Wildlife Day to celebrate and raise
awareness of the wild fauna and flora around
the world;
Whereas March 3, 2019, represents the sixth
annual celebration of World Wildlife Day;
Whereas, in 2019, the theme of World Wild-
life Day is ‘‘Life below water: for people and
planet’’; and
Whereas, in 2019, World Wildlife Day com-
memorations will—
(1) raise awareness about the breathtaking
diversity of marine life;
(2) highlight the crucial importance of ma-
rine species to human development; and
(3) encourage future generations to con-
tinue efforts to protect marine ecosystems:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates March 3, 2019, as ‘‘World
Wildlife Day’’;
(2) supports raising awareness of the bene-
fits that wildlife provides to people and the
threats facing wildlife around the world;
(3) supports escalating the fight against
wildlife crime, including wildlife trafficking
and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fish-
ing;
(4) applauds the domestic and inter-
national efforts to escalate the fight against
wildlife crime;
(5) commends the efforts of the United
States to mobilize the entire Federal Gov-
ernment in a coordinated, efficient, and ef-
fective manner for dramatic progress in the
fight against wildlife crime; and
(6) encourages continued cooperation be-
tween the United States, international part-
ners, local communities, nonprofit organiza-
tions, private industry, and other partner or-
ganizations in an effort to conserve and cele-
brate wildlife, preserving this precious re-
source for future generations.

March 12, 2019
The Senator from Rhode Island.
f
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, when we yielded to accommodate
the majority leader, I was talking
about the episode on the Senate floor
with the Republican Senators coming
to bash the Green New Deal. I wanted
to go on to say that the USA Today
editorial—the one saying climate
change is ‘‘a true crisis facing the
United States and the world’’—also
said this about the Green New Deal
critics:
Republicans in the White House and Con-
gress are having a grand old time mocking
the Green New Deal. . . . But the critics owe
this and future generations more than scorn;
they have an obligation to put better ideas
and solutions on the table.
So far we have not seen much from
my Republican colleagues by way of
better or, indeed, any solutions.
Madam President, I would like to
take a moment to express my gratitude
and appreciation to Senators MUR-
KOWSKI and MANCHIN for the joint piece
that they wrote in the ‘‘Washington
Post’’ recently.
I ask unanimous consent to have
that article printed in the RECORD at
the conclusion of my remarks.
So we get that my colleagues don’t
like the Green New Deal.
Let’s consider other proposals. We
have lots of them on the Democratic
side. We have had cap and trade. We
have had ‘‘keep it in the ground.’’ We
have had Green New Deals. We have
had revenue-neutral carbon fee pro-
posals.
Senator VAN HOLLEN, of Maryland, is
here to discuss his ideas. We are ready
here.
Republicans said last week they
wanted innovation to address climate
change—great, me too. But you can’t
count on the innovation fairy to fly
down and wave innovation fairy dust
on the problem and make it go away.
One of the reasons that Senator BAR-
RASSO’s and my bipartisan carbon cap-
ture bill was necessary is because there
was not enough innovation. There was
not enough innovation because,
quoting the USA Today article, ‘‘fossil-
fuel polluters keep using the atmos-
phere as a free waste dump.’’
It is really hard to spur innovation
when there is no revenue in the busi-
ness model. So our bill put revenue in
the business model. We did it in the
form of tax credits.
But the big driver for developing in-
novation and for developing innova-
tive, new technologies would be a price
on carbon, just like Senator SCHATZ
and I have in our American Oppor-
tunity Carbon Fee Act—a revenue-neu-
tral, border-adjustable carbon fee. This
bill passes all the major Republican
tests. It is a market solution that fixes
a market failure. It does not grow gov-
ernment or regulation, and it does not
put American industry at a disadvan-
tage against foreign competitors. It
will drive innovation: Put a $50 per ton
price on carbon emissions, and every
polluter paying the price has an incen-
tive to spend up to $49 per ton on solu-
tions. That is how you get innovation.
This carbon pricing idea has support
from a swath of senior Republican offi-
cials, including seven Chairs of the
Council of Economic Advisers, six cur-
rent and former Members of Congress,
four EPA Administrators, three Secre-
taries of State or Treasury, two Chairs
of the Federal Reserve, and one Con-
gressional Budget Office Director—all
Republicans. Some of these Repub-
licans were members of a group of
prominent economists, including 27
Nobel Prize winners, who recently pub-
lished this statement in the Wall
Street Journal editorial page sup-
porting just the kind of carbon fee
model that is the basis of Senator
SCHATZ’s and my legislation. Since
then, over 3,500 U.S. economists have
signed this statement, and that is be-
cause it is pretty obvious how you have
to solve this problem, once you want
to.
Former Republican Congressman Bob
Inglis has been very active in this area.
He said of our carbon fee proposal:
‘‘Democrats . . . have offered Repub-
licans an olive limb, not just an olive
branch.’’
We are trying to reach out. We are
trying to get to yes, and that olive
branch will remain extended as long as
it takes.
If you think all of our bills are no
good, come up with something better,
for Pete’s sake. Give it a try. I am
ready to work with Republicans on
passing a carbon fee or other climate
change legislation. I think I have
proved that by working in a bipartisan
fashion. But when Republicans will not
propose anything and will not agree to
anything—even an olive limb offered to
them—then, that is a pretty strong
sign that there is something more
going on than objections to a Green
New Deal. If you don’t like the Green
New Deal, tell us what you do like. Go
the carbon fee route. Go ‘‘leave it in
the ground’’—whatever. But please,
let’s get together and solve this prob-
lem.
As USA Today said, ‘‘the American
people are getting impatient.’’
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the Washington Post, March 8, 2019]
LISA MURKOWSKI AND JOE MANCHIN: IT’S TIME
TO ACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE—RESPONSIBLY
(By Lisa Murkowski and Joe Manchin)
Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, represents
Alaska in the U.S. Senate, Joe Manchin, A
Democrat, represents West Virginia in the
U.S. Senate.
The two of us have more in common than
might meet the eye. We come from different
parties, but we are both avid outdoorsmen
and represent states that take great pride in
the resources we provide to the nation and to
friends and allies around the world. Alaska
and West Virginia know that resource devel-
opment and environmental stewardship must
move in tandem, which is why we are com-
mitted to putting forward bipartisan solu-
tions to help address climate change.
There is no question that climate change is
real or that human activities are driving
much of it. We are seeing the impacts in our
home states. Scientists tell us that the Arc-
tic is warming at twice the rate of the rest
of the world. Rising temperatures and dimin-
ishing sea ice on Alaska’s shores are affect-
ing our fisheries and forcing some remote
communities to seek partial or total reloca-
tion. In summer 2016, West Virginia experi-
enced unprecedented flooding that killed 23
residents and inflicted tremendous damage
across the state.
Congress is in the middle of a debate about
the appropriate way to tackle climate
change. This is often portrayed as an issue
with just two sides—those who support dras-
tic, unattainable measures to reduce green-
house-gas emissions, and those who want to
do nothing. We believe the time for sensa-
tionalism is over. And we are seeking ideas
that will bring people together, rather than
drive them apart.
On the Senate Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee, we are working together
to find pragmatic policies that can draw
strong and enduring support. In our hearings
this year, we have heard from a range of ex-
perts who are helping us to gather facts that
shape these efforts.
Just this week, we held a hearing focused
on climate change and the electricity sector.
We heard that utilities are pursuing cleaner
energy technologies and integrating them
into their networks. These changes to the
generation mix reduced carbon dioxide emis-
sions by 28 percent between 2005 and 2017 and
lowered costs to consumers.
Yet, our witnesses also agreed that to ef-
fectively mitigate the impacts of climate
change, we must do more to pursue low- and
zero-carbon technologies that will continue
to lower emissions.
The United States leads the world in re-
search and development. Our national labs
and universities are working toward the next
scientific breakthrough, and private inves-
tors are pursuing the next game-changing
technology. The United States is at the fore-
front of clean-energy efforts, including en-
ergy storage, advanced nuclear energy, and
carbon capture, utilization and sequestra-
tion. We are committed to adopting reason-
able policies that maintain that edge, build
on and accelerate current efforts, and ensure
a robust innovation ecosystem.
The impact of developing these new tech-
nologies will be felt by Americans from all
walks of life, including residents of rural
communities and other areas served by older
technologies. Transitioning these commu-
nities to more efficient forms of energy will
provide them with cleaner energy that is
also more stable and has lower costs, which
will bring about additional benefits.
American ingenuity has solved many of
the great challenges of our time and is key
to addressing climate change. If the United
States is going to lead by example, we must
continue to lead the world in the develop-
ment of new and improved technologies. On
the Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee, we agree it is time to act. And that
is why we will work to find responsible solu-
tions worthy of West Virginians, Alaskans
and all Americans.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am now honored to yield the
floor to my distinguished colleague
from Maryland who has been working
on this issue in the House before he
came to the Senate and has become a
real leader in our Senate caucus, Sen-
ator VAN HOLLEN.

ator from Maryland.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1802 March 12, 2019
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Thank you,
Madam President. I want to start by
thanking my friend, the Senator from
Rhode Island, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, for his
leadership on addressing the climate
issue for many, many years, taking to
the floor of the Senate time and again
to raise the alarm about the dangers of
climate change and what it means to
communities throughout this country
and people throughout the world, and,
much more than that, putting forward
very specific ideas—constructive
ideas—on how we can address this issue
together. I am proud to join the legis-
lation that he referenced, along with
Senator BARRASSO, to look at carbon
capture technologies and to incentivize
those technologies, as Mr. WHITEHOUSE
indicated. It is a small measure but
maybe a first baby step that we can
work on here together.
Like the Senator from Rhode Island,
I have been listening carefully to the
floor discussion over the last couple of
weeks. I have heard many of our Re-
publican colleagues come to the floor.
They have come to criticize the Green
New Deal. The Green New Deal, of
course, is a very ambitious set of goals
to address the crisis of global climate
change and to put out some ideas for
how we address this generational chal-
lenge.
While I heard a lot of criticism, as
Senator WHITEHOUSE said, I didn’t hear
a single—not one—idea about how we
can work together to significantly ad-
dress this challenge, which is why
Democrats have asked our Republican
colleagues to join us in supporting S. J.
Res. 9, which was introduced by Sen-
ator CARPER, along with the Democrats
and, I am pleased to say, one Repub-
lican. The question, of course, is where
are the other 52 Republicans when this
is the language? I am going to read it
because it is very straightforward, and
I think the American public will ask
themselves why we don’t have 100 Sen-
ators on this piece of legislation:
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled, That it is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) climate change is real;
(2) human activity during the last century
is the dominant cause of climate crisis; and
(3) the United States and Congress should
take immediate action to address the chal-
lenge of climate change.
It is simple, straightforward. I want
to just take these very quickly, one at
a time.
‘‘Climate change is real.’’ Look, we
all know that there are a few green-
house gases. You have methane, which
is a very potent greenhouse gas. But
the most prevalent one, of course, is
carbon dioxide. It is a greenhouse gas,
and you can measure the concentration
of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.
You can go out and take samples and
measure it.
In doing that, we find that we have
seen huge increases in the concentra-
tion of carbon dioxide in our atmos-
phere over the last 100 years.
I am proud to represent the State of
Maryland, which is home to NASA
Goddard, where they do a lot of climate
science, and home to NOAA, or the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration. I am holding the latest
measurement they did in January 2019.
It shows the carbon dioxide in the at-
mosphere at 411 ppm. That is a jump
just from 2006, when it was at about 380
ppm. If you look at that over time, you
see a big jump in concentration. These
are greenhouse gases, and that is why
you see, of course, the increasing tem-
peratures.
I am now holding in my hand some-
thing from NASA that just came out
on February 6 of this year, headlined
‘‘2018 fourth warmest year in continued
warming trend, according to NASA,
NOAA.’’ It points out that globally 2018
temperatures ranked behind those of
2016, 2017 and 2015, and it goes on to say
that the past 5 years are collectively
the warmest years in modern record.
So there are large concentrations of
CO2 and rising temperatures. I hope our
Republican colleagues will agree with
us on that point in the resolution.
No. 2 is that it is caused by ‘‘human
activity.’’ There is no doubt that if you
look at how fossil fuels that were in
our Earth for millions of years have
been released during the Industrial
Revolution in the last century—be it
from coal-fired powerplants, oil, or
gas—all of a sudden you saw this car-
bon which had been trapped in the
Earth released into the atmosphere
through human activity, and that also
is measurable.
So I hope our Republican colleagues
will agree with us on those two points,
and if they agree with us on those
points, then I hope they will agree with
us that we should all do something
about it, because the consequences of
climate change are very real, and we
can see them all around us.
Senator WHITEHOUSE mentioned a re-
cent study that showed that the prob-
ability that the scientists were wrong
was .001 percent—negligible.
We just saw last Thanksgiving—this
last year at Thanksgiving time—that
300 U.S. scientists issued the Fourth
National Climate Assessment. I have a
copy of part of that in my hand right
here, and they make it very clear—
these are U.S. scientists—that the im-
pact of these growing temperatures is
real and, of course, we see them all
around us in the form of much more ex-
treme and frequent droughts. We see it
in the form of more forest fires. We see
it in the form of flooding and sea level
rise. We see it all over our country in
every community and all over the
world. The costs of doing nothing are
mounting by the day.
If you look at this report that was
issued around Thanksgiving, they also
talk about the regional impact of dis-
ruption and of the impacts of climate
change. They look at different regions
around the country, including the
Northeast. Of course, Senator WHITE-
HOUSE represents Rhode Island, and I
have the honor of representing Mary-
land. It says these areas, these regions,
will get hot faster than many other
areas.
It also talks about the impact of cli-
mate change on the Chesapeake Bay,
which is a national treasure and is very
important to Maryland’s economy.
They predict stronger and more fre-
quent storms and an increase in rain,
which will lead to more pollution in
the bay, increased water temperatures,
and sea level rise. By the way, one is-
land has already disappeared in the
Chesapeake Bay, and a couple more
look like they will be going under in
the coming years because of sea level
rise.
If you go to the Naval Academy in
Annapolis and you talk to folks there,
they will tell you that they are already
experiencing the negative impact of
flooding and sea level rise right there
at the Naval Academy. Of course, our
military has warned for years about
the consequences of climate change.
I just want to give a very simple
analogy since I mentioned the Chesa-
peake Bay. Like many of us, we have
worked hard to protect water bodies in
this country, and the Chesapeake Bay
is an incredible natural estuary. Years
ago, everyone recognized that the bay
was dying. We saw more sewer over-
flows into the bay because we didn’t
have enough sewage treatment plants.
We saw runoff from suburban roads and
highways. We saw nutrient runoff from
farms in the Chesapeake Bay water-
shed. The bay was on its way down
fast. Of course, with all of those nutri-
ents in the watershed, you lose the oys-
ters, the crabs, and the seafood indus-
try. You lose the Chesapeake Bay.
The same thing is, of course, hap-
pening to our planet. Just like with the
Chesapeake Bay, there is a limit to
how much carbon pollution you can
put on our planet. We have all seen
those amazing photographs of the
Earth from outer space. The Earth is
telling us that there is a limit as to
how much carbon pollution we can
spew into it, and it is telling us by its
screaming out with these extreme
weather events. So the real question is,
What are we going to do about it?
As Senator WHITEHOUSE said, there
are many things we should be doing. I
will close my remarks by mentioning
one that also involves putting a price
on carbon because, among the array of
tools we need to deploy, that really
needs to be one of them. It is really
based on the simple idea we have pur-
sued in this country to fight pollution,
which is that the polluter pays, right?
The folks—the industries—who are
causing the pollution that is impacting
our communities in harmful ways
should pay. How do you make them
pay? You put a price on the carbon pol-
lution that is being emitted. When you
put a price on the carbon pollution
that is being emitted, there is an in-
centive to emit less of it, and there is
an incentive for others to find innova-
tive ways to generate energy without
there being carbon pollution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1803
March 12, 2019
That is why, for many years, I pro-
posed what is called the cap and divi-
dend bill, which looks at the science
and says: OK, if we want to make sure
to avoid these huge costs to our com-
munities, we have to limit the amount
of carbon pollution that is being emit-
ted.
We base that cap on science, and that
generates a price for carbon. That
means, as Senator WHITEHOUSE said,
that in order to avoid that price, peo-
ple will look for ways to reduce carbon
emissions. We take the funds generated
from putting a price on carbon, and we
rebate those funds to the American
people. A study by an economist at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst
found that if you do that—if you rebate
the funds you generate by putting a
price on carbon and making polluters
pay and if you rebate that to American
households—80 percent of American
households will actually have more
money in their pockets at the end of
the day than they started with. That
doesn’t even count the additional bene-
fits from there being a cleaner environ-
ment and fewer storms and severe
weather events. It also doesn’t include
the incredible economic opportunities
that would be unleashed by having
more people invest in clean energy
technology and energy efficiency.
So it is really a pleasure to be here
with my friend Senator WHITEHOUSE
because that is one tool among others,
including the need to invest in more re-
search. The Senator said you have to
put some resources behind research and
innovation. It doesn’t just happen by
magic. We can have clean energy port-
folio standards, we can do a lot of
things, but we need to start with some-
thing real. That is why we are here, be-
cause that is the final part of that res-
olution. It is a very simple resolution
that says that climate change is real,
that it is caused by human activity,
and that the U.S. Congress should take
immediate action to address the chal-
lenge.
It is time for our colleagues to stop
criticizing everybody else’s ideas and
to put their own ideas on the table. We
are ready to work with our colleagues
on a bipartisan basis to address this
most pressing of issues that face our
country and the world.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I may, Madam
President, I would like to remark on
the figure that Senator VAN HOLLEN
used of the recent measurement in our
atmosphere of a carbon dioxide con-
centration of 411 parts per million.
Standing on its own, that may not
seem particularly significant, so let’s
put that into context.
NASA, which Senator VAN HOLLEN
mentioned and which has important fa-
cilities in Maryland, has been meas-
uring this for a long time.
By the way, I think NASA’s sci-
entists have demonstrated they know
what they are talking about. They
have rovers driving around on Mars
right now, so they know what they are
talking about.
The scientists have gone back and de-
termined what the carbon dioxide lev-
els were on Earth over a period of
400,000 years. If you look back, there is
a graph that NASA has that shows the
carbon dioxide levels ramping up and
down, up and down, over 400,000 years.
For that entire time, the levels have
stayed between 180 parts per million
and 300 parts per million. That was the
range within which the entire human
species experienced our development—
180 parts per million at the low and 300
parts per million at the high. At 411,
we are now out of that range by almost
the entire range. We are not out by a
little; we are out of that range by a lot.
Also, 400,000 years is a very long
time. If you look at how long human-
kind has been farming—kind of the
basic, organized activity of our spe-
cies—the common view is that we real-
ly started farming about 12,000 years
ago. Some people push that number
further, more towards 20,000 years. We
invented the wheel a little over 5,000
years ago in Mesopotamia. If you think
about the first people who put seeds in
the ground and planted farms, you only
go back 12,000 to 20,000 years. If you
think about the first people who rolled
a wagon or a chariot on a wheel, you
only go back about 5,000 years. This
record goes back 400,000 years. They
know it because you can go into an-
cient ice, and you can find bubbles of
air from tens and hundreds of thou-
sands of years ago, and you can test
them. I have been to the freezer at
Ohio State University, which is where
they keep the cores they have drilled
out of glaciers, and I have seen how
they go back and do these micro meas-
urements that let you know what the
carbon dioxide levels were. So we are
not off by a little, folks; we are off by
a lot.
When you consider the known sci-
entific effect of carbon dioxide con-
centrations, we have known what it
has done. This has been a greenhouse
gas since Abraham Lincoln rode around
in his top hat. This is not scientific
news; we know this stuff.
When you consider that we are that
far out of the range that has made
human life and development com-
fortable on this planet throughout the
entire duration of our species—that we
are out of that range for the first time
in 400,000 years and are out of that
range by an amount that is practically
equal to the entire range itself—if that
is not a signal for us to wake up and
pay attention, I don’t know what is.
The fact that the fossil fuel industry
can drown out that signal with its po-
litical signal in this body is astound-
ing.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, if I might, that is why it is al-
ways interesting to hear some of the
critics of climate change say: Do you
know what? Carbon dioxide has been
around since the beginning of the plan-
et, so it can’t possibly be harmful.
Of course it has been around forever,
but, as Senator WHITEHOUSE pointed
out, it has been around for hundreds of
thousands and millions of years at a
certain concentration. If you look at
all of the evidence from NASA sci-
entists and others, you will see that
level of concentration bumped up and
down within a certain range for all of
those millennia that the Senator
talked about. Yet, in the last 150 years,
especially the last century, it shot
straight through the roof. It is an ex-
cellent example of the phrase ‘‘every-
thing in moderation.’’
Obviously, carbon dioxide has been
part of our planet’s gases all along, but
the fact is that we have unleashed that
carbon dioxide, in the form of fossil
fuels, that has been trapped in the
Earth for millions and millions of
years. We have somehow just let it out
within the last 100, and that is what is
creating harmful, poisonous levels of
carbon dioxide that are poisonous for
the planet. Just like with a human
being, when you put poison in the body,
the body lets you know. The Earth is
screaming out in all of these different
ways to let us know that it has reached
its limit when it comes to carbon diox-
ide pollution. That is why we have to
do something about it.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Arsenic, too, is a
naturally occurring substance, but you
don’t want too much of it.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. There you go.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank Senator
VAN HOLLEN for joining me in this col-
loquy and for speaking today on the
floor.
I see the distinguished ranking mem-
ber of the Finance Committee here.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, just
before they leave, I thank both Senator
WHITEHOUSE and Senator VAN HOLLEN
for conveying the urgency behind this
climate change issue. Both of them
have gone through the specifics of what
this is all about. Suffice it to say, I
share many of the concerns they have
been discussing here this evening. I
thank them.
f
NOMINATION OF NEOMI J. RAO
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, to-
night, the Senate is debating another
Trump judicial nominee who is at-
tempting to run away from appalling
statements they wrote in the not-so-
distant past. This time, it is Neomi
Rao, who is up for a lifetime appoint-
ment to the powerful DC Circuit Court
of Appeals.
While studying at Yale, Ms. Rao
wrote that sexual assault victims were
partly to blame for having been as-
saulted.
She ridiculed feminism and women’s
rights activists. She attacked groups
that promoted multiculturalism and
minority rights. She belittled those
who fought for LGBTQ rights. She
wrote that warnings about what we
now identify as climate change are, in
effect, fake news. And that’s not all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1804 March 12, 2019
After these writings came to light,
she stuck to the same script as the
other Trump nominees have done who
found themselves in the same position.
They say: It is all way in the past. I
have grown up. I no longer hold those
views.
Except in Ms. Rao’s case, she cannot
plausibly claim the views she put into
writing back then would have no bear-
ing on how she would decide cases as a
judge today. That is because you can
see those extreme views reflected in
the work she is doing right now as the
head of the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs.
This is an office that doesn’t get a lot
of time in the spotlight, but the indi-
vidual in charge of that office has more
power to shape Federal rules than al-
most anyone outside the Oval Office.
During Ms. Rao’s time as the head of
this program, she has taken a buzz saw
to protections for women’s health, for
sexual assault victims on college cam-
puses, for LGBTQ Americans, and for
Black and Latino Americans.
Under her watch, the Trump adminis-
tration has allowed polluting corpora-
tions to poison Americans’ air and
water, propped up dirty powerplants
that belch carbon into the skies, and
added to the extreme dangers of cli-
mate change.
During her nomination hearing, she
called—and this was her description—
some of what she wrote
‘‘cringeworthy.’’ She wrote a letter to
the Judiciary Committee saying she
was sorry, and that’s all well and good,
but it doesn’t change the fact that she
has helped turn those same extreme
views—those same extreme views—into
Federal policy under President Trump.
To help spell this out, as they say on
so many television shows: Go to the
tape.
In the long essay titled ‘‘The Femi-
nist Dilemma’’ published in the mid-
1990s, Ms. Rao laid out her views on a
range of issues dealing with women’s
rights and sexual violence. At the time,
our country was waking up to the fact
that most sexual assaults are not ran-
dom acts of violence committed in
dark alleyways; they are committed by
someone the victim knows.
The term ‘‘date rape’’ was relatively
new to a lot of people. In this essay she
wrote: ‘‘Although I am certainly not
arguing that date rape victims ask for
it,’’ she did exactly that—several
times. She put the burden on women to
prevent their assaults.
She also described ‘‘The dangerous
feminist idealism which teaches
women that they are equal.’’ That is an
exact quote—‘‘dangerous idealism
which teaches women that they are
equal.’’
She went on, ‘‘Women believe falsely
that they should be able to go any-
where with anyone.’’ That is a quote.
‘‘Women believe falsely that they
should be able to go anywhere with
anyone.’’
Now, as I noted already, Ms. Rao has
tried to separate herself during her
nomination from those thoughts—what
she wrote as a younger person—but she
continues to double down on these
views and their influence in her cur-
rent position.
A few years ago, there was an effort
to strengthen Federal rules to reduce
sexual assaults on campus and compel
schools to do a better job of protecting
women. With Ms. Rao’s help, Education
Secretary Betsy DeVos and Donald
Trump are now rolling those protec-
tions back.
Ms. Rao has also taken steps to roll
back rules designed to fight wage dis-
crimination and sexual harassment
against women in the workplace. She
worked to make it harder for women to
get no-cost contraception under the Af-
fordable Care Act.
Now I am going to turn to her views
on the rights of other groups. LGBTQ
Americans, Black, and Latino Ameri-
cans are just several examples.
Here she has attacked so-called
multiculturalists, writing: ‘‘Under-
neath their touchy-feely talk of toler-
ance, they seek to undermine Amer-
ican culture.’’ When you read that sen-
tence, it seems like she believed the
American culture in need of protecting
is actually one of intolerance.
Now, she protested that ‘‘homo-
sexuals want to redefine marriage and
parenthood,’’ to which I say: Anyone
like Rao, who defines marriage and
parenthood by limiting the definition
of love, is just wrong and, frankly, un-
American.
She even blasted African-American
and Latino fraternities and sororities,
arguing they were the ones who didn’t
understand the true meaning of Dr.
King’s ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech.
In a book review, she praised an au-
thor for writing:
Perhaps it is time to stop thinking of
blacks—and having them think of them-
selves—as a category. Let them rise or fall
as individuals.
A nominee for the Federal bench
ought to be able to recognize that the
design of racism has been to have soci-
ety and governments at all levels in
this country discriminate against Afri-
can Americans as a category and to
prevent individuals and their families
from rising from this hardship.
Again, Ms. Rao can try and try and
try some more to distance herself from
these writings, but she cannot distance
herself from the work she does right
now in her current job.
Civil rights activists scored a major
victory in a recent Supreme Court
case, Texas Department of Housing and
Community Affairs v. The Inclusive
Communities Project. The case dealt
with what have come to be known as
the ‘‘disparate impact’’ regulations.
The Court held that housing policies
that inadvertently discriminate
against minorities violate the Fair
Housing Act. That type of ‘‘disparate
impact’’ regulation exists across Fed-
eral law. But right now, with Ms. Rao’s
help, Donald Trump is working to undo
these protections. Here I quote from
the Washington Post:
The Trump administration is considering a
far-reaching rollback of civil rights law that
would dilute Federal rules against discrimi-
nation in education, housing, and other as-
pects of American life.
This article continues:
Past Republican administrations have
done little to erode the concept’s applica-
tion, partly out of concern that the Supreme
Court might disagree, or that such changes
would be unpopular and viewed as racist.
Apparently, that is not a big enough
concern to stop Ms. Rao and the Trump
administration.
Now, briefly, I would like to look at
her writings on climate and environ-
mental protection.
She mocked what she called the
‘‘three major environmental bogey-
men, the greenhouse effect, the deplet-
ing ozone layer, and the dangers of acid
rain.’’
In an extraordinary twist of logic,
she suggested that people who warned
about climate change were clinging to
a ‘‘dangerous orthodoxy’’—her quote—
‘‘with no reference to the prevailing
scientific doubts.’’
Her work at the Trump administra-
tion shows no change in perspective.
Fuel economy standards that reduce
carbon emissions and save drivers
money at the pump have been axed by
the Trump administration and Ms.
Rao. The Clean Power Plan—gone
under with the Trump administration
and Neomi Rao. Rules cracking down
on mercury pollution, which causes
brain damage to kids, weakened by the
Trump administration and Ms. Rao.
Rules designed to protect workers from
exposure to dangerous chemicals on
the job—rolled back again by Ms. Rao
and the Trump administration. The list
can go on.
This nominee’s record shows, in my
view, that an apology is not enough—
even a written one—because the shock-
ing and offensive views she put into
words in the past are reflected by her
work in the present.
It is all right here in her CV as a
Trump official. She is responsible for
those policies that lead to more dis-
crimination, that are taking rights and
protections away from women, Black
Americans, and Latino Americans.
She doesn’t even have a long record
of legal experience which she can fall
back on and cite qualifications. Her
qualifications seem to be her extreme
views and membership in the far-right
Federalist Society—a well-funded out-
side group that the Trump administra-
tion has empowered to fill the judici-
ary with extreme nominees from well
outside the mainstream.
Actions Ms. Rao has been green-
lighting have been challenged in court,
and rulings against them have made
clear that the Trump administration is
willing to break the law to get their
preferred ideological outcome.
For example, just last week, a Fed-
eral judge slammed Ms. Rao’s actions
to undo efforts to crack down on wage
discrimination. The judge said Ms.
Rao’s decision was arbitrary, it was ca-
pricious, and unsupported by any anal-
ysis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1805
March 12, 2019
Perhaps that is why, during her nom-
ination hearing, she refused to recuse
herself from cases involving issues she
worked on during the Trump adminis-
tration.
So here is my bottom line. The Sen-
ate has seen this before—Trump nomi-
nees with extreme, offensive, and what
are essentially incendiary writings
from the past. In Ms. Rao’s case, there
are current examples of how she has
not left those views in the past.
When it was Ryan Bounds nominated
to the Ninth Circuit, this body—the
U.S. Senate—stood up and said no. Mr.
Bounds’ views were extreme. More im-
portantly, he knew it, and he hid them.
In my view, it is time to take a stand
once more in the Senate, where Ms.
Rao’s views are on display for all to
see. I am going to be a no on the nomi-
nation of Neomi Rao. I urge my col-
leagues to join me.
I yield the floor.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOSEPH
WALSH’S 100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. MIKE LEVIN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the 100th birthday of
veteran, father, husband, and friend to many,
Joseph Walsh.
Joe was born on March 18, 1919 in East
Orange, New Jersey. After graduating from
high school, Joe was inspired by a family
friend’s stories of World War I to enlist in the
Marines in April 1938.
Joe was serving in the Marine Corps’ Third
Defense Battalion at the Navy Yard in Pearl
Harbor on December 7, 1941, one of the most
pivotal days in American history. Joe was at-
tending a morning color guard ceremony when
the attack began. The next two hours were
‘‘all confusion,’’ as Joe characterizes it. His
battalion fired anti-aircraft machine guns at the
Japanese planes as they headed towards the
Navy Yard.
Joe never spoke about his experience at
Pearl Harbor when his children were growing
up. He is the last surviving member of the
Pearl Harbor Survivor Association’s North
County Chapter 31 and served as the organi-
zation’s president for many years. As Presi-
dent, Joe organized the annual memorial cere-
mony at Oceanside Harbor and campaigned
for the installation of Oceanside’s Pearl Harbor
memorial monument in 2006.
Joe met LaVonne ‘‘Bea’’ Phaneuf in 1945 at
a friend’s wedding. Many years later, Joe still
remembers the baby blue dress Bea wore that
night. Bea was one of 23,000 women who en-
listed in the Marines during the war. She was
a member of the Aviation Women’s Reserve
Squadron 21 at Quantico, Virginia. Joe and
Bea have been married since 1946 and have
six children.
As parents, Joe and Bea instilled values of
telling the truth, respecting others, and taking
care of those in need. Joe was always giving
away things that others needed even when his
family had very little. Joe can talk to anyone
and somehow make them laugh.
Joe Walsh has lived an incredible and full
life. He is a true inspiration for our community,
and we cannot thank him enough for his serv-
ice to his country.
Joe Walsh will be celebrating his birthday
on March 18 with friends and family in Vista,
California. I am honored to pay tribute to Joe,
and I wish him a very happy 100th birthday.

MAJ SEAN M. DONOHUE TRIBUTE
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Major Sean M. Donohue of the
United States Army for his extraordinary dedi-
cation to duty and service to the U.S. House
of Representatives and our Nation. Major
Donohue will soon transition from his current
assignment as an Army Congressional Liaison
in the U.S. House of Representatives to serve
as the Command Surgeon for the Center for
Initial Military Training at the U.S. Army Train-
ing and Doctrine Command. This unit is the
largest charged with training all initial entry
Soldiers in the Army.
A native of Tacoma, WA, Major Donohue
began his military career after graduating from
the University of Puget Sound, enlisting after
the 9/11 attacks as a medic in 2002. He was
commissioned in 2009, completed his clinical
training as a Physician Assistant at Fort Car-
son in Colorado and promptly deployed to Af-
ghanistan as a Battalion Surgeon with the
173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team. Since
then, Major Donohue has served in numerous
leadership and staff positions around the
world. His wife, Lexey, is a dedicated military
spouse and they have three handsome boys:
William, Jack and Maximus.
In 2017, Army Medicine selected Major
Donohue to serve as Legislative Liaison in the
Army House Liaison Office. In his role as a
legislative liaison, Major Donohue served as
the primary liaison between Members of the
115th and 116th Congresses, their Staff, Leg-
islative Committees, and the U.S. Army. In this
role, he planned, coordinated, and accom-
panied Congressional and Staff Delegations
on numerous worldwide fact-finding and inves-
tigative missions. Major Donohue built the re-
lationships and trust needed to increase the
trust and confidence the U.S. Congress has in
the U.S. Army.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize
the selfless service of Major Donohue and his
family as they continue to serve our great Na-
tion in the next chapter of his remarkable ca-
reer.

REMEMBERING MODEANE
THOMPSON
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the life of the late Modeane Nich-
ols Thompson, a founding member of the
Memphis Panel of American Women, whose
quiet resolve to establish racial and sectarian
reconciliation and understanding during tense
times in the 1960s will be long remembered.
Mrs. Thompson, a longtime family advocate
with Family Service of Memphis, died Feb-
ruary 25 at the age of 89. An African Amer-
ican and Roman Catholic, Mrs. Thompson
joined with Joyce Blackmon, Dorothy ‘‘Happy’’
Jones, Jeanne Varnell and Jocelyn Wurzburg
to demonstrate that people of different races
and religions could establish lasting relation-
ships and bridge cultural divides. Mrs. Thomp-
son was a calming influence in Memphis as a
voice and early advocate for the communities
of South Memphis where lives were disrupted
by urban renewal. She was quoted in the na-
tionally circulated Redbook magazine in 1964
in an article about racial prejudice entitled
‘‘What Can I Tell My Children?’’ She was a
natural fit for the women’s panel, which she
told The Commercial Appeal was ‘‘designed to
confront historically difficult issues in an open
and civil manner. We hoped open dialogue
and minds between people for the first time.’’
A lifelong member of the NAACP and the Na-
tional Conference of Christians and Jews, her
work was honored by the National Under-
ground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati
in 2006 and by the Women’s Foundation for a
Greater Memphis, with its Legends Award, in
2014. I extend my condolences to her five
children, seven grandchildren and three great-
grandchildren, her extended family and her
many friends.

WINNING THE NATIONAL ASSO-
CIATION OF INTERCOLLEGIATE
ATHLETICS NATIONAL TITLE
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the Keiser University men’s
swimming team and their coach Adam Epstein
on winning the 2019 National Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) national title.
Coach Esptein leads by example. His dedi-
cation to Keiser University and its swimming
program is truly commendable. Not only has
Coach Esptein been named Coach of the
Year for the second time, since forming his
team in 2017, but in just three seasons he has
led the Seahawks to two NAIA national titles.
This year’s championship team had many
standout swimmers. Junior Marcel Nagy won
three events and was named the NAIA Swim-
mer of the Year. Freshman Pol Roch won the
500 meter free-style and set a national record
in winning the 400 meter individual medley.
Lukan Macek and Joel Hannson made their
teammates proud with their respective per-
formances in the 200 breaststroke, and Jan
Suchan won his third national championship in
the 100 meter breaststroke. The Seahawks
won all five relays in the competition and to-
taled 622 points to win the national title.
Madam Speaker, I would like to congratu-
late Dr. Arthur and Mrs. Belinda Keiser, the
Keiser University Seahawks’ Swim Team, and
Coach Adam Epstein on this momentous win.
It is my distinct honor to be the University’s
representative in Congress. I wish Keiser Uni-
versity and its swimming program many more
years of continued success.

HON. LIZ CHENEY
OF WYOMING
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Scott Talbott on his retirement
as Director of the Wyoming Game and Fish
Department.
I have had the pleasure of knowing Mr.
Talbott for many years, and his tireless work
to ensure hunting and recreation in Wyoming
remains available and open to the public is
much appreciated.
A third-generation Wyoming native, Mr.
Talbott spent much of his adult life working to
protect and preserve wildlife in Wyoming. Dur-
ing his 34 years at the department, Mr. Talbott
has served in several positions working his
way up to eventually serve as Director. It has
been a privilege working with Mr. Talbott to
ensure stewardship of Wyoming’s world-class
wildlife.
Again, Madam Speaker, I would like to con-
gratulate and thank Scott Talbott for his years
of dedicated service to the people and wildlife
of Wyoming.
HONORING FATHER P. MARTIN
‘‘MARTY’’ DONNELLY
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, it is with
deepest sorrow, highest esteem, and abiding
gratitude that I include in the RECORD the trib-
ute delivered by Father Tony Gallagher in
honor of the life of Reverend Paul Martin
‘‘Marty’’ Donnelly on February 1, 2019 at the
Most Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in
Toledo, Ohio. Father Marty will be dearly re-
membered as a faithful Roman Catholic priest,
a servant of God, who gave his unselfish and
purposeful life to the people of Greater To-
ledo. Following the tribute is Father Donnelly’s
obituary.
HOMILY: MARTY’S FUNERAL MASS (EXCERPTS)
(Isaiah 61:1–11, Psalm 27, Acts 10:34–43, Luke
10:25–37)
A giant among us has left us. Reverend
Marty Donnelly has transitioned to the joy
of eternal glory, but hurt in our pain of loss.
First and understandably, we all offer spe-
cial and prayerful sympathy to those closest
to Marty: Pat, his only brother-in-law; his
devoted nieces and nephews; his close friend
Tom Landgraff; and his beloved cousins, par-
ticularly his second cousin Dorothy Taylor (I
always found it awkward to call her
‘‘Buck’’). Unquestionably, Buck warrants the
deep gratitude of all of us for her many,
many years of extraordinary, dedicated, and
unselfish caretaking for Marty right up to
the end.
But what is the end? What is death? Here
is my version of another better-phrased
story: freighter fully loaded leaving a dock
at Toledo Terminal on the Maumee River—
dock workers shout ‘‘There she goes’’ as the
ship is seen as a speck between the water of
the bay and the sky—fully, loaded the ship is
observed by someone on Put-in-Bay who
shouts ‘‘Here she comes’’—the loaded ship is
the same, the absence or change is in the To-
ledo workers—and that is death.
Today we grieve the absence of Marty Don-
nelly. Yet we believe that angels have al-
ready shouted ‘‘Here he comes.’’ Marty Don-
nelly knew that if life has the last word,
then love must overcome negativity and dis-
cord, forgiveness must overcome bitterness,
and generosity must overcome greed.
Marty had such faith. Yet, with great zest
he appealingly owned his own humanity and
was clearly animated by a profound prayer
life, by the teachings of Vatican II and Pope
Francis, and by a continued embrace of Sa-
cred Scripture.
Consider our first reading from Isaiah: the
lowly hear good news, the broken-hearted
are healed; captives are set free; prisoners
are released; mourners are comforted and
given happiness, fancy attire, and called
oaks of justice; ancient ruins are rebuilt; ru-
ined cities are restored; everlasting joy will
be with people who will be in a covenant
with the Lord.
In his meaningful and large life Marty un-
derstood this mission. He remained, in his
own words, ‘‘terminally hopeful.’’ In that
light he was one of 27 co-founders of the As-
sociation of U.S. Catholic Priests during a
retreat in August 2011 and an active member
of its local chapter’s Social Justice Sub-
committee. The intended vision of that new
Association, now numbering some 1,200 na-
tionally, is to be a voice of priests for the
complete teachings of Vatican II.
Fearless in his dedication to the social di-
mension of the WHOLE Gospel, particularly
as a very public voice in and for our African
American community. Impressive was his
commitment to that community AND to
their youth. Noteworthy was his vision in
education in his many years at Central
Catholic, where he assembled an enormously
gifted staff committed to the Catholic social
justice tradition. His education vision con-
tinued in the Central City’s Martin de Porres
Parish. With the generous support of his
high school classmate, he implemented a
renovation of the Bancroft-Detroit campus
and created the Pacesetter Program which
provided some 100 Central City youth schol-
arships first to Central Catholic and then to
Xavier University. When St. Ann School had
to close, he and his classmate imaginatively
created a Charter School called The Peace
Academy to carry on Gospel-based values in
a creative and legal way.
You and I are here today to celebrate the
powerful witness that Marty himself gave us.
Marty wanted us to be in a life-giving move-
ment that is about demonstrating God’s
goodness, God’s mercy and compassion,
God’s love—demonstrating those to the larg-
er societal movement. Marty realized that
we could do all sorts of pious things and still
not actually follow Jesus.
Marty uncompromisingly and generously
lived as a Good Samaritan. You, I, and our
faith communities could profitably do an
honest reality check about our own efforts
to dress wounds, bring to an inn, offer care,
and cover expenses for those in our area who
are somehow stripped, beaten, and left half-
dead.
We knew that Marty was not perfect . . .
my goodness, his fussing and fuming on a
golf course was a spectacle. However, he
dared to dream big, out loud and in public.
He intervened with grand imagination. He
emphasized Gospel-based action, not self-rev-
erential pieties. Marty invited us to move
doctrines and teachings to the level of actual
experiences and an authentically Christian
lifestyle.
Although Marty creatively forged new
paths of service in Toledo and received many
honors, he himself lived as a serf, not a
prince. He never constructed a clerical ped-
estal for himself.
As Christ did, Marty pointed to the King-
dom of God already in our midst. And he did
this even as his brain functions slowly wors-
ened over the years. When his usually fine
words could not do so he did this by actions,
to the end. To observe Marty in any phase of
his adult life was to know God’s Kingdom
hiding in plain sight.
Wow!! What a remarkable friend and fam-
ily man!! What an authentic servant leader!!
What a genuine man of God and of the peo-
ple!! If each of us would follow Jesus Christ
the way Marty did, our faith communities
may actually be ‘‘field hospitals.’’
Now, in our celebration of Eucharist we
join together with Christ in gratitude to our
loving, gracious Father for the beautiful gift
of Paul Martin Donnelly. We thank God for
who he was to us, for what he was to us, and
for how he was to us. Then, fed by the Eucha-
rist, we are missioned to go live the Gospel
in our own lives.
May our gracious God give eternal peace
and joy to our noble Good Samaritan we en-
dearingly called Marty.
Amen.
FATHER P. MARTIN ‘‘MARTY’’ DONNELLY
Father P. Martin ‘‘Marty’’ Donnelly was
sent by God on August 16, 1938, which began
a lifelong walk in service to others. This
journey touched many in the greater North-
west Ohio community. Fr. Marty’s journey
of service ended when he passed away Janu-
ary 27, 2019, surrounded by family and
friends. A life well done!

March 12, 2019
He was born the son of Leonard and Agnes
Donnelly, who were founding members of
Most Blessed Sacrament Parish, where
Marty attended elementary school. Marty
then attended Toledo Central Catholic High
School and was a member of ‘‘the great class
of 1956’’. Many of Marty’s classmates re-
named lifelong friends and gathered regu-
larly. After Central Catholic, Marty followed
his older brother Bob’s path into the priest-
hood.
Marty attended St. Meinrad Seminary Col-
lege and earned his bachelor’s degree in 1961.
Subsequently, Marty attended Pontifical
Gregorian University in Rome and was or-
dained a Roman Catholic priest in 1964. Fr.
Marty also received a Master in Education in
1973, from the University of Notre Dame.
Once Fr. Marty entered the priesthood his
life of service accelerated with assignments
at Norwalk St. Paul Parish and High School
from 1964–1968, and Lima Central Catholic
from 1968–1973. It was in 1973, that Fr. Marty
returned to his alma mater, Toledo Central
Catholic, as an Assistant Principal. In 1976,
he was named the seventh Principal and
later the first Pastor and President of Toledo
Central Catholic, a role he served until 1987.
Fr. Marty became Pastor at St. Ann and St.
Theresa parishes in 1987, and served as pastor
of St. Martin de Porres from 1990 to 2005. In
2005, he returned to his roots as Pastor of
Most Blessed Sacrament Parish until his re-
tirement in 2011.
Through his years of faith filled service,
Fr. Marty mentored and supported youth
from his schools, parishes and neighbor-
hoods, helping them to weave the fabric of
their communities. He will always be re-
membered for his dedication to the poor and
furthering social justice causes in the com-
munity.
Fr. Marty was affiliated with many organi-
zations including Central City Ministries of
Toledo, the Erase the Hate Campaign, the
Ohio Coalition against gun violence and the
Multi-Faith Council of Northwest Ohio.
Through his advocacy for these organiza-
tions and others, Fr. Marty touched the lives
of many.
Being a servant to others, he never sought
or wanted recognition for himself, however
he earned many, including Toledoan of the
Year, receiving a Key to the City in 2005;
Central Catholic Golden Shamrock Award
2001; a Humanitarian of the year award;
Drum Major for Justice in 2005; the St. Kath-
erine Drexel award in 2006; a Voice for All
People in 2007, and the Central City Ministry
Service Award in 2011.
In addition to his passionate service to
others Fr. Marty was truly family centric,
encompassing the Donnelly, Hendricks and
greater Quinn clans. Fr. Marty fully loved
and looked forward to the annual Quinn re-
unions where everyone anticipated his cre-
ative costumes based upon the theme of the
family party.
Fr. Marty was preceded in death by his
parents, Leonard and Agnes Donnelly; broth-
ers, Leonard ‘‘Quinnie’’, Most Reverend Rob-
ert Donnelly, Auxiliary Bishop of Toledo and
sister, Mary Hendricks. Surviving are his
brother-in-law, Patrick Hendricks, nieces,

in, Dorothy ‘‘Buck’’ Taylor for her years of
dedication, love, care and friendship with Fr.
Marty.

HONORING VERNON DAVIS
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing Vernon Davis, a District of
Columbia native, for his outstanding achieve-
ments as a core member of the Washington
NFL team and for his Vernon Davis Founda-
tion.
Vernon Davis was born in Washington, D.C.
and raised in the Petworth neighborhood with
seven siblings, including his brother Vontae
Davis, who is currently a member of the NFL’s
Buffalo Bills. Vernon Davis attended Truesdell
Elementary, Paul Public Charter School and
Dunbar High School. He was a letterman in
football, basketball and track and field, and
went on to attend the University of Maryland,
where he was a Consensus All-American in
football in 2005.
Vernon Davis, tight end of the Washington
NFL team, started his NFL career in 2006 with
the San Francisco 49ers. He went on to be-
come a Super Bowl champion, Second-team
All Pro and NFL receiving touchdowns leader.
As a core member of the Washington NFL
team, Davis’ love for football and influence on
the team’s culture are displayed with pride on
a daily basis.
Off the field, Vernon is known for his dedi-
cation and commitment to children and fami-
lies in the Washington, D.C. area through his
Vernon Davis Foundation. These efforts are
highlighted through his work to promote read-
ing among our youth through his READ 85
campaign, support mentoring programs with
the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Wash-
ington and strengthen families in collaboration
with the National Center for Children and
Families. Davis is also a loving father and one
of the best-dressed players in football.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing Vernon
Davis for his outstanding contributions through
his work as a sports hero and as a role model
for Washington, D.C. residents.
CELEBRATING THE PALM
CENTER’S 20TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today to recognize the Palm Cen-
ter on the occasion of their 20th anniversary.
Founded in 1998 by the University of Cali-
fornia, Santa Barbara, the Palm Center con-
ducts policy research on key social and polit-
ical issues affecting the most vulnerable Amer-
icans. For 20 years, the Palm Center has
been a trailblazer in efforts to protect lesbian,
gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) service
members. The organization has worked dili-
gently against the discriminatory ‘‘Don’t Ask,
Don’t Tell’’ (DADT) policy, which prohibited
service members of the LGBT community from
disclosing their sexuality while serving.
The Palm Center’s independent research
has enhanced the quality of public dialogue
and contributed to the work of independent
scholars, students, journalists, members of the
public, and policymakers, like myself. In 2009,
the Palm Center’s research was a welcomed
resource that allowed me to introduce the
Open and Honest Testimony Act. This legisla-
tion addressed the discriminatory DADT policy
by allowing LGBT troops to testify openly with-
out the risk of discharge and ensured that
Congress based its decision on the best pos-
sible information.
In 2013, the largest collection of research
on DADT policy was published in the Journal
of Homosexuality. This publication was com-
posed of the work of Palm Center scholars, as
well as reviews of the literary works of Palm
Center authors. The Palm Center was the first
to release a study on openly gay military serv-
ice members following the repeal of DADT.
Even after its repeal, the Palm Center has
continued its work against other anti-LGBT
military policies.
The Palm Center’s current research focuses
on transgender military service. This research
comes at a pivotal time when President
Trump’s Administration threatens the ability of
transgender men and women to serve in our
military. The Palm Center’s scholarship has
made it abundantly clear that the transgender
ban would weaken our military readiness,
cause substantial disruptions, deprive the mili-
tary of talent, and wreak havoc on the lives of
military families. The research the Palm Cen-
ter is conducting is crucial to negating the mis-
information and belittling rhetoric the Trump
Administration continues to engage in regard-
ing our brave transgender service members.
Madam Speaker, I want to extend my heart-
felt congratulations to the Palm Center on its
20th anniversary. The work they are doing to
provide the public with accurate and evidence-
based information is invaluable to us all. I look
forward to continuing my work with the Palm
Center, and wish them many more years of
great success.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ADAM
DAVID NUSZEN
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life and legacy of Adam David
Nuszen who lost his battle with mental illness
and addiction a little over 3 years ago. With an
insatiable curiosity and unparalleled
connectivity to the world around him, Adam’s
bright future was as limitless as the night sky
he so admired. As a gifted musician, poet,
writer, philosopher and inventor, Adam enlight-
ened everyone who had the honor of meeting
him, and as the oldest of three siblings, he
was the protector of his family with a fierce
loyalty that was only surpassed by his quiet
quest for justice.
At the age of 22, Adam was diagnosed with
schizophrenia, which sent him in and out of
hospitals in an attempt to balance his mental
illness with some semblance of an everyday
life, but he succumbed to the dangerous and
devastating world of opioid addiction. Even in
his darkest days, Adam always encouraged
his loved ones to ‘‘look up’’ so they didn’t miss
the beauty he saw in the world around them.
In November 2015, Adam lost his battle with
addiction, but only after leaving an indelible
mark on his family, friends and community.
During his last conversation with his mother
Linda, Adam carried this same positive senti-
ment and tone, which has stayed with Linda to
this day and inspired the creation of the non-
profit foundation Look Up for Adam.
The rise of the heroin and opioid abuse epi-
demic has affected so many families across
Long Island and our entire nation, and Look
Up for Adam provides support for these fami-
lies as they embark on ‘‘the difficult journey of
loving a person who is addicted to drugs.’’
Even in the darkest of days, Look Up for
Adam reminds these families to look up just
as Adam did, and in honor of his enduring
spirit and character, I’d like to support his
mother’s request in declaring March 12th,
Adam’s birthday, as National Look Up Day.
There are so many families across our en-
tire nation who are battling the heroin and
opioid abuse epidemic, who when down in the
trenches sometimes forget to look up at the
world around them. National Look Up Day
serves as a reminder for these families to
keep a positive outlook, but also for us as
Members of Congress to never stop fighting to
combat the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic
and never waver in our support for the families
affected by it.

HONORING ROB WYNBRANDT
HON. LARRY BUCSHON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the contributions of Rob Wynbrandt,
who will retire on March 15th as Executive Di-
rector and General Counsel of the Society of
Thoracic Surgeons (STS). I commend his 30
years of legal service and guidance for
cardiothoracic surgeons and their patients.
Mr. Wynbrandt graduated from North-
western University in 1977 with a Bachelor of
Arts degree in History, and obtained a Juris
Doctor with Honors from the University of
Michigan in 1979. He worked for many years
as a partner in a Chicago law firm, serving cli-
ents such as The Society of Thoracic Sur-
geons, the American Academy of Derma-
tology, American Academy of Pediatrics,
American College of Radiology, and the Amer-
ican College of Surgeons. In 2002, Mr.
Wynbrandt was named STS Executive Direc-
tor and General Counsel.
Once Mr. Wynbrandt took the helm at STS,
he expanded its staff and oversaw the devel-
opment of programs on patient safety, public
reporting, and professional medical education
for cardiothoracic surgeons. It was under Mr.
Wynbrandt’s legal expertise that the STS
launched its now world-renowned National
Database. As a result of his leadership, the
database has become the gold standard for
clinical outcomes registries and serves as the
bedrock for quality improvement initiatives in-
volving heart and lung surgery patients.
I congratulate Mr. Wynbrandt on a distin-
guished career at STS, and join his family,
friends, cardiothoracic surgeons, and their pa-
tients from around the country in extending my
best wishes in his retirement.

CLASSIC 8A STATE CHAMPION-

HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS

Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the Blanche Ely boys’ basket-
ball team and their coach Melvin Randall on
their 57–52 victory to claim its second straight
Class 8A boys basketball state championship
at Lakeland’s RP Funding Center on March 9,
2019.
Coach Randall’s dedication to Blanche Ely
High School and its basketball program is truly
commendable. Before the game, Coach Ran-
dall provided the team the same piece of ad-
vice he always does: ‘‘piece by piece’’. The
All-USA Boys Basketball Coach of the Year
and Broward County Sports Hall of Fame In-
ductee led his team by example, providing
them with the courage, resilience, and wisdom
needed to win.
The Blanche Ely boys’ basketball team
would not be a success without their tremen-
dous commitment to the sport. Senior Joshua
Scott will be the first player in the program’s
history to win four back-to-back state titles.
Aderes Stanton-McCray also was critical to his
team’s win. His block brought the team back
into the lead in what Coach Randall described
as the ‘‘play of the game’’.
I would also like to recognize the entire
Tiger basketball team, which includes: Tyrecke
Francois, Jayden Fye, Daniel Merrius, Eric
Guerrier, Aderes Staton-McCray, Javier Za-
pata, Jeremiah Mathieu, Jair Copeland, Der-
rick Lovett, Joshua Scott, Malachi Hazelton,
Lance Rainer, Javon Williams, Lamont Evans,
Colby King, and Bryson Williams.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to congratu-
late Principal Dr. Karlton O. Johnson for his
outstanding leadership of Blanche Ely High
School, as well as Coach Melvin Randall, and
the entire Blanche Ely boys’ basketball team.
They had a tremendous season and should be
extremely proud of themselves. I wish the
Blanche Ely High School and their basketball
program many more years of continued suc-
cess.

TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM HENRY

nine decades of life behind him, he remains a
vibrant part of his beloved central Texas com-
munity.
Many go through life wondering if they’ve
made a difference. William doesn’t have that
problem. As a successful small business
owner, respected race horse owner, and de-
voted family man, he represents the very best
of Texas values.
Over his incredible life, William witnessed
his nation’s brave soldiers defend freedom on
foreign shores, watched a humble mid-
westerner take mankind’s first steps on an-
other world, and marveled at technological ad-
vances beyond any of his dreams. He saw
how America has been defined by extraor-
dinary men and women who fought to make
our nation a beacon of hope and freedom, al-
ways willing to learn from the past, confront
the challenges of the present, and hopeful
enough to embrace a better tomorrow.

TRIBUTE TO THE MILWAUKEE
URBAN LEAGUE
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Milwaukee Urban League as
it celebrates 100 years of service to the Mil-
waukee area Community. The Milwaukee
Urban League was established in 1919 as an
affiliate of the National Urban League (NUL) in
response to the migration of African Ameri-
cans who moved north from southern states in
search of greater opportunities and a better
way of life. They assisted in their transition to
urban life and employment, helping African
Americans in Milwaukee secure economic
self-reliance, parity and power, and civil rights.
The Milwaukee Urban League become a
hub and sought to meet the various needs of
the African American Community. They estab-
lished a medical clinic in the 1920s and spon-
sored a community center for holiday gath-
erings, youth recreation and crafts, and taught
boxing skills. In 1926 the Urban League re-
leased a study that established the need to
eliminate poor housing as a high priority. In
subsequent years, it was instrumental in end-
ing legalized racial discrimination in housing
and creating the Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair
Housing Council which still exists today. In the
1930s, the Milwaukee Urban League estab-
lished the Industrial Relations Project to im-
prove job opportunities and working conditions
through relationships with business establish-
ments.
Over the years the Urban League has con-
tinued to promote employment and economic
self-sufficiency through such initiatives as ap-
prentice programs, and pre-employment skills
training. Other employment help includes on
the job placement and training and older work-
ers and job ride programs. The Milwaukee
Urban League has promoted business owner-
ship and development through efforts such as
the Franchise Initiative designed to help Afri-
can Americans acquire franchises, thereby,
generating wealth and increasing the number
of jobs in the community. It hosts an annual
Youth Leadership Summit to promote civic en-
gagement.
The Milwaukee Urban League has been on
the front lines of the struggle for equality by
both performing research that establishes the
case for change and taking actions that result
in change to help the next generation suc-
ceed. The Urban League continues to collabo-
rate on many issues to enhance the well-being
of the community it serves to achieve positive
outcomes, including: seeking alternatives to in-
carceration, working with organizations to
speak out against hatred and bigotry, improv-
ing academic achievement and social growth
among students, and eliminating barriers to
employment including enhancement.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons I rise to
recognize and pay tribute to the Milwaukee
Urban League as it celebrates its 100th anni-
versary and continues its efforts to benefit the
Fourth Congressional District and the State of
Wisconsin.

HONORING SHERIFF JOE MAX
TAYLOR
HON. RANDY K. WEBER, SR.
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speaker,
former Galveston County Sheriff Joe Max Tay-
lor passed away on Monday, February 11,
2019.
Sheriff Taylor was a veteran, husband and
father who dedicated his life to public service.
His colleagues describe him as an innovator,
mentor and a skilled politician. The Sheriff
served Galveston County for 54 years, 19 of
those years he served as sheriff.
Sheriff Joe Max Taylor’s legacy is one filled
with a deep love for his Galveston community.
During his career, he assisted in growing the
sheriff’s office from nineteen deputies to more
than 300 deputies. He was also instrumental
in helping form the mental health division and
the auto crimes task force.
Those who knew Sheriff Taylor know he
was more than a sheriff, he was someone
who did so much for our community. He will
be greatly missed, and our thoughts and pray-
ers are with his family.

INTRODUCTION OF THE TEACHER
VICTIMS’ FAMILY ASSISTANCE
ACT OF 2019
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce the Teacher Victims’ Family
Assistance Act of 2019. It is well known that
this country faces a gun violence epidemic. In
fact, in the 2018 school year alone, there were
24 school shooting incidents. This is the high-
est annual number of school shootings in re-
cent history, averaging out to one school
shooting incident every seven and a half
school days. The pain and heartache that re-
sult from this tragic and needless loss of life
sends shockwaves through our communities,
but especially through the families left behind.
Today, our teachers must contend with not
only the awesome responsibility of preparing
our children for bright and meaningful futures,
but also with protecting them from the very
real threat of active shooters and others wish-
ing to harm our children and grandchildren.
Too often, the teachers themselves are cas-
ualties in this epidemic, leaving the families of
the slain teachers, many with small children,
unprepared financially.
The Teacher Victims’ Family Assistance Act
of 2019 directs the Secretary of Education to
provide assistance to the immediate family
members of K–12 teachers who are killed dur-
ing their performance of duties at a public or
private school. This bill provides victims’ fami-
lies with funeral assistance; a death benefit
payment to the surviving spouse, dependent
child, or other next of kin; monthly living as-
sistance for the surviving spouse; and under-
graduate education assistance for each de-
pendent child.
In time, it is my sincere hope that the need
for the crucial assistance provided by this
measure will not be necessary as fewer and
fewer families are forced to cope with the sud-
den, tragic loss of a loved one at school. How-
ever, until that time, we must do all we can for
our dedicated and hardworking teachers and
their families, and that is exactly the spirit with
which this legislation is put forward.
Madam Speaker, I urge this body to expedi-
tiously pass this measure. Doing so will reaf-
firm America’s solidarity, gratitude, and sup-
port for our nation’s dedicated educators, who
work tirelessly on behalf of our children.

COMMEMORATING THE TWENTY-
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
CRYSTAL CHORDS
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 12, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of
the Crystal Chords.
The Crystal Chords are a group of extraor-
dinary women who come together to share
their love of music and sing a cappella in the
barbershop style. For twenty-five years the
women of Crystal Chords have graced the
communities of the Corning-Elmira area, sing-
ing at a variety of community functions. They
are a proud chapter of Harmony, Inc., a non-
profit international organization, whose mission
is to empower women through education,
friendship, and a cappella singing in the bar-
bershop style.
The barbershop quartets of the Crystal
Chords share their talents throughout the year,
singing for civic and charitable events. They
have sung at community events such as the
Corning Parade of Lights and Horseheads’
Holly Days, and regularly perform at local
churches. The Crystal Chords are committed
to charity in their communities as they
fundraise for the Food Bank of the Southern
Tier at all of their concerts and events.
The Crystal Chords are proudly directed by
the husband-wife team of Bill and Donna
McKay. Their years of barbershop quartet ex-
perience and unwavering dedication have led
the Crystal Chords from its inception twenty-
five years ago to continued success today.
Twenty-five years of uniting members of our
communities with music is certainly a cause
for celebration. I congratulate the Crystal
Chords on this impressive milestone and look
forward to their continued success in the years
to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
Crystal Chords.
