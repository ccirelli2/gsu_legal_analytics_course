HONORING JAN ALLEN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of the late Jan
Allen, an extraordinary North Caro-
linian and a personal friend.
Jan was a trailblazer who worked
tirelessly to level the playing field for
women in politics in North Carolina,
and she did a tremendous job at her
work.
Twenty-two years ago, she founded
Lillian’s List to get more women elect-
ed to political office at the State level.
I had the great privilege of working
with Jan during my time in the North
Carolina General Assembly over those
21 years. I had the great privilege of
working with Jan during my time
throughout Congress, as well.
There is no way to qualify the impact
that Jan had on the State of North
Carolina, but I know that, because of
Jan, more women have held office in
the State and more women are con-
tinuing to run.
Thanks to Jan, laws have been passed
to improve the lives of women, fami-
lies, and children, and North Carolina
is a better place to live for everyone.
My thoughts and prayers will con-
tinue to be with Jan’s family, her
friends, and my entire North Carolina
community. I thank Jan Allen for her
work, and may the Lord continue to
bless her and her family.
f
CATTLE COUNTRY NEEDS USDA’S
MARKET INVESTIGATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.
Speaker, this is a town where inves-
tigations can last for years, and some-
times, they cost millions. There are
other investigations that are insignifi-
cant, little things. They are just meant
to check a box so we can move onto the
next task.
Yes, I think we all know that, in
D.C., there are two types of investiga-
tions, investigations that are for show
and investigations that are for real.
Well, in cattle country, we need an in-
vestigation for real.
Times have been tough, really tough
for cattle producers, especially the last
couple of years. The producers that I
know, they don’t ask for guarantees or
handouts. All that they want is a fair
chance to earn a living. Unfortunately,
prices have been soft, and those pro-
ducers aren’t sure that the market is
accurately applying margin to our
feeders and to our ranchers.
Following the Holcomb fire, the mar-
ket experienced extreme volatility.
The producers that I know, smart and
savvy professionals, are telling me that
what happened in that aftermath did
real damage to the viability of their
businesses and to their way of life.
That is why I was grateful to see
USDA, under the Packers and Stock-
yards Act, open up an investigation
into the cattle market. An investiga-
tion like that does not happen every
day, and it has folks in South Dakota
anxiously awaiting the results. I know
that I am.
What I have seen so far, what I have
heard so far from USDA, gives me a
good feeling that they are conducting
this investigation for real, that they
are working hard to gather and analyze
the pertinent data. They want to get to
the bottom of this. They want to deter-
mine to what extent, if any, there were
unfair trade practices or market ma-
nipulation.
That kind of a determination, Mr.
Speaker, won’t be easy. It will require
real effort, real persistence, a real will-
ingness to dig deep.
As I said at the beginning, there are
two types of investigations in this
town, those that are for show and those
that are for real. It looks like USDA is
conducting this investigation for real,
and thank goodness for that, because
our cow-calf folks deserve that, our
feeders deserve that, and, Mr. Speaker,
our country deserves that.

ELIMINATE FORCED ARBITRATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) for 5
minutes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7778 September 19, 2019
FAIR Act, which would eliminate
forced arbitration clauses in employ-
ment, consumer, and civil rights cases,
restoring the rights of consumers,
workers, and small businesses to go to
court.
This is about respecting the Seventh
Amendment, the constitutional right
to a trial by jury, the right of every
single American to get their day in
court.
This is also about public account-
ability. This is about ending the ability
of bad corporate actors to shield their
wrongdoing and patterns of violation
from public scrutiny.
Let me be perfectly clear: Forced ar-
bitration clauses, which are often bur-
ied in the fine print in confusing legal
jargon, put the interests of powerful
corporations over American workers
and consumers.
This impacts every single one of us.
Every person in this room at some
point has unknowingly ceded their
rights away when entering into a con-
tract to buy a new car, to start a new
job, or sign up for a new credit card.
This is hurting real Americans, from
the elderly people who are mistreated
in nursing homes, or employees work-
ing overtime but not getting paid, to
servicemembers who are fired or not
rehired after returning from Active
Duty. Very few of them are actually
getting justice.
In the last 5 years, the number of
consumers who have won a monetary
award from forced arbitration averages
to 382 people a year. Let me put this
into perspective: On average, more
Americans get struck by lightning
every year than win a monetary award
from an arbitration.
When corporations know that they
can get away with such bad behavior
and shield that bad behavior from com-
ing to light, there is absolutely noth-
ing incentivizing them to follow the
law and treat consumers well.
It should go without saying, but this
legislation is overwhelmingly popular.
Research shows that 84 percent of
Americans oppose forced arbitration.
I urge every single one of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ for the FAIR Act
and restore vital rights to American
consumers, workers, and small busi-
nesses.

WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS
COUNTRY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Iowa (Mr. KING) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate the privilege of being recog-
nized here to speak on the floor of the
United States House of Representa-
tives. I come to the floor this morning,
Mr. Speaker, to address a topic, and
most of the words that I say will be
from an article written by Roger
Scruton, who is an author from Great
Britain. He is commenting on a new
book by Douglas Murray, titled ‘‘The
Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and
Identity.’’
Some of this hits home so much, and
it has so much to do with America,
that I thought it was important I ad-
dress this here this morning.
He says: ‘‘In every period of history,
therefore, there have been opinions and
customs that are dangerous to question
. . . but our situation in Western de-
mocracies today is a novel one. . . .
The old customs have been torn asun-
der by a culture of repudiation, which
encourages people to shape their lives
according to an ‘identity’ of their
own.’’
Socialization no longer means what
it used to mean. It means now becom-
ing who you are without regard to the
framework that existed in the civiliza-
tion and the culture prior. ‘‘The pun-
ishments for saying, thinking, or im-
plying the wrong thing . . . are real,
serious, and largely impossible to de-
flect.’’
That means that ‘‘the archive of your
crimes is stored in cyberspace, and
however much you may have confessed
to them and sworn to change, they will
pursue you for the rest of your life,
just as long as someone has an interest
in drawing attention to them. And
when the mob turns on you, it is with
a pitiless intensity that bears no rela-
tion to the objective seriousness of
your fault. A word out of place, a hasty
judgment, a slip of the tongue, what-
ever the fault might be, it is sufficient,
once picked upon, to put you beyond
the pale of human sympathy.’’
This is reflected in the book ‘‘The
Madness of Crowds.’’
‘‘The emerging world of censorship is
a world without forgiveness . . . in
which the real virtues and vices that
govern our conduct are ignored alto-
gether’’ or are decided to be irrelevant.
‘‘The crimes for which we are judged
are existential crimes. Through speak-
ing in the wrong way, you display one
of the phobias or isms,’’ or they pre-
sume that is the case, ‘‘that show you
to be beyond acceptable humanity. You
are a homophobe, an Islamophobe, a
white supremacist, or a racist, and no
argument can refute these accusations
once they have been made.’’
Even ‘‘your accusers are not inter-
ested in your deeds; they are interested
in you,’’ and what they are interested
in is ‘‘whether or not you are ‘one of
us,’ ’’ meaning actually one of them.
‘‘Your faults cannot be overcome by
voluntary action, since they adhere to
the kind of thing that you are, and you
reveal what you are in the words that
define you,’’ as defined by your critics.
‘‘These words may be taken out of
context, even doctored to mean the op-
posite of what you said’’—that is true
with the author and certainly true
with me—‘‘but this will not affect the
verdict, since there is no objective
trial, no ‘case for the defense,’ no due
process. You are accused by the mob,
examined by the mob, and condemned
by the mob, and if you have brought
this on yourself, then,’’ they say, ‘‘you
have only yourself to blame. For the
mob is by nature innocent. It washes
its own conscience in a flow of collec-
tive indignation, and by joining it, you
make yourself safe,’’ which is one of
the reasons we see an epidemic of vir-
tue signaling here in this Congress, Mr.
Speaker.
‘‘The spirit of the mob has entered
not only the language of public debate
but also the sources of information and
the institutions of decisionmaking.
Censorship begins in the media them-
selves.’’
Cyberspace is censored and is con-
trolled by about four major companies.
George Orwell predicted this, but I
think it has eclipsed even his magnifi-
cent imagination and the reality that
we are dealing with today.
‘‘Murray gives riveting examples of
the way in which’’—I will use this ex-
ample—‘‘whiteness has become a moral
fault in the eyes of identity warriors
on the American campus.’’ They now
openly ‘‘condemn people for the color
of their skin,’’ provided that it is
white. The art of taking offense,
‘‘whole sections of the university cur-
riculum are devoted to explaining to
students that words, arguments, com-
parisons, even questions,’’ rhetorical or
not, ‘‘are ‘offensive,’ regardless of the
intention with which they are used,’’
or, actually, the language, the precise
definition of the language.
‘‘Invariably, the offense is given by
the old majority culture and is taken
on behalf of some privileged minority.’’
Mr. Speaker, this is a shorthand
version of what is going on in this
country, what is going on in this Con-
gress, what is going on in the media.
And I submit this, that we don’t any
longer have an objective news media.
That center that used to be the truth
has been completely, almost com-
pletely, vacated. Much of it has gone to
the left. Some has gone to the right.
And that peace of being able to pick up
a newspaper and read it and believe
that it is true today is no longer true
today. And the American civilization
must come to grips with this and go to
original sources, come to our own con-
clusions, adjust our civilization and
our culture. If we fail to do so, we will
be pitted against each other for a long
time to come.

STOP GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR
NATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. RUSH) for 5 minutes.
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, let me begin
by saying I certainly and clearly dis-
associate myself from the remarks of
the previous speaker. I absolutely,
wholeheartedly disagree with him and
do not concur with him.
Mr. Speaker, in 1999, my son Huey be-
came a victim of gun violence when he
was murdered in an aborted robbery at-
tempt as he was bringing groceries into
his apartment on the South Side of
Chicago.
Tragically, Mr. Speaker, my son’s
death was not unique because literally

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7779
September 19, 2019
hundreds of men, women, boys, and
girls are dying every day in our Nation
due to gun violence.
According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, almost 40,000
Americans have died as a result of gun-
related injuries in the year 2017, which
is the most recent year for which com-
plete data is available.
b 1015
Almost 40,000 Americans have died as
a result of gun-related injuries in the
year 2017. In the city I love, the city I
live in, the city of Chicago, over 279
citizens of our Nation have been mur-
dered within the last year due to gun-
fire.
Mr. Speaker, these statistics should
be a clarion call to action by this Con-
gress, by this Nation, by this adminis-
tration. That is why, Mr. Speaker, the
committee that I am proud to serve on,
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce, and the Energy and Commerce
Subcommittee on Health will finally
meet in my district on October 3 to
convene a hearing to examine gun vio-
lence as a national public health issue.
This is a hearing that I have been con-
sistently calling for ever since 2017.
This hearing will convene commu-
nity members, national experts, vic-
tims, academia, and law enforcement.
All these individuals will gather in my
district in the city of Chicago for one
purpose and one purpose only: to dis-
cuss how we can better protect our Na-
tion, our people, our boys and girls, our
schoolchildren, our church-going citi-
zens, our mosque-going citizens, our
citizens who worship in synagogs all
across this Nation, our movie theater-
going citizens, our citizens who are in
malls across this Nation enjoying
themselves and shopping.
We need to have protection for all of
our citizens driving along the high-
ways. All of our citizens need to be pro-
tected, and this hearing will have the
purpose of discussing how we can bet-
ter protect our citizens and our com-
munities from this epidemic, this wide-
spread epidemic of gunfire, gun vio-
lence. As with any epidemic that this
Nation faces, we will have experts
come and speak to us.
Mr. Speaker, we must stop the vio-
lence. Save the children. Save the fam-
ilies.
f
MEMORIAL TO THE BUFFALO
SOLDIERS AT FORT VANCOUVER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Washington (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER)
for 5 minutes.
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize an
important chapter in my region’s his-
tory that must be remembered, and it
is significant to our whole Nation: the
service of African American regiments
known as buffalo soldiers.
Their service stations included Fort
Vancouver; and afterward, some of
them made our region their permanent
home, men like Willie ‘‘Bill’’ More-
house, who served their Nation with
courage and honor.
The buffalo soldiers’ place in south-
west Washington history began in
April of 1899. That date marks the as-
signment of buffalo soldiers from Com-
pany B of the 24th Infantry to the bar-
racks at Fort Vancouver. This was also
the first time in history that a unit
from one of the Army’s four African
American regiments was included in
Fort Vancouver’s regular garrison of
troops.
The buffalo soldiers’ contributions to
our Nation continued throughout sub-
sequent conflicts.
Two years ago, we lost a pillar within
the greater Vancouver community, a
member and president of the Moses
Williams Pacific Northwest Chapter of
the buffalo soldiers, ‘‘Bill’’ Morehouse.
Bill was a member of the United
States Army and the National Guard
early in his life, with his military serv-
ice spanning World War II and the Fort
Vancouver barracks as a POW guard.
His contributions to our community
went beyond his military service. Bill
led toy and food drives for underprivi-
leged kids, and he provided honor
guard at military ceremonies and pa-
rades.
In just a few days, on September 21,
a ceremony will take place to dedicate
a permanent memorial at Fort Van-
couver to Bill and to the buffalo sol-
diers so he will be honorably remem-
bered. This memorial will help mark
their unwavering commitment to our
country, a commitment they made in
the face of racism, unfair treatment,
and adversity, policies of the past.
I am proud that their legacy will live
on in Vancouver, that their fight will
live on, and I pledge to do whatever I
can to ensure that the buffalo soldiers’
stories of service and sacrifice are not
forgotten.
f
OUR ESTUARIES: NATIONAL RE-
SOURCES AND COMMUNITY
TREASURES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. POSEY) for 5 minutes.
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, today I
join millions of my fellow Americans
in recognizing National Estuaries
Week, which extends from September
14 to September 21.
We know that estuaries are those
places where freshwaters or rivers meet
the seas. Estuaries are also places
where biodiversity is often at its ze-
nith. They are the ecologies of our
coastal communities. Wherever a wa-
tershed empties into the sea, we find
an estuary.
My home in Florida is part of an es-
tuary called the Indian River Lagoon,
where the fresh and salt waters mix be-
hind barrier islands to form what ex-
perts recognize as the most biodiverse
estuary in the United States of Amer-
ica. My community and district depend
on the lagoon to support a broad array
of activities to meet our economic, en-
vironmental, and recreational needs.
My neighbors and I understand how
much we depend on the lagoon. We
strive to protect the sea turtles and
the habitat of the manatees. When
they are thriving, we know that fisher-
men, boaters, businesses, and, most im-
portantly, our families will thrive.
For years, I have worked for the
health of the Indian River Lagoon and
tried to help other communities keep
their estuaries healthy. The challenges
of the Indian River Lagoon are the
same challenges faced by all the other
estuaries.
Last Congress, I joined with Con-
gresswoman SUZANNE BONAMICI to
found the Congressional Estuary Cau-
cus to support the National Estuary
Program, foster research in estuary
restoration and protection, and bring
other resources to bear on sustaining
our estuaries.
National Estuaries Week is a special
time for a national celebration of our
estuary efforts and for local estuary
programs within the national program
to bring the importance of estuaries to
their communities and involve other
citizens in their work.
An important part of these goals is
to communicate the value and impor-
tance of our estuaries and our coasts to
key decisionmakers at the local, State,
and Federal levels. That is what we are
doing right now.
Our friends at Restore America’s Es-
tuaries tell us that last year’s celebra-
tion was a tremendous success, as orga-
nizations and volunteers from across
the country gathered at their local
bays or riverfronts and classrooms to
celebrate and learn about the impor-
tance of our estuaries and how they
benefit our daily lives. More than 30,000
volunteers across 21 States, Canada,
and Guam participated in over 105 dif-
ferent estuary events.
Many of this year’s events are posted
online, and they give us a stunning pic-
ture of how each estuary, while being a
national asset, is also a unique treas-
ure to its communities. For example,
in Palm Bay in my district, the Marine
Resources Council, the Indian River
Lagoon National Estuary Program,
The Nature Conservancy of Florida,
Act 2 Technologies, and the Tampa Bay
Estuary Program held a rain barrel
workshop and auction, heard from a
distinguished panel of water quality
experts, and dined on a fine barbecue
meal. A speakers panel open forum fo-
cused on audience participation, facili-
tating questions and concerns, as well
as the opportunity to present ideas and
potential problems and solutions for
our waterways.
We also celebrate National Estuaries
Week as a time to recommit our effort
in the caucus to achieve full funding
for the National Estuary Program and
to bring those resources to the commu-
nities that live on the estuaries’ edge.
We can and we must work to assure
that our estuaries and our environment
are sustained.

Dr. Bryant R. Ali, New Psalmist Wor-

fered the following prayer:
Our Father which art in heaven, hal-
lowed be thy name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done, as in heaven,
so in Earth. Give us day by day our
daily bread. And forgive us our sins; as
we also forgive everyone that has
sinned against us. And lead us not into
temptation; but deliver us from evil.
Lord, as these elected officials handle
the agenda before them today, may the
words of their mouth and the medita-
tion of their heart be acceptable in
Your sight.
Lord, Your word declares that those
who acknowledge You, paths will also
be directed by You. I pray that we
truly become one nation under God,
united with liberty and justice for all.
Lord, touch each Representative
today. Bless their family and the com-
munity they have the privilege of serv-
ing. In the name of the Father, Son,

WELCOMING DR. BRYANT R. ALI
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. PAYNE) is recognized for 1
minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to introduce and praise today as
guest chaplain Pastor Bryant Ali.
Pastor Ali has been my friend for al-
most 50 years. He has been the ‘‘pastor
in the hood,’’ as we call him, for 26
years at the New Psalmist Worship
Center in Newark, New Jersey, a center
he founded to bring the power of the
Lord to those who have lost their way.
He is a renowned author, community
activist, counselor, teacher, and
preacher in my district. His story is
one that should inspire us all. Pastor
Ali received his spiritual calling as a
homeless man struggling with chem-
ical addiction. He conquered those de-
mons through the power of the Lord.
He started preaching and pursued his
calling.
Today, he has a doctoral degree in
holistic theology. He serves as the
president of the Baptist Ministers Con-
ference of Newark and Vicinity, and he
is a spiritual counselor for the Newark
Anti-Violence Coalition and serves on
the board of the Newark Community
Health Centers.
He is an outstanding clergyman, an
incredible leader in my community,
and a true inspiration. I am very proud
to have him say a prayer for us today.
My fellow Members, I would like to
present the senior pastor of New
Psalmist Worship Center, the Honor-
able Dr. Bryant Ali, who did an incred-
ible job for us today.

ADDRESSING AMERICA’S
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, the American Society of Civil
Engineers estimates that, by 2025, the
cost of addressing America’s infra-
structure needs will reach $4.6 trillion.
With Federal transportation funded at
$305 billion this year, we aren’t even
coming close.
With each day that passes, the need
grows. Safety is threatened; oppor-
tunity is lost; and the cost of getting
the job done only increases.
According to the Federal highway
data, in the Buffalo Niagara region
alone, 1 out of every 13 bridges is struc-
turally deficient. Our roads are crum-
bling; our water infrastructure is
breaking; and our transit systems are
inadequate and outdated. The situation
couldn’t be more urgent, and the op-
portunity couldn’t be more obvious.
Numerous economic reports indicate
investment in infrastructure delivers
real jobs and real growth in the Amer-
ican economy. It is time to deliver on
the substantial investment in infra-
structure. There is a great deal of work
to be done, and there are Americans
prepared to do that work.
f
HONORING SUCCESS OF SORINEX
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, every August, I participate in
a bus tour of South Carolina’s Second
District with my wife, Roxanne, and
dedicated staff from the Washington
and district offices, visiting schools,
job-creating businesses, and chambers
of commerce.
An amazing stop this year was at
Sorinex in Lexington. Sorinex is a fam-
ily-owned business that makes unique
exercise equipment for professional
teams, national Olympic teams, col-
leges, high schools, and the military. It
is a classic example of a garage-origi-
nated business that now produces
equipment worldwide.
The founder of Sorinex, Richard
‘‘Pops’’ Sorin, took us around the im-
pressive facility. The beginning of the
visit was a tour with a historic collec-
tion of over 100 years of weightlifting
equipment. Not only does Sorinex cre-
ate its custom equipment, but it also
produces all of its own branded apparel.
I am grateful Lexington is the home of
their success.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
Our sympathy to the family of Emily
Clyburn and our prayers for Congress-
man JIM CLYBURN and daughters
Mignon, Jennifer, and Angela.

her passing recently at the age of 96.
She was one of Newark’s most dedi-
cated artists and art supporters who
leaves a legacy of great contributions
behind.
Fifty years ago, she opened the first
art gallery in Newark, the Aard Studio
Gallery. It was a place dedicated to art
and encouraging artists of color to
learn and express their unique talents.
Through this gallery, Gladys helped in-
spire and launch the careers of African
American artists across the city.
Thanks to Gladys’ efforts, the New-
ark Museum held the first exhibit of
local artists, called Emerging and Es-
tablished, in 1983.
Gladys is one of the founding mem-
bers of the Newark Arts Council, today
known as Newark Arts. She even re-
ceived the 2019 Lifetime Achievement
Award from the Women’s Caucus for
Arts.
Her art has been displayed locally,
nationally, and even internationally.
When in Newark, visitors can see one
of Gladys’ five murals, called Music
Unites Us All, on the PSE&G Fair-
mount Heights Art Wall.
Gladys has been a blessing to our cul-
tural scene and to me personally as a
great and valued friend and friend of
all of her children. Gladys’ life reminds
us of the value of art in society, and
she will be sorely missed.

PRAYING FOR RESIDENTS OF
SOUTHWEST TEXAS
(Mr. BABIN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in the wake of a terrible storm that is
devastating my district in southeast
Texas as we speak today, Tropical
Storm Imelda, which appeared out of
nowhere. Highways and roads are flood-
ing, and local authorities are advising
folks to seek shelter. Relatives of mine
have complained that they are now un-
derwater, as well, and flooding.
Again, we seem to see these storms
come out of nowhere. This one hit us
by surprise. It wasn’t even a named
storm, and once they named it, it
seemed like, within just a few hours, it
made landfall.
Our office is working with the Gov-
ernor’s administration in Texas, Gov-
ernor Abbott, and with the Trump ad-
ministration to quickly get declara-
tions of a Federal emergency to ensure
that the resources and help necessary
will be provided to our constituents
there.
Right after votes today, I will be
heading home as quickly as possible
and will be doing all that I can to help
the people of southeast Texas. We are a
tough and resilient people in southeast
Texas, and we live by the rule that we
need to help our neighbors. We saw
that in technicolor just 2 years ago
with Hurricane Harvey and that devas-
tation.
My prayers are with everyone in this
storm right now, and my office will be
working around the clock to do all we
can, and I will head home.
f
HONORING CHRISTA MCAULIFFE
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of all New Hampshire
residents and Americans in support of
the Christa McAuliffe Commemorative
Coin Act.
Christa McAuliffe was a dedicated
high school social studies teacher who
understood how history is defined by
ordinary people doing extraordinary
things.
Christa dared to touch the future as
a teacher and as an astronaut. Selected
from more than 11,000 applicants for
NASA’s Teacher in Space Program, she
inspired the world and furthered our
Nation’s commitment to exploration
inside and outside the classroom. I re-
member watching the shuttle launch as
a kindergarten student on January 28,
1986, feeling the pride that a New
Hampshire teacher from just up the
road in Concord was making history.
Although Christa McAuliffe and six
other souls were tragically lost in the
Challenger explosion, her legacy en-
dures. The creation of the commemora-
tive coin is one way we can honor her
and all of our educators for opening
doors of opportunity and challenging
students to succeed. The proceeds from
these coins will support FIRST Robot-
ics, a program that is building the next
generation of creators, leaders, and
dreamers. I urge my colleagues to pass
this bipartisan legislation today.
f
HONORING FLORIDA SHERIFFS
YOUTH RANCHES
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in support of the Florida Sheriffs
Youth Ranches and similar community
care centers for at-risk children across
our Nation.
Founded in 1957, the Florida Sheriffs
Youth Ranches have been improving
the lives of at-risk children throughout
our State with its comprehensive pro-
grams in six Florida locations, includ-
ing one in my district, Live Oak, Flor-
ida.
The Sheriffs Youth Ranches are cred-
ited with helping more than 152,000
children and families in Florida alone.
I have visited them, and I admire their
work. It goes well beyond basic care
and provides a sense of security, guid-
ance, and belonging to these children
who are coming from incredibly dif-
ficult circumstances.
Without action by this House, on
September 30, the title IV-E child wel-
fare waiver will expire, adversely af-
fecting the support provided to chil-
dren’s homes across the country.
It is our responsibility to ensure that
vital services to vulnerable children
and families are not interrupted. We
must guarantee that the system has
the same amount of resources nec-
essary to achieve safety and perma-
nency for all of these children.

RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT ALS
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to shine a light on one of my
constituents, Mr. Dan Shultes.
Dan, who lives in Schoharie County,
is a wonderful family man with a wife,
two young children, and a community
that loves him dearly. At 42 years of
age, he has, in just a matter of months,
gone from being completely healthy to
being diagnosed with ALS.
This devastating disease has stolen
his ability to complete basic tasks such
as brushing his teeth, feeding himself,
or signing his name. When I saw him
last month at a barbecue, he was con-
fined to a wheelchair, surrounded by
loved ones.
Stories like Dan’s should remind us
how important it is to continue to
raise awareness about ALS and moti-
vate Congress to take every action pos-
sible to help the 30,000 Americans
struggling with ALS. Congress must
provide robust funding for disease re-
search and create expedient pathways
to market for new treatments and
medications that could save or dras-
tically improve the quality of life for
those living with this disease. We
should work tirelessly to provide guid-
ance or therapeutic solutions as soon
as possible.
Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank
my good friend and colleague, PAUL
TONKO, a true ally in this fight, as we
are working closely with the Shultes
family.
May God bless Dan Shultes and his
family.

RECOGNIZING GARY MABREY

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize my
friend, Gary Mabrey, for his retirement
after 30 years of service as the CEO and
president of the chamber of commerce
serving Johnson City—my hometown—
Jonesborough, and Washington County,
Tennessee.
After joining the Air Force during
the Vietnam war, Gary returned to
northeast Tennessee to continue serv-
ing his community. After earning a
master’s degree in city management
from East Tennessee State University,
he spent 10 years training government
officials before joining the chamber of
commerce.
As CEO and president of the cham-
ber, Gary worked tirelessly to
strengthen the economy of northeast

Tennessee. He attracted new businesses
and supported the existing ones. He
promoted education, local colleges, and
regional charities. Gary’s leadership
was recognized when he was named to
the U.S. Chamber national board.
Mr. Speaker, I am blessed to call
Gary Mabrey my friend. I thank Gary
for his service to our community dur-
ing his tenure with the chamber, and I
wish Gary and his beautiful wife, Jack-
ie, all the best in their new retired life.

WE MUST SHUT DOWN DETENTION
CENTERS ON OUR SOUTHERN
BORDER
(Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr.
Speaker, I hold in my hand several let-
ters received from my constituents in
Brooklyn, New York, New York teens
who, like me, are disgusted by the on-
going injustice and inhumane treat-
ment of Brown and Black children who
are being held in detention centers at
the southern border of our Nation.
I will read one letter from Charlee,
who is 16 years old, living in New York
City:
‘‘To my fellow teens,
‘‘After hearing about your situation,
I am sorry our country doesn’t wel-
come you with open arms.
‘‘Trust that not everywhere is like
this . . . America can be accepting and
supportive.
‘‘I hope you’ll be released and al-
lowed to become part of a family.
‘‘I hope you’ll get to see the better
places of this country.
‘‘You deserve to live freely and safe-
ly. I wish you luck.
‘‘Believe that your future will be bet-
ter and someday these detention cen-
ters will be shut down.’’
She is right. We must shut down
these inhumane detention centers. We
must put an end to the irreparable
mental and physical damage being
done to our most vulnerable in the
United States. We must reunite these
families, and we must stand on the
right side of history.
f
RECOGNIZING GOD’S PIT CREW
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the work of God’s
Pit Crew, a Virginia crisis response
team of Fifth District constituents
who have done incredible work pro-
viding aid and support in response to
over 130 natural disasters across the
country and around the globe.
Their work began in 1999 when Randy
and Terri Johnson drove three truck-
loads of supplies to Oklahoma City
after a devastating tornado. Twenty
years later, their coalition of friends
and neighbors has grown to over 400
members who have volunteered their
time and skills to help those in need.
Most recently, these Danville resi-
dents provided aid to the Bahamas
after Hurricane Dorian this summer
and the wildfires in Paradise, Cali-
fornia, late last year.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues join me in recognizing these
Virginians for their service to our com-
munities and the work they have done
for those in need.
God bless God’s Pit Crew.
f
MAKE HIGHER EDUCATION
ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, every
student deserves the opportunity to
pursue higher education and achieve
their goals, but for too many Ameri-
cans, especially low-income students or
families in poverty, unexpected finan-
cial emergencies like sudden medical
costs, transportation issues, or loss of
employment can prevent them from
completing coursework or even cause
them to drop out of school altogether.
A broken-down car or a brief hos-
pitalization should not derail a life-
time of hard work for any student.
That is why I am proud to have
partnered with Congresswoman KATIE
HILL to introduce the CAMPUS Act,
which provides emergency grants to
students in need so they can continue
their coursework and stay on track
academically. This legislation provides
a critical safety net for low-income
students and brings us one step closer
to making higher education accessible
and affordable for all young people.
f
SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH
(Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker,
I rise today to recognize the important
work being done at the VA to help pre-
vent suicides.
An estimated 45,000 Americans die
each year from suicide. Roughly 6,000
are veterans. That is over 16 per day,
over 115 per week.
Suicide is a national public health
issue, and it is important that we edu-
cate ourselves on how to recognize the
warning signs.
In the spirit of Suicide Prevention
Month, the VA has launched efforts to
help deliver assistance to veterans,
funding for additional research, strate-
gies to educate communities about sui-
cide prevention, and collaboration with
public and private partnerships to im-
plement tools to help curb suicides
among our Nation’s veterans.
As a fellow veteran, I have seen first-
hand some of the difficulties veterans
face following their military service,
and we owe to them our support after
they have sacrificed so much. Veterans
are all around us—neighbors, friends,
and family members—and they deserve
our utmost attention.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the VA
for their support and their work in ad-
dressing this important issue.
f
HONORING DEVIN MCQUEEN
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I rise today to honor the life of Devin
McQueen, who loved baseball and his
friends, but loved his family more than
anything.
I am here to honor his mom, Colleen
McQueen; his dad, Derrick McQueen;
his uncle, Michael McLaughlin; and all
of his family.
Devin was only 15 when he passed
away after battling multiple rare dis-
eases and chronic illnesses.
I am so glad that our community
came together and honored his life and
spirit when we recently unveiled a
beautiful sculpture in his memory. The
sculpture in his honor is called ‘‘The
Strength of a Giant.’’ It is a sculpture
by artist Scott LoBaido of a boy push-
ing a large boulder towards a blue sky.
Ever upward and ever forward, with
the strength of a giant: that is what
Devin’s life was all about.
Mr. Speaker, I want to say to Devin:
We won’t forget you.

with the accompanying papers, referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
and ordered to be printed:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to per-
sons who commit, threaten to commit,
or support terrorism declared in Execu-
tive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001,
is to continue in effect beyond Sep-
tember 23, 2019.
The crisis constituted by the grave
acts of terrorism and threats of ter-
rorism committed by foreign terror-
ists, including the terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001, in New York and
Pennsylvania and against the Pen-
tagon, and the continuing and imme-
diate threat of further attacks on
United States nationals or the United
States that led to the declaration of a
national emergency on September 23,
2001, has not been resolved. This crisis
continues to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity, foreign policy, and economy of
the United States. For this reason, I
have determined that it is necessary to
continue the national emergency de-
clared in Executive Order 13224 with re-
spect to persons who commit, threaten
to commit, or support terrorism.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I
call up House Resolution 564 and ask
for its immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 564

lution it shall be in order to consider in the
House the bill (H.R. 4378) making continuing

other purposes. All points of order against
consideration of the bill are waived. The bill
shall be considered as read. All points of
order against provisions in the bill are

sidered as ordered on the bill and on any
amendment thereto to final passage without
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of
debate equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of the
Committee on Appropriations; and (2) one
motion to recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE),
pending which I yield myself such time
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
be given 5 legislative days to revise and
extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today
the Rules Committee met and reported
a rule, House Resolution 564, providing
for the consideration of H.R. 4378 under
a closed rule. One hour of general de-
bate has been provided, controlled by
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Appropria-
tions.
Mr. Speaker, before I begin my for-
mal remarks, let me just take this mo-
ment also to recognize the leadership
of the ranking member on the Rules
Committee, Mr. COLE. He is not only a
friend, but he is a fair and evenhanded
appropriator that can work with both
sides. I know if the gentleman could
control this entire process, we would
not be having continuing resolutions;
we would be actually voting for fund-
ing for the entire year.
As my colleagues know, funding for
the Federal Government runs out on
September 30, and that is less than 2
weeks from now. I had hoped that we
would have finished all of our work by
now. Certainly, the House has done its
lion’s share of work, but instead of
prioritizing that, President Trump has
been obsessed with drawing on weather
maps and Twitter fights and cozying up
to dictators.
b 1230
And the Republican Senate is com-
pletely dysfunctional. It seems like we
have a better chance of getting struck
by lightning than seeing them pass a
bill.
The House has passed bills that fund
96 percent of the government. Again, 96
percent of the government is funded by
the actions in this House. But the Re-
publican Senate has passed zero. Noth-
ing. What are they doing over there,
Mr. Speaker?
The Senate is just starting to get its
act together, but where have they been
all summer?
This House is the only adult in the
room. That is why we are acting today
to keep the lights on. This continuing
resolution will keep the government
funded through November 21. It is bi-
partisan and it is drafted as cleanly as
possible to encourage the Republicans
in the Senate and the White House to
finally negotiate on a long-term deal.
I know my Republican colleagues on
the other side of the Capitol are afraid
to stand up to the President. They have
stood by as President Trump ransacked
funding for military construction
projects in their States and diverted it,
instead, to pay for his ineffective bor-
der wall, a border wall that I am now
being told you can fry an egg on.
The President is hurting our brave
servicemen and -women, their families,
and their communities, but still Senate
Republicans do nothing. They won’t be
able to shirk their responsibilities here
because any compromise will require
bicameral support and the President’s
signature.
Someone over there is going to have
to deliver some bad news to Donald
Trump: that he is going to have to log
off Twitter and actually govern. It may
not make for good television but keep-
ing the government open for business is
the most basic responsibility that we
have.
Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, when
we finally do go to conference, this ma-
jority is going to defend our values.
That means fully funding a fair and ac-
curate census, securing our elections
from foreign interference, and sup-
porting Federal research into our Na-
tion’s gun violence epidemic, all while
working to fund education, healthcare,
and infrastructure.
This is what responsible governing
looks like. I know that may be a rad-
ical concept for some of my friends on
the other side, who enabled this Presi-
dent to launch the longest shutdown in
American history, but we don’t believe
in shutting down the government. The
last Trump shutdown cost us $3 billion
in economic activity that can never be
recovered. That is according to the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Of-
fice.
We cannot afford a repeat at a time
when Moody’s has found the Presi-
dent’s disastrous trade war is already
resulting in 300,000 fewer jobs created.
That is a figure that could increase to
450,000 fewer jobs by the end of the year
if he continues these policies.
It is tough to know what will happen
because it seems like the President
can’t make up his own mind. You
would have better luck at a casino
than betting what President Trump
will do next. That is not master nego-
tiation, that is madness.
Our farmers are hurting. I am glad
that this bill lessens the impacts they
are facing as a result of the President’s
trade war. These families need our
help, and I stand with them.

H7784 September 19, 2019
Someone has to lead here to keep our
government funded, and we are. No
gamesmanship, just the cleanest pos-
sible plan to keep the lights on for an-
other month.
So I encourage all my colleagues:
let’s say enough to this uncertainty.
Enough with the shutdowns and
enough with the President’s inaction.
Let’s pass this short-term CR and fi-
nally make bipartisan, bicameral nego-
tiations on a long-term deal a reality.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend,
the gentleman from Massachusetts, the
chairman of the Rules Committee, for
yielding me the customary 30 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for
his kind words, and I mean that with
all sincerity. We, obviously, have dif-
ferent opinions, we represent different
parties, but we do work together well.
I appreciate the manner in which my
friend runs his committee and dis-
charges his responsibility on that com-
mittee and to this entire House.
We are here today, Mr. Speaker, on a
bill that represents one of the most
fundamental roles of the United States
Congress. That is to fund the govern-
ment to keep it open.
Today’s bill is a bipartisan con-
tinuing resolution ensuring that crit-
ical government funding will remain in
place through November 21. The exten-
sion of funding is necessary to ensure
that the House and the Senate have the
time to reach a deal for full year appro-
priations for fiscal year 2020.
Mr. Speaker, I call this bill a con-
tinuing resolution, but I think the
other word I used is much more impor-
tant. That word is bipartisan. That is
what this bill truly is: a bipartisan
compromise between the two parties. It
is amazing what we can get done when
we agree to work together and move
towards a common goal. In putting for-
ward this bill, that is exactly what we
have done.
H.R. 4378 is a bipartisan compromise
that ensures that we will keep the gov-
ernment open and operating through
November 21. The American people de-
serve no less.
H.R. 4378 not only funds the govern-
ment and keeps it open, but it also pro-
vides critical authorization extensions
for some important government pro-
grams. Without passing this bill, cru-
cial programs impacting millions of
Americans in every district of the
country would expire. These include
programs like community health cen-
ters, the Commodity Credit Corpora-
tion, the National Flood Insurance
Program, the Special Diabetes Pro-
gram, and the Special Diabetes Pro-
gram for Native Americans.
Every one of these programs is one of
great importance to my district, but
the same could be said of every other
Member of the House. All of us have
constituents who use these and other
important programs every day. All of
us have constituents whose lives are
changed for the better because these
programs are there. And if they were to
expire and stop working, all of us—
every last Member—would, rightly,
hear about it from our constituents the
following day.
The bill before us today is not a per-
fect bill, but that is the nature of a
compromise. When the two parties
agree to work together, both sides have
to give up some things for the greater
good. That is the nature of compromise
and the nature of what we can do when
we agree to set aside partisanship for
the good of all those we are privileged
to represent.
Mr. Speaker, while I cannot support
the rule, I do support the underlying
measure. I think it represents a real bi-
partisan achievement that every Mem-
ber of the Chamber, Republican and
Democrat alike, can and should sup-
port.
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the
rule, but urge support for the under-
lying legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t
have any other speakers on this side of
the aisle, and I am prepared to close.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately bring
up H.R. 4261, a bill to prohibit taxpayer
funding in support of campaigns for the
offices of Senators or Representatives.
Earlier this Congress, my Democratic
friends passed H.R. 1, which included a
public funding scheme for congres-
sional elections that would transfer
hundreds of millions of taxpayer dol-
lars to congressional candidates, most
particularly to incumbents. That bill
included an astonishing 6–1 match for
campaign contributions under $200. For
every dollar a congressional candidate
raised, taxpayers would kick in an ad-
ditional $6 if that contribution was less
than $200. If the goal is to fix the cam-
paign finance system and level the
playing field, throwing even more
money into the system—especially tax-
payer dollars—makes zero sense.
As an appropriator, I find it hard to
think of a worse use of taxpayer dollars
than creating a government-funding
campaign ATM. At a time when we
could be funding the National Insti-
tutes of Health to help find a cure for
cancer, or fund needed infrastructure
projects across the country, or bring
broadband internet to rural areas,
Democrats in the House of Representa-
tives have, instead, made clear that
they want to spend taxpayer dollars on
themselves. Congress should take im-
mediate steps to ensure that taxpayer
dollars are never spent on congres-
sional campaigns, and H.R. 4261 would
accomplish that goal.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to
the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma?
There was no objection.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, in closing,
while I certainly oppose the rule, I
want to urge support for the under-
lying measure. H.R. 4378 is a bipartisan
continuing resolution that will fund
the government and keep it open for
the American people while we complete
our work on appropriations for fiscal
year 2020. It will also provide exten-
sions for critical programs impacting
constituents in every district in the
Nation.
I want to associate myself with my
friend’s remarks. While I haven’t voted
for very many of the appropriations
bills—I don’t think I voted for any of
them that this Chamber has passed be-
cause I have some strong disagree-
ments—the House has largely done its
work. We have largely completed the
appropriations process here.
I am glad our friends in the Senate—
and they had a reason to do this—they
waited until we had a bipartisan deal
with the administration in both cham-
bers on the top-line spending level. But
I agree with my friend that it is time
to get to work. It is time for these bills
in the Senate to start moving and get
passed. Then we can sit down, have the
appropriate negotiation between the
two chambers, hopefully arrive at a bi-
partisan agreement, and present the
legislation to the administration that,
hopefully, the President will be willing
to sign.
Again, I think buying the time we
need here, without inconveniencing the
American people, is a wise thing to do.
I urge all my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle to support that and vote no
on the previous question, no on the
rule, but yes on the underlying legisla-
tion.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote yes on the previous question and,
obviously, yes on the rule.
Let me just say that we need to do
something about campaign finance. I
think our current system is corrupt. I
think people wonder why this institu-
tion has enacted tax bills that favor
billionaires and millionaires at the ex-
pense of the middle class. Well, I think
you can tie that to the money. When
people want to know why we can’t get
the United States Senate to take up
sensible gun control legislation, like
universal background checks, I tell
them to follow the money. I think we
need to even the playing field so that
middle class families, and those strug-
gling to get into the middle class, are
heard on this Hill as much as corpora-
tions and special interests have been
over the past several years.
H.R. 1, which we passed in this
House, I think is a step in the direction

toward giving government back to the
people and taking it away from big cor-
porations, ending the practice of tax
bills that just favor the very well-off
and the well-connected, so I disagree
with the gentleman’s amendment.
But let me say this in conclusion. As
my good friend, Mr. COLE, pointed out,
this is a bipartisan compromise con-
tinuing resolution. I thank Chair-
woman LOWEY and Ranking Member
GRANGER, as well as my colleague from
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) who I know
worked so hard on the Appropriations
Committee, for getting us to this
point.
I wish we did not have to do con-
tinuing resolutions. In the future that
would depend on whether our col-
leagues in the United States Senate
want to get their act together and de-
liberate and legislate in a timely fash-
ion. We need to pass this because our
farmers are hurting. Our retailers, our
small businesses, and our local manu-
facturers are hurting.
Virtually, anyone who sets foot into
a store is forced to pay more for prod-
ucts today than before he took office
because President Trump’s tariffs are
causing the typical U.S. household
$1,000 a year. That is $1,000, Mr. Speak-
er.
None of us can control the Presi-
dent’s haphazard so-called negotiation
with China, but we can control whether
Congress acts to lift the threat of an-
other shutdown. The Senate may be in
disarray and the President may be fo-
cused on his latest Twitter feud or
talking about how many mountain
climbers couldn’t climb over his new
wall, or whether you can fry an egg on
it, but this majority is focused on the
American people. We are doing our job
to prevent a shutdown to provide nec-
essary funding that benefits all people
in this country and buying some time
so that we can work out a long-term
deal.
So I urge all my colleagues to join
with us today. Let’s encourage the
Senate Republicans and the President
to finally do the jobs they were elected
to do and keep this government funded.
We are doing our job, and in here,
today, we will bring a bipartisan prod-
uct to this floor—this bipartisan con-
tinuing resolution—that deserves a
strong vote on both sides of the aisle.
The text of the material previously
referred to by Mr. COLE is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 564
At the end of the resolution, add the
following:
SEC. 2. That immediately upon adoption of
this resolution, the House shall resolve into
the Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union for consideration of the

for election for the offices of Senator or Rep-
resentative of Congress. The first reading of
the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of
order against consideration of the bill are
waived. General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed one hour equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Committee
on House Administration. After general de-
bate the bill shall be considered for amend-
ment under the five-minute rule. All points
of order against provisions in the bill are
waived. When the committee rises and re-
ports the bill back to the House with a rec-
ommendation that the bill do pass, the pre-
vious question shall be considered as ordered
on the bill and amendments thereto to final
passage without intervening motion except
one motion to recommit with or without in-
structions. If the Committee of the Whole
rises and reports that it has come to no reso-
lution on the bill, then on the next legisla-
tive day the House shall, immediately after
the third daily order of business under clause
1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of
the Whole for further consideration of the
bill.
SEC. 3. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not
apply to the consideration of H.R. 4261.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure under
consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, while the House did its
work and passed 12 appropriations bills
through committee and 10 off the floor,
the Senate appropriations process is
far behind. Because of this delay, we
must pass a continuing resolution to
avoid another government shutdown
like the one that started late last year
which caused real harm to our econ-
omy and to hardworking Americans.
With less than 2 weeks until the end
of the fiscal year, a clean continuing
resolution that keeps government open
and funds key priorities is so impor-
tant. This legislation avoids controver-
sial policy provisions that have slowed
down the appropriations process and
that, if included, would jeopardize pas-
sage. For example, it does not include
an anomaly requested by the Trump
administration to allow wall building
outside the Rio Grande Valley.
At the same time, the CR contains
provisions that reflect shared prior-
ities, including allowing the Census
Bureau to ramp up preparations for the
2020 decennial Census, extending fund-
ing for the Ukraine Security Assist-
ance Initiative for another year, ensur-
ing that FEMA disaster relief can be
spent as quickly as needed to effec-
tively respond to disasters, ensuring
the Department of Agriculture can op-
erate rural water and waste loan pro-
grams, and extending the National
Flood Insurance Program and author-
ization for the Export-Import Bank.
In addition to these provisions, ex-
tenders that have been negotiated by
my colleagues on the Energy and Com-
merce and Ways and Means Commit-
tees will keep health programs that are
critical to American families up and
running.
By extending these programs and
government funding through November
21, this CR will allow additional time
to negotiate our differences and enact
responsible long-term funding for pri-
orities that help make our country
safer and stronger.
As we negotiate, families, businesses,
and communities across the country
will have much-needed budget cer-
tainty with no disruption to vital serv-
ices or to the pay of Federal employ-
ees.
After we pass this CR and the Senate
moves forward with their process,
Democrats will negotiate responsible
appropriations bills that uphold our
values and give working families a bet-
ter chance at a better life.
Keeping government open and pro-
viding certainty for our communities
must be a top priority. Our continuing
resolution is a necessary step to that
end.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in support of this legislation,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 4378, a continuing resolution
that will fund the government through
November 21.
It is unfortunate that we are here in
this situation and have to pass this CR
to keep the government open, but we
can’t afford an unnecessary and costly
shutdown.
Because the budget agreement did
not get enacted until August, the Sen-
ate began working on the fiscal year
2020 appropriations bills only last
week. As a result, there is simply not
enough time to complete the appro-
priations process by the September 30
deadline.
Passing a short-term CR will allow
us the time to complete the fiscal year
2020 appropriations bills, while ensur-
ing that our military and law enforce-
ment personnel get paid.
In addition to preventing another
shutdown, H.R. 4378 promotes economic
growth, strengthens national security,
protects life and religious liberty, al-
lows us to respond to disasters, and
supports public health programs.
It ensures farmers and ranchers will
continue to receive temporary relief
from retaliatory tariffs at a critical
time of the year for our Nation’s agri-
cultural industry.
It extends programs that are essen-
tial to countering China’s influence
over our economic and national secu-
rity.
It continues all existing pro-life pro-
tections from fiscal year 2019 appro-
priations measures.
It provides a short-term extension of
the National Flood Insurance Program

and allows FEMA flexibility to respond
to disasters.
I would much rather be here today in
support of full appropriations bills, but
I have confidence that, with more time,
we will be able to come together to
pass full-year appropriations bills that
the President can sign into law.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in voting in favor of this con-
tinuing resolution so that we can get
to work.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the major-
ity leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, first of all,
I want to start by congratulating
Chairwoman LOWEY and Ranking Mem-
ber GRANGER on working together. I
want to congratulate the members of
the Appropriations Committee.
I know there wasn’t always agree-
ment. I am hopeful, as we go forward,
we can reach agreement on the indi-
vidual bills or the minibuses or omni-
bus that we will ultimately pass to
fund government in a timely fashion.
Mr. Speaker, I know that Mrs. LOWEY
and Ms. GRANGER worked together to-
wards that objective. I want to con-
gratulate all the members.
Mr. Speaker, I am also proud of the
fact that we funded 96 percent of the
government through this House prior
to June 30 of this year. That has not
been done in over a decade, and it was
the hard work of the chair and the
ranking member and the members of
the committee. Even though there was
not agreement on the substance at the
end, without that cooperation, that
could not have happened, so I thank
the committee and its leadership.
As majority leader and as a member
of the Appropriations Committee, al-
beit on leave, I am focused, and we are
focused as a majority, on doing our job
and providing certainty for the mili-
tary, for Federal agencies, for workers,
for businesses, and for the American
people that the Congress can, in fact,
do its work in a responsible way.
I regret that the Senate has not done
its work. They have not passed a single
appropriations bill, not one. By the
time we came back in September, they
had not passed a single bill out of com-
mittee.
So this CR is necessary, as the Sen-
ate failed to introduce even a single ap-
propriations bill before August for the
first time in more than three decades,
let alone mark up or bring it to the
floor, as I said.
That is why we need to make sure
the government doesn’t shut down. We
don’t have to have drama. We don’t
have to have panic. We don’t have to
have people saying: ‘‘Why can’t the
Congress do its work?’’
We are bringing this bill to the floor,
and we are going to pass it today with,
I hope, a large bipartisan vote and send
it to the Senate. It is my under-
standing that they intend to pass this
so that we will not have the angst, the
lack of confidence in this institution,
and the instability because coming
right up to the precipice of closure is
avoided.
To that end, we have on the floor, as
I said, a continuing resolution to pre-
vent a shutdown. This CR, this con-
tinuing resolution, authorizes the oper-
ations of government through Novem-
ber 21. There was some discussion
about going into the middle of Decem-
ber.
Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my col-
leagues and I want to say to my com-
mittee, there is no reason on God’s
green Earth we cannot complete our
business on the appropriation process
by November 21, not a single reason,
except procrastination and an unwill-
ingness to compromise.
Americans have sent people with dif-
ferent views to this Congress, but not-
withstanding those differences in
views, they expect us to be able to
work.
One of the great pleasures that I have
had in this Congress is serving on the
Appropriations Committee, particu-
larly when I went there. It, frankly,
has become more partisan than it was
when I first went on in January of 1983.
I came to Congress in 1981. Sil Conte
was the ranking member from Massa-
chusetts on the Appropriations sub-
committee on which I served and of the
committee, and we were able to work
together, resolve our differences. Mr.
Speaker, I am proud of the fact that
Mrs. LOWEY and Ms. GRANGER have
that same psychology.
This bill will extend the authoriza-
tions that would otherwise expire at
the end of this month, including the
Export-Import Bank, the National
Flood Insurance Program, the Higher
Education Act, and a number of impor-
tant health programs.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. PALLONE,
chairman of the committee, for work-
ing to make sure that we could do that
in a timely fashion as well.
Mr. Speaker, I hope we can pass this
on a bipartisan basis, as I said, and
move forward in good faith to do the
job the American people sent us here to
do: assure the operations of their gov-
ernment in an efficient and effective
way on their behalf, a government that
expands justice, opportunity, economic
security, and strengthens our national
defense.
We came to a bipartisan budget
agreement on lifting spending caps in
July, and that was a good first step.
Next, we must come to a bipartisan
agreement on how to divvy up the al-
lotment to each of the 12 appropria-
tions bills, what we euphemistically
refer to as 302(b) allocations. We need
to make progress and compromise on
that issue.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my friends in the
Senate to not squander the extra time
this CR provides, approximately 7
working weeks, and come to agreement
among themselves first and then with
us.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman
LOWEY, her subcommittee chairs, Ms.
GRANGER and her ranking members for
their hard work moving the House bills
so expeditiously and producing a CR
that will avert a shutdown at the end
of September. We can get the job done.
Again, let me reiterate in closing, we
can complete this job prior to Novem-
ber 21, and that is exactly what we
ought to do.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho
(Mr. SIMPSON).
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of the continuing resolution before us
today.
I think we can all agree that con-
tinuing resolutions aren’t the ideal so-
lution to funding our government. In
fact, most of the people on the Appro-
priations Committee hate continuing
resolutions.
b 1430
Ideally, all of our 12 appropriations
bills would be enacted by October 1.
Last year, we were able to complete
several bills on time, including the en-
ergy and water bill.
But sometimes we need more time to
complete our negotiations. Considering
that a budget deal was not enacted be-
fore last month, there simply isn’t
enough time to complete work on these
bills before the new fiscal year.
So while continuing resolutions
aren’t ideal, supporting a short-term
CR to keep our government func-
tioning is the only responsible vote
today—I will say that again. It is the
only responsible vote today, for our na-
tional security, for our economy, and
for the general welfare of the American
people.
For instance, this bill will ensure the
Department of Energy can maintain
our nuclear weapons stockpile and the
Corps of Engineers can dredge our
ports and waterways so goods and ma-
terials can move freely.
I also appreciate that this bill recog-
nizes our farmers. Agriculture faces
uncertain times and the temporary re-
lief provisions, while not a solution, do
help.
I would also like to applaud the in-
clusion of a provision related to the
specialty crop initiative. This program
is vital to the success of potato farmers
in Idaho.
We must avoid disruptions to these
vital activities by passing this con-
tinuing resolution before us today and
then working towards completing our
work on the final appropriations bills,
as the majority leader said, by Novem-
ber 21.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote yes on this continuing resolution.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the
distinguished chairwoman of the Sub-
committee on Energy and Water Devel-
opment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7793
September 19, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Chairwoman LOWEY for her great lead-
ership.
It is with, actually, great reluctance
that I rise in support of today’s short-
term continuing resolution, and I urge
my colleagues to do so as well. While
this continuing resolution will keep
the lights on for the government of the
United States, surely, this isn’t the
most responsible course of action we
could follow.
This extension of current funding
means Federal agencies are effectively
forced to operate on autopilot. They
can’t begin any new programs or re-
spond to shifting priorities. To force
our Nation’s government to once again
operate on a continuing resolution has
been railed against by our Republican
friends as particularly problematic for
the Pentagon. And they are right. But
it is the lack of action from our Senate
Republican colleagues who deep-sixed
their fiscal responsibility and their
leadership that brought us here today.
I commend Chairwoman LOWEY’s real
leadership, and Speaker PELOSI, and
Majority Leader HOYER for their
prioritization and passage in the House
of 10 of the 12 annual appropriation
spending bills. But what has the Senate
achieved? Very little.
Despite Democratic warnings for
months about the need for a bipartisan
budget agreement, it took until July to
settle on top-line numbers. Only this
very month were our Senate colleagues
willing to advance their first bills.
Why you might ask? Because they
are beholden to the White House. But
this White House has consistently dem-
onstrated its lack of regard for the
Federal budget process itself, for Con-
gress’ constitutional power of the
purse, and for the constitutional sepa-
ration of powers when it comes to Fed-
eral funding decisions.
So I suppose there is a bit of time to
right this ship of state. But it will take
real courage from congressional Repub-
licans to separate themselves from the
irresponsible campaign promises of the
President. It will take serious commit-
ment in the Senate to produce bills
that can be conferenced with our House
versions that are just waiting for con-
ference.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Ohio.
Ms. KAPTUR. And by November 21, it
will take bipartisan responsibility to
support this body’s highest priority to
fund the entire Federal Government for
the remaining fiscal year 2020.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this short-term resolution and
demand our Republican colleagues get
serious about reasonable expectations
in a divided government. Let us com-
promise and let us govern as the people
of the United States expect.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
4 minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. ADERHOLT).
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing.
Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon in
support of this continuing resolution.
Having to pass a continuing resolu-
tion is never an ideal situation, as I
think most Members of this body
know. However, I support this CR be-
cause it will ensure that Congress can
provide the basic services which so
many of our constituents depend on.
I also support this bill because it pro-
vides us with the necessary time to ne-
gotiate those FY 2020 appropriations
bills, bills that have already been re-
ferred to this afternoon, bills that I
hope are both fiscally responsible and
will avoid poisonous, partisan riders,
unlike the bills that were passed over
the summer in the House, which Re-
publicans, frankly, cannot support.
This continuing resolution continues
Federal funding at last year’s levels
with limited exceptions to ensure our
government has the resources it needs
to aid our constituents and help them
where they need Federal assistance.
Serving as ranking member of the
Commerce, Justice, Science, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee, I sup-
port the inclusion of language that en-
sures the Census Bureau will stay on
track to deliver a full and accurate ac-
count of all Americans in the 2020 cen-
sus that will be beginning in a few
months, as well as the language that
enables the International Trade Com-
mission to meet its statutory man-
dates under the bipartisan American
Manufacturing Competitiveness Act.
I am also pleased that this legisla-
tion continues to provide for all exist-
ing pro-life protections that will allow
the USDA to provide temporary relief
from unjust tariffs in retaliation to
American farmers and ranchers during
the period of the continuing resolution.
Unfortunately, this bill does fall
short of providing the resources needed
by the United States Marshals Service
for the detention and care of its pris-
oners. Stepped up efforts under the
Trump administration to prosecute
firearms, drug, and immigration viola-
tions directly impact the United States
Marshals Service’s needs.
The safe, secure, and humane con-
finement of prisoners depends on ap-
propriate funding for this account. We
cannot, as a Congress, call for a crack-
down on gun crime and simultaneously
fail to adequately provide for the de-
tention of arrestees. This need must be
addressed in the FY 2020 legislation.
Therefore, in conclusion, Mr. Speak-
er, I look forward to working with my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle on
the Appropriations Committee as we
complete the consideration of FY 2020
appropriations bills under the budget
deal that was reached last month.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
pass this bill.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAL-
LONE), the chairman of the Committee
on Energy and Commerce.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, it is
good to see my colleague from New
Jersey in the chair. And I thank Chair-
woman LOWEY for yielding. She is my
classmate. There aren’t too many of us
left, but it is good to see her there.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
4378, the Continuing Appropriations
Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of
2019. I am particularly pleased that
H.R. 4378 includes a provision that will
increase enrollment numbers for the 9/
11 World Trade Center Health Program,
which provides healthcare and treat-
ment for responders and survivors.
Since being notified 2 weeks ago that
this program is approaching enroll-
ment capacity, I have been working
with my colleagues in the House and
the Senate, as well as the administra-
tion, to come to an agreement to raise
the enrollment cap in order to guar-
antee that new enrollees will continue
to have access to treatment. We were
able to quickly come together on an
agreement so that new enrollees will
access this program for many years to
come.
The bill, H.R. 4378, also includes tem-
porary funding extensions for several
Medicare extenders and public health
programs, including funding for com-
munity health centers, Medicaid fund-
ing for Puerto Rico and the U.S. terri-
tories, and the demonstration program
for certified community behavioral
health clinics. This temporary patch
will protect Americans’ access to these
vital programs while Congress works
toward a long-term agreement.
While I am relieved that this bill will
prevent any interruption of healthcare
services, I want to stress that our work
is far from done. We have to continue
to work toward a bipartisan, long-term
extension that provides funding capac-
ity to these programs for the millions
of Americans who depend on it.
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has already voted in support of
bipartisan, long-term extensions of
these programs, and I am hopeful that
we can reach a bipartisan, bicameral
agreement to get these extensions
signed into law before the short-term
patch expires in November.
Again, I thank Chairwoman LOWEY. I
know she, JERRY NADLER, CAROLYN
MALONEY, the New York representa-
tives, are very concerned about
healthcare in the aftermath of 9/11, so
I particularly appreciate your support
on that.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. CARTER).
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
4378, the continuing resolution. I wish
we were here to pass FY20 appropria-
tions bills, but the fact of the matter is
we are delayed.
We need to pass this bill to ensure
the government continues to operate.
This is especially important for the
critical functions of our government,
such as national defense, homeland se-
curity, and serving our veterans. It will

also ensure the men and women serving
the Nation, including my soldiers at
Fort Hood, are paid on time. This is
imperative and by itself is enough rea-
son to support this bill.
Passage of this bill will give us time
to finalize our FY20 appropriations
process.
I look forward to working with my
friend from Florida, the chairwoman of
the Military Construction, Veterans
Affairs, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee, Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ,
to finish our bill. I am ready to go to
work.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this continuing res-
olution.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the distin-
guished chairwoman of the Military
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding, and I thank my colleague
from Texas, the ranking member of the
Military Construction, Veterans Af-
fairs, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee, for being such an incred-
ible partner in our work together, and
I look forward to bringing our one-
twelfth of this bill in for a landing
when we complete the appropriations
process for this fiscal year.
But, for now, Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of this continuing resolution
which, yet again, puts us in a position
of having to avoid another shutdown.
The House has done its part, passing
ten appropriations bills, but the Repub-
lican Senate has been delinquent in
their responsibilities.
This resolution, thankfully, buys us
time, time that avoids any budgetary
anxiety that our families, businesses,
and communities simply don’t need
right now.
If Wall Street and Main Street agree
on one thing, it is that government
shutdowns help no one. What we all
want is what this continuing resolu-
tion provides: a measure of stability.
And, Lord knows, we need that right
now, given current events.
It avoids divisive policy fights and
embraces shared priorities, such as bol-
stering the 2020 Census Bureau prepara-
tions, which is a vital constitutional
responsibility, and ensuring our crit-
ical health programs don’t expire. And
namely, it does not fund the Presi-
dent’s border wall, yet does provide
much-needed Medicaid funding to
Americans still recovering in Puerto
Rico.
I am extremely proud of our leader-
ship, particularly our chairwoman, for
providing this budgetary certainty
that our economy needs right now, and
for ensuring that the priorities of
working families are protected.
Again, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this resolution, and I look forward
to working with my fellow appropri-
ators to bring the FY20 final bill in for
a landing.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART).
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I
also rise in support of this continuing
resolution.
As an appropriator, and you have
heard it from all of us, this is not the
best choice—it is not our first choice—
to do continuing resolutions. But this
short-term CR is necessary to give the
Senate time to move its appropriations
bills through the process.
In the meantime, Mr. Speaker, this
legislation is absolutely critical for our
men and women in uniform, for our
first responders, for our air traffic con-
trollers, and so many other public serv-
ants who keep us safe each and every
day.
b 1445
This legislation also has a limited
number of provisions that are, frankly,
important to Members on both sides of
the aisle. Let me just give you a couple
of examples. Disaster response tools
are in this CR and extension of flood
insurance and relief for the men and
women who help put the food on our
table, the American farmers.
Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, this
legislation gives us the opportunity to
complete our full-year appropriations
bills by November 21.
I am absolutely confident that we
can finish our bills by this date because
we have a bipartisan budget deal that
was signed by the President. I am par-
ticularly looking forward to working
with Chairman PRICE to finalize a T-
HUD bill to address the infrastructure,
safety, and housing needs of our great
country.
I also know that because of Chair-
woman LOWEY and Ranking Member
GRANGER, they will lead us through
this process in a transparent, clear
way, as they always have.
Mr. Speaker, again, we need to pass
this bill. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR), an
outstanding member of the Appropria-
tions Committee.
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Chairwoman LOWEY for her leadership
and her expertise on the Appropria-
tions Committee. I also thank my fel-
low Texan, Ms. GRANGER, for her work
and her leadership on this. And I thank
both of them for working in a bipar-
tisan way because, again, in support of
this continuing resolution, we are here
to build consensus, find common
ground, and keep government working
for our people.
We need to set aside partisanship and
bias, and think about and vote for what
is best for our country. This measure
allows us to continue the conversation
while we keep government open and
functioning.
This bill will extend several pro-
grams that are expected to expire at
the end of the month. For example, it
permits USDA to access the full $30 bil-
lion under the Commodity Credit Cor-
poration to assist our hardworking ag-
ricultural producers across the U.S.
It supports our farmers and ranchers
through the Market Facilitation Pro-
gram.
It extends funding for local commu-
nity mental and substance use disorder
treatment, which is so important to
our communities.
It allows the Census Bureau to con-
tinue with the 2020 Census preparation,
which is so important for all parts of
the country.
It supports small businesses by en-
suring the continuing operation and
funding of SBA loan programs.
It maintains critical disaster and
emergency funding.
It supports rural communities by
maintaining funding for water and
waste loan programs.
It also supports public health initia-
tives by extending funding for commu-
nity health centers and graduate med-
ical education.
We need to continue working to-
gether as Democrats and Republicans,
and working with our Senate folks, to
make sure that we get this done.
Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to sup-
port the continuing resolution and con-
tinue bipartisanship, and for that, I
thank them.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. FORTENBERRY).
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Ranking Member GRANGER for
the time but also for her important
leadership on this important bill.
I thank Chairwoman LOWEY for her
continuous work and leadership in
seeking common ground on this con-
tinuing resolution.
Mr. Speaker, as Ranking Member
GRANGER noted, we find ourselves in a
difficult position today, so we are de-
liberating a continuing resolution in-
stead of passing full-year appropria-
tions. It is important, though, that we
follow our constitutional duty to main-
tain government operations.
This bill will keep the government
open. It will support essential public
policies, and it will minimize the
drama in the budgetary process.
One of our constraints is that the
Senate did just start marking up its
bills, as has been noted, last week.
Mr. Speaker, I will focus my com-
ments on the agricultural portion of
the bill. On a positive note, in that re-
gard, the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee’s Agriculture, Rural Develop-
ment, Food and Drug Administration,
and Related Agencies Subcommittee
passed its bill out of the full com-
mittee just this morning.
Until the majority leader decides to
bring the Agriculture appropriations
bill to the floor, and it passes, we have
no option other than to wait for the
bill to move through the process. Until
that time, Chairman BISHOP and I will
be ready to start conferencing the Ag-
riculture appropriations bills with our
Senate colleagues.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7795
September 19, 2019
We look forward to House and Senate
leadership decisions on the respective
allocations for each of these individual
appropriations bills, and on that note,
I would strongly recommend that the
House and Senate leaders keep in mind
the critical needs of the agricultural
and rural communities, as well as food
and medical product safety, when ar-
riving at the final number for alloca-
tions.
As ranking member of the Appropria-
tions Committee’s Agriculture, Rural
Development, Food and Drug Adminis-
tration, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee, I was surprised to learn
that in the initial draft of this bill, it
would have halted desperately needed
payments to our farmers and ranchers
in rural communities.
The White House had requested an
anomaly, consistent with prior years,
that the continuing resolution carry a
noncontroversial provision to reestab-
lish the funding mechanism for farm
bill programs that support conserva-
tion, risk mitigation, as well as tem-
porary trade payments to farmers and
ranchers so hurt by unjustified retalia-
tory tariffs. The majority did recognize
the harm of not including this provi-
sion, and for that, I am very grateful.
I would like to make a plea to keep
farmers and ranchers out of any polit-
ical disputes. America’s farmers are
hurting, and now is the time for fur-
ther bipartisan solidarity.
Second, Mr. Speaker, this bill cor-
rects an oversight in the disaster
spending bill to help sugar beet farmers
in the Midwest. These hardworking
farmers have been devastated by 2
years of flooding, and they do deserve
equal assistance to others who have
faced unprecedented damage to their
crops and their livelihoods due to ex-
treme weather events.
Mr. Speaker, I support this con-
tinuing resolution. Let’s keep working
hard to finish the rest of the job.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very
pleased to yield 1 minute to the distin-
guished gentlewoman from the Virgin
Islands (Ms. PLASKETT).
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Chairwoman LOWEY, and I thank
the leadership for bringing this CR and
health extenders legislation to the
floor.
The bill contains critical Medicaid
relief for my district, the Virgin Is-
lands. It extends the disaster-related
100 percent Federal funding to sustain
Medicaid on our islands through No-
vember 21.
While the territories are part of
America, and we are American citizens,
Federal law unfairly places Medicaid
funding caps on the islands—unlike the
States, where funding is open-ended—
and it requires them to pay a much
greater percentage of Medicaid than
the States.
Supplemental funding has only been
provided on a temporary basis. Without
the fix in this bill, the rate of Federal
funding would plummet nearly 50 per-
centage points to the permanent,
capped level of 55 percent.
Cuts to that funding put basic
healthcare at risk for many Americans
living on our islands.
The fundamental problem is that the
U.S. territories are forced to operate
Medicaid under capped funding. A more
equitable matching rate is needed on a
permanent basis.
I know that the Energy and Com-
merce Committee has done so in its
legislation. We are hopeful that when
we work on a final budget, that will
take place.
I have sponsored legislation, H.R.
1354, to remove these caps perma-
nently. I thank everyone for advancing
this cause and this CR.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. JOYCE).
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I
rise in support of this bill, despite my
disappointment that a continuing reso-
lution is necessary at this point in
time.
The alternative is a government
shutdown, which would only serve to
hurt the American people by depriving
them of critical services, not to men-
tion wasting their money.
For example, this bill continues the
environmental reviews in permitting
that are necessary for economic and
energy development. This bill also
guarantees that our beloved national
parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and
other public lands stay open for busi-
ness, especially for those who depend
on tourism and those who have already
booked visits for the upcoming holi-
days.
This bill continues the flow of fund-
ing critical to all the communities
working to upgrade their infrastruc-
ture so that citizens can continue to
have access to clean and safe water.
This bill ensures that our Nation will
continue to meet its moral and legal
obligations to sovereign American In-
dian and Alaska Native Tribes, whose
ancestors paid in advance with their
lives and their lands for peace and the
promise of basic services like edu-
cation, public safety, and access to
healthcare.
For these reasons and more, I support
this bill, and I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to do the same.
There is so much more upon which we
agree than disagree.
Let us act on what we agree upon so
that our constituents can continue
their daily lives without interruption.
This bill continues the operation of
programs upon which we already
agreed only 7 months ago. Vote ‘‘yes.’’
I thank the ranking member for
yielding me this time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CALVERT).
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the ranking member and chairwoman
for their good work.
I rise today in support of the con-
tinuing resolution. Like many of my
colleagues, we are hopeful that, once
we had a budget deal, we would move
to conference and the appropriations
bills and pass them, if not on time,
close to on time. Unfortunately, the
Senate needs more time, and this will
give the Senate the time and the House
time to do their work.
The CR expires November 21. There is
more than enough time to sit down
with our colleagues in the Senate to
work out our differences. In fact, I
would hope we can still move quickly
and, if able, pass conference bills before
the end of the CR—most importantly,
for our U.S. servicemembers.
Our military has moved quickly to
restore readiness and modernize. Sec-
retary Esper has demonstrated his
commitment to a modern, more agile
Department that can quickly respond
to threats, and he needs our support to
continue his efforts.
I am confident that once the chair-
man and I have had a chance to sit
down with our Senate colleagues, we
can quickly work out our differences
and write a bill that keeps the military
on the path toward meeting the chal-
lenges posed by our adversaries, which
there is no lack of.
Recent events demonstrate that the
world needs our leadership and pres-
ence. I urge my colleagues to vote for
this CR and avoid the devastating im-
pacts of a government shutdown. Let’s
get to work on the fiscal year 2020 bills
to ensure the continuity of vital efforts
at the Department of Defense. I urge a
‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Without action, the government will
shut down in the next 2 weeks, causing
undue harm for our economy and hard-
working families. This is unacceptable.
Our continuing resolution will pro-
vide budget certainty for families,
businesses, and communities while we
negotiate long-term funding for our
priorities and fight to give every per-
son a better chance at a better life.
I urge support, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 564,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks on this
legislation and to insert extraneous
material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, in 1985, Christa
McAuliffe was selected out of over
10,000 applicants to be the first partici-
pant in NASA’s Teacher in Space pro-
gram, becoming the first private cit-
izen to be on a space mission.
Before her selection, Ms. McAuliffe
was a social studies teacher at Concord
High School in New Hampshire and ex-
tremely popular with her students.
McAuliffe was to be part of the space
shuttle Challenger’s crew and the mis-
sion plan, including having her conduct
not only some basic science experi-
ments, but also teach two 15-minute
classes from space that would be broad-
cast to millions of students.
On January 20, 1986, Christa
McAuliffe tragically lost her life,
alongside her six crewmates, in the
space shuttle Challenger disaster.
Ms. McAuliffe was posthumously
awarded the Congressional Space
Medal of Honor in 2004 and has had
scholarships and schools named in her
honor.
This year, a pair of teachers turned
astronauts, Ricky Arnold and Joe
Acaba, honored Ms. McAuliffe by film-
ing the lessons she would have taught,
had she lived to complete her mission,
while they were aboard the Inter-
national Space Station.
This film is accessible to students
around the world, courtesy of a part-
nership between NASA and the Chal-
lenger Center for Space Science Edu-
cation. The first lesson was released in
August 2018, and more lessons continue
to be released.
Proceeds from the sale of the com-
memorative coin will benefit FIRST,
the Nation’s leading not-for-profit
STEM engagement program. The mis-
sion of FIRST is to inspire young peo-
ple to be science and technology lead-
ers by engaging them in exciting, men-
tor-based programs that build science,
engineering, and technology skills that
inspire innovation and that foster well-
rounded life capabilities, including
self-confidence, communication, and
leadership.
Each year, more than 1 million chil-
dren in the U.S. and 100 countries par-
ticipate in FIRST. It has a presence in
every State and nearly every congres-
sional district.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to
support this bill and vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to first
start by taking just a few minutes to
recognize a dear friend of mine, a mem-
ber of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, Congressman SEAN DUFFY of
Wisconsin.
SEAN has been a good friend of mine
since the very beginning of when he
started running for Congress, and I
have had the pleasure of serving with
Mr. DUFFY since he came to Congress
in 2011.
As we say on the committee, known
for his punctuality, it is kind of amaz-
ing that he is here now. This might be
the first time he has been on time in
all his 9 years of service in the House.
SEAN has been a huge asset for the
Financial Services Committee and his
constituents in the Seventh District of
Wisconsin. He has worked on national
issues of importance, like flood insur-
ance; large issues, like international
regulation of insurance agreements; as
well as important, smaller issues that
are very important to people’s lives,
like mold and lead-based paint remedi-
ation and providing better options for
residents of public and assisted living
or assisted housing. He has been a
great advocate for his constituents,
and I have been honored to work with
him as a colleague.
He has led three separate subcommit-
tees on the Financial Services Com-
mittee. He has had a meaningful im-
pact on public policy. He has developed
meaningful relationships on both sides
of the aisle in this institution and has
been willing to have some of the bigger
debates on policy that, perhaps, were
divided in the party. He has always
done so with a joyful heart and a fan-
tastic capacity for communicating.
At some points, to the dismay of my
colleagues on the other side of the
aisle, including the chairwoman of the
committee, the debate can sometimes
get rough-and-tumble, but he always
does it with a smile on his face; and
you can have a conversation with him
afterwards, no matter how difficult or
challenging the conversation or debate.
While SEAN has been a colleague, I
have counted him as an adviser and a
friend and somebody I knew I could
talk to even in the toughest of times.

H7798 September 19, 2019
SEAN is leaving because of his family.
He has made a decision that it is the
right thing for his family, to depart
our institution and our schedule and
the challenges of public life at this
time in his family life. He has got a
beautiful family, some of whom are
here behind me today.
So we wish SEAN and Rachel Duffy
the best, and we will keep them, cer-
tainly, in our thoughts, but forever in
our prayers and in our hearts.
I thank SEAN so much for his leader-
ship.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.
239, the Christa McAuliffe Commemo-
rative Coin Act of 2019.
I would like to thank the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. UPTON), the dean of
the Michigan delegation, who has the
bill here in the House, H.R. 500, and
who has gathered more than 309 co-
sponsors on this bill to see it across the
line.
We know the story of Christa
McAuliffe. In fact, one of my first
memories of understanding what NASA
did was to see the tragedy of the loss of
the shuttle and the human tragedy of
somebody who is such a dedicated pub-
lic servant, dedicated to her classroom,
to teaching, but, also, her willingness
to put herself on the line to be a great-
er advocate for teaching and for edu-
cation.
Christa McAuliffe had a meaningful
impact on people’s lives, and this is a
representation of that. It is a fantastic
undertaking that we have had here
today. Due to the great work of Con-
gressman UPTON, we have wide, bipar-
tisan support for this important and
meaningful act before us.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader.
b 1545
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding. I want
to thank Mr. MCHENRY for his leader-
ship as ranking member of the com-
mittee, and for his bringing this to the
floor.
I want to thank my very good friend,
not my Republican friend, my very
good friend, FRED UPTON, for his work
and his leadership on this piece of leg-
islation, and my dear friend, ANNIE
KUSTER, for her leadership.
This is personal for me. I am so
happy to rise in support of this legisla-
tion.
I went to Georgetown Law School,
and I set up practice just about 5 or 7
miles from here in the late sixties. And
in the seventies, late seventies, I had a
law clerk; he also went to Georgetown
Law School. He was a young, bright,
extraordinarily able individual. His
name was Steve.
Steve is now a Federal District Court
Judge in New Hampshire. He had an ex-
traordinary wife, and her name was
Christa. Steve and Christa became very
dear friends of Judy’s and mine.
In those days, I had enough time to
sail, and I had a sailboat. Steve and
Christa, from time to time, would go
sailing with Judy and me and perhaps
some of my children. I remember
Christa with the wind in her hair,
beautiful outside but, more impor-
tantly, beautiful inside, full of life, full
of excitement, full of vision for what
she, as a teacher, could do for her chil-
dren.
Some of you may recall that
Christa’s motto as the Teacher in
Space was: ‘‘I touch the future. I
teach.’’ And she was looking forward
with such excitement, not only to
leave the bounds of Earth, but to re-
turn to Earth and engage with her stu-
dents; to share her experience; to share
the excitement and adventure of going
into a new frontier that we call space.
It is so appropriate that we pass this
coin bill in her name. Christa was my
friend. She was the best of us, as were
her fellow astronauts on that fated day
at the beginning of 1986, that, for a few
seconds, burned so brightly with so
much hope, and whose lives were
snuffed out in an instant as the CHAL-
LENGER blew up.
Christa, during the course of the
competition to be the teacher in space,
would visit my office that was in the
Longworth Building, in the back of the
building on the fifth floor.
Mr. Speaker, every time she would
come to Washington, she would come
to my office, and we would visit as she
was participating in the competition,
and I saw her excitement and her an-
ticipation. Obviously, NASA saw it as
well because, out of those 10,000, they
chose her to be the representative of
the most important profession in our
country, the teaching profession, with-
out whom our society cannot succeed.
It is so appropriate that this coin
bill, as the chairwoman has said, will
benefit a program called FIRST, that
Dean Kamen, one of the great engi-
neers and inventors in our country and,
indeed, the world, established; and now
we have literally thousands and thou-
sands and thousands of young people
all over this world participating in
STEM activities and, particularly, ro-
botics, who will be enabled to pursue
this program more fully.
Surely, no one is going to vote
against this bill, but we can all be very
proud of the fact that we not only me-
morialize an extraordinary fellow cit-
izen, fellow human being, who, as Ken-
nedy said, brought her energy and her
faith and her devotion to making her
country, her community, and our chil-
dren better.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman
for bringing this bill to the floor. I
thank Mr. MCHENRY for his support. I
thank Mr. UPTON, and I thank Ms.
KUSTER.
This is a thing that is good to do.
America is better for Christa
McAuliffe’s life.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my strong sup-
port for this bill.
Christa McAuliffe was more than just a
teacher and an American hero who lost her
life in the pursuit of science and our under-
standing of the universe.
Christa was a friend.
Her husband, Steven, now senior judge of
the U.S. District Court for the District of New
Hampshire, worked as my law clerk for two
years.
I got to know Christa then, and before the
couple moved to New England, Christa taught
in Prince George’s County schools in my dis-
trict.
As a graduate of Bowie State University and
then as a teacher for eight years in Prince
George’s County, she inspired so many young
people in Maryland to dream big and aim for
the stars.
Kind, intelligent, and compassionate—
Christa was a perfect choice for the ‘‘Teacher
in Space’’ program, to which she was selected
out of more than 11,000 applicants.
Christa was the ideal candidate.
She could connect with anyone; her person-
ality was magnetic.
She had a way of inspiring every student to
give his or her best, and she radiated a joy
and love of teaching every time she entered a
classroom or stood up to speak.
With trademark poise and determination,
Christa approached the challenge of space
travel like she did all others: with boundless
passion.
I remember when she spoke to over 12,000
people from Prince George’s County School
System after her selection for the ‘‘Teacher in
Space’’ program.
Everyone in the audience—from the young-
est students to the oldest teachers, parents
and guests—we all felt like we were about to
go on the journey alongside her.
Christa spoke about her goals for the
spaceflight, how she wanted to get students
and teachers around the country excited about
science and space.
She spoke of how the ‘new frontier’ of
space belongs to all of us as the children of
earth.
And she told us that she would be returning
to teaching after her journey to space, be-
cause that was what she loved, and nothing
could stop her from doing what she loved.
Of course, tragically, we know that she
never had that chance.
Today, we have an opportunity to help
make sure that Christa can continue to inspire
and instill lessons about science and space.
Even more than three decades after she
and the six astronauts perished in the Chal-
lenger disaster, we can carry on her legacy by
promoting S.T.E.M. learning with this new
commemorative coin program named in her
memory.
The proceeds will benefit the F.I.R.S.T. Ro-
botics Program, which engages and inspires
future generations to become leaders in
S.T.E.M. fields.
I hope my colleagues will join me in cele-
brating Christa’s life and building on her leg-
acy by supporting this legislation with strong,
bipartisan approval.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, if I may
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 151⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
the balance of my time to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON), the
dean of the Michigan delegation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7799
September 19, 2019
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Mr. MCHENRY for his leadership on
this, and for his co-sponsorship.
I want to particularly cite STENY
HOYER, not only as a great friend, but
as one who really helped shepherd this
to the floor today.
These are not easy. In fact, I talked
to a colleague earlier today who has
got another coin bill, and I told him I
don’t know if I can ever do another one
of these again. It takes a lot of work.
This has been bipartisan from the
very start, and I want to thank my
friend, MIKE CRAPO, who used to be on
the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, who now chairs the Senate Fi-
nance Committee.
But particularly, I want to thank my
three colleagues that I see on the other
side here, DEBBIE DINGELL, ANNIE
KUSTER, and CHRIS PAPPAS, for their
help to make sure that we could, in
fact, get more than 290 cosponsors,
which is the magic number to try and
get this thing done.
It is, as Mr. HOYER, the majority
leader, said, an important piece of leg-
islation; it really is. It is, in essence,
the Senate companion. Our bill, H.R.
500, is the companion to the Senate
bill, S. 239, which passed at the end,
just before the August break in the
Senate.
But we only do two coin bills a year.
And as one that helped buttonhole
Members about this, there is no cost to
the Treasury. That is important. All of
the costs are firstborn; the sale of the
coins all goes to reimburse the Treas-
ury for the costs that are associated,
and then the profits from the coins go
to the particular cause; in this case, it
is FIRST.
Many of us on both sides, all across
the country, have seen FIRST competi-
tions in high schools, with high
schools, tens of thousands of high
school students over the last 10, 15-
some years.
More than 3,500 individual corporate
sponsors help to enlist people to be en-
couraged to go into the math and
science fields, to compete, to develop
robots, to compete against each other,
to work with each other, build team
partnerships, and it really makes a dif-
ference.
In fact, there is a story that the cur-
rent Air Force Academy Super-
intendent apparently said earlier this
year that one of the first things that
they look at for students for admission
to the Air Force Academy is: Did they
participate in FIRST. Because they
know that if they did, that is an out-
standing outside-school activity and
they know that they are on the right
path.
What this coin is going to do, with
Christa McAuliffe’s picture, but the
other six astronauts that were with her
on that fateful January day, the sale of
that coin is going to help FIRST,
which was set up by Dean Kamen, who,
in my book, is a rock star. But he, in
essence, is the Thomas Edison of today.
Yep, he did the Segway. He also did
the kidney dialysis machine. He has
done prosthetics so that our veterans
coming back from Iraq and Afghani-
stan are actually able to be functional
in a way that makes up for the loss of
those particular limbs.
He is such an enthusiastic supporter
of this that it is not only in every
State in the Nation, but all around the
world now, in terms of competition.
And they have provided financial as-
sistance, I think more than $50 million
in scholarship loans, to students look-
ing to move on to higher education,
particularly in engineering.
So this coin is going to be a sellout.
I am looking forward to 2021 to getting
my coin for sure and helping the cause.
I would note that our State, in
Michigan, under Governor Snyder, and
now Governor Whitmer, a Republican
and a Democrat, they have authorized
in their budget at least $10 million a
year to help offset the costs that are
associated with the students as they
participate in this program that often
starts in January and concludes, as we
saw in the worldwide competition in
Detroit earlier this year, just a few
months later.
So it is a great program. All of us
need to support it.
Having more than 300 cosponsors was
pretty awesome to do in just a short
amount of time. And I congratulate my
colleagues from New Hampshire, par-
ticularly the ones that are on the floor
today for their work with our Senate
colleagues to get this thing across the
finish line. Knowing that you can only
do two is pretty amazing.
I reserve the balance of my time, just
in case somebody needs it. I urge all
my colleagues to support this bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Michigan cannot reserve.
The gentleman from North Carolina
controls the time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from New
Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER).
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for
yielding, and I thank our colleagues on
the other side of the aisle.
I am so thrilled today to rise in favor
of the Christa McAuliffe Commemora-
tive Coin Act.
Christa McAuliffe was a teacher at
my alma mater, Concord High School,
and she was my hero. Christa was
smart; she was charming; she was the
kind teacher who left her mark on
countless students through her willing-
ness to do whatever it took to help
them succeed.
The Concord and broader New Hamp-
shire community was thrilled when she
was chosen out of over 10,000 applicants
as NASA’s first teacher in space. Her
mission was to inspire a generation of
American students to look toward the
sky and pursue careers in science. And
her motto, as Mr. HOYER noted: ‘‘I
touch the future. I teach.’’
She cared about America, and every
year she invited my mother, former
State Senator Susan McLane, into her
classroom so that her students would
know about our government and oppor-
tunities for their future.
Her husband, Steve, and their two
children, were important in our com-
munity. And I am reminded of the
story, when President Bush announced
Christa’s appointment, he whispered
into Steve’s ear: ‘‘You will be making
your dinner a lot more on your own.’’
Tragically, on January 28, 1986,
Christa, along with six other members
of the Challenger Space Shuttle crew,
perished when the shuttle exploded.
I can’t tell you the number of col-
leagues when I was asking for their sig-
natures to join us in this bipartisan
bill said, I remember exactly where I
was when that happened.
But we remember Christa because
she wanted her students to seek out
the best in themselves, and always to
reach a little higher. Inspired by
Christa’s leadership, her students did
just that by going on to become teach-
ers and to pursue careers in science and
education and public policy.
Christa’s legacy can be seen all over
the State of New Hampshire; from the
Christa McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery
Center, which is a planetarium in our
town, to Christa McAuliffe Middle
School in Concord. And I am proud
that this coin will help cement
Christa’s place in American history for
generations to come.
So it is fitting that the proceeds from
the coin will support FIRST Robotics,
a nationwide leader in STEM edu-
cation, founded, as Mr. UPTON said, by
New Hampshire inventor, Dean Kamen,
to help fulfill Christa’s legacy by help-
ing students discover the wonders of
the world through education and
science.
I was so proud to work with my col-
leagues and friends, FRED UPTON,
DEBBIE DINGELL, and my new colleague
from New Hampshire, CHRIS PAPPAS, to
help secure the cosponsors needed to
pass this bill. I appreciate Leader
HOYER’s and Chairwoman MAXINE
WATERS’ willingness to move this bill
and to honor Christa McAuliffe.
I urge my colleagues to vote for this
bill.

Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL).
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of S. 239, the Christa McAuliffe
Commemorative Coin Act of 2019.
We all remember where we were on
January 28, 1986, the day we lost the
space shuttle Challenger and its crew,
and Americans all across the country
mourned. Among the brave crew mem-
bers was New Hampshire’s own Christa
McAuliffe, who had been chosen as the
first teacher in space.
Through her spirit and enthusiasm
for pioneering the unknown, she en-
couraged a generation to reach for the
stars. Her quest for knowledge and her
commitment to inspiring young people

to pursue their dreams has had a last-
ing impact on children everywhere. To
honor her and keep her dream alive for
the next generation, my dear friends
Representative UPTON, who has been
incredible, Representative ANNIE
KUSTER, and Representative PAPPAS,
Michigan and New Hampshire, have
worked together for this, and I thank
them for their leadership.
The bill will mint a commemorative
coin, with the proceeds going to sup-
port the New Hampshire-based non-
profit FIRST, or For Inspiration and
Recognition of Science and Tech-
nology.
Each year, they host the first robot-
ics competition, and we see young peo-
ple building these robots, encouraging
and inspiring them to invest in science
and math. I try to go to them every
time I can. I was just at an all-women’s
one last Saturday. They strive to in-
spire young people to be leaders in the
science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics fields.
There is no better way to honor the
memory and life of Christa McAuliffe
than to continue to inspire and encour-
age young people to be at the forefront
of innovation and technology.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
supporting this.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
It is amazing how a teacher can
touch lives. Christa McAuliffe touched
lives, not just for the students in her
classroom, not just in her community,
but by what she means to the Amer-
ican people and how her contribution is
marked in the American psyche of
what teachers are and what they rep-
resent in such a significant way.
The Challenger tragedy was a mas-
sive loss for us as Americans in terms
of human life, certainly. But it is
marked in American history, and it is
marked in American history in a very
special way and has a quite different
feel because of Christa McAuliffe.
The work put in to bring a coin bill
to the floor is extraordinary, and I
have to say this: The challenge to get
a coin bill to the House floor is enor-
mous under our rules. Under a bipar-
tisan understanding, we have a massive
hurdle in order to get here. It is not a
normal process to bring a bill to the
floor. It is an onerous and difficult one.
That is why we have so few bills to
strike new coins that come across the
House floor and get enacted into law. It
is a proper thing to make it onerous
and difficult because, when it happens,
it shows what we are trying to rep-
resent with that coin, whether it is a
person, a community, an action, that
what they did was so pure, so perfectly
American, and that what they did, that
person, that group, what they did
should be noted in American history
and should be noted in a meaningful
way, a meaningful enough way that it
was how the Romans marked who their
emperors were.
This is our way of saying in a very
special way that Christa McAuliffe was
a wonderfully special human being who
made a significant mark as an Amer-
ican.
I thank Congressman UPTON for the
massive amount of passionate work
that he put in to make this day pos-
sible. I thank my colleagues across the
aisle for this process and for the out-
come that we have here today.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, 2021 marks the 35th
anniversary of the space shuttle Chal-
lenger tragedy. This bill will help com-
memorate and further Christa
McAuliffe’s inspirational life and help
develop a new generation of dreamers
and innovators by providing FIRST
with additional funding to launch
young people into critically needed,
well-paying STEM jobs.
I thank the sponsor of the House
companion to S. 239, the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. UPTON), and I urge
my colleagues to join me in supporting
this important piece of legislation.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
on the morning of January 28, 1986, the
Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart just
over a minute after launch. We will always re-
member the brave Challenger crew, and the
sacrifice they made to help advance the explo-
ration of space. Among those lost in the Chal-
lenger tragedy was one teacher, Christa
McAuliffe, who was to be the very first teacher
to go to space with NASA’s new Teacher in
Space project. The Teacher in Space project
was created to spark students’ interest in
science, exploration, and discovery.
Teachers are leaders and inspirers. Teach-
ers encourage their students to reach for the
stars; devoting their careers to uncovering the
endless opportunities that are out there for
their pupils. That is just what Christa McAuliffe
was seeking to do when she joined the Teach-
er in Space project. Ms. McAuliffe was once
asked to describe her philosophy of living, to
which she answered, ‘‘to get as much out of
life as possible.’’
The Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin
Act of 2019 is an excellent way to recognize
and remember Ms. McAuliffe for her contribu-
tions to education and to celebrate women in
STEM. We must continue to uphold Ms.
McAuliffe’s mission to boost the next genera-
tion’s interest in the sciences. Christa
McAuliffe decided to embark on this adventure
with her students in mind, knowing she would
have incredible lessons to teach them when
she returned from space. Although she never
returned, the story of her life will continue to
inspire successive generations of students to
explore, to remain curious, and to keep a love
of learning alive.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
TITUS). The question is on the motion
offered by the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. WATERS) that the House
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S.
239.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7802 September 19, 2019
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of
the House Budget Committee, provided that
such statement has been submitted prior to
the vote on passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert
extraneous material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I thank Representative GARCIA for
this important piece of legislation that
establishes a whistleblower program at
the Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Board. This program is similar to
the program that was created by the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act for the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission.
At the SEC, this program has proven
to be extremely successful and has
been instrumental in incentivizing
whistleblowers to report suspected mis-
conduct while protecting them from re-
taliation by their employers. Accord-
ing to the SEC, the SEC’s whistle-
blower program has awarded approxi-
mately $381 million to 62 individual
whistleblowers since the program
began.
Given the PCAOB’s critical mission
to protect investors and further the
public interest by ensuring inform-
ative, accurate, and independent audit
reports of public companies and SEC-
registered brokers and dealers, it is
vital that PCAOB whistleblowers are
incentivized to come forward and are
protected from employer retaliation.
Due to the success of this program
and its proven track record at the SEC,
I urge my colleagues to support this
commonsense bill. Madam Speaker, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I rise to speak on H.R. 3625, the
PCAOB Whistleblower Protection Act.
I thank the Congresswoman from
Texas for her leadership on this bill
and for her work on the committee.
Madam Speaker, businesses have a
self-interest in detecting and elimi-
nating illegal activity as swiftly as
possible within their organizations. As
such, businesses, including audit firms
and clients of audit firms, generally
strive to comply with the law because,
ultimately, violating the law hurts in-
vestors and, thereby, hurts their busi-
ness and hurts their reputation.
Violating the law is bad for business,
right? It hurts the company’s reputa-
tion, its value. It keeps business part-
ners away. It breeds distrust in the
marketplace. We know all of these
things.
However, sometimes, businesses need
someone to call out bad behavior or il-
legal activity. Whistleblowers play an
important role in rooting out bad be-
havior that harms the markets, that
harms Mr. and Mrs. 401(k), average, ev-
eryday investors, which most of us are.
Moreover, it is important to appro-
priately incentivize whistleblowers to
either report potentially unlawful ac-
tivity internally or to appropriate gov-
ernment authorities. That is why we
have whistleblower statutes. That is
why this is a good piece of legislation.
To that end, I am glad to see that
this bill, which will establish rewards
for certain whistleblowers whose tips
lead to PCAOB—or Peekaboo, as we
call it on the Financial Services Com-
mittee—monetary sanctions.
This builds on the structure of the
SEC’s whistleblower program in a re-
cent bill that we passed out of the
House in the month of July that pro-
tects internal whistleblowers as well.
Additionally, I want to note that the
provision in this bill that states that,
to the maximum extent possible, the
PCAOB shall coordinate with the Office
of the Whistleblower at the SEC in car-
rying out the law under this bill.
The SEC whistleblower has been
around for quite a while. They have the
good regard of both parties, I think, in
terms of how they respond. We want to
make sure that experience is well co-
ordinated with this new whistleblower
authority at PCAOB.
I hope that, where possible, the SEC’s
Office of the Whistleblower can provide
significant assistance to the PCAOB, if
not handle all these whistleblower
claims itself. They have that type of
experience. I think it would be proper
for that agency to do that and to en-
sure that it is done in the most cost-ef-
fective manner for the taxpayer and for
the investors as well.
This legislation is good, in that it
provides flexibility for that best deliv-
ery system as the SEC and Peekaboo
go about this.
Again, I thank my colleague from
Texas for her hard work on this bill
and for bringing an important piece of
legislation that is good for taxpayers,
good for investors, and really good for
the stability of the markets and the be-
lief in the stability of the markets. I
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA).
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, this legislation is very simple. It
would establish a whistleblower pro-
gram at the Public Company Account-
ing Oversight Board based on the pro-
gram Congress established at the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission under
Dodd-Frank.
The Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board was originally estab-
lished to ensure proper oversight of au-
dits of public companies. This was done
after the implosion of Enron and its ac-
counting firm Arthur Andersen, some-
thing that was very painful to many in
my district in Houston.
In the Dodd-Frank Act Congress
passed, it expanded the whistleblower
program at the SEC to both provide in-
dividual protections for retaliation if
they came forward to the Commission
and made them eligible for monetary
awards if their information led to en-
forcement action. Likewise, under my
bill, individuals would be eligible for a
reward program upon the successful
completion of disciplinary action.
Whistleblowers would be incentivized
to come forward when they suspect vio-
lations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; the
rules of the PCAOB and the SEC; and
other rules, laws, and professional
standards governing audits of public
companies. Importantly, these whistle-
blowers would also be protected
against retaliation from their employ-
ers.
In July, this House overwhelmingly
passed the Whistleblower Protection
Reform Act by a vote of 410–12.
b 1615
This bill uses the very same whistle-
blower protections that the House
passed in that piece of legislation.
This legislation would implement a
key recommendation that the Project
on Government Oversight board made
in a recent report.
Madam Speaker, as one can see from
that report, it is likely more could be
done to strengthen this oversight board
and its enforcement abilities, but I am
confident that this bill is a good first
step.
One of the reasons that investors
from around the world invest in Amer-
ica is the stability and transparency of
our public markets. Congress, the pri-
vate sector, and regulators have all
worked hard to make transparency a
selling point around the world. This
bill is just one small tool in the tool-
box of making sure that transparency
and the investor faith it generates in
this country continue.
Supporters of this bill include the
National Whistleblower Center, The In-
stitute of Internal Auditors, and Public
Citizen. This bill passed by voice vote
out of committee.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank
Chairwoman WATERS and the ranking
member, Mr. MCHENRY, and their staffs
for working with us to incorporate
some of the bipartisan suggestions that
I believe make this bill stronger by en-
suring that the SEC and the PCAOB
coordinate in their whistleblower ef-
forts. Those changes make this bill
stronger, and I thank them for their bi-
partisan support.
Madam Speaker, I will close by sim-
ply saying that PCAOB works. Let’s

keep it going. I hope that all my col-
leagues will join me in supporting this
legislation, and I ask for their support.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I would like to com-
mend my colleague from Texas—
though new to this legislative body,
she has shown experience in how she
has legislated here—and the willing-
ness of the Democrat majority staff on
the committee to work with my staff
to ensure that we have a bill that is
functional and right and can get wide
support, as it should. So I thank the
gentlewoman for this, which it may be
her first legislative undertaking
through the committee, and I want to
commend her for the work that she has
done.
I address the Chair in saying that,
but I think it is important that this
body understands that there is good
legislating that happens on our com-
mittee, and bipartisan legislating.
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as
he may consume to the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA), the
ranking member of the Investor Pro-
tection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital
Markets Subcommittee, and my friend
and colleague.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing.
I do need to point out, while this bill
had passed by a voice vote, it does not
mean that it did not have opposition,
and I rise today to express my concern
with this bill which would establish
this whistleblower incentive program
at the PCAOB.
Now, my opposition to this should
not be interpreted as opposition to a
whistleblower—in fact, it is the oppo-
site of that—or a whistleblower pro-
gram, but there are a number of rea-
sons why I believe, and I think are
clear, that this is a redundant program
that is already covered in other ways.
First, the bill is at odds with estab-
lished principles of confidentiality that
exist within the auditing profession.
State laws and professional standards
require accounting professionals to
maintain the confidentiality of client
information received in the course of
performing an audit. This bill purports
to exclude from whistleblower status
any person who gains the information
while performing audit work.
However, the exclusion is muddled by
an unclear and potentially broad excep-
tion. As a result, it is very possible
that personnel performing audits may
try to garner bounties by blowing the
whistle on their audit clients, contrary
to their professional obligations.
By providing monetary incentives for
audit personnel to go to the PCAOB,
the bill inevitably will have harmful
effects on the auditor-audit client rela-
tionship, the audit process, and the
public’s confidence in the financial re-
porting process.
This bill also raises other significant
questions. For example, why is a pro-
gram at the PCAOB even necessary in
light of the Security and Exchange
Commission’s already well-established
whistleblower program? This is a com-
pletely redundant function that is
being attempted here.
Additionally, what are the costs as-
sociated with setting up a new whistle-
blower program, and will these costs
force the PCAOB to divert resources
from other projects in order to get this
duplicative program off the ground?
So, in light of these concerns, I be-
lieve that this is a redundant and ill-
conceived bill that likely has one pur-
pose: to provide another avenue for
plaintiffs’ bar to enrich itself. That is a
massive concern that I and so many
others involved in this have.
It is incumbent upon those who sup-
port this bill to explain why they be-
lieve that auditors, who play such a
critical gatekeeping function in our
capital markets, should be potentially
offered the prospect of monetary boun-
ties at the expense of disrupting the ef-
fective functioning of the audit process
as it is today, especially in light of the
SEC’s well-established whistleblower
program that would cover all of these
particular circumstances.
Madam Speaker, I do appreciate the
ranking member yielding time to me.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
thank my colleague for his comments.
Certainly, there is a diversity of
thought among our colleagues on this
bill.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA), who is the
author of this legislation, and she will
sufficiently describe why this bill is
not redundant.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I will be brief, just two points:
Number one, it is not redundant. If it
were so, the National Whistleblower
Center and The Institute of Internal
Auditors wouldn’t see a need for it, and
neither would the report that we have
now placed in the RECORD. It is needed,
and certainly we need to support it.
Secondly, in terms of costs, the cost
for implementing this bill will be offset
by the increase in fees that the board
will collect from the accounting boards
for which they have oversight. So there
will be no additional costs. It will be
offset.
Madam Speaker, it is needed, and I
urge adoption of this bill.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
am prepared to close.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
have no additional speakers. I reserve
the right to close.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Whistleblowers provide an important
function. We want to make sure that
there are legal constraints on this, ob-
viously. The Securities and Exchange
Commission have shown themselves
good actors in terms of implementing
the whistleblower law that we cur-
rently have on the books, and I antici-
pate, with the capacity for implemen-
tation, that there could be that like
kind of coordination between PCAOB
and the SEC in order to implement this
bill.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
First, Madam Speaker, I congratu-
late the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
GARCIA). I am so very proud of the
work that she is doing on the Financial
Services Committee. We are here today
on this particular legislation, but this
particular legislator, who serves on the
Financial Services Committee, has un-
dertaken to produce legislation that is
so meaningful, not only for her district
and for her State, but for this country.
I am very pleased about this bill today,
and I join her in saying it is certainly
not redundant.
Madam Speaker, I think the gen-
tleman on the opposite side of the aisle
from Michigan almost forgot why he
came here, because he used the word
‘‘redundant’’ at least six or seven
times, and he repeated it and repeated
it because I think it was difficult for
him to find other words to try and ex-
plain why he was on the floor today op-
posing this bill.
The SEC has demonstrated the value
of whistleblowers. And, yes, the whis-
tleblowers are compensated, but they
save our government money. They save
the SEC money. They save harm from
being done to those investors that we
should be protecting.
Madam Speaker, again, I can’t say
enough about Congresswoman GARCIA
and this bill and the work that she is
doing, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
WATERS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3625, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert
extraneous material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H.R. 3619, the Appraisal Fee Trans-
parency Act, and I want to thank the
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY)
for bringing this bill to the House.
This bill would provide the Appraisal
Subcommittee with greater flexibility
to adjust the structure and amount of
the fees they charge to appraisal man-
agement companies to alleviate con-
cerns that the current statutory re-
quirements governing these fees are
too rigid and would have put pressure
on appraisal management companies to
pass on the burden of unnecessarily
high fees to appraisers and reduce the
number of appraisers that they work
with.
At a time when some areas of the
country are experiencing an appraiser
shortage, we cannot afford to make it
harder for appraisers to obtain work.
This bill would also create a national
registry of appraiser trainees, much
like there is already a national reg-
istry of licensed appraisers. This is one
small step that will help facilitate the
entry of new appraisers into the indus-
try.
Finally, this bill would provide con-
sumers with a separate disclosure of
fees paid to the appraiser and fees paid
to the appraisal management company
in order to enhance their under-
standing of the costs associated with
their mortgage.
These are reforms that are broadly
supported by the appraisal industry
and will make meaningful changes to
this industry which makes up a critical
part of the home buying process.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY) for
offering this bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H.R. 3619, the Appraisal Fee Trans-
parency Act of 2019.
In June, the Financial Services Com-
mittee held a hearing on a variety of
issues relating to the appraisal process.
The issue of appraisal industry reform
might not be an exciting headline, but
honest, educated, and, importantly,
independent appraisals help ensure the
safety and soundness of mortgage lend-
ing.
We know how the last financial crisis
happened, and it started with mort-
gages, so it is really important that ap-
praisals are accurate and true.
As neutral parties, appraisers help
determine the fair market value of as-
sets for both lenders and purchasers.
b 1630
Yet, much of the current appraisal
framework remains an antiquated, con-
fusing maze of overlapping and con-
flicting State and Federal rules. These
inefficiencies harm appraisal quality,
lower competition, and inhibit market
innovation. Building a 21st century
housing finance system requires us to
do better.
The bill we are considering today is a
good first step in that reform process.
It makes the necessary improvements
to the fee structure and to the ap-
praiser registry. These reforms will
help increase transparency and clarity
for consumers in an already complex
regulatory scheme.
The bill also allows the Federal Ap-
praisal Subcommittee to set up a less
arbitrary fee schedule for appraisal
management companies. These man-
agement companies are intermediaries
lenders sometimes use to provide cer-
tain appraisal-related services. This
new schedule will help increase com-
petition and employment within the
industry. Its proceeds will be used to
improve appraiser complaint investiga-
tions and enforcement activities.
The bill would also, for the first
time, allow trainees to be listed on the
subcommittee’s national registry for
appraisers. This will help meet ap-
praisal needs, as well as help those
trainees receive the valuable on-the-
job experience they need to gain fur-
ther accreditation. That is just the na-
ture of the apprenticeship process that
the appraisal industry has in order to
get licensure in most States.
The bill also provides for greater
transparency under the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act, or what we
commonly call RESPA. If you have
ever had a mortgage, you understand
what RESPA is. You may not under-
stand RESPA, but you know what it is,
is probably the more accurate way to
say it. This is an important trans-
parency measure for the disclosure of

the fees to the management companies
when one is used in a transaction.
Finally, the bill adds a representa-
tive from the Veterans Administration
to the current seven member Federal
Appraisal Subcommittee, along with
HUD, the Fed, the OCC, FHFA, FDIC,
NCUA, and the CFPB. If you are listen-
ing at home, don’t worry about the de-
tails of it. It is basically every Federal
regulator in Washington has a seat at
the board. We are now putting the VA
on there because the VA Administra-
tion does mortgages as well for vet-
erans. So let’s get them all at the table
and let’s have them all communicate.
That covers the national mortgage
market that we currently have. This is
good legislating. That is basically what
I am saying.
I think it is a welcome thing to add
veterans to the mix on the sub-
committee. They currently make up
roughly 10 percent of mortgages annu-
ally, so it is really important they
have a seat at the board and a seat at
the table, especially, around this im-
portant issue.
Their input will help the sub-
committee promote greater uniformity
in its supervisory role. Taken together,
these reforms will help sort out some
of the antiquated, confusing, and over-
lapping appraisal rules.
This bill was reported out of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee unani-
mously. I commend its sponsor and co-
sponsor. Chairman CLAY of the Hous-
ing, Community Development and In-
surance Subcommittee has done great
work. He will work with Republicans
where he can, but he tries to beat us on
most days. But on this one, he worked
with Ranking Member DUFFY in order
to have this bipartisan bill before us
today.
Representative CLAY is a tough Dem-
ocrat, who represents his State well,
and is a tough negotiator. What we
have before us is a really good bill be-
cause of the quality of legislating—not
easy legislating, but tough legis-
lating—that Representative CLAY is
about on the Financial Services Com-
mittee and here in Congress.
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of
this meaningful reform, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Missouri (Mr. CLAY), the chair of the
Subcommittee on Housing, Community
Development and Insurance.
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, I rise in
support of H.R. 3619, the Appraisal Fee
Transparency Act of 2019. I thank
Chairwoman WATERS for yielding the
time, as well as the support that she
has given.
Let me also thank Ranking Member
MCHENRY for his support of this legis-
lation, as well as the ranking member
of the subcommittee, Mr. DUFFY, who I
hope will be replaced with someone
just as competent as Mr. DUFFY has
been.
This bill would provide the Appraisal
Subcommittee with greater flexibility
to determine the structure and amount
of the fee charged to appraisal manage-
ment companies, provide the Appraisal
Subcommittee with greater flexibility
to utilize fee proceeds to partner with
different entities to ensure compliance
with Federal appraisal standards, add a
representative of the Department of
Veterans Affairs to the Appraisal Sub-
committee, create a national registry
of appraisers in training, and provide
consumers with greater transparency
in the disclosure of fees paid by ap-
praisals.
Madam Speaker, as you are well
aware, a significant part of the housing
market is comprised of veterans, as
was mentioned, but currently the Ap-
praisal Subcommittee does not have
representation from the Department of
Veterans Affairs. This bill would add a
designee from the VA, which further
acknowledges the unique critical role
of our veterans.
Though this bill does not address this
directly, one of the takeaways from the
hearing that we held back in June was
the lack of diversity in the appraisal
industry, which currently does not
have many women or minorities. That
is one of the reasons this bill adds a na-
tional registry of appraiser trainees,
which would help bring new people into
this unique and very important indus-
try.
Lastly, the bill makes it Federal law
to disclose to consumers the fee that
they pay for their appraisals. This con-
sumer-friendly addition to the bill pro-
motes transparency and ensures that
the opaque world of appraisals is be-
coming more understandable to the av-
erage home buyer.
I will add that one of the most com-
pelling parts of the appraisal hearing
was the testimony of scholar Andre
Perry of the Brookings Institution
where he discussed in-depth the re-
search of his colleagues which dem-
onstrated that the appraisal industry
has contributed to the growing racial
wealth gap.
Madam Speaker, I look forward to
the support of the House of this impor-
tant legislation.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I, again, thank the
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY)
for bringing this bill to the floor. This
bill will remove another impediment to
obtaining homes for everyday Ameri-
cans by making more appraisers avail-
able to home buyers.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this
important piece of legislation, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
WATERS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3619, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

SHUTDOWN GUIDANCE FOR
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACT
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and pass the
bill (H.R. 2290) to require the Federal
financial regulators to issue guidance
encouraging financial institutions to
work with consumers and businesses
affected by a Federal Government
shutdown, and for other purposes, as
amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2290
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Shutdown
Guidance for Financial Institutions Act’’.
SEC. 2. SHUTDOWN GUIDANCE FOR FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS.
(a) GUIDANCE.—Not later than the end of
the 180-day period beginning on the date of
enactment of this Act, the Federal financial
regulators shall, jointly, in consultation
with State banking regulators and other ap-
propriate Federal and State agencies, issue
shutdown guidance to the financial institu-
tions they regulate encouraging the finan-
cial institutions to—
(1) work with consumers and businesses af-
fected by a shutdown;
(2) recognize that consumers and busi-
nesses affected by a shutdown may lose ac-
cess to credit and face temporary hardship in
making payments on debts such as mort-
gages, student loans, car loans, business
loans, or credit cards;
(3) consider prudent efforts to modify
terms on existing loans or extend new credit
to help consumers and businesses affected by
a shutdown, consistent with safe-and-sound
lending practices; and
(4) take steps to prevent adverse informa-
tion being reported in a manner that harms
consumers affected by a shutdown, including
by preventing modified credit arrangements
intended to help consumers fulfill their fi-
nancial obligations from being reported to,
and coded by, consumer reporting agencies
on a consumer’s credit report in a manner
that hurts the creditworthiness of the con-
sumer.
(b) NOTICE OF GUIDANCE DURING A SHUT-
DOWN.—Not later than the end of the 24-hour
period beginning at the start of a shutdown,
the Federal financial regulators shall, joint-
ly, issue a press release to alert financial in-
stitutions, consumers, and businesses to the
existence, and content, of the guidance
issued pursuant to subsection (a).
(c) POST-SHUTDOWN REPORT TO CONGRESS
AND UPDATED GUIDANCE.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than the end of
the 90-day period beginning on the date a
shutdown ends, the Federal financial regu-
lators shall, jointly, issue a report to Con-
gress containing an analysis of the effective-
ness of the guidance issued pursuant to sub-
section (a).
(2) UPDATED GUIDANCE.—Not later than the
end of the 180-day period beginning on the
date a report is issued under paragraph (1),
the Federal financial regulators shall update
the guidance required under subsection (a) if
any shortcomings are identified in such re-
port.

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of

the vote on passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks on this
legislation and to insert extraneous
material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 2290, Shutdown Guidance
for Financial Institutions Act, a bill
introduced by one of our colleagues and
a new member of the Financial Serv-
ices Committee, Representative JEN-
NIFER WEXTON of Virginia.
Last December, President Trump
shut the government down for an un-
precedented 35 days, resulting in
missed paychecks for countless govern-
ment employees and contractors.
About 800,000 Federal employees were
furloughed and another 4 million or so
Federal contractors were negatively af-
fected.
The resulting damage was signifi-
cant. Many of our constituents, who
did nothing wrong at all, found it hard
to make essential payments—such as
payments on mortgages, rent, student
loans, car loans, business loans, or
credit cards—when their income was
temporarily limited.
Furthermore, the Congressional
Budget Office estimated the shutdown
cost the American economy $11 billion
and it delayed approximately $18 bil-
lion in Federal discretionary spending
for compensation and purchases of
goods and services.
Should there be another government
shutdown in the future, this bill will
help ensure that, at a minimum, there
is timely guidance provided by finan-
cial regulators to encourage financial
firms to work with and help affected
consumers. Consistent with prudent
lending practices, firms would be en-
couraged to modify payment terms or
extend credit, when appropriate, and
prevent adverse information from
being reported that might hurt a con-
sumer’s credit score.
During the October 2013 shutdown,
regulators issued guidance to financial
institutions on day nine of the shut-
down, urging financial firms to do what
they could to help affected consumers.
On January 11, 2019, financial regu-
lators issued a joint statement to pro-
vide guidance to financial institutions,
again encouraging them to help con-
sumers affected by the shutdown. How-
ever, the guidance did not come until
the 20th day of the shutdown and only
came after I wrote regulators the day
before prodding them to issue such
critical guidance.
This delay is unacceptable, whether
it is 9 days or 20 days, and there is no
reason why regulators should not pre-
pare the appropriate guidance now and
issue a press release within the first 24
hours of any future shutdown to re-
mind financial institutions to help af-
fected consumers, as H.R. 2290 would
require.
Furthermore, H.R. 2290 builds on H.
Res. 77 that I sponsored and was passed
by the House on a voice vote in Janu-
ary 2019, expressing the sense of Con-
gress that financial institutions and
other entities should proactively work
to help consumers affected by any fu-
ture government shutdown.
Passing the Shutdown Guidance for
Financial Institutions Act will help en-
sure guidance is provided to financial
firms in a timely manner and that
there is no ambiguity that struggling
consumers affected by a shutdown,
through no fault of their own, get the
assistance that they need.
I commend the work of Representa-
tive WEXTON on this very important
legislation. I support the bill, and I
urge my colleagues to do the same.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in rec-
ognition of Federal employees im-
pacted by the government shutdown
and express my support for Federal
regulators and financial institutions
supporting consumers in need of assist-
ance in the event there is a lapse in
Federal funding.
b 1645
We just passed a continuing resolu-
tion to keep the government open ear-
lier today. So the good news is, this
fall does not look like storm season for
Federal employees, and, hopefully, the
contents of this act won’t have to be
used. I think that is a good thing. I
think we can all agree that is a good
thing. On a bipartisan basis, we should
agree that it is a good thing.
Whether it is a missed credit card
payment or an unexpected medical ex-
pense, government shutdowns can
leave Federal employees, contractors,
and other individuals facing economic
hardship through no fault of their own.
Madam Speaker, if you look at the
government shutdowns under the Car-
ter administration, the Reagan admin-
istration, and the Clinton administra-
tion, the lapse in funding impacted
people’s lives, and we don’t want Fed-
eral employees to be held hostage due
to the inability of Congress and the ex-
ecutive branch to come to terms on
Federal funding.
H.R. 2290 requires Federal financial
regulators to issue guidance encour-
aging institutions to work with indi-
viduals impacted by a government
shutdown. It also requires the regu-
lators to provide Congress with a re-
port analyzing the effectiveness of that
guidance. It is proper.
I remind my colleagues that guidance
does not constitute a formal rule-
making. Unlike a rule, guidance is non-
binding. This bill sets out best prac-
tices for both regulators and financial
institutions, and they should take that
guidance seriously.
I also want to reiterate that this leg-
islation conveys no new authority on
Federal financial regulators. Let’s
make that clear. I know that many fi-
nancial institutions and financial regu-
lators are already implementing the
best practices contemplated by this
legislation.
Six months or 7 months after the
Federal Government shutdown, I think
we have already seen that the regu-
lators have taken action. Institutions
have historically been cognizant of the
needs of consumers who find them-
selves in these types of unforeseen situ-
ations. In fact, last fall, more than 100
banks took it upon themselves to offer
loan modifications, payment deadline
extensions, payroll advances, or low- or
zero-interest rate loans, among other
accommodations, to those impacted by

the shutdown. Those are positive ac-
tions. We know that those positive ac-
tions made a difference during that pe-
riod of uncertainty.
Federal financial regulators have
also played an important role in ensur-
ing fair treatment for consumers af-
fected by a shutdown. In January of
this year, the FDIC, the OCC, the Na-
tional Credit Union Administration,
the Federal Reserve, the CFPB, and the
Conference of State Bank Supervisors
partnered to encourage institutions to
work with consumers who were nega-
tively impacted. They took it upon
themselves to do that, and they had
the authority to do so.
In a related financial institution let-
ter, the FDIC encouraged all supervised
institutions to consider prudent ar-
rangements that would increase the po-
tential for creditworthy borrowers to
meet their obligations.
While I agree with my colleagues
across the aisle that we should encour-
age banks to work proactively with
consumers affected by a shutdown, we
must also encourage financial regu-
lators to provide some type of clarity
as well. This bill ensures exactly that.
I think this bill is sufficient. It deals
with the four walls of governance and
the data held within government, and I
think it is a good piece of legislation
that codifies existing practices.
I encourage my colleagues to support
this bill, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON), a new
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee.
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 2290, the Shut-
down Guidance for Financial Institu-
tions Act.
This legislation would help protect
Federal employees, government con-
tractors, and small business owners
from some of the financial hardships
that arise from a government shut-
down.
The shutdown that lasted from late
December 2018 through January of this
year, the longest in our Nation’s his-
tory, stretched 35 days and cost the
economy billions of dollars.
For more than a month, paychecks
were put on hold for 800,000 Federal em-
ployees and work-stop orders went on
to Federal contractors, resulting in
tens of thousands of layoffs. Unlike
Federal workers, contractors did not
receive backpay.
Thousands of families saw their lives
upended. Missing one paycheck is a
hardship for many, but missing two
can be devastating. Not only were peo-
ple struggling to make their rent or
mortgage payments, some had to rely
on food pantries to feed their families
or ration their insulin because they
could not afford the copay. This was
through no fault of their own.
During this time, a lot of companies
stepped up with offers of assistance for
people impacted by the shutdowns, in-
cluding banks and credit unions that
offered flexible payment options and
no-interest loans.
This was especially important for
employees in the national security
community because financial difficul-
ties can damage their credit scores and
put their security clearances and,
therefore, their livelihoods at risk.
While it is positive to see so many
lenders taking proactive steps to miti-
gate harm, there were still issues and
confusion at some financial institu-
tions, and regulator guidance from the
Federal Government was slow to come.
It was not until the 20th day of the
shutdown that financial regulators pro-
vided guidance, encouraging banks to
work with borrowers and account hold-
ers affected by the shutdown, and let-
ting banks know that such efforts
would not be subject to examiner criti-
cism.
During the shutdown in 2013, it
wasn’t until the ninth day that similar
guidance was released. Let me give you
an example of why this matters. I want
to read part of a letter that I received
from a desperate constituent in the
middle of the last shutdown.
She wrote: ‘‘My husband and I re-
cently sold our home and put an offer
on another home in the area. . . . The
mortgage financing for our new home
was all set before the government shut-
down. Our closing date is set for Janu-
ary 28, 2019, on the new house. Today,
we learned that the mortgage company
is denying our mortgage application
because I am furloughed. They consider
me unemployed and too much of a risk
to finance.’’
Thankfully, my constituent and her
lender were able to work through this
problem. The mortgage was eventually
approved, but this never should have
happened in the first place.
My legislation would essentially
automate the process of issuing guid-
ance by requiring Federal financial
regulators to release guidance within
24 hours of the start of a shutdown. It
also includes reporting requirements
on the effectiveness of the guidance
and requires regulators to fix any
shortcomings that are identified.
Madam Speaker, despite the uncer-
tainty and the hardship of the last few
years, Federal workers have shown a
steadfast commitment to service. They
serve in every congressional district in
every State, carrying out countless
vital responsibilities on behalf of the
American people. They deserve way
better than the way they have been
treated.
I thank Chairwoman WATERS and
Ranking Member MCHENRY for ush-
ering this bill to the floor, and I urge
my colleagues to support it.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
We should all work to make sure that
there is never again a government
shutdown. However, if one occurs, this
bill will ease the burden on many vul-
nerable workers and families.
Once again, I commend the gentle-
woman from Virginia for bringing this
legislation to the House, and I urge my
colleagues to join me in supporting
this important piece of legislation.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
think this legislation puts to rest the
need for the Financial Services Com-
mittee to legislate around the govern-
ment shutdown. I am glad we were able
to put that to rest, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
WATERS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2290, as

The question was taken; and (two-

Marine’’) was integral in providing the link
between domestic production and the fight-
ing forces overseas, providing combat equip-
ment, fuel, food, commodities, and raw ma-
terials to troops stationed abroad.
(3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowl-
edged the indispensability of the Merchant
Marine to the victory in a 1945 letter stating
that, without the support of the Merchant
Marine, ‘‘the Navy could not have accom-
plished its mission’’.
(4) President, and former Supreme Com-
mander of the Allied Forces, Dwight D. Ei-
senhower acknowledged that ‘‘through the
prompt delivery of supplies and equipment
to our armed forces overseas, and of cargoes
representing economic and military aid to
friendly nations, the American Merchant
Marine has effectively helped to strengthen
the forces of freedom throughout the world’’.

vital role in this regard, ensuring the effi-
cient and reliable transoceanic transport of
military equipment and both military and
civilian personnel.
(6) The Merchant Marine provided for the
successful transport of resources and per-
sonnel despite consistent and ongoing expo-
sure to enemy combatants from both the air
and the sea, including from enemy bomber
squadrons, submarines, and mines.
(7) The efforts of the Merchant Marine
were not without sacrifices as the Merchant
Marine bore a higher per-capita casualty
rate than any other branch of the military
during the war.
(8) The Merchant Marine proved to be an
instrumental asset on an untold number of
occasions, participating in every landing op-
eration by the United States Marine Corps,
from Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima.
(9) The Merchant Marine provided the bulk
tonnage of material necessary for the inva-
sion of Normandy, an invasion which, ac-
cording to a 1944 New York Times article,
‘‘would not have been possible without the
Merchant Marine’’.
(10) In assessing the performance of the
Merchant Marine, General Eisenhower stat-
ed, ‘‘every man in this Allied command is
quick to express his admiration for the loy-
alty, courage, and fortitude of the officers
and men of the Merchant Marine. We count
upon their efficiency and their utter devo-
tion to duty as we do our own; they have
never failed us’’.
(11) During a September 1944 speech, Presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt stated that the
Merchant Marine had ‘‘delivered the goods
when and where needed in every theater of
operations and across every ocean in the big-
gest, the most difficult, and dangerous trans-
portation job ever undertaken. As time goes
on, there will be greater public under-
standing of our merchant fleet’s record dur-
ing this war.’’.
(12) The feats and accomplishments of the
Merchant Marine are deserving of broader
public recognition.
(13) The United States will be forever
grateful and indebted to these merchant
mariners for their effective, reliable, and
courageous transport of goods and resources
in enemy territory throughout theaters of
every variety in World War II.
(14) The goods and resources transported
by the Merchant Marine saved thousands of
lives and enabled the Allied Powers to claim
victory in World War II.
(15) The Congressional Gold Medal would
be an appropriate way to shed further light
on the service of the merchant mariners in
World War II and the instrumental role they
played in winning that war.
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks on this
legislation and to insert extraneous
material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 550, the Merchant Mariners
of World War II Congressional Gold
Medal Act of 2019.
I thank the gentleman from Cali-
fornia, Representative GARAMENDI, for
his work on this bill, which honors the
courage and sacrifice of the civilian
mariners of the Merchant Marine.
In the early days of America’s in-
volvement in World War II, German U-
boats sank numerous vessels during
the Battle of the Atlantic. While many
think of convoys being attacked as
close to Europe, the German Navy also
took the war to the U.S. eastern sea-
board.
In March 1942 alone, 27 ships from six
Allied Nations were sunk off U.S.
shores. All told, 733 American cargo
ships were lost during World War II.
Despite this danger, some 215,000 ci-
vilian merchant marines served with
courage to establish and maintain crit-
ical supply lines, ensuring that vital
supplies, cargo, and personnel reached
Allied Forces in both Europe and Asia.
Though they had no military stand-
ing or government benefits, these civil-
ian mariners often faced death from
German U-boat assaults. These brave
mariners paid a heavy price in service
to their country, suffering the highest
casualty rate of any branch of the U.S.
Armed Forces during World War II.
An estimated 9,300 mariners lost
their lives and another 12,000 were
wounded to make sure our uniformed
servicemembers could keep fighting.
Unfortunately, their sacrifices are
commonly underappreciated and often
overlooked.
They were not even considered vet-
erans until Congress remedied that dis-
service in 1988. Many of our histories of
World War II gave them a passing men-
tion or do not recognize their vital role
in ensuring the success of the Allied
forces. It is time that we give these
brave mariners the recognition they so
richly deserve.
I thank Mr. GARAMENDI for intro-
ducing this bill to Congress, and I urge
Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
the bill, H.R. 550, the Merchant Mari-
ners of World War II Congressional
Gold Medal Act of 2019.
For the last two Congresses, Con-
gresswoman SUSAN BROOKS from Indi-
ana has taken this measure on. We
passed it out of the House last Con-
gress. It didn’t make its way through
the Senate.
Madam Speaker, I commend the hard
work that my colleague Mrs. BROOKS
put into legislating around this really
important recognition of those who
served and fought valiantly in their
own way during World War II. So many
lives were sacrificed by merchant mari-
ners during World War II.
I thank my colleague Mrs. BROOKS
for her work to make this day possible,
and I thank my colleague Mr.
GARAMENDI for his work this Congress
to take this across the line for a really
nice, bipartisan piece of legislation rec-
ognizing the unsung heroes of World
War II.
In World War II, merchant mariners
sailed across the Atlantic. They trav-
eled abroad, delivering precious cargo
to support the war. In the moment of
most severe crisis for the United King-
dom, it was our merchant mariners
who fed the island nation of Great Brit-
ain. It was our merchant mariners and
our foodstuffs that fed Europe post-
World War II, as well.
It was our merchant mariners who
risked their lives in treacherous seas,
before the concept of a convoy was in-
vented in World War II, to protect the
lives at stake, cargo at stake, the ships

at stake, and to ensure a better oppor-
tunity to make it across from the
United States and Canada to Great
Britain to save that island nation.

They were treacherous times, and the
stakes of our actually providing sup-
port for the Soviet Union in the worst
point of the ravages that they were suf-
fering under Germany in their fight
with Germany were substantial as well.
The icy seas of the north to bring cargo
in to save lives for our Soviet Allies
during World War II were substantial,
and there are massive numbers of sto-
ries of the lives put at risk in order to
bring important food to save lives.
It is merchant mariners who were—
we use the word ‘‘bravery,’’ but when
we think about somebody doing their
job of hard labor to make a ship go
that is carrying cargo, we don’t think
of that as bravery. It is fortitude, the
will to keep doing something that is
really important, even against tough
odds. It shows who merchant mariners
are. At sea today, the risks that they
take in order to make our global econ-
omy work is real. But during World
War II, it was on a knife’s edge, and the
number of lives that were lost was ex-
traordinary.
By one statistic, 1 out of every 26
merchant mariners was killed during
that time period of World War II. Their
ships sailed from port to port, and
many never reached their final destina-
tion. Especially the German Operation
Drumbeat targeted these ships in
transport in a massive way, knowing
that they were traveling mostly un-
armed and unescorted.
Just off the North Carolina coast,
there are 80 cargo ships that were tar-
geted and 1,600 lives that were lost.
That is just off one portion of our East
Coast.
There are stories of heroic acts by
these folks who were just, in peaceful
times, doing a normal trade—an ex-
traordinary trade, but a normal trade—
but at war were the number one target
in that early stage to break the will of
the British and our support of them
and then again trying to snuff off the
Soviet Union from supplies, food, and
weaponry.
So this is a fantastic recognition of
the important work that merchant
mariners provided, the vital work that
they provided during World War II, and
a recognition of a trade, a craft, a skill,
and the hard work of those folks who
did make the cargo go.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
California (Mr. GARAMENDI), who is
chair of the Subcommittee on Readi-
ness on the Armed Services Committee
and a highly valued Member of this
House.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I
thank Chairwoman WATERS so very
much for the opportunity to speak on
this bill.
I am very pleased that the House is
taking up the Merchant Mariners of
World War II Congressional Gold Medal
Act, H.R. 550.
I am proud to have worked on this bi-
partisan legislation with my original
cosponsors, Representative DON YOUNG
of Alaska and Representative SUSAN
BROOKS, who I see is joining us here on
the floor, finally getting this bill to the
floor this session.
This is not the first session. Five
years of work have brought us to this
point, three Congresses. Mrs. BROOKS,
last year, carried this, and we got it
out of this House and then to the Sen-
ate. My hope is that the Senate will fi-
nally send this bill to the President’s
desk so it can be signed into law.
Our bill would award the Congres-
sional Gold Medal to our American
merchant mariners who served during
World War II, including those who
made the ultimate sacrifice.
Following the award of this medal,
given to the American merchant mari-
ners who served during World War II, it
will be on display at the American
Merchant Marine Museum at the U.S.
Merchant Marine Academy in Long Is-
land, New York. It will be there dis-
played in honor of our Nation’s mer-
chant mariners.
In 1944, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
said that the Merchant Marines had
‘‘delivered the goods when and where
needed in every theater of operations
and across every ocean in the biggest,
the most difficult and dangerous trans-
portation job ever undertaken.’’
Indeed, the Merchant Marines suf-
fered the highest per capita casualty
rate of any other branch of the U.S.
Armed Forces during World War II. As
said earlier, 1 out of every 26 American
casualties in World War II was a mer-
chant mariner. An estimated 8,300
American mariners lost their lives. An-
other 12,000 American mariners were
wounded during their wartime service.
Regrettably, the merchant mariners
were not granted veteran’s status until
1988, when Congress finally came
around to recognizing the need for this.
Awarding the Congressional Gold
Medal, as our bill does, would finally
give merchant mariners from our Na-
tion’s Greatest Generation the honor
and respect that they are owed.
Lastly, I want to thank the more
than 300 Members of this House who co-
sponsored the bill, allowing it to come
to the floor for passage, and I also want
to thank Mrs. BROOKS and Mr. YOUNG,
who carried on in the previous Con-
gresses.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield such time as she may consume to
the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.
BROOKS).
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in strong support
of H.R. 550, the Merchant Mariners of
World War II Congressional Gold Medal
Act of 2019.
I want to thank the chairwoman and
the ranking member for bringing this
bill to the floor, but I very much want
to thank the fine gentleman from Cali-
fornia, Representative GARAMENDI, for
leading the effort this Congress.
Many Members of Congress have been
involved in this, including one of our
former colleagues, Representative Jan-
ice Hahn, whom I worked with closely
several Congresses ago, and we have
continued to try to bring this effort be-
fore the American people and before
this House.
Merchant mariners, today, are Fed-
eral Government employees who pur-
sue a civil service career in the Navy
while assigned aboard U.S. Govern-
ment-owned ships that support the
Navy’s warfighters and warfighting
platforms around the world. But,
Madam Speaker, as you have already
heard, often forgotten, merchant mari-
ners are an integral part of our armed
services today and in our Nation’s his-
tory, especially during World War II.
They took part in every invasion dur-
ing World War II, from Normandy to
Okinawa. They provided the greatest
sealift in history, and they became the
difference between victory and defeat.
With an estimated 9,300 casualties,
they bore a higher per capita casualty
rate than any other branch of the mili-
tary during World War II. Even so,
they were not recognized as veterans
until 1988, and they never received the
benefits that other World War II vet-
erans received under the GI Bill.
While I was at home many years ago
in Indianapolis, I met with a group of
family members of merchant mariners
and some who served actually during
World War II. So it was because of that
meeting that I learned so much about
their service and decided to take up the
mantle in trying to work with Rep-
resentative Hahn at that time to get
the recognition that they deserved.
These loyal, brave men put their
lives on the line for the cause of free-
dom and selflessly answered their Na-
tion’s call to duty. So now is the time,
working in a bipartisan way, to get it
across the finish line, to formally pay
our respect to all of these deserving
men and recognize the countless sac-
rifices and contributions of merchant
mariners in our history.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
New York (Mr. SUOZZI), who is a mem-
ber of the Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I
thank Chairwoman WATERS for yield-
ing to me today.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in
strong support of H.R. 550, the bipar-
tisan Merchant Mariners of World War
II Congressional Gold Medal Act.
I want to express my deep gratitude
to Representative JOHN GARAMENDI,
Representative DON YOUNG, and Rep-
resentative SUSAN BROOKS for carrying
this message forward.
This act will award this body’s high-
est honor, the Congressional Gold
Medal, to midshipmen who fought on
behalf of our country during World War
II. This is particularly important to me
because I represent the district that is

home to the Kings Point Merchant Ma-
rine Academy, and the Congressional
Gold Medal will be housed there at that
location.
This is so wonderful that this is fi-
nally being done. I am a proud member
of the Board of Visitors at the United
States Merchant Marine Academy in
Kings Point.
Kings Point, I want everyone to
know, is the only service academy
whose students engage in combat dur-
ing times of war. In fact, during World
War II, over 7,000 of these students an-
swered our Nation’s call to duty, and
142 students gave the supreme sac-
rifice.
Today, only 600 of these veterans are
still alive. Ralph Crump is one of those
veterans.
In 1941, Mr. Crump went on his first
cruise as a freshman cadet at the
United States Merchant Marine Acad-
emy. He was quickly promoted to third
assistant engineer.
After his first cruise, Ralph was pre-
pared to return to Kings Point to finish
his schooling when his captain told
him there was no replacement engineer
and he needed to sail cargo for Russia.
Over the next 8 months, Ralph and his
convoy suffered heavy casualties in the
Mediterranean, China, Burma, and
India.
Crump later sailed ships taking ex-
iled U.S. diplomats back to Asia, re-
turning with prisoners of war liberated
from a Japanese camp near Shanghai.
Ralph finally graduated from the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy a year
later, in 1946. Today, there is a Ralph
Crump wing in the National World War
II Museum in New Orleans named in
his honor.
This is just one example of so many
merchant mariners who did so much
during this time, but I especially want
to point out the students who served
during wartime from the Merchant Ma-
rine Academy.
Brave men and women like Ralph at
the Merchant Marine Academy in
Kings Point, as well as the mariners
who served across the country, deserve
this highest recognition. It is not too
late. It is time we recognize their sac-
rifice and award them the much-de-
served Congressional Gold Medal.
Madam Speaker, I applaud my col-
leagues again for their leadership, and
I ask the whole House to support our
brave merchant mariners.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN), who chairs the Fi-
nancial Services Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the chairwoman, and I
thank the ranking member as well.
Madam Speaker, we are truly the
land of the free because we are the
home of the brave. Unfortunately, not
all of the brave have been treated the
same when they have returned home
from war. Such is the case with the
Merchant Marines. These merchant
mariners came home, but they didn’t
come home to the parades that others
came home to. Many of them didn’t re-
turn the same way they left, and many
didn’t return at all.
I stand here today because I am so
proud of the work that these Members
of Congress have done to celebrate and
appreciate the lives of the merchant
mariners. Yes, it is true that they did
not become actual veterans until 1988.
Yes, it is true that they didn’t receive
all of the GI Bill benefits that some
others received. But it is also true
that, though it may be late, they will
be properly recognized.
I am so honored to announce that
Congressman GARAMENDI, Congress-
woman BROOKS, and Congressman
YOUNG have done a good thing, a just
thing, and a righteous thing.
I would add one additional thing.
There is a bill that is currently pend-
ing, H.R. 154. This bill would accord
$25,000 to each of these mariners who
are alive. It is the right thing and the
just thing, and we ought to do it as
well.
But today, let’s celebrate what has
been accomplished. Let’s have this
Congressional Gold Medal presented,
and let’s make sure that if we see a
merchant mariner, we give them the
love that they richly deserve as well.
They are truly persons who have made
us the land of the free because they are
members of the home of the brave.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to close.
Madam Speaker, on a personal note,
on my team on the House Financial
Services Committee and when I was
chief deputy whip of the House, I had
somebody work with me on my team
named Phil Poe of Maryland.
Phil, out of college, was inspired by
the stories of World War II merchant
mariners and inspired by a family
member, as well, to get licensed as a
merchant mariner. He spent a little
time as a merchant mariner and then
paid his way through graduate school
as a merchant mariner.
So I want to commend his willing-
ness to serve, but I also want to note
that, for the RECORD, these stories of
World War II merchant mariners are
having an impact generations later.
That inspirational story of the risks
that they were willing to take, plus the
family connection and inspiration he
heard from those stories, have made a
major difference for him. That work
ethic that he developed and learned on
that ship really steeled him to do bet-
ter in graduate school, and by the time
he came to the Hill, it was all easy
compared to what he had been through.
b 1715
So these stories we hear from long
ago of merchant mariners and their
sacrifice still have an impact today,
and I am glad we have a Congressional
Gold Medal and legislative recognition
around the sacrifices that merchant
mariners made during World War II.
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption, and
yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
I, too, join in thanking Representa-
tives GARAMENDI, BROOKS, and YOUNG
in bringing this bill to the floor of the
House of Representatives and working
for its passage.
I would just say a word about the
gentleman from California (Mr.
GARAMENDI), whom I have known for
many, many years. We served in the
California legislature together, and, of
course, I am not surprised that he took
time out to recognize those who have
not been given credit for their work
and what they have done in support of
our country. This is typical of Mr.
GARAMENDI and the way that he has
conducted himself throughout his en-
tire career.
I also thank those Members who have
come to the floor today to join in this
very special recognition. This is a bi-
partisan bill that honors those who an-
swered our Nation’s call to duty, re-
gardless of the danger and without ex-
pectation of accolades. Now it is time
that we give these courageous mariners
the recognition they have more than
earned.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this
important piece of legislation, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
WATERS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 550, as

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert
extraneous material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam?
There was no objection.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2613, the Advancing Inno-
vation to Assist Law Enforcement Act,
and I urge all Members to support it.
The financial services industry
spends quite a bit of time considering
how it can use new technologies to im-
prove its data collection and analysis
to detect and report suspected finan-
cial crime.
This bill turns the lens onto the Fi-
nancial Crime Enforcement Network,
FinCen, to look at its use of artificial
intelligence, digital identity tech-
nologies, blockchain, and other innova-
tive technologies.
The study required by H.R. 2613 will
examine how this essential regulatory
and data-driven agency could itself
better utilize these technologies to
more actively analyze and disseminate
the information FinCen collects and
stores to provide investigative leads to
its law enforcement partners.
The result of this study will help the
agency and us in Congress to identify
gaps that need to be filled with the
same advanced tools that are being
adapted by the industry.
I applaud the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. GONZALEZ) for his work on this
bill and recommend its passage.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H.R. 2613, the Advancing Innovation to
Assist Law Enforcement Act. I com-
mend the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.
GONZALEZ), my colleague, for his work
on this important bipartisan legisla-
tion.
This—if I am not mistaken—is the
gentleman’s first piece of legislation
coming out of the Committee on Fi-
nancial Services here on the House
floor, and it is quite a good thing. His
constituents should know, Madam
Speaker, about the type of legislating
that he is trying to achieve.
The Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network, what we commonly call
FinCen, is tasked with receiving and
maintaining financial transaction
data. This includes analyzing and dis-
seminating data for law enforcement
purposes to safeguard the financial sys-
tem from illicit use, to combat money
laundering, and promote national secu-
rity. If you think terrorism financing,
if you think about laundering drug
money, this is the agency that does it.
In short, FinCen is in the data busi-
ness.
This bill directs FinCen to carry out
a study on the implementation of arti-
ficial intelligence and digital identity
technology to ensure that FinCen is
equipped with all the tools it needs to
thwart bad actors and protect the fi-
nancial system.
And so this takes, in many respects,
Congressman GONZALEZ’ broad back-
ground and brings that experience here
to the legislative body and to this im-
portant law enforcement agency. This
legislation takes the first step to revo-
lutionize the way law enforcement
works to locate and stop criminal ac-
tivity in the financial services indus-
try, including potential terrorist
threats using artificial intelligence,
blockchain, and other emerging tech-
nologies.
This a FinTech bill. This is a tech-
nology bill. I urge my colleagues to
support this measure. This bill ensures
that FinCen is innovating alongside in-
dustry and alongside other Federal
agencies and law enforcement agencies.
And it drives them to utilize the most
advanced computing and advanced
technology available anywhere in the
world in the best practices when it
comes to data analysis and use.
The use of new technologies will al-
ways help streamline government oper-
ations, allowing FinCen to move
quicker in the face of emerging
threats.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. I want to
commend the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. GONZALEZ), my colleague, for his
hard work on this bipartisan bill, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
we have no additional speakers on this
legislation. I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield the balance of my time to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ),
my colleague and author of the bill.
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam
Speaker, I rise in support of my bill,
and I thank the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. WATERS), chairwoman
of the Committee on Financial Serv-
ices, and the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY), my friend and
ranking member, for his kind words
and all his work to bring this legisla-
tion to the floor today.
The Advancing Innovation to Assist
Law Enforcement Act is a bipartisan
bill that I introduced along with the
gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.
EMMER), my friend, and it is supported
by the gentleman from Utah (Mr.
MCADAMS), my friend from across the
aisle.
This bill takes a stand to block a
major tool used by cartels, terrorist or-
ganizations, traffickers and the like, to
finance their illegal activities and put
our Nation and the people living in it
at risk.
Money laundering enables the ship-
ment of deadly drugs like opioids and
fentanyl into communities like mine in
Ohio that has been disseminated by the
opioid crisis. Money laundering fi-
nances cartels who wreak havoc on our
southern border and the communities
that surround it, as I saw on my recent
bipartisan trip to the border. And
money laundering proliferates the hor-
rors of human trafficking, which con-
tinues to exist across our country, de-
spite government and private industry
attempts to better identify victims and
cut off trafficking routes.
My bill makes sure that we are using
the best technology we have available
to find and stop the money laundering
that makes all these crimes not only
possible, but financially profitable for
cartels, traffickers, and terrorists.
My bill requires the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network, or FinCen, to

study the implementation and internal
use of emerging technologies, including
artificial intelligence, digital identity
technologies, blockchain, and other
new and innovative technologies to
better identify and prevent money
laundering in our financial services in-
dustry.
Additionally, this bill would require
the study of how FinCen could better
utilize these technologies to more
quickly disseminate the information it
collects to Federal, State, Tribal, and
local law enforcement.
It is my firm belief that we must le-
verage the use of emerging tech-
nologies in order to make our govern-
ment operations more efficient and up-
grade the toolkit that enables our law
enforcement to effectively go after bad
actors.
Finally, H.R. 2613 would require that
the Director of the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Service Network report
to the House Committee on Financial
Services and the Senate Banking Com-
mittee on policy recommendations.
The recommendations would allow the
private sector, FinCen, and other Fed-
eral agencies to improve coordination
and communication through advance
technologies. This will help Congress
ensure that we are providing the nec-
essary support for our law enforcement
community to effectively fight illicit
activity based on these recommenda-
tions.
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I thank those who have helped push it
forward.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
am prepared to close if the majority
has no more speakers, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
we are prepared to close. I yield myself
the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I once again thank
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GON-
ZALEZ) for bringing this bill before the
House.
Improving the use of technologies
can only improve our response to the
wide range of crimes that FinCen com-
bats. I urge my colleagues to join me in
supporting this important piece of leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Guam (Mr. SAN
NICOLAS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2613.
The question was taken; and (two-

HIDDEN FIGURES CONGRESSIONAL
GOLD MEDAL ACT
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I move to suspend the rules and pass
the bill (H.R. 1396) to award Congres-
sional Gold Medals to Katherine John-
son and Dr. Christine Darden, to post-
humously award Congressional Gold
Medals to Dorothy Vaughan and Mary
Jackson, and to award a Congressional
Gold Medal to honor all of the women
who contributed to the success of the
National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration during the Space Race, as
amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1396
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hidden Fig-
ures Congressional Gold Medal Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) In 1935, the National Advisory Com-
mittee for Aeronautics (referred to in this
section as ‘‘NACA’’) hired 5 women to serve
as the first ‘‘computer pool’’ at the Langley
Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory where
those women took on work making calcula-
tions that male engineers had made pre-
viously.
(2) During the 1940s, NACA began recruit-
ing African-American women to work as
computers and initially separated those
women from their White counterparts in a
group known as the ‘‘West Area Computers’’
where the women were restricted to seg-
regated dining and bathroom facilities.
(3) Katherine Johnson was born on August
26, 1918, in White Sulphur Springs, West Vir-
ginia.
(4) In 1953, Katherine Johnson began her
career in aeronautics as a computer in the
segregated West Area Computing unit de-
scribed in paragraph (2).
(5) As a member of the Flight Research Di-
vision, Katherine Johnson analyzed data
from flight tests. After NACA was reformu-
lated into the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (referred to in this
section as ‘‘NASA’’), Katherine Johnson—
(A) calculated the trajectory for Alan
Shepard’s Freedom 7 mission in 1961, which
was the first human spaceflight by an indi-
vidual from the United States;
(B) coauthored a report that provided the
equations for describing orbital spaceflight
with a specified landing point, which made
her the first woman to be recognized as an
author of a report from the Flight Research
Division;
(C) was asked to verify the calculations
when electronic computers at NASA were
used to calculate the orbit for John Glenn’s
Friendship 7 mission; and
(D) provided calculations for NASA
throughout her career, including for the
Apollo missions.
(6) Katherine Johnson retired from NASA
in 1986.
(7) Dr. Christine Darden was born on Sep-
tember 10, 1942, in Monroe, North Carolina.
(8) In 1962, Dr. Christine Darden graduated
from Hampton Institute with a B.S. in Math-
ematics and a teaching credential.
(9) Dr. Christine Darden attended Virginia
State University where she studied aerosol
physics and earned an M.S. in Applied Math-
ematics.
(10) Dr. Christine Darden began her career
in aeronautics in 1967 as a data analyst at
NASA’s Langley Research Center (referred
to in this section as ‘‘Langley’’) before being
promoted to aerospace engineer in 1973. Her
work in this position resulted in the produc-
tion of low-boom sonic effects, which revolu-
tionized aerodynamics design.
(11) Dr. Christine Darden completed her
education by earning a Ph.D. in Mechanical
Engineering from George Washington Uni-
versity in 1983.
(12) While working at NASA, Dr. Christine
Darden—
(A) was appointed to be the leader of the
Sonic Boom Team, which worked on designs
to minimize the effects of sonic booms by
testing wing and nose designs for supersonic
aircraft;
(B) wrote more than 50 articles on aero-
nautics design; and
(C) became the first African American to
be promoted to a position in the Senior Ex-
ecutive Service at Langley.
(13) Dorothy Vaughan was born on Sep-
tember 20, 1910, in Kansas City, Missouri.
(14) Dorothy Vaughan began working for
NACA in 1943. Dorothy Vaughan—
(A) started at NACA as a member of the
West Area Computing unit;
(B) was promoted to be the head of the
West Area Computing unit, becoming
NACA’s first African-American supervisor, a
position that she held for 9 years; and
(C) became an expert programmer in
FORTRAN as a member of NASA’s Analysis
and Computation Division.
(15) Dorothy Vaughan retired from NASA
in 1971 and died on November 10, 2008.
(16) Mary Jackson was born on April 9,
1921, in Hampton, Virginia.
(17) Mary Jackson started her career at
NACA in 1951, working as a computer as a
member of the West Area Computing unit.
(18) After petitioning the City of Hampton
to allow her to take graduate-level courses
in math and physics at night at the all-
White Hampton High School, Mary Jackson
was able to complete the required training to
become an engineer, making her NASA’s
first female African-American engineer.
(19) Mary Jackson—
(A) while at NACA and NASA—
(i) worked in the Theoretical Aero-
dynamics Branch of the Subsonic-Transonic
Aerodynamics Division at Langley where she
analyzed wind tunnel and aircraft flight
data; and
(ii) published a dozen technical papers that
focused on the boundary layer of air around
airplanes; and
(B) after 21 years working as an engineer
at NASA, transitioned to a new job as
Langley’s Federal Women’s Program Man-
ager where she worked to improve the pros-
pects of NASA’s female mathematicians, en-
gineers, and scientists.
(20) Mary Jackson retired from NASA in
1985 and died in 2005.
(21) These 4 women, along with the other
African-American women in NASA’s West
Area Computing unit, were integral to the
success of the early space program. The sto-
ries of these 4 women exemplify the experi-
ences of hundreds of women who worked as
computers, mathematicians, and engineers
at NACA beginning in the 1930s and their
handmade calculations played an integral
role in—
(A) aircraft testing during World War II;
(B) supersonic flight research;
(C) sending the Voyager probes to explore
the solar system; and
(D) the United States landing the first man
on the lunar surface.
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Guam (Mr. SAN NICOLAS) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Guam.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert
extraneous material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam?
There was no objection.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1396, the Hidden Figures
Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019.
I thank the gentlewoman from Texas
(Ms. JOHNSON) for her work on this bill,
which honors the women mathemati-
cians and engineers who helped win the
Space Race. This year marks the 50th
anniversary of the Apollo Moon space
landing, a shining beacon of bold Amer-
ican innovation and ingenuity, made
possible by tireless and often
unacknowledged and under-appreciated
contributions of the women working as
computers, mathematicians, and engi-
neers at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
These women faced challenges that
exemplified the period of segregation
in which they lived and the male-domi-
nated culture at NASA and its precur-
sors, despite the contributions they
made to space exploration. They faced
lower pay, were not allowed to submit
their work under their own names and
did not receive the promotions that
their male colleagues did. They also
faced segregated dining facilities,
water fountains, and bathrooms.
It was only right that the experi-
ences of these women were brought to
light by a popular book by Dr. Chris-
tine Darden published in 2016, which
also became a successful movie. This
book described her and the struggles of
Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and
Dorothy Vaughan in this difficult envi-
ronment.
The women computers, mathemati-
cians, and engineers of NACA and
NASA overcame these challenges. They
made critical contributions not only to
the Space Race, as depicted in the film
based on Dr. Darden’s book, but also to
World War II aircraft development and
research into faster-than-sound flight.
The Congressional Gold Medal is the
highest civilian award bestowed by the
Congress. It is awarded to persons who
have performed an achievement that
has an impact on American history and
culture that is likely to be recognized
as a major achievement in the recipi-
ent’s field long after the achievement.
The Hidden Figures Congressional
Gold Medal Act awards five Congres-
sional Gold Medals; one each to Kath-
erine Johnson, Dr. Christine Darden,
Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson,
and one medal to honor the contribu-
tions of the hundreds of women com-
puters, mathematicians, and engineers
whose names have largely been lost to
history.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JOHNSON) for
introducing this bill this Congress, and
I urge members to vote ‘‘yes’’.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H.R. 1396, the Hidden Figures Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act. I thank the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JOHNSON)
for her work on this important bipar-
tisan legislation.
This bill awards a Congressional Gold
Medal to Katherine Johnson, Dr. Chris-
tine Darden, and posthumously, to
Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson,
to honor all the women who contrib-
uted to NASA’s successful race to
space.
b 1730
These women worked tirelessly to
send a man to space, despite being seg-
regated in workrooms, bathrooms, and
cafeterias in the workspace of NASA.
They provided invaluable work, as
has been outlined in a very popular,
well-received, highly regarded movie.
Without their effort, it is possible we
may not have been able to witness
John Glenn orbit the Earth, Apollo 11’s
flight to the Moon, or watch the astro-
nauts of Apollo 13 return safely to
Earth and land in the South Pacific
Ocean.
In fact, Madam Speaker, when Apollo
13’s James Lovell and John Swigert—
who is actually here in the National
Statuary Hall collection, a statue from
his home State—when they famously
announced, ‘‘Houston, we’ve got a
problem,’’ when that message reached
mission control, it was Katherine
Johnson who crunched the numbers to
get our folks home.
This was at a time when everything
was going wrong, and she had a cool
head and an incredibly brilliant mind
to put this complex data together. This
is not hoping the computer spits out
the right information. This is the long
work that we all dreaded as kids when
it was simple math, and this was of the
longest, most complex nature, the type
of math that they had to do very
quickly.
These women deserve the Congres-
sional Gold Medal. They deserve this
recognition.
Madam Speaker, I support this bill,
and I urge my colleagues to pass this
piece of legislation. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

from Texas (Ms. JOHNSON), chairwoman
of the House Committee on Science,
Space, and Technology.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.
1396, the Hidden Figures Congressional
Gold Medal Act.
I thank the ranking member of the
committee, Mr. LUCAS, for joining me
in introducing this bill and for his ef-
forts to help secure the necessary sup-
port to bring the bill to the floor.
I also thank Senator COONS for his
leadership in championing an identical
companion bill in the Senate, which
passed out of the Senate by unanimous
consent in March.
I also wish to thank the 309 bipar-
tisan cosponsors in the House.
The ‘‘Hidden Figures’’ of NASA in-
clude the now-well-known women
mathematicians and engineers Kath-
erine Johnson, Dr. Christine Darden,
Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson.
Their stories, portrayed in the 2016
‘‘Hidden Figures’’ book and film, rep-
resent the stories of hundreds of
women computers, mathematicians,
and engineers working at NASA and its
precursor organization, the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,
NACA, from the 1930s to the 1970s.
In the early days of the space pro-
gram, women and their talents were
critically important but often over-
looked. Women were typically not per-
mitted to serve in any visible position
or recognized publicly for their con-
tributions.
Women of color faced the additional
daily indignity of racial discrimina-
tion.
In spite of these challenges, these
women chose to apply their consider-
able talents to help achieve what was,
arguably, one of the Nation’s crowning
technological achievements: landing
the first humans on the Moon.
The success of the NASA space pro-
gram was due, in large part, to their
brilliance, hard work, and perseverance
in the face of adversity.
What better example can we hope to
give our sons and daughters?
This bill will bestow Congress’ high-
est civilian honor in recognition of the
achievements of Katherine Johnson,
Dr. Christine Darden, Dorothy
Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and all the
other women computers, mathemati-
cians, and engineers at NACA and
NASA during this important time in
our history.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I am pleased that
this bill has wide bipartisan support,
and I thank the entire House Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology for its efforts in ensuring that
this incredible story is not lost in the
annals of history.
Given the place the Moon landing
holds in our Nation’s collective con-
sciousness, a national expression of
gratitude for these women and their
contributions is long overdue.

thirds being in the affirmative) the

the table.

GREG LEMOND CONGRESSIONAL
GOLD MEDAL ACT
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I move to suspend the rules and pass
the bill (H.R. 3589) to award a Congres-
sional Gold Medal to Greg LeMond, in
recognition of his service to the Nation
as an athlete, activist, role model, and
community leader, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 3589
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Greg
LeMond Congressional Gold Medal Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
The Congress finds the following:
(1) Gregory James ‘‘Greg’’ LeMond was
born in Lakewood, California, on June 26,
1961.
(2) Greg began cycling at the age of 14, win-
ning an astonishing 11 straight races to
begin his career.
(3) Greg took home a full suite of medals at
the 1979 Junior World Championships, in-
cluding gold, silver, and bronze, emerging
victorious in the road race and placing in
both team and track pursuit events.
(4) At age 18, Greg became the youngest cy-
clist in the history of the sport to be selected
for the United States Men’s Olympic team.
(5) Greg emerged victorious in the 1980 Cir-
cuit de la Sarthe, becoming the first Amer-
ican in history and the youngest rider ever
to win a major pro-am cycling event on the
European continent.
(6) At age 19, Greg signed his first profes-
sional contract.
(7) In 1982, Greg made the first of several
remarkable recoveries, returning from a bro-
ken collarbone to win the silver medal at the
world championships in Great Britain.
(8) The Tour de France, the world’s pre-
eminent cycling competition, was first held
over a century ago, in 1903.
(9) The Tour de France takes place over 23
days, covering an extraordinary 2,200 miles,
winding through multiple mountain ranges,
spanning multiple nations, and is viewed as
comparable to running a marathon every day
for three consecutive weeks.
(10) Greg first competed in the Tour de
France in 1984, finishing third, and finishing
second the following year, in both years dep-
utizing himself to his teammates, sacrificing
a chance to win himself to boost his team-
mates toward victory.
(11) Greg emerged victorious in the 1986
Tour de France, ascending the fabled Alpe
D’Huez, defeating the field by more than
three full minutes, becoming the first Amer-
ican and the first non-European to win
cycling’s most prestigious race.
(12) In 1987, while recovering from a broken
wrist and collarbone, Greg was tragically
shot during a turkey hunting accident, leav-
ing him in intensive care, requiring the re-
moval of over 40 shotgun pellets from his ab-
domen, was deemed unlikely to ever ride a
bicycle again, and likely survived only due
to the abnormal strength of his cardio-
vascular system.
(13) Greg mounted the greatest comeback
in the history of American sports, taking
home an astonishing victory at the 1989 Tour
de France, following multiple surgeries, life-
threatening gunshot wounds, tendon repair,
and an appendectomy, winning by eight sec-
onds in the closest finish in the history of
the Tour de France.
(14) Greg would win a third Tour de France
victory in 1990.
(15) Greg is the only American to win the
Tour de France.
(16) Greg has vocally spoken out to cham-
pion healthy sport amongst athletes of all
ages and competition levels.
(17) Greg and his wife, Kathy, are active in
numerous nonprofit causes, including
healthy sport, assisting victims of sexual
abuse and various childhood illnesses.
(18) Cycling offers young people a healthy,
active, outdoor hobby.
(19) Greg completed his professional career
having won two World Championships, three
Tour de France championships, and twenty-
two titles overall.
(20) More than any other cyclist, Greg per-
sonified the ‘‘breakaway’’ culture of Amer-
ican cycling in the 1970s and 80s, viewed uni-
versally as the epitome of a young person on
a bicycle, attempting to accomplish feats no
other American had achieved.
(21) Greg has not only reached the pinnacle
of international sport, but has devoted his
time and resources to assisting his fellow
athletes.
(22) Greg has demonstrated the commit-
ment to excellence, generosity, community,
and tenacity that makes him an example for
all to follow.

September 19, 2019
SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS.
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the
purpose of complying with the Statutory
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of
the House Budget Committee, provided that
such statement has been submitted prior to
the vote on passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Guam (Mr. SAN NICOLAS) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Guam.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert
extraneous material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam?
There was no objection.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 3589, the Greg LeMond
Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019.
I thank the gentleman from Cali-
fornia, Representative THOMPSON, for
his work on this bill, which honors a
man who, in addition to being one of
our Nation’s greatest athletes and the
greatest American cyclist in history,
exemplifies the virtues of sportsman-
ship, selflessness, and perseverance.
Born in Lakewood, California, Greg
LeMond is the only American cyclist
to win the Tour de France officially,
which he won three times. He is also
the first American to win a major Eu-
ropean cycling tournament and the
youngest cyclist in history to be se-
lected for the U.S. men’s Olympic
team.
LeMond is at the pinnacle of Amer-
ican cycling history and ranks firmly
among the most accomplished inter-
national athletes in U.S. history.
In 1987, he suffered a horrific gunshot
injury during a hunting accident,
which left him with over 40 pellets in
his abdomen. He was told he would
never ride a bicycle again.
Remarkably, in what remains one of
the most astonishing recoveries in
sports history, LeMond won the 1989
Tour de France on its final day, to win
his third yellow jersey in 4 years.
That victory—on the heels of gun-
shot wounds, an appendectomy, a bro-
ken wrist, and a fractured collarbone—
is a testament to Mr. LeMond’s tenac-
ity and training. It still stands as the
last time an American officially won
the Tour de France.
Above and beyond his considerable
athletic accomplishments, LeMond has
demonstrated a repeated willingness to
sacrifice his own individual victories
for the sake of his teammates.
Outside of the world of sports,
LeMond and his wife, Kathy, have
worked through various charitable ini-
tiatives to support victims of childhood
abuse and various childhood illnesses.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. THOMP-
SON for joining me in introducing this
bill this Congress and urge Members to
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
the Greg LeMond Congressional Gold
Medal Act.
First, I thank my colleague from
California (Mr. THOMPSON) for his work
on this important, bipartisan legisla-
tion.
I support the Greg LeMond Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act. I support it be-
cause Greg LeMond is a legend, one of
the cycling world’s best, and the only
American ever to officially win the
Tour de France.
When fans of cycling think of
LeMond, they think of firsts. In 1983,
LeMond was the first American to win
an elite world road championship. In
1984, LeMond was the first cyclist to
sign a million-dollar contract. In 1986,
he was the first American to win the
Tour de France.
Finally, in 1989, he was the first cy-
clist to appear on the cover of Sports
Illustrated as Sportsman of the Year.
Madam Speaker, Greg ‘‘LeMonster’’
LeMond recovered from a near-fatal
hunting accident in 1987 to go on to win
two more Tours de France. He won
those two with buckshot that was
lodged in the lining of his heart.
What an incredible athlete. What an
incredible physical specimen, what a
tenacious spirit, and what an icon that
is a fantastic representation for our
children to understand that you can be
an elite athlete and do so abiding by
the normal human constraints by
which we are all bound.
Doing it with intensity, with train-
ing, with focus, with practice, and with
such a great deal of success over his
amazing career, Greg LeMond is an
icon in the sports world and is deserv-
ing of the Congressional Gold Medal.
He represents some of the finest quali-
ties that we have as Americans.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman
from California (Mr. THOMPSON), chair-
man of the House Ways and Means Sub-
committee on Select Revenue Meas-
ures.
Mr. THOMPSON of California.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H.R. 3589, my legislation to award
American cyclist Greg LeMond with a
Congressional Gold Medal. I thank Mr.
GRAVES from Georgia, the coauthor
and lead Republican on this bill. This
is a bipartisan measure.
It is clear by the number of co-
authors that Greg LeMond has tremen-
dous respect in this Chamber.
It was pointed out that he was born
in California, Madam Speaker, but he
is your favorite son as well, having
grown up in Nevada.
Madam Speaker, Greg LeMond stands
atop the list of the greatest American
cyclists in our history. His accomplish-
ments speak for themselves: the only
American in history to officially win
the Tour de France, a three-time Tour
de France champion, the youngest
American ever selected for the U.S.
Olympic team, the first American in
history to win a major cycling tour-
nament in Europe, and the winner of 22
races overall.
These achievements alone would
place Greg firmly among the greatest
of American athletes, but they don’t
tell the full story.
Greg’s career has embodied many of
our most cherished and fundamental
values: sportsmanship, sacrifice, and
being a good teammate.
Greg won the Tour de France three
times, but he could have won even
more. In 1984 and 1985, Greg LeMond
was in a position to win the tour, in po-
sition to win another title for himself,
but instead, both times, Greg LeMond
chose to deputize himself to his team-
mates, sacrificing a chance at the title
himself to ensure that one of his team-
mates would emerge victorious.
Greg would continue to demonstrate
that selflessness for the rest of his life.
In addition, Greg personified the ideals
of perseverance and commitment,
never more so than during the 1989
Tour de France, because, in 1987, as you
heard, while recovering from a broken
wrist and collarbone, Greg LeMond was
shot during a hunting accident.
Doctors removed over 40 shotgun pel-
lets from his abdomen. He was told
that he would never ride a bike again.
Eighteen months later, Greg LeMond
mounted one of the greatest comebacks
in American sports history, winning
the 1989 Tour de France by 8 seconds,
the closest margin of victory in the
history of that event.
That victory, on the heels of his gun-
shot wounds, an appendectomy, a bro-
ken wrist, and a fractured collarbone,
was the last time an American won the
Tour de France.
In the years since, Greg LeMond has
devoted himself to helping others. He
and his wife, Kathy, are active in nu-
merous community causes: helping vic-
tims of sexual abuse and supporting re-
search into various childhood illnesses.
Greg LeMond has worked to promote
clean and healthy sporting habits and
to encourage young people to live
healthy, active, engaged lifestyles.
More than any other cyclist in our
history, Greg LeMond was the epitome
of the ‘‘Breaking Away’’ culture: a
young kid on a bike, trying to do
things no American had ever done.

Madam Speaker, Greg LeMond is one
of our Nation’s greatest athletes, a tre-
mendous role model, and a force for

good in his community. It is fitting
and proper that we honor him with the
Congressional Gold Medal. I encourage
my colleagues to vote for this bill.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself the balance of my time.
I am pleased to support this bipar-
tisan bill, and I want to thank Mr.
THOMPSON and all the bill’s many co-
sponsors.
For decades, Greg LeMond has exem-
plified the breakaway culture of Amer-
ican cycling and is the embodiment of
talent, tenacity, and selflessness that
is unparalleled in American sports.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this
important piece of legislation, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in support of H.R. 3589, the Greg
LeMond Congressional Gold Medal, which I’ve
had the honor of working with Mr. THOMPSON
of California on—a great partner and advocate
in recognizing Greg LeMond’s achievements.
Mr. LeMond blazed a trail in American cy-
cling, down which thousands of American cy-
clists have followed.
Over a thirteen-year professional career, he
raced to three wins at the Tour de France,
one of the most arduous events in endurance
sports, and became the first non-European to
be crowned its champion. Even today, facili-
ties like the Silver Comet Trail in my district
owe their existence in part to Greg’s legacy
and excitement created by his achievements.
Since his retirement, Greg and his wife
Kathy have devoted thousands of hours to ad-
vocating against doping in sports, promoting
athletic integrity, and serving others. As the
lead Republican on the Financial Services and
General Government Appropriations Sub-
committee, which includes anti-doping funding,
I am only too familiar with the scourge of
doping in sports. Greg has earned 750 acco-
lades over his career, and while a Congres-
sional Gold Medal may not rival a yellow jer-
sey, I hope we are able to provide him this
recognition.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Guam (Mr. SAN
NICOLAS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3589, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert
extraneous material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam?
There was no objection.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1830, the National Purple
Heart Hall of Honor Commemorative
Coin Act.
I want to thank the gentleman from
New York (Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALO-
NEY) as well as Representatives TAKANO
and GALLAGHER for their work on this
bill which would honor the Purple
Heart Hall of Honor.
The Purple Heart was established by
General and future President George
Washington in 1782 and is one of the
oldest and most recognized American
military medals awarded to service-
members who were killed or wounded
by enemy action.
The National Purple Heart Hall of
Honor is located in New Windsor, New
York, just 2 miles from the town of
Newburgh, where General Washington
signed the order creating the Purple
Heart. Its mission is to collect and pre-
serve the stories of Purple Heart recipi-
ents from all branches of the Armed
Forces from the time of its creation.
The Hall of Honor is a memorial to
the brave men and women who have
been wounded or died during combat,
and work ensures that their sacrifices
are not forgotten. Currently, there are
over 200,000 names installed at the Hall
of Honor.
This bill would provide tangible sup-
port to the Hall of Honor by directing
the West Point Mint to produce com-
memorative coins in recognition of the
work of the Hall of Honor. Proceeds
from the sale of this coin would fund
improvements to the museum itself to
help expand the understanding and re-
spect for those who have served and
sacrificed.
Additionally, proceeds would go to-
ward special projects like the Purple
Heart Patriot Project, which provides
resources for Purple Heart recipients
and their families from all across the
Nation to visit the National Purple
Heart Hall of Honor Museum.
I thank Mr. MALONEY, Mr. TAKANO,
and Mr. GALLAGHER for joining me in
introducing this bill this Congress, and
I urge Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H.R. 1830, the National Purple Heart
Hall of Honor Commemorative Coin
Act.
I would like to thank the gentleman
from New York (Mr. SEAN PATRICK
MALONEY) for his work on this impor-
tant bipartisan legislation. I thank
him for his hard work and sincere ad-
vocacy for Purple Heart, those that our
Nation honors with the Purple Heart
and who have sacrificed to honor us as
a nation.
The National Purple Heart Hall of
Honor is a New York State facility
that is dedicated to collecting, pre-
serving, and sharing the stories of all
Purple Heart recipients from all
branches of service and across all con-
flicts.
Enrollments at the National Purple
Heart Hall of Honor are voluntary and
are made by Purple Heart recipients,
their families or friends. Currently,
there are 1,095 Purple Heart recipients
enrolled from the great State of North
Carolina, representing World War I,
World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Soma-
lia, Operation Enduring Freedom, and
Operation Iraqi Freedom.
These courageous men and women
are recognized by the National Purple
Heart Hall of Honor because, surpris-
ingly, there is no comprehensive list of
recipients maintained by the Federal
Government. That is a separate issue
we can deal with at a separate time.
But I think it is important, the work
that Congressman MALONEY has taken
upon himself and the enormous labor it
takes to get a bill like this to the
House floor.
In fact, the only award for which
there is no list is the Medal of Honor.
Madam Speaker, the National Purple
Heart Hall of Honor is an organization
that deserves the recognition and the
commemorative coin that this bill will
strike. I urge my colleagues to support
this bill. It is another good piece of bi-
partisan legislation.
Again, I want to commend the author
of the legislation, Mr. MALONEY, for his
hard work and advocacy on behalf of
those who have received the Purple
Heart.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman
from New York (Mr. SEAN PATRICK
MALONEY), chairman of the Coast
Guard and Maritime Transportation
Subcommittee.
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of
New York. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of my bill, the Na-
tional Purple Heart Hall of Honor Com-
memorative Coin Act, and urge my col-
leagues to support its passage.
The National Purple Heart Hall of
Honor, located in my district in New
Windsor, New York, has a mission to
collect and preserve the stories of Pur-
ple Heart recipients from all service
branches and across generations so we
can ensure that all recipients are re-
membered. The hall also serves as a
living memorial to our veterans’ sac-
rifice.
My bill would honor the National
Purple Heart Hall of Honor and all our
Purple Heart recipients with a com-
memorative coin produced at the
United States Mint at West Point,
right down the road. Proceeds from the
sale of the coin would be directed to
the National Purple Heart Hall of
Honor, Incorporated, for projects and
programs that raise awareness about
the National Purple Heart Hall of
Honor and pay tribute to the memory
and sacrifices of all our servicemen and
-women who were wounded or killed in
combat.
Too often, the voices of our veterans
are not heard, and, as our veterans get
older, particularly our World War II
veterans, their memories and experi-
ences are in danger of being lost. These
stories are the most powerful record we
have to document the sacrifice of our
soldiers and their families, stories like
that of Corporal Richard Lay, a New
Yorker who served in the Marines dur-
ing Vietnam. Corporal Lay was born in
Manhattan to a father who, himself,
had served during World War II.
In 1968, during his service in Viet-
nam, Corporal Lay’s unit was am-
bushed by Vietcong soldiers in what he
describes as ‘‘a day of hell.’’ During the
mission, he was injured by shrapnel
from a nearby enemy blast. The Ma-
rines wanted to send Corporal Lay
back to the United States because of
his injuries, but he insisted on remain-
ing on the front lines with his fellow
marines to finish his tour of duty.
After his tour ended, Corporal Lay
went home to serve as a New York City
Police Officer for 13 years.
I am reminded of the story of Rich-
ard Drago, a sergeant in 1970 stationed
near the Cambodian border in Vietnam.
Rich, whom I know, and his company
were attacked while providing artillery
support for forward operations. While
operating a machine gun, Drago was
badly wounded but remained unwaver-
ing at his post. Without his grit and
perseverance, the enemy would have
surely pushed forward through the
United States’ position.
We can’t forget about the dedication
of our military nurses who have risked
their lives time and again in support of
freedom, nurses like Beatrice Mary
MacDonald, assigned to a British
Clearing Hospital as chief nurse during
World War I, in 1917. Chief Nurse Mac-
Donald and her unit served 4 miles be-
hind enemy lines in Belgium, yet Ger-
man aircraft still bombed the hospital
where she served, wounding her with
shell fragments. Due to those injuries,
she lost sight in her right eye. Chief
Nurse MacDonald remained in the
Army throughout the war. She is a
hero, and the first known woman to
have earned the Purple Heart.
In 2013, I had the honor of presenting
a long-overdue Purple Heart to the
family of a World War I veteran, Cor-
poral William B. Tiebout. Corporal
Tiebout served in the National Guard,
enlisted in the Army, and was, in May
of 1918, wounded in action while serv-
ing in Belgium. He sustained shrapnel
wounds to his legs and was wounded
again when his military hospital was
strafed by German aircraft. He was dis-
charged from the Army in 1919 but

never received his Purple Heart. He
served again during World War II and
responded to another call to defend
freedom, enlisting this time in the
Navy and serving as an aircraft inspec-
tor in Bethpage, New York.
Despite serving in two world wars
and being wounded, Corporal Tiebout
was never awarded the medals he had
earned. Presenting the Purple Heart to
his family was something I will never
forget. It was 95 years overdue, but
time could not diminish the debt we
owed to Corporal Tiebout for his serv-
ice to our Nation and his sacrifice in
defense of our freedom.
These are the stories that remind us
of what it is that is the very best in the
American spirit. Nothing exemplifies
the love of country more than the her-
oism of our Purple Heart veterans, the
veterans I just highlighted and so
many more whose names will never be
read out in this sacred Hall but whose
heroism is precious, nonetheless.
The Purple Heart Hall of Honor
houses hundreds of thousands of stories
of patriotism and resilience. We have
been working for years to get this bill
passed, and I am so proud and grateful
for the support of our military service
organizations that supported this legis-
lation, especially the Military Order of
the Purple Heart.
For volunteers like Stephanie
Keegan, who lost a son who served with
honor and came home with invisible
wounds, their efforts will guarantee
that we will finally produce this coin
to honor Purple Heart veterans, bolster
the important work of the hall and the
National Purple Heart Honor mission
and support the mission of the West
Point Mint.
Congratulations to all, and let’s pass
this measure in honor of all of our
wounded heroes and their families.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself the balance of my time.
I want to again thank Mr. MALONEY
for introducing this legislation, and all
the cosponsors. We must work to guar-
antee the stories of our Purple Heart
recipients are not forgotten. This
shows our commitment to this impor-
tant mission and to helping future gen-
erations understand the recipients’ sac-
rifices.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this
important piece of legislation, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Guam (Mr. SAN
NICOLAS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1830, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE
A message from the Senate by Ms.
Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that
the Senate has passed without amend-
ment a bill of the House of the fol-
lowing title:
H.R. 1058. An act to amend the Public
Health Service Act to enhance activities of
the National Institutes of Health with re-
spect to research on autism spectrum dis-
order and enhance programs relating to au-
tism, and for other purposes.

REAUTHORIZE THE OLDER
AMERICANS ACT
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, every
day, Americans volunteer within their
communities to help family, friends,
and neighbors, including our Nation’s
elderly. Personally, I have had the op-
portunity to deliver Meals on Wheels
on many occasions, and I have seen the
impact it has had on our seniors.
As a society, we must work together
to take care of older Americans who
are sometimes exploited, abused, or ne-
glected. That is why, in 1965, the Older
Americans Act was enacted to support
a wide range of services and programs
for individuals over the age of 60. This
critical legislation supports many pro-
grams important for Georgia’s seniors,
like nutrition programs at churches
and family caregiver support.
I am proud to serve on the House
Education and Labor Committee
where, this week, with unanimous bi-
partisan support, we voted to move for-
ward legislation to reauthorize the
Older Americans Act. As Congress has
done many times before, I urge my col-
leagues to reauthorize the Older Amer-
icans Act to protect our Nation’s elder-
ly.

HONORING DORNELL COUSETTE
(Mr. BYRNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to remember the life of Tusca-
loosa Police Department Investigator
Dornell Cousette.
Officer Cousette was tragically killed
in the line of duty Monday night. He
was only 40 years old. He leaves behind
two young children and his fiance.
As a 13-year veteran of the Tusca-
loosa Police Department and a veteran
of the United States Army, Officer
Cousette was loved and respected in
the Tuscaloosa community.
This awful event reminds us that the
men and women of law enforcement do
not get the appreciation they deserve.
Not only are they public servants in
the truest sense, but they have wives
and husbands. They have children that
they care for. They are active members
of their communities. They put their
lives on the line to protect. They de-
serve our thanks and gratitude and our
prayers.
I offer my sincerest condolences to
the family of Officer Cousette. We can
all be proud of the record of service and
sacrifice he leaves behind. Dornell
Cousette will not be forgotten.

FORCED ARBITRATION IS UNJUST
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to support and endorse the
FAIR Act, of which there will be a vig-
orous debate on the floor of the House
tomorrow.
As a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I was very pleased to be a co-
sponsor of that legislation and to ex-
plain to Americans what forced dispute
arbitration is. It is arbitration almost
without your knowledge.
This bill will provide the opportunity
for individuals who are forced into ar-
bitration to be able to waive that par-
ticular provision.
In fact, one of the saddest cases is
that of someone who utilized Massage
Envy, a company where this person
was trying to relieve their pain and,
unfortunately, was assaulted on the
massage table. All they wanted to do
was to get out of their contract, but
when they checked the little box to get
out of their contract, they checked the
box to say that you must go into forced
arbitration. You must wait weeks and
months and days and years.
I want to take note of the fact that
this is not about trial lawyers. It is
about justice. I am glad that the Na-
tion has lawyers who can stand before
the bar and in the courts to defend
those who cannot defend themselves.
Forced arbitration is an injustice.
This repeals that injustice.
I am a strong supporter of the FAIR
Act, and the fact is that it gives justice
to those who have no other remedy.
Let’s pass the FAIR Act.

Pennsylvania exceeded the national av-
erage.
Mental health professionals, advo-
cacy organizations, survivors, and al-
lies take this month to combat the
stigma of discussing mental health and
connect those with suicidal thoughts
to a network of professional resources.
If you think a loved one is struggling
with depression or ideation, just ask.
People in need can often feel relieved
when someone asks about their well-
being in a caring way. Acknowledging
and discussing their thoughts may be
the first step in reducing risk.
I encourage anyone who is struggling
with thoughts of suicide to call the Na-
tional Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1–
800–273–8255.
Madam Speaker, let’s keep the con-
versation going year-round. We can all
play an important role in prevention.

RECOGNIZING POW/MIA SOLDIERS
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GUEST. Since World War II,
138,103 American soldiers have been
listed as prisoners of war, and 83,114
American soldiers have been listed as
missing in action. National POW/MIA
Recognition Day was created to honor
the sacrifice of the men and women
who were imprisoned during wartime
and to remember those brave soldiers
who never returned to American soil.
Today, we thank our heavenly Fa-
ther for returning home those Amer-
ican soldiers who found themselves
confined on foreign soil, and we bow
our heads in prayer and remembrance
of those still missing.
I ask the Members of this body and
American citizens everywhere to in-
clude these soldiers, their families, and
their communities in your prayers and
to join me in thanks for the freedoms
and liberties we enjoy every day be-
cause of their sacrifice.

COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE WITH
AGGRESSIVE ACTION AND GLOB-
AL LEADERSHIP
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
TLAIB). Under the Speaker’s announced
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LEVIN) is
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam
Speaker, I would like to begin by say-
ing that the issue of climate change is
very personal to me. I have a 5- and a
7-year-old at home, and like any par-
ent, there is a lot that I worry about
for their future. One of the things I
worry most about is the planet that we
are going to leave behind for them and
for their future children.
The path we are on right now leads to
a grim future for our planet. We have
burned fossil fuels like coal and oil at
unsustainable rates, releasing extraor-
dinary amounts of greenhouse gas
emissions into the air. We have de-
stroyed forests and other carbon sinks
around the world that previously ab-
sorbed some of those emissions.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change, a collection of 1,300 inde-
pendent scientific experts from coun-
tries all over the world, concluded
there is a more than 95 percent prob-
ability that human activities over the
past 50 years have warmed our planet.
As a result, the last 5 years were the
hottest ever recorded, according to the
Trump administration’s own weather
and space agencies. Over the past cen-
tury, average global temperatures have
increased steadily. Sixteen of the last
17 years have been the warmest ever re-
corded by human observations.
In my home State of California, the
indicators of our rapidly changing cli-
mate are unmistakable. Our summers
are hotter, our droughts are more se-
vere, and our land is drier, creating
fuel for year-round wildfires that have
wiped out entire communities.
According to the Trump administra-
tion’s own report on climate change
compiled by more than 300 experts
across 13 Federal agencies, the impacts
of climate change are already being
felt in communities across the country
and will become increasingly dev-
astating over a short period of time.
The President would be well served
to read the report of his own agencies.
We are having more frequent and ex-
treme weather, like hurricanes and
floods. We are experiencing sea-level
rise and coastal erosion. Our national
security agencies have warned us that
unless we take aggressive action to
combat climate change, we will see a
deterioration in global stability caused
by food and water insecurity, wors-
ening public health, economic distress,
and damage to military infrastructure
as a result of sea-level rise and more
extreme storms.
Climate change is a defining issue of
our time. If we don’t take bold action
to address this crisis now, our children
and grandchildren will suffer the worst
consequences.
Unfortunately, this President and
many in the Trump administration are
content with inaction or worse. In fact,
some refuse to admit climate change is
real, instead pushing policies that
would exacerbate the problem, catering
to the fossil fuel industry and cor-
porate polluters at the expense of our
air, land, and water.
While we should be taking aggressive
action to combat climate change and
pushing countries around the world to
do the same, the White House gladly
surrenders our standing as a global
leader.
My colleagues and I are here to say
that we will lead. We will continue to
fight for action. My colleagues that
you will hear from, they are leading
right now.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. HILL),
my friend from California’s 25th Dis-
trict.
Ms. HILL of California. Madam
Speaker, I am both a millennial and
one of the youngest Members of Con-
gress. I joined Congress at a moment
when communities from California to
the Bahamas are enduring the effects
of climate change. In my own commu-
nity, we are experiencing lengthening
fire seasons and longer droughts.
As the climate crisis grows, those of
us who have refused money from Big
Oil and who will be the ones who have
to live with the effects of climate
change have to take it upon ourselves
to fight for our generation and the gen-
erations to come.
Tomorrow, young people across the
world will begin a week of climate ac-
tion with the Global Climate Strike.
We may not have made this mess, but
we will fight to clean it up.
That is why I sent a letter to Donald
Trump, along with 110 of my fellow
Members of Congress, to call for a re-
negotiated NAFTA deal that meaning-
fully addresses the climate crisis.
From moderates to progressives, we
are coming together to call for binding
climate standards and a recommitment
to the Paris climate agreement in the
updated NAFTA.
So far, that is not what Trump has in
mind. The current NAFTA 2.0 deal that
Trump negotiated with Mexico and
Canada fails to mention climate
change.
We cannot afford to pass another
trade deal that is on the wrong side of
our historic fight to tackle climate
change.
With 76 percent of Americans now
saying that climate change is a crisis
or a major problem, it is common sense
that our trade deals should support,
not undermine, climate action. In fact,
this is a longstanding demand, one that
leading environmental organizations,
labor-environment coalitions, climate
economists, and Members of Congress
have been elevating over the last 2
years of NAFTA talks.
The fact of the matter is that the cli-
mate crisis threatens our communities
and our future every single day. While
we are fighting to tackle the crisis, we
are seeing corporate polluters pad the
pockets of too many of our colleagues
on the other side of the aisle to protect
their bottom lines. I see colleagues in
both Chambers of Congress who won’t
have to deal with the repercussions of
their actions bargaining with my fu-
ture and the future of generations to
come.
This cycle must end now. It is past
time for rhetoric and empty promises.
We need new policies that offer real so-
lutions to the climate crisis. That
doesn’t include just H.R. 9, which, to be
honest, has very little chance of being
taken up in the Senate. It also has to
include our trade policies.
The reality is that this moment is
too important to throw away. This is
an unprecedented opportunity to put
our money where our mouth is on cli-
mate. We should ensure that any re-
negotiated NAFTA prioritizes climate

by including binding climate standards
and getting a guarantee from Trump
himself that the United States will re-
main a member of the most universal
and basic worldwide climate agreement
for our health, for our safety, for our
future, and for the people.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam
Speaker, I thank Representative HILL,
and I very much appreciate her leader-
ship.
Over the next several days, the eyes
of the world will turn to the climate
crisis with the Youth Global Strike for
Climate set to take place in over 150
countries just before the United Na-
tions holds a Climate Action Summit
in New York City.
While millions of people across the
globe call for action on climate change
and world leaders come together to
show how they will honor their com-
mitment to the Paris Agreement, it is
safe to say that the White House won’t
step up to lead, let alone take any
meaningful action. Instead, the Trump
administration is pulling us out of the
Paris Agreement, which nearly 200
countries from Afghanistan to
Zimbabwe and all in between have
signed.
Where President Obama created a
leading role for the United States on
the world stage, the Trump administra-
tion has retreated.
The U.N. Secretary General has
called on all leaders to come to the Cli-
mate Action Summit with concrete, re-
alistic plans to enhance their nation-
ally determined contributions by 2020,
in line with reducing greenhouse gas
emissions by 45 percent over the next
decade and to net zero emissions by
2050.
The United States has an important
opportunity to show leadership and to
push other countries to follow us, and
that is how we should evaluate all of
these measures, on the basis of
followership. That requires that we
lead.
That is critically important, the
work that we do. The amount of collec-
tive action that will be needed must
start with leadership from the United
States. That is the only way we are
going to combat the climate crisis.
I was very proud to help introduce,
among other bills, the Climate Action
Now Act, the first major climate
change legislation that we had in the
116th Congress, in fact, that we have
had for a number of years in the U.S.
House of Representatives. The bill
would prohibit the administration from
withdrawing the United States from
the Paris Agreement and would also
call on the President to develop and
make public a plan for how the Nation
will meet the pollution reduction goals
in the Paris Agreement.
The bill isn’t just about staying in
Paris. It is about creating good-paying,
green jobs right here in America. It is
about public health. It is about pro-
tecting our air. It is about protecting
our water. It is about defending our na-
tional security from the threats that
climate change poses. It is about again
leading in the world.
That is how the United States should
be leading. We should set the example.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE),
my friend.
b 1815
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from California
(Mr. LEVIN) so much for yielding.
Madam Speaker, 12 years, we are told
that we have 12 years to limit the ef-
fects of climate change on our planet
and ensure a better world for our chil-
dren, our grandchildren, and future
generations to come—12 years.
I mean, it really seems like a long
time, but now scientists are saying
that the actions we take in the next 18
months will determine our ability to
meet our climate goals by 2030.
In 18 months, we will experience two
more winters and another summer,
each bringing with them more extreme
weather and more catastrophic natural
disasters. The stakes are so high.
Less predictable climates produce
lower crop yields, drive up the costs of
healthy food; meanwhile, extreme
weather events and heat waves result-
ing from a changing climate may wors-
en a growing array of public health
problems like waterborne diseases,
asthma, mental illness, heart disease,
stroke, and more.
In Wisconsin, from where I hail, we
still remember the deathly chill of the
polar vortex this past winter, matched
only in intensity by the summer’s
record-setting heat, heavy downpours,
and flooding. Our storm in July pro-
duced severe enough damage that sev-
eral counties across Wisconsin received
Federal disaster relief funding.
But do you know what, Madam
Speaker? Disaster funding can help re-
build communities, but it cannot pre-
vent them from being torn apart by cli-
mate change.
As we debate which urgent actions
must be taken within the next 18
months to prevent further decay of our
climate, we must work not only to sup-
port a swift transition away from fossil
fuels to renewable energy sources, but
also to fortify our communities.
The fact is climate change has a dis-
parate impact on low-income and mi-
nority communities. Indeed, these
communities are already dispropor-
tionately impacted by other environ-
mental hazards, and we are just piling
on.
Air pollution from both stationary
and mobile sources are a primary
source of environmental health risks,
particularly in urban areas. Low-in-
come, high-minority population com-
munities, which unfortunately are
highly segregated, tend to be closer to
industrial sources of pollution, includ-
ing chemical plants, steel mills, oil re-
fineries, peak load power plants, and
hazardous waste incinerators.
One study found that Blacks, the
poor, and people with low educational
attainment were substantially more
likely to live within 1 mile of a pol-
luting facility, and that within urban
areas, racial disparities were particu-
larly evident in the Midwest and the
West.
As it pertains to our warming cli-
mate, another study found that, as
urban areas heat up, so-called urban
heat islands, low-income and high-mi-
nority communities will boast higher
heat indexes during extreme heat
events, thereby compounding the al-
ready dire and deadly impacts that
heat waves have on urban populations.
Or, just to put it bluntly, the urban
poor in dozens of large U.S. cities will
actually experience more heat than the
wealthy simply by virtue of where they
live.
With climate change, extreme heat is
expected to become more common and
more severe for the poor and already
vulnerable communities. This will like-
ly result in increases in heat-related
illnesses, including cardiovascular and
respiratory complications, kidney dis-
ease, and can be especially harmful to
outdoor workers, children, our elderly,
and low-income households.
It is also worth mentioning that
these communities, which already suf-
fer resource deficits, cannot simply re-
locate out of flood zones. They also
face challenges adopting new clean en-
ergy technologies.
Now, while this administration con-
tinues to fiddle when it comes to tak-
ing the threat of climate change seri-
ously and exercising leadership, while
they ignore the admonition of science
that if we don’t do something within
the next 18 months we may not be able
to reverse these impacts within 12
years, I will tell you something. In
June, my city of Milwaukee announced
a comprehensive action-based plan to
meet the U.S.’ commitment under the
Paris climate accord, despite what this
administration is doing. We are moving
forth to create green infrastructure
and to create jobs.
In August, our Wisconsin Governor,
Tony Evers, signed an executive order
aimed at eliminating the use of carbon-
based fuel in Wisconsin by 2050. We also
created a diverse task force comprised
of city and county officials that will
chart a path to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions by 45 percent of 2015 lev-
els by 2030 and eliminate them alto-
gether by 2050, a goal which I whole-
heartedly support.
But let’s just keep this real, Madam
Speaker. While actions by State and
local officials are welcome and nec-
essary, we know they can’t do it alone.
On such a vital issue, the Federal Gov-
ernment should not lead from behind.
The Federal Government cannot be
missing in action and absent from the
table, and it will be absolutely critical

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7821
September 19, 2019
But leading from behind is exactly
what this administration is doing. Be-
sides pulling out of the Paris climate
accord without any plan or alternative
for addressing climate change, this ad-
ministration has moved to roll back
the Obama era Clean Power Plan and
other efforts to address greenhouse gas
emissions.
We must not only make sure that we
recognize the disparate impacts of cli-
mate change as we act, but we must
also bring our most at-risk citizens to
the table and educate them and discuss
the actions that we will take together
to address climate change.
We need to do right by our fellow
human beings and by our beloved
shared planet and protect ourselves
and our planet against the threats we
face today and in the future. Even if
this administration wants to turn its
back, this House must not. We must
continue to pass legislation that will
help us meaningfully address climate
change.
Twelve years from now? Eighteen
months from now? How about right
now?
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam
Speaker, I thank Representative
MOORE for those powerful words.
Madam Speaker, I also want to ad-
dress something that has been in the
news, and that is the President’s an-
nouncement yesterday that he will re-
voke California’s waiver under the Fed-
eral Clean Air Act to set its own auto
emissions standards. This is some-
thing, as a native southern Californian,
that is near and dear to my heart.
So many southern Californians have
had to endure poor air quality over the
years, and this, honestly, is something
that has never been partisan. Since the
late 1960s, California has been able to
set its own air quality standards, be-
cause the standards that we set when
Ronald Reagan was Governor of Cali-
fornia in the late 1960s exactly pre-
ceded those standards set by the Fed-
eral Government.
Clean air is not a partisan issue. This
is absolutely ridiculous that the ad-
ministration would want to go after
California once again in this manner.
So another thing to refute are the
claims made by the President about ve-
hicle safety and cost—completely base-
less. Fuel-efficient cars meet the same
exact safety standards as any other
passenger vehicle and have proven to
be more cost-effective. The auto manu-
facturers want to accelerate the transi-
tion to more electric vehicles, more
sustainable vehicles.
Everybody wants California to be
able to have its own standards, with
two exceptions: President Trump and
Big Oil. Those are the only two excep-
tions. So it is pretty clear to see whose
direction the President is taking when
it comes to this decision.
We also need to acknowledge that his
decision here flies in the face of estab-
lished climate science. Transportation
is the largest source of greenhouse gas
emissions in our country. The science
tells us that greenhouse gas emissions
are driving climate change, so we
should be doing everything we can to
reduce those emissions from transpor-
tation.
The Clean Air Act clearly gives Cali-
fornia the authority to set its own
emission standards, and this authority
has been repeatedly confirmed by the
courts, the Congress, and previous ad-
ministrations, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike.
Again, this is not a partisan issue.
Even the auto companies want to see
this happen.
So why are we still here? Why are we
fighting over this ridiculous assump-
tion by the President that he can roll
back five decades of progress for clean-
er air in California?
We are not going to let it stand. I
will do everything in my power as a
Member of Congress, as I know my col-
leagues will, and California will pre-
vail.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN),
my friend and the Representative from
California’s Second District.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker,
from the Representative of the north-
ernmost district on the coast of Cali-
fornia, I really do want to thank my
friend from southern California for
yielding to me. San Diego and Orange
Counties are so well-served by his in-
telligent, principled leadership, and es-
pecially on this issue, this existential
crisis that we are trying to confront of
global climate change. The gentle-
man’s leadership on this issue has cer-
tainly been noted.
Madam Speaker, our leader, Speaker
NANCY PELOSI, did a very unusual thing
in reaching out and choosing a fresh-
man Member of Congress, and it is be-
cause of Mr. LEVIN’s background and
clarity on these issues that she put
him on the House Select Committee on
the Climate Crisis, where I am proud to
serve with him. So I thank the gen-
tleman so much for that leadership.
And, Madam Speaker, he is doing
more than that. He is putting great
bills into the hopper. He is leading this
debate this evening. So we are well
served with Mr. LEVIN’s leadership in
southern California.
Now, one of the previous speakers
mentioned that we are gathered here
on the eve of this global climate strike
tomorrow. Tens of thousands of stu-
dents all over the United States, 800
different sites, are working in harmony
with 156 other countries where young
people are doing the same thing world-
wide. This is a week of action.
These are high school kids, and even
younger in some cases. They under-
stand what is at stake here. The part of
their message that I think we really
need to hear is that we don’t have
time.
There is an extreme urgency to con-
front this crisis, and they understand
that the longer we wait, the harder it
is going to be to preserve a livable fu-
ture for their generation. Of course, if
we wait too long, it is game over.
They are scared, and they ought to be
scared. We all ought to be scared about
the fact that we are running out of
time to address this crisis.
Yesterday, I had a chance to sit down
with a few of these young leaders. I am
super grateful that four of those that
Chairman GRIJALVA and I met with for
a couple of hours were from Sonoma
County in my district. So I want to
thank Olivia, Kate, Christian, and
Jonah. They were from the National
Children’s Campaign and also Schools
for Climate Action. They came all the
way to Washington, D.C., to make sure
that the country heard their story.
That story, of course, involves the
terrible firestorm of October 2017 that
the folks in the North Bay had to live
through. These young people had their
lives uprooted and impacted in pro-
found ways, and it helped sharpen their
climate activism. They brought that
story to a very important, urgent con-
versation that Chairman GRIJALVA and
I were part of yesterday.
More and more people like them are
living the very real impacts that cli-
mate change is having right now. This
is not some abstract thing in the fu-
ture. It is happening now, and it is
going to get worse as we go forward, es-
pecially if we don’t act.
So this message of urgency, clearly
the public understands it. Congressman
LEVIN and I were just in the Cloak-
room, and MSNBC showed a brand-new
poll that shows that 65 percent, I be-
lieve, of the American people under-
stand this is a crisis.
It is not just an important issue. It is
a crisis.
b 1830
The public gets it. The rest of the
world gets it. In fact, on Monday, the
nations of the world will gather in New
York to map out the next steps on cli-
mate action. They will be building on
the Paris climate agreement. They will
be working together to figure out how
we can reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions by 45 percent over the next dec-
ade.
But if the American people get it and
all of these young people all over the
world get it, it is fair to ask: Where is
American leadership right now? Where
is this administration right now? Un-
fortunately, Mr. LEVIN alluded to the
worst of it: this fight over California’s
clean car authority. They are trying to
take us backward in the wrong direc-
tion. We just don’t have time for that
if we are serious about this crisis.
Mr. LEVIN talked about the fact that
our authority under the Clean Air Act
goes back to 1967. I think it was a Gov-
ernor named Ronald Reagan, actually,
who got us started on this critical au-
thority. It has been so successful. Cali-
fornia has used it to protect clean air
over 50 times.
Madam Speaker, I would ask Con-
gressman LEVIN if he knows how many
of those times, the 50 times that we
have used that Clean Air Act author-
ity, how many of those were revoked?

Zero. It has never been revoked. It has
always been upheld, and it has been
wildly successful in helping California
improve air quality, reduce smog, and
improve public health. We have added
jobs and the economy has continued to
grow.
We have been able to do all this in a
way that helped stimulate the auto in-
dustry, to innovate, and to bring new
and very desirable models of vehicles
to market that wouldn’t be there if it
weren’t for California’s leadership on
clean car standards, and, of course,
more than a dozen other States that
have followed suit and joined us as
clean car States.
What President Trump is trying to
do is absolutely unprecedented in
American history and it is legally dubi-
ous. He is wrong on the law and he is
wrong on the policy. It is the most se-
rious assault on State authority and on
public health that you could imagine.
And yet, with this administration, hey,
it is just another day in the Trump
White House, unfortunately.
This House, of course, the people’s
House, gets it. We have already started
to take action. We are working to
block the Trump administration’s
worst climate rollbacks.
Just last week, a bipartisan majority
of this House voted to approve my bill
to protect the Arctic refuge from this
crazy ‘‘drill everywhere’’ mandate that
they put into the Republican tax scam
in 2017. We also passed bills to protect
the Pacific, Atlantic, and Florida Gulf
Coasts from these plans to do more off-
shore drilling. These are important
steps in the fight to confront the cli-
mate crisis.
And, of course, there was H.R. 9, the
Climate Action Now Act, which would
block President Trump’s attempt to
take us out of the Paris climate agree-
ment.
Let’s keep working together in the
people’s House. Let’s keep working
with this energized, motivated, incred-
ibly passionate new generation of lead-
ers that we are seeing all over the
country and all over the world.
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
man LEVIN for his leadership.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam
Speaker, I thank Congressman
HUFFMAN for his friendship, for his
mentorship, and for all the work that
he does. He is a true environmental
champion. I am really, really grateful
to call him a friend. We have got a lot
of work to do.
I think it is really important that, as
we think about this issue, we begin to
address some of the myths and the mis-
conceptions that are out there. One of
the biggest that I hear from my friends
across the aisle is that we cannot com-
bat climate change without destroying
our economy, when exactly the oppo-
site is true.
If we invest in the clean energy jobs
of the future, we will see incredible
economic growth and we will protect
the environment at the same time. No-
where has that been more true in the
United States than in our State of
California, where I am proud to tell
you that we have the most clean-en-
ergy jobs in the United States.
If you look at this chart, there are
over 500,000 jobs in the clean tech sec-
tor. I am proud to have come from the
clean tech sector. I am proud to have
started a trade association in Orange
County, California, which historically
has been seen as one of the most con-
servative places in the United States.
We created a booming clean tech indus-
try that is growing stronger than ever
before. The same is true in San Diego
County, where we have some of the
leading clean energy companies in the
United States. We can protect the envi-
ronment and we can grow the clean
tech economy at the same time.
In California, it has never been a par-
tisan issue. When we passed AB 32 in
2006, Arnold Schwarzenegger was the
Governor, Republican Governor. Then
when we passed cap and trade, we had
nine Republican legislators who helped
get that passed in the California legis-
lature.
Governor Schwarzenegger and those
Republican legislators at the time un-
derstood that if we made climate
change a primary focus, if we reduced
greenhouse gas emissions, that not
only was it the right thing to do for
our State and for the planet, but it was
the right thing to do for our economy.
That is exactly what has happened.
My friend, Marshall Burke, is a re-
searcher at Stanford University, my
alma mater. He has studied the costs of
action on climate change, but, more
importantly, the costs of inaction.
There is an inherent cost to doing
nothing. My friends across the aisle al-
ways like to tell you about the cost of
doing something. They will say bold
and aggressive measures will cost too
much. Well, Mr. Speaker, the costs of
inaction are even greater.
My friend, Marshall Burke, has said
that if we don’t take substantial action
to mitigate the climate crisis, it will
cost the U.S. economy $25 trillion to
$35 trillion over the coming decades.
That is with a T: $25 trillion to $35
trillion.
The good news is that we can take
the steps we need to in order to act. We
can combat the climate crisis, and we
can create those clean energy jobs.
I have introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion to reduce our dependence on fossil
fuels by promoting development of re-
newable energy on public lands.
We can expand those technologies
that grow our economy and protect the
environment by extending important
tax credits like the solar investment
tax credit, which drives job creation,
reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and
helps level the playing field for clean
energy. And we need it for things like
battery storage, as well.
I have introduced legislation that
presents an ambitious plan for
transitioning the United States to 100
percent zero-emission vehicles, which
will also have an enormous health ben-
efit to the United States of America.
According to a 2016 report issued by
the American Lung Association,
transitioning to zero-emission vehicles
would deliver $33 billion in total health
and climate savings by 2050. The 90 per-
cent reduction in the pollution that
causes smog and soot would translate
to 195,000 fewer lost work days, 96,000
fewer asthma attacks, and 2,200 fewer
premature deaths.
And I have introduced legislation, as
well, to expand electric vehicle charg-
ing on public lands across the United
States and convert National Park
Service and United States Forest Serv-
ice fleets to zero-emission vehicles.
This commitment will also help the
United States lead the world in devel-
oping and manufacturing innovative
zero-emission vehicle technology.
Since California first instituted a
zero-emission vehicle requirement in
1990, the overall economy has flour-
ished, cutting-edge companies like
Tesla have generated billions of dollars
in economic activity for our State, and
leading automotive companies across
the country and the world have done
everything they can to invest in the
cleaner technology of the future zero-
emission vehicles.
Alternatively, if we fail to act, if
American car companies don’t lead,
and if we don’t have a supportive Fed-
eral Government helping them to lead
the way in these zero-emission vehicles
of the future, we will allow other coun-
tries to take the lead. China, India, and
nations in Europe will reap the eco-
nomic rewards that should be staying
right here in the United States of
America. We will find ourselves pur-
chasing foreign vehicles that should
have been made right here in the USA.
Many of my colleagues are doing
great work. They have introduced or
passed legislation that addresses the
climate crisis in many different ways
and promotes the clean energy jobs of
the future. You just heard from a few
of them.
Mr. Speaker, I want to wrap up here
by pointing out one more key fact. The
American people overwhelmingly sup-
port aggressive action to combat cli-
mate change.
Public opinion polling shows that the
majority of Americans say that it must
be addressed, and it has got to be ad-
dressed now. The majority of Ameri-
cans overwhelmingly believe this is a
crisis, and they are right to believe
that.
Unfortunately, our President right
now calls climate change a hoax. He
says that it was brought on by China to
undermine American economic com-
petitiveness. He is not willing to listen
to the science. He should listen to the
scientists from his own agencies. He
should just take the half hour nec-
essary to even read the executive sum-
mary from his own scientists’ report.
That is all I would ask.
He should think about climate
change when he makes appointments.
Unfortunately, he has been appointing
climate science deniers like William

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7823
September 19, 2019
Happer, a gentleman who once said
that if the plants could vote, they
would vote for coal. He said that more
CO2 in the atmosphere is a good thing.
This is a person advising the President
of the United States on climate
science.
And it is not that the administration
is too close to the oil and coal indus-
try, it is that they are the oil and coal
industry. It is literally a revolving
door between 1600 Pennsylvania Ave-
nue, those coal companies, and those
oil companies. The American people
demand better than that.
This complete rejection of estab-
lished science is dangerous, and it is ir-
responsible.
It is dangerous and irresponsible for
the White House to pressure the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration, or NOAA, into sup-
porting the President’s false claims
about Hurricane Dorian. You don’t see
any Sharpies on this chart.
It is dangerous and it is irresponsible
that the White House refuses to accept
climate science and act on it. It is dan-
gerous. It is irresponsible. We must em-
brace science. We must embrace facts.
As I said in the beginning of this,
this is about our children and our
grandchildren. I am thinking today
about my own two children: my daugh-
ter, Elizabeth, who is 5, and my son,
Jonathan, who is 7. Maybe my wonder-
ful wife, Chrissy, will cue up C–SPAN
and play this for them.
My son, who is 7, just started second
grade. We have 12 years. By the time
my son is ready to graduate high
school, according to the best science,
we better have gotten this crisis fig-
ured out or we are going to have irrep-
arable damage as a result. It is on us.
When I am done with my service in
the House of Representatives, which I
hope comes many years from now, I
want to be able to look back, as I know
so many of my colleagues do, and know
that we gave it everything we had to
try to address what we believe is the
most pressing issue facing the United
States of America and the world.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB).
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL PREADMORE
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in tribute to the city of Melvindale and
the city of Dearborn Fire Department
Captain Michael Preadmore, who,
today, retires after 23 years of service.
He knows safety doesn’t take a day off,
so he maintained a perfect attendance
record since becoming a firefighter in
1996. He has also received such awards
as the Fire Chief Life Saving Award
and the department Medal of Valor
Award for his bravery in the line of
duty.
Please join me in saluting Captain
Preadmore in wishing him a happy re-
tirement.
HONORING GENERAL MOTORS WORKERS
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today, I
stand with the United Automobile
Workers by honoring General Motors
workers on day 4 of their strike.
This is Grayson Riley Poland, a child
of a General Motors worker. She is
only 5 years old. She periodically gets
treatment for her cerebral palsy that
keeps her legs from scissoring due to
her muscles tightening up. Her next
treatment, Mr. Speaker, is on October
1. Her father is on strike right now and
worried about whether or not he has
healthcare coverage anymore.
Mr. Speaker, the General Motors
CEO makes $22 million, 281 times the
median income of their workers. Yet,
workers are being asked to pay more
for healthcare.
General Motors workers gave up so
much to keep the company afloat.
They didn’t abandon GM during their
toughest time, but now they are asking
for fair wages and coverage for their
healthcare.
Mr. Speaker, I am urging my col-
leagues and the country to join me in
solidarity with them today.
b 1845
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield to the gentlewoman from Il-
linois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), my friend.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for leading this
discussion about climate. What I really
love about so many of our freshman
Members, like Congressman LEVIN, is
that they say how urgent the need is
right now to act, a sense of urgency.
I am on the Subcommittee on Envi-
ronment and Climate Change, and we
had a hearing yesterday. We had nice
people testifying, but we still heard,
particularly from our Republican col-
leagues, that it is a decision between
jobs and a clean environment. Are you
kidding me?
We have known about this crisis,
which it is, for decades. We knew about
it even in the Johnson administration,
long ago.
We have had this debate about jobs
and environment as if you have to pick
one or the other. As Representative
LEVIN went over and over, about how
good for the economy, how good for
workers, how good the jobs are, we are
now wasting time in addressing this
problem. It was really frustrating to
me that we continue to go over this.
In the meantime, the forests are
burning in California. The fields are
flooding in Illinois, where I am from.
The hurricanes are destroying islands,
Florida, and all up and down the
coast—except for Alabama, not really.
It is really so important that we are
listening to the children. Yesterday, we
had this amazing young woman, Greta
Thunberg, who is from Sweden. She is
16 years old, but she is also a veteran
fighting worldwide, an international
figure calling for us to act.
This is one of the things that she said
yesterday when she was here in Wash-
ington. This is Greta, now 16 years old,
who said: ‘‘Please, save your praise. We
don’t want it. Don’t invite us here to
just tell us how inspiring we are with-
out actually doing anything about it,
because it doesn’t lead to anything.’’
Greta is fierce, but she is not the
only one. I am hoping that I am going
to be able to get home in time to my
district to join my grandson outside of
his school tomorrow afternoon at one
of the demonstrations, the many dem-
onstrations that are going to be taking
place across the country on climate
where young people are telling us: We
can’t wait. This is our century. This is
our time. We are going to take the
lead.
I think it is our job now to follow
them. There is a court suit right now
where 21 young people have sued the
Government of the United States of
America for violating their constitu-
tional rights by ignoring this issue of
climate and the crisis that we are cre-
ating.
Our species is in danger. Every spe-
cies living on Earth today is in danger.
This is truly a matter of life and death.
We already are seeing climate refu-
gees, people who can’t live in places be-
cause they can’t grow crops anymore.
We are seeing the spreading of the Sa-
hara desert. We are seeing the Amazon
rainforest burning. Every fifth breath
that every person takes on Earth is be-
cause of the oxygen that comes out of
the rainforest in the Amazon.
What are we doing? We are still de-
bating this. We are still talking. We
are having conversations about it and
way too little action.
I am really happy that, last week, we
passed a bill, at least in the House, to
stop offshore drilling in the Atlantic
Ocean, in the Pacific Ocean, and in the
Gulf. I am really happy that we are
trying to reverse the drilling in ANWR
up in Alaska.
But we have to do big things. We
have to take action together with
countries around the world.
We have to listen to the children.
They are begging us. They are acting,
and they are speaking out. All we real-
ly need to do is follow.
Again, I thank Representative LEVIN
and so many of the freshmen who have
come here to the Congress and said:
This is urgent. We can’t wait anymore.
We can’t dawdle anymore. We must
act.
I really appreciate the opportunity to
come down here today.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam
Speaker, I thank Representative SCHA-
KOWSKY for coming.
It is a great honor to sit on the new
Select Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis under the chair, KATHY CASTOR
from Florida. I serve with many other
great Members, and we have an honest
dialogue about the action that we are
going to need to take to combat this
crisis.
Of course, I thank our great Speaker
NANCY PELOSI for creating that select
committee as part of the 116th Con-
gress.
Governor Jay Inslee said: ‘‘We’re the
first generation to feel the sting of cli-
mate change, and we’re the last who
can do something about it.’’
I couldn’t agree more with Rep-

They are counting on us.

ACT NOW ON IMMIGRATION CRISIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
TLAIB). Under the Speaker’s announced
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) is rec-
ognized for 60 minutes as the designee
of the minority leader.
HONORING WINTON W. CARTER ON HIS 100TH
BIRTHDAY
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, on Sep-
tember 30, 2019, northeast Florida will
help Winton Carter celebrate his 100th
birthday.
The year Mr. Carter was born, World
War I formally ended with the Treaty
of Versailles, alcohol was officially il-
legal with the formal start of Prohibi-
tion, and Boston’s Babe Ruth was trad-
ed to the New York Yankees at the end
of the season.
Even more amazing is the life Mr.
Carter has led serving our country.
Mr. Carter received a Purple Heart
after being wounded by shrapnel in his
thigh while under continuous fire,
fighting the Japanese on the island of
Saipan in World War II. He was there
for the famous raising of the American
flag on the Japanese island of Iwo
Jima. Mr. Carter also later fought in
the Korean war.
After 22 years in the military, he re-
tired as a Marine master sergeant and
served a total of 40 years in govern-
ment service, which included recruit-
ing future Marine heroes.
Mr. Carter is a widower, having cele-
brated 60 years of marriage to his wife,
Norma Jean. He is the father of two,
and he loves to talk about the Lord.
Therefore, it is on this day, Sep-
tember 19, that I proudly acknowledge
Mr. Winton W. Carter on the House
floor, and I ask you to join me in wish-
ing him an early happy birthday.
OBSERVING NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION
DAY
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would
like to take this time to honor those
who were prisoners of war and those
who remain missing in action, as well
as their families, in observance of Na-
tional POW/MIA Recognition Day.
We are forever indebted to those who
sacrificed everything so that we may
enjoy the freedoms granted to us by
the Constitution.
‘‘You are not forgotten.’’ This is a
central phrase of National POW/MIA
Recognition Day. It is our job as a na-
tion to stand behind those who are cur-
rently serving, those who have served,
and those who have never returned
from service who gave the ultimate
sacrifice.
Through international relationships,
many of those who have fallen have
been returned back to our country and
to their families, and we will continue
to do the search and return our MIA
soldiers. It is our responsibility as a
nation to never forget or quit search-
ing for the men and women who paid
that ultimate price. We must continue
to honor them in the years to come.
HONORING FIRST RESPONDER JOHN LANKENAU
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would
like to take this time to honor one of
my constituents, John Lankenau.
As the anniversary of 9/11 just passed,
we must always remember those who
we have lost and honor the heroes who
sacrificed their lives for others.
On September 11, 2001, Mr. Lankenau
was assigned as a hazardous material
specialist in Albany, New York. On
that tragic day, as the second plane
flew into the towers, Mr. Lankenau
was requested to respond to New York
City to assist first responders at
Ground Zero.
Upon arrival, Mr. Lankenau was re-
quested by name to conduct the first
hazard surveys of Ground Zero. He
worked until early morning, taking air
and soil samples on the wreckage site.
Mr. Lankenau remembered how dan-
gerous it was, maneuvering through
the wreckage and fearing that there
was a possibility that one of the adja-
cent buildings could collapse, causing
more fatalities.
He spent the next couple of weeks
going back and forth from home, con-
tinuing to assess the hazards and the
conditions at Ground Zero.
It is my greatest pleasure to rep-
resent men like Mr. John Lankenau in
the United States Congress. I commend
him and the rest of the first responders
on 9/11 for their character, their cour-
age, and their commitment to serving
others. I thank them, these true he-
roes, for their service.
CONGRATULATING UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA ON
ITS RANKING
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would
like to highlight my alma mater, the
University of Florida, which I rep-
resent in Florida’s District Three.
The University of Florida, under the
guidance of its president, Dr. Kent
Fuchs, has again risen in the U.S. News
and World Report rankings to number
seven among all public universities in
the United States. This is the third
year in the row the University of Flor-
ida has advanced in that ranking.
The University of Florida incor-
porates all health disciplines, is one of
the largest engineering schools in the
country, and has a top-rated veteri-
narian school, which I graduated from
in 1983.
It is just one of the few schools in the
Nation to have won major sports team
national championships and titles in
football, basketball, and baseball.
I guess that is why it is great to be a
Florida Gator.
Madam Speaker, I would like to talk
about another crisis that has not been
dealt with on this House floor, and that
crisis is the immigration crisis we
have.
We hear a lot about the climate cri-
sis. Crises are the things that are hap-
pening right now that we must respond
to. But so many of the things that we
face in Congress are issues that may be
a crisis for some along the border, or
some who are being advanced by people
coming into the country illegally, but
if Congress were to act, these crises
would go away.
There is time to deal with climate
change, and there is time to deal with
the crisis on the border, but we must
act.
I have a photo here from June 2014,
when my colleagues on the other side
said there was a crisis, and it was
under President Barack Obama. This is
still going on at the border. I look at
these people, and they look like people
who want opportunity. They are com-
ing to this country.
I have this other photo, and there are
families, women, children, husbands.
They look like people who are wanting
to come into this country for oppor-
tunity.
Congress has failed, and it has not
just failed this Nation, but it failed
these people in the policies that we
don’t have because of political divide.
We talk about how we want to fix the
crisis on climate change, but we don’t
come together on that. We want to
talk about the immigration crisis, but
we don’t come together on it because it
becomes a wedge and a tool that people
use in politics for the next election.
They say, well, they are against that,
and that is why you have to vote me
back in.
That happens on immigration. That
is why immigration doesn’t get fixed. I
am convinced of that.
b 1900
So we have proposed a guest worker
program that will solve probably about
90 percent, what our estimates are, of
the people who are coming across our
southwest border.
I think we are all in agreement that
the people coming across our south-
west border are not the rocket sci-
entists; they are not the engineers;
they are not the health professionals.
They are the people who are working in
the lower skills—agriculture, hospi-
tality, and construction—but yet they
are so needed in this country because,
without them, this country won’t
work. We can’t grow the fruits and
vegetables, and we can’t build the
buildings.
So what we have proposed is a guest
worker program. If you would picture a
banner, Madam Speaker, ‘‘Guest Work-
er Program.’’
And understand, it is not immigra-
tion reform, because ‘‘immigration,’’ if
we use that word up here, they part.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7825
September 19, 2019
This side blames the Republicans of
wanting to deport everybody. On my
side, we will say this side wants to give
everybody amnesty. Neither is true. So
they walk away and nothing gets done.
We have seen this year after year for 36
years.
So the banner bill will say, ‘‘Guest
Worker Program.’’ It will have three
silos: One will be agriculture, which is
the one I am heading; one will have
hospitality; and one will have con-
struction.
I will talk about the agriculture pro-
gram.
The way this works is it does three
things: It creates a prescreened pool
before people come into the country,
which is number one. Number two is it
addresses the people who are already
here illegally. Number three, it re-
forms the H–2A program, which is a
temporary seasonal program of 10
months, and it makes it stronger so it
serves our producers better, but it also
protects the migrant worker.
This is something that should not be
a partisan issue. This is something
that I have shared personally in this
Chamber with over 50 Members of the
House of Representatives in a bipar-
tisan way; I have shared it on the Sen-
ate side in a bipartisan way; and we
have shared it with outside industries
around the country. In fact, I am get-
ting calls from people from Wisconsin,
from Indiana, from Pennsylvania, and
from California who want this bill
passed.
Basically, what this does, briefly, is,
on the H–2A program, which is a tem-
porary worker visa program—for 10
months, it is supposed to be. The way
the program works now is somebody
will come in on an H–2A program for
temporary work. They will get a waiv-
er, and that waiver will be for 1 year.
Then they can get another waiver up to
3 years.
What we have seen is people just kind
of fade off the grid, and they wind up
being in America illegally. They may
have come in legally, but then they
transfer and become a person here ille-
gally. Then they live in the shadows,
and they are afraid to come out for fear
of deportation.
The other thing is they come in on
an H–2A visa currently, and they may
leave the agriculture permit that they
came in on and work construction and
get hired by construction. Or they may
go into another field, and so the permit
that allowed them to come in, they
don’t honor.
So with our program, we tighten up
the restrictions on H–2A. People come
in on a guest worker H–2A visa that
dedicates them to the sector of agri-
culture, and they are dedicated to be in
that sector because that is what they
have agreed to come in on. They can
stay up to 11 months is what we are
proposing, then they go back home,
and then they can come back.
The other thing we do is the
prescreening portion of this bill works
this way:
We will have a country-to-country
agreement between, say, the country of
Honduras and the United States. It is a
state-to-State Department agreement.
So, if a person from Honduras or any-
where in Central America wants to
come to the United States, they apply.
They must be a minimum of 18 years of
age. They have to apply individually. If
they are married and the spouse wants
to come in, that spouse applies, but
they have to be a minimum of 18, no
children.
They apply. That information from
the country they come from goes to
our State Department, and it would be
basically passport information: their
name, their address, age, and things
like that. Our DHS will take that in-
formation. They will do a background
check. Once they clear the background
check, that person who applied as an
applicant, they are permitted to come
into the country, but only after a job is
available.
When a person applies, they can
apply to a sector. Maybe it is dairy;
maybe it is fruits and vegetables; or
maybe it is a citrus program. Once
they get accepted into the country and
a job is available, they get issued what
we call a GWIC card, which is short for
‘‘guest worker identification card,’’
and it will look like any other kind of
identification. It will have smart card
or smart chip technology. It will have
the individual’s picture on it.
Once a person gets this card, they are
permitted to be in the country for a 5-
year period of time. For 5 years they
can stay in this country, and they can
renew 41⁄2 years into the program. After
that, they can continually do that, pro-
vided they stay a person of good stand-
ing in the Nation.
They can get a driver’s license num-
ber. It will be a guest worker driver’s
license number that has to be renewed
every 5 years. It will start off in the
State they get approved in and when
they pass the test. But that will allow
them to drive in the country legally.
It gives them a chance to come into
the country legally, whether they want
to be a temporary worker or a 5-year,
year-round worker.
We have a restriction in there that
they have to commit to work 75 per-
cent of the year in the agriculture sec-
tor, on the guest worker program for
agriculture. That person has taken on
the responsibility and commitment
that they will work in ag, and ag only.
On both programs with the H–2A or
the 5-year guest worker program, that
individual is automatically entered
into the E-Verify system. So when our
employers take somebody out of the
pool, they are automatically using E-
Verify.
That person, again, is free to travel
the country. If they come in, say they
want to do citrus in Florida, that sea-
son is over usually by mid-June. They
can go to North Carolina and work
with another crop, or maybe the State
of Washington or New York, and they
can stay indefinitely in the country for
that 5-year period of time. But they
must work a minimum 75 percent of
the year in the United States in agri-
culture.
If they choose to leave agriculture
and work in construction and they get
picked up or found out and they get
hired illegally by a contractor, what
happens is they have broken the terms
of their agreement, and they will be de-
ported for that.
That identification number will be a
15-digit identification number with the
initials ‘‘AG’’ at the end of it for agri-
culture. So that person, when they are
put into the E-Verify system, if they
are hired by an ag employer, those
have to jibe. If that person tries to go
to construction, then his number won’t
work in a construction entity.
If an employer tries to hire somebody
illegally who is permitted to work in
agriculture and they want to hire them
in construction, then they are subject
to a $2,500 fine per person per incident.
This is something that we hear over
and over again from our producers and
our contractors in the hospitality in-
dustry. They need a guest worker pro-
gram, and our goal for this was to cre-
ate a reliable, a predictable, and a cer-
tain workforce for the labor of this
country.
The second part of the 5-year pro-
gram is this: For the people who are in
the country illegally, they can apply to
this program. What we have done is we
have moved ag labor from the Depart-
ment of Labor to the USDA.
So for that group of people who are
in this country illegally, they can
apply to this program. The program
will be run by the United States De-
partment of Agriculture, and they will
run a program that says: For this time
period, if you are here illegally and you
want to apply to this program, then
you can apply with the understanding
that we are not looking to deport you.
We are looking to get you to a legal
status in this country for 5 years at a
time.
While that person is applying, he is
what we call the applicant. During that
process, they are protected from being
deported. Background checks will be
run.
We realize that some people are
going to have fender benders. They
may not have shown up for a court date
or didn’t return a library book. We un-
derstand that, and they will be given
due time to get right with the law and
clear up their past.
When they get accepted into the pro-
gram, they become a participant. Dur-
ing that time period as a participant,
they are here for 5 years at a time and
can renew 41⁄2 years into it. They get
the GWIC card, and they get the 15-
digit identification number that dedi-
cates them to work in the ag center.
They are not dedicated to a certain em-
ployer, and they can renew 41⁄2 years
into it.
If they came in illegally with a fam-
ily, their family is also protected dur-
ing that period of time when a back-
ground check is being done. Once that

is cleared up, that family is protected
for up to 5 years at a time. Again, when
they renew, that family is protected.
It is not a pathway to citizenship. If
somebody wants to become a citizen,
then they apply for citizenship just
like anybody else who wants to become
a citizen of our great Nation.
In this program, again, what we are
looking for is to create a reliable and
predictable workforce for our agri-
culture sector, and it gives the flexi-
bility of the individual to move around
the country to fulfill the needs that
migrant worker has.
We did a roundtable throughout the
State of Florida over the August re-
cess. We stopped at 10 different areas in
my State. Florida is a large agriculture
State. People think of it as beaches
and palm trees, but we are also the
number one producer of sweet corn in
the country, number one in water-
melons, number one in citrus in the
Nation, and we have over 300 specialty
crops. So we are very heavily depend-
ent on migrant labor.
As we traveled around our State, we
got a tremendous amount of feedback
from all the different sectors. We sat
down with the migrant help workforce.
I am a veterinarian by trade, and I
worked with horses and cattle. I have
been around agriculture since I was 15.
I have talked to the migrant. I have
talked to the people. I found out by
asking them: Did you come here le-
gally or illegally?
They would tell you because we had a
great relationship. They would say: I
came here illegally.
You can ask them: Do you want to
become a citizen?
Some do, some don’t. Most of them
just want the opportunity to come here
and work.
When we were in south Florida going
through talking to some of the pro-
ducers, they were saying people from
Honduras can come here and work a
season, maybe 5 months. The amount
of money they make in 5 months is
equivalent to 5 years in that nation.
I saw this as a way that we can fulfill
the needs of our producers and fulfill
the needs of food security for this Na-
tion but also fulfill the needs of that
worker who wants to come here for a
better life, and they have the oppor-
tunity to become a citizen if they go
through the normal channels.
The other thing this does, and I
didn’t mention this, is there is a $2,500
fee for that 5-year permit, which
breaks down to $500 a year.
For the person who came in illegally,
the first time they apply and get ac-
cepted into this program and become a
participant, there will be the $2,500 fee
for the permit, but there will also be a
$2,500 fine because they have agreed
that they have broken the law coming
in. That puts that argument to rest of,
well, they broke our law. These people
realize that. They acknowledge it.
They paid the fine, and we can move
forward.
I thought it was interesting, when we
went down and did our tour around the
State, that the producers said: You
know, it comes down to this. This Na-
tion will either import their food, or
they are going to import their labor.
This is a national security issue. I
look at these workers—I have worked
with so many of these people over the
course of the years, over the last 30
years, and they are great people. My
heart goes out to them because I know
they want a better future. I know they
want to live an American Dream—
maybe not in this country, but maybe
the Honduran dream. If a person can
work 5 months here and have the
equivalent of 5 years’ pay in their
home country, it can change lives, and
it will develop an economy down there.
So what I ask our Members of Con-
gress to do is get this information.
They can go to our website,
yoho.house.gov. They can go to the leg-
islation tab and click on that. That
will have a drop-down screen, and there
will be the ag guest worker program.
We have two short videos on that that
explain this program. We have a 10-
page white paper that explains this
program. We have a bill that is already
written—it is right at 110 pages—that
we look to introduce.
This is not a solution to immigra-
tion. It is a solution to the workforce
challenges we have in this Nation in
agriculture, hospitality, and construc-
tion.
By doing this and coming to agree-
ment on border security and enforcing
the laws already on the books and by
giving people a legal portal to come
into this country legally—they are
prescreened before they come in—and
by allowing people who are in this
country illegally to become legal, we
have solved a big crisis that this body
has been unable to fulfill, and we honor
the American people. It causes more
division in this Nation, more division
in this House, and it just grinds the
wheels of progress for this Nation to an
end.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

OUR GREATEST ECONOMIC
THREAT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker,
don’t you love that, when we take a
few minutes getting organized because
sometimes we walk around with so
many moving parts?
This is sort of the continuing con-
versation that we have been doing on a
theme for well over a year now, in the
last Congress and now into this one. It
is a combination of a couple things:
One, our office works very hard on
actually looking at solutions, but first
you have got to understand some of the
problems. And I want to say this very
nicely—and maybe in the next couple
weeks we will come back and do it
again, we have already done it a half a
dozen times here on the floor—and that
is: The miracles of technology are
about to do amazing things in environ-
mental protection.
So to our brothers and sisters on the
left who were sharing their heartfelt
concerns over global warming and
greenhouse gases, well, what is so dis-
appointing is the lack of optimism in
the incredible technology break-
throughs that have happened.
Think of this: Outside Houston, they
are burning coal, they are burning nat-
ural gas. And there is no smokestack.
They are capturing every bit of this
ACO2.
There is just a litany of these types
of technologies that—sort of the old
Malthusian view of the way you save
the planet is we live much poorer.
Well, that has been wrong now for
centuries.
And once again, we are going to
prove that the 1968 book, The Popu-
lation Bomb, which predicted that the
world was going to starve by the late
1970s has been wrong over and over and
over.
We, as policymakers, have an obliga-
tion to make sure we are moving those
technologies forward, just like the
Ways and Means Committee last year
actually updated the tax credit for car-
bon sequestration. And if you follow
the literature, there are amazing
things that have happened just in that
1 year with that technology and now
efficient, good things are happening.
But that is not my reason for being
behind this microphone tonight. We are
going to continue the theme and I will
fulfill my obligation from last week
when I said I would bring in the new
revenue numbers for the first 11
months of the year on what is actually
happening in the economy; what is the
greatest threat to our future.
Let’s start with the threat and then
let’s talk a little bit about the good
things and the solutions.
Almost every Member at some point
has walked behind these microphones
and shown this slide. But this is so im-
portant to understand what the actual
conversation is that drives almost
every policy on this floor. It is called
demographics. It is the reality of the
math.
You see this red? That is 1965. I ac-
cept that is—what?—55 years ago. But
34 percent of the government spending
was what we called mandatory, earned
and unearned benefits. Social Security,
you earn it. Medicare—this is prior to
Medicare—but you earn those things.
Today, it is no longer 34 percent of
our spending. Today, it has actually
crossed over 70 percent of our spending
we don’t even vote for on this floor.
It is a formula:
You turn a certain age, you get a
benefit.
You fall under a certain income, you
get a benefit.
You are part of a certain group, you
get a benefit.

September 19, 2019
The blue, 15 percent of our spending,
that is defense. The green here, 15 per-
cent is what we call the other part of
discretionary. And that is what we sit
here and debate. And that number is
going to continue to shrink because we
have 74 million of our brothers and sis-
ters who are baby boomers who are
moving into retirement.
Madam Speaker, 10,300 Americans
every single day turn 65. It is not Re-
publican or Democrat. It is math.
But as I have joked many times—
even though it is a little bit of a dark
humor—welcome to a math-free zone.
So let’s actually continue to talk
about what is the greatest threat to
our society and also the fact that we
have some amazing opportunities to
actually deal with it.
Here is the math. Take a look at the
chart behind me.
If I could sit in front of you and say
the next 30 years—we are going to re-
move Social Security, we are going to
remove Medicare from the conversa-
tion—your government, your Federal
Government has, $23 trillion in the
bank. But if we roll Social Security
and Medicare back into the math, we
are $103 trillion upside down—$103 tril-
lion negative—so we are a couple 100
percent of GDP. And that is the 30-year
window.
Because remember the math, every 5
years, just the growth in Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, and healthcare entitle-
ments, just the growth, equal the De-
fense Department—every 5 years. So
every 10 years it is as if we added two
Defense Departments, just the growth
of Social Security and Medicare.
Is that Republican or Democrat? It is
demographics. Somehow, this place
completely forgot there was a baby
boom 50 years ago-plus—60 years ago
over an 18-year period of time, and we
have 74 million of us who are baby
boomers moving into our earned retire-
ment and we have not set aside a frac-
tion of the resources necessary.
So this is the great fragility for my
little soon to be 4-year-old little girl.
This is a threat to her economic life,
her economic future. But I will argue
the future of our country, and actually
the economic vitality of the entire
world, because when the United States
runs into crushing headwinds, the rest
of the world also suffers.
And once again, look at the chart.
The reality of it is—Social Security is
huge—but it is an easier fix. It is Medi-
care. Medicare is what our great fra-
gility is.
So let’s actually talk about some of
the positives because—and it is my
very last slide that we typically start
with.
We come here and talk about, hey,
there is sort of five pillars, economic
expansion, Tax Code, trade, regulatory
that you do those policies to maximize
economic growth, incentives to join
the labor force.
As you know, we still have a math
problem. Millennial men into the labor
force—even though the August num-
bers were stunning—now we have bro-
ken over—what is it?—63.2 percent
labor force participation. I know that
is geeky, but when tax reform was
done, the modelers all said, Well, we
are fearful that capital stock and labor
will be the headwinds that keep us
from being able to grow.
Well, it turns out, that thing they
call capital stock has worked in our
favor. It is working great. The amount
of resources coming back in—we call
repatriation, that was part of the Tax
Code—have exceeded the models.
Americans saving have exceeded the
models, and now that we are, in many
ways, still the healthiest economy in
the world, the amount of resources
that are flowing into our economy
from around the world have exceeded
what any one modeled. Capital stock is
in great shape. Look at our interest
rates.
It turns out labor is our fragility.
But think about this: If I had come to
people in this room, Republicans,
Democrats, and said, Hey, 3 years ago—
we are having this conversation 3 years
ago—you are going to live in a country
in 2019 with substantially more jobs
than available workers, that in the
last—like we saw in the August data,
in the last 3 months for—we will call it
our brothers and sisters—and I hate
this term, but there is not a better way
to talk about it—who are in some of
the lower income quartiles, they will
be having wages growing faster than 4
percent. You would have thought I was
out of my mind. Yet, it is happening.
You would think there would be just
joy from our friends on the left and a
little more talking about how wonder-
ful that economic growth being moral,
because it helps so many of our broth-
ers and sisters who have had some real-
ly rough decades.
The math is still early, and it is
going to be hard to do, but there are a
couple modelers out there that I had
these conversations with that are say-
ing this may be the year, that because
of income growth in those—our broth-
ers and sisters who didn’t finish high
school, who had those types of equiva-
lent of moderate-to-lower-skilled jobs,
but their wages are growing so fast,
this may be the first year where in-
come inequality actually shrinks a bit.
And our friends on the left say that is
one of the biggest moral imperatives in
their vision. Guess what? Something
we are doing is working in the econ-
omy.
Look at our brothers and sisters, the
Hispanic population, African American
population, handicap population—all
these different subcategories we do to
do our U6 math—either at or bypassing
some of the best employment numbers
in modern history.
You would think there would almost
be joy. And you would think actually
the debates around here would be, how
do we keep it going? Instead of who we
intend to punish next.
So part of the amusement I have had
so far this year, particularly—and it is
sometimes hard, but never do it, come
up here behind the microphone, and we
have this whole binder of some of the
crazy things that were said a couple
years ago when we were doing tax re-
form: Revenues are going to collapse.
The economy is going to be thrown
into a recession; all of this sort of
darkness. And it was wrong.
So think about this: The chart be-
hind me is the yellow—I think that is
yellow—is the, what we call receipts
for the first 11 months of this fiscal
year.
Remember, your Federal Govern-
ment’s fiscal year begins October 1.
The blue is 18; the green is 17. Receipts
for the first 11 months of 2019 in hard
dollars, in inflation-adjusted dollars,
are the largest revenue receipts in U.S.
history. And I was doing the math off
the top of my head. I need to grab it
and sit in front of a calculator, but off
the top of my head, I believe that is a
4 percent growth rate in revenues. Yet,
the argument around here is the tax
cuts are these horrible—and they are
going to crack—they are wrong. And
the math is here.
Do you think we are going to get an
apology? That number is also—if I in-
flation-adjust it so I do constant dol-
lars over the last few decades, it is the
second-highest revenue in U.S. history.
And think about what is happening
in our economy. How many of our
brothers and sisters are working? How
many of our brothers and sisters are
seeing the value of their homes, the
value of their paychecks—the best they
have been in decades.
I don’t know how we come here to
the floor, we claim we care about work-
ing men and women in the country,
and then don’t take joy in the fact that
the math is actually stunningly posi-
tive, and how we don’t engage in a de-
bate and discussion on how we keep it
going.
But politics, as you know, in D.C.,
have become absolutely perverse,
where the weaponization of every-
thing—the rage is now a business plan
of certain media outlets to, God forbid,
you say something positive about the
economy, because you will lose
viewership. But the math is the math.
So let’s even take it a bit farther: Be-
cause we live in a society that is so
honest about what is actually hap-
pening in the economy, you all saw in-
dustrial production numbers a couple
days ago. I know I am geeking out a
bit, but, remember, wasn’t it on this
very floor just a couple months ago we
were all talking—well, one side was
talking about we are going into reces-
sion, things are crashing, you know,
the sugar high is over. Except for the
fact that industrial production last
month had a .6, which is a nice, big
spike and revision of previous months.
It is working. The United States is
working. Our economy is working, and
compare it to the rest of the world.
Where is the joy? Where is the excite-
ment?
If you say you care about people,
these are people not only working, but

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

why do we fixate on industrial produc-
tion? What are the two factors that
allow a business concern to pay their
workers more? Well, it is traditionally
inflation, which doesn’t mean a bigger
paycheck buys you anything more. It
is productivity.
When productivity goes up, people
get paid more. And the purchasing
power is more. Industrial production is
linked to productivity. It means this is
part of the reason our brothers and sis-
ters out there, who are out there work-
ing their hearts out, are getting paid
more, and their purchasing power is
better.
I know this is geeky. I know I come
behind this microphone and sometimes
sound like an accountant on steroids,
but these things are important because
it is real. It is not some emotional
blaring of, you know, we hate this per-
son, we like this person.
We made the math work. And we are
seeing the results of good things for
hardworking Americans. Growth is
moral.
And where I want to take that is my
experience in Phoenix of visiting the
homeless campus, and St. Joseph the
Worker there having jobs because we
are so desperate for workers in our
market that employers are trying to
recruit workers from the homeless
campus.
b 1930
And we actually brought someone
last year to testify in front of the Ways
and Means Committee. We are so des-
perate for carpenters and plumbers and
electricians, they brought a young man
to come testify in front of the Ways
and Means Committee who wasn’t like
our typical witness. He wasn’t wearing
a suit. He had a number of facial tat-
toos. As a matter of fact, he had a
number of facial piercings.
He opened up his testimony to the
Ways and Means Committee saying: I
am a three-time convicted felon. I am
an addict.
But because of a private group that
was so desperate for workers, they
took a chance. They were doing train-
ing—in his case, electrical training—in
the prison before he got probation, and
they guaranteed him a job when he got
out. It didn’t mean they were going to
keep him.
He had Republicans and Democrats
and everyone in the room, as well as
the staff, crying because he told the
story: I am a three-time convicted
felon.
He was an addict, and he was saying
he had not touched drugs or alcohol for
a year. He gets to see his family again.
He gets to see his child again. And he
is now up to $22 an hour, and he is so
busy working that he hasn’t had the
chance to relapse.
It is stories like that that need to be
part of our lexicon. It is part of the joy
that economic growth is moral because
it helps and solves so many problems,
and particularly in our earlier slides
where I had this absolute fixation on
retirement security and our discussion
of growing the economy and labor force
participation and technology and in-
centives, bringing that package all to-
gether so we keep our promises around
Social Security and Medicare.
But we have the first pillar that we
are living in right now, and that is a
proof that policy—policy—can work,
whether it be the tax policy we did a
couple of years ago or whether it be
some of the regulatory changes we
have embraced.
Madam Speaker, could you imagine
if we could actually get that extra half
a point of GDP growth by finishing the
NAFTA replacement, the USMCA?
How many of our brothers and sisters
in this place will drop their politics or
their terror of giving this White House
a victory and actually do what is good
for the workers in this country—actu-
ally, the workers for all of North
America, because, as supply chains are
moving away from China, wouldn’t we
like to have them here in our hemi-
sphere? Or do politics blind people to
the point that basic economics in math
and opportunity don’t count?
So, back to one of the other things,
and I put up this slide. Partially, it is
one of my Democrat friends here who
brought this to my attention, because
we have been working on this concept
that there is a disruptive revolution
coming in healthcare.
We have done the presentations here
on the floor many times of the thing
you can blow into and it instantly tells
you you have the flu, and the algo-
rithm, if we could just legalize it, could
actually order your antivirals, except
for the fact that that technology is il-
legal under current law.
But, also, the concept of, in just a
few months, there is going to be a drug
that cures hemophilia. It is going to be
really expensive, but, for our brothers
and sisters who have one of the most
expensive diseases in our society, they
are cured.
So what would happen to those num-
bers I was showing you on Medicare if
I came to you and said: Hey, there is
one disease group that is 30 percent of
Medicare spending in the model for the
next three decades? It turns out it is
diabetes.
It is one of the reasons this body has
been investing in things like the Cures
Act and other miracles that are now
happening in what we call synthetic bi-
ology, in the new types of biological
drugs—you have all seen the stories,
and it is still a bit of optimism—that
we may be able to start growing pan-
creatic cells again.
Could you imagine if we cured just
diabetes? It is not only the noble thing
of curing a disease that is part of our
chronic population; we often don’t
think about what is the economic cas-
cade that it has to, actually, retire-
ment security.
It turns out, if 30 percent of Medicare
future costs are just somehow related
to first-degree or second-degree or
third-degree effects of diabetes, it is
part of the reason so many of us in this
body have worked so hard to say: Put
the money in. Let’s invest in the dis-
ruptions.
Because I do believe, if we could buy
a calculator for our Members here and
help them understand the technology
disruptions that are going to make the
environment and healthcare and so
many other things just amazing—and,
then, if we could legalize many of the
technologies that, oddly enough, are il-
legal under our reimbursements and
under our rules today, there are some
really amazing things.
These next few decades could be just
amazing, particularly for my little 4-
year-old girl. But these amazing things
don’t happen when everything is polit-
ical and everything is weaponized and,
if it is not a melodrama, we don’t do it.
So we typically start with this, but I
am going to close with it this time.
We have been trying to help our
brothers and sisters in here under-
stand, the old discussions of, well, we
can do this little bit of entitlement re-
form or raise taxes over here or do this
and that fixes the fragility that is the
future of, particularly, Medicare, but
those days are over. We lost that math-
ematical opportunity a decade and a
half ago.
But there is a way to survive the debt
bomb that is coming at us if we do the
things that are necessary for economic
expansion, do the things that are nec-
essary to encourage our brothers and
sisters to be in the labor force, actually
embrace the disruptive technologies in-
stead of being fearful of them and being
fearful of sort of telling many of our
incumbent business models that they
are going to have to adopt.
And we are going to have to tell the
truth that, within the benefits, we need
incentives for you to think about, if
you are healthy and can do it, staying
in the labor force.
And the other thing is we are going
to have to actually talk about, just as
Mr. YOHO before me, things we do in
immigration and population stability,
of an immigration system that maxi-
mizes economic vitality, sort of the
talent-based system the President
talks about.
But, even in a country where our
birthrates have collapsed, how we en-
courage family formation, if you mix
all these things together and with a
couple good lucks, like with the tech-
nology we are talking about that cures
diabetes, we can make the math work
that the $103 trillion of debt that we
expect over the next 30 years, substan-
tially because of our demographics,
does not have to destroy this country,
because we can cut that in half. If we
do that, we have some amazing decades
ahead of us.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker,
prior to discussing the current state of
immigration law, I would like to yield
some time to my good friend and col-
league, Congressman DUFFY, who I
think is going to address some impor-
tant issues of Congress tonight.
I hope everybody pays attention be-
cause I think, other than perhaps lec-
turing us on logging and fishing and
hunting, this will be his last official
speech as a Congressman for a few
years.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY),
my colleague.
FINAL ADDRESS TO CONGRESS
Mr. DUFFY. Madam Speaker, I
thank my good friend from Wisconsin
for yielding tonight.
Madam Speaker, I have got to tell
you, it is a pretty unique and cool feel-
ing to stand in this well and hold onto
this podium for the last time. What an
honor it is to serve in this House and
stand in this Chamber.
I want to take a moment, as I give
my last address to the House, to thank
my constituents who have put so much
faith in me that they would give me
the opportunity—a guy from small
town Wisconsin, from Hayward, Wis-
consin, who had a big family and grew
up doing lumberjack sports—to come
here and represent them. And they
have done that five times, five times
over.
I would just note that they have been
so kind to me, whether they agreed
with me or not. Whether I was at a
townhall or a Lincoln Day dinner or a
dairy breakfast or a parade or affair,
the kindness that has come from my
constituents as I have done my best to
serve their interests could not fill my
heart with greater pride and joy to rep-
resent the good people of Wisconsin’s
Seventh Congressional District, which
is the central, northern, and western
part of our great State.
But, as many of us will tell you, I
don’t think our Founders ever envi-
sioned that to come to this Chamber
should be a lifetime sentence. We are
supposed to come, be citizen legisla-
tors, serve our time, and then step
aside and let someone else step forward
and do the good work.
And, in news reports, as I have an-
nounced that I was going to step aside,
people will say, ‘‘SEAN DUFFY’s seat.’’
Well, I think we should correct that. It
is not my seat. It was not my prede-
cessor’s seat. It is the people’s seat,
and they get to choose every 2 years—
well, now, this is going to be 8 months
in—a new Congressman to represent
them. It is the people’s seat. It is not
mine. It is theirs. So, I thank the Sev-
enth District.
I want to say thanks to my fellow
colleagues and Members of Congress on
both sides of the aisle. We get a bad rap
in this Chamber where people will tell
us: You guys are so dysfunctional. You
guys can’t get along. You guys can’t
get anything done.
There is some truth to that. There is
a lot of bickering; there is a lot of
fighting; and, yes, sometimes we don’t
get a lot done. But I will just tell you
this, that people get along a lot better
across the aisle than might meet the
eye on some of the major news net-
works.
Though it might not be on tax reform
or immigration reform, there is a lot of
legislation that we work on together,
on which we try to find bipartisan com-
promise that can not just pass our
committees, but can pass the House
and can get our dysfunctional friends
in the Senate to actually pick up and
pass so we can get it to the President’s
desk. It happens a lot.
The Chamber, I think, though it is
going through some difficult times, we
are actually working, and I am proud
of that.
I am proud to serve with my ranking
member, PATRICK MCHENRY, who has
been so kind and generous to me. I
have actually enjoyed serving with
MAXINE WATERS.
Some of the subcommittee chairs and
ranking members like AL GREEN and
LACY CLAY and EMANUEL CLEAVER have
become good friends of mine, and I
honor their friendship and am grateful
for it. But sometimes, oftentimes, we
work better than we are given credit
for.
I want to take a second, because I
think this is such an important part of
the debate that we are having today,
and talk about American capitalism. I
mean, American capitalism is the
American model. It has been our Amer-
ican way that has brought us more op-
portunity, more prosperity, more up-
ward mobility, more innovation, more
creativity, more generosity than any
other country that has existed on the
face of the Earth.
Part of that American capitalist sys-
tem is an idea not that we have no gov-
ernment, but that we have limited gov-
ernment, and not that we have no
taxes, but we have limited taxes. What
you saw over 2 years of a Republican-
led majority in the House and the Sen-
ate with a Republican President is we
did those things. And the net end re-
sult was what we thought it would be:
We put people back to work.
When I ran the first time 9 years ago,
we had people who couldn’t find jobs,
families who were suffering. I heard, all
the time, families say: I wish we had a
better economy, because I want my
kids to be able to stay in our home-
town and get a job in our hometown
and raise their family in our hometown
so we can have an extended family, but
they have to leave. They have to go to
Milwaukee or Minneapolis or Chicago
or Wausau or somewhere else to get a
job, but they can’t stay here.
b 1945
But today, after we have imple-
mented these reforms, it is profound
what is happening. People are going
back to work. In Wisconsin, our wages
are up, and unemployment is down. We
have more jobs in Wisconsin than we
have people to fill those jobs. That is a
success story of American capitalism. I
am proud of that.
Though everybody may not agree
that it has been those policies that
have created it—some of those are on
the left—when they dig deep in their
heart, they can’t deny that what we
have done has made their lives better.
And so often we have, in my district,
it has been the forgotten men and
women, men and women who feel like
people come to this Chamber, to this
town, and they engage in debates that
are irrelevant; debates that don’t make
their lives better; debates that don’t
improve their economy. Maybe it is a
debate that might improve the coasts
or global corporations, but it is a de-
bate that doesn’t help their rural,
small-town community.
They have seen, over the last few
years, that their voices have been
heard; their pain has been heard, and it
has been addressed. And for that, they
are incredibly grateful.
When you shop at Walmart and you
have a hard time figuring out where
you are going to get the dollars to pay
your mortgage, or how you are going to
send your kids to school, and if you
lose your job, then it all collapses; and
in today’s market, they look and go,
This is really great. This has improved
so much. We couldn’t be more grateful
for the economy and the system that
has offered this prosperity that we now
feel.
I am troubled that, even though we
have had the success of a free enter-
prise system, an American capitalist
system, we now have a debate in this
Chamber where people want to go a dif-
ferent model, right?
We have a debate saying we want to
go to socialism. Socialism should be
the model of America’s future; and
that the promise of socialism, where
we can all be equal, and we can all get
free stuff, if we can just tax the rich a
little bit more and give a little bit
more to you, it is going to be a beau-
tiful economy.
Those promises have been made
throughout human history, and those
promises always fail. Whether you
want to go to the old Soviet Union,
whether you want to go to Venezuela,
or Cuba, it never works.
This country actually fought social-
ism in Europe. We fought socialism in
our universities. Now we are fighting
socialism in the halls of Congress?
We can’t lose this fight, because if we
lose this fight, we lose our future. And
if you lose the future, you don’t leave
enough to your kids.
So I hope that this Chamber will re-
calibrate and think through what the
best economic model is to continue
with that prosperity, continue with
that opportunity for our kids and for
our next generation.
But as we talk about maybe equality
and opportunity, I do think there is a
really important point: As the socialist
talks about the equality of the out-
come, I think our model has been the
equality of opportunity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7830 September 19, 2019
When I look at communities in
America, and communities in Wis-
consin, and you can look at a zip code
of that community, and you will be
able to recognize the opportunity and
the poverty of the kids that are being
raised in those communities, by their
zip code, because of the school system
they have in place in those commu-
nities in those zip codes.
That is a travesty. That is not equal
opportunity. That has given a group of
kids the short end of the stick.
So, as I have been in this Chamber, I
have fought for school choice. Because
if you are a parent and you have a
child and you have a failing school, you
should have the opportunity to get out
of your failing school and go to a
school that is going to give you the
skill sets and the tools to take advan-
tage of the American economy. You
should have that right. You should
have that option. And that is school
choice.
I would love it if we could make the
schools better in these communities,
and we should fight to do that. But
these kids can’t wait. So I hope the
fight for school choice continues.
I have fought in this Chamber for
free trade, but I have also fought with
our President for fair trade. And when
we have people who take advantage of
this economy, of my constituents, and
say it is free trade, well, free trade
isn’t free trade if it is not fair trade.
And I couldn’t support the President
more in his fight against China to
make sure that we have a fair system
with their growing economy. And it is
not easy.
I look in this Chamber. Oftentimes
there is not a lot of political courage,
but you have a President who, one of
the greatest things he has going for
him is the great economy; and he is
willing to jeopardize this great econ-
omy, to risk the great economy and en-
gage in a trade conflict with China, not
to help him in the next election, but to
help American kids in the next 10, 15,
20 years.
That is what real leaders do. That is
what courage is in a leader, and that is
what our President has done on this
trade fight; risking the economy for
the kids and our future, to make sure
we are still the number one economy
and the number one military.
One of the great issues I am proud to
have fought on is the issue of life. I
don’t think that there is anyone who is
more vulnerable, more voiceless than
the unborn; and to have been in this
Chamber, and to have been able to lend
my voice to those who don’t have one
has been an amazing honor.
I think that this will be a scourge at
this time period in American history,
and we have had these time periods in
our past, that we haven’t stood up and
fought what science tells us, as you
look at a 4D ultrasound, what that
baby is in the womb.
I am on the right side of history to
have fought for the millions of little
babies who have lost their lives over
the course of the last 40-plus years.
And I hope this Chamber one day can
see that life does begin at conception;
that we shouldn’t be having a debate
about late-term, partial-birth abortion.
We shouldn’t be having a debate about
how we allowed children to die more
comfortably after they are born; that
that is outrageous. It is, frankly dis-
gusting. We should get that right.
As I close my final remarks from this
well, I want to thank my team.
Any Member of Congress, anyone
who serves in this institution can’t do
it without great people with them,
great people surrounding them, fight-
ing—not with them personally, but
fighting on the issues with them. It
doesn’t work without them.
Over the course of the last 81⁄2 years,
I have had the most remarkable team
to serve with me and work with me.
And though they have worked for me,
they are some of my best friends who
have stood with me, and I couldn’t be
more grateful that they have come into
my life and come into my district and
our community; and not just fought so
hard with me, but fought so hard for
the people that I represent to make
sure their issues are covered, to make
sure that their voices were heard.
They helped me amplify my constitu-
ents’ voices, and I want to thank Pete
and the D.C. team, specifically, and
Jesse and the district team for their
endless efforts. My constituents were
well served by them, so thank you.
Finally, I want to thank my family.
When I started, I didn’t have as many
kids. Actually, I had Patrick and Mar-
garita and Mari V and Paloma, who
didn’t know their father at any point
other than as a Congressman. But some
of my older kids were well aware of
what we did before.
My oldest daughter, Evita, we did our
first parade together, and I was terri-
fied. I was terrified to do a parade, and
this little 9-year old girl came out with
me with the most courage.
All of them have stood with me and
worked with me and campaigned with
me. It has been a family endeavor.
Anyone who runs, they know the sac-
rifice that their families go through.
My family has been great, going to pa-
rades, and going—in Wisconsin we do
dairy breakfasts—going to dairy break-
fasts. And they have been there sup-
porting me and working with me, and I
couldn’t be more grateful for them.
As their dad comes out to Congress 4
days a week, I am not there as much,
and they have supported me through
this whole effort, this whole adventure.
A dad can’t do that unless he has kids
who support him. So, to all of them,
from Lucia, to Evita, to Patrick, and
John Paul, and Margarita, and Mari V,
and Paloma, and Jack, I want to thank
you all for the support you have given
me.
Finally, I want to thank my wife, I
would not be here without her. When I
ran, everyone said I could never make
it to this Chamber. I could never win.
And she was the one who said, No, I
think you can. I think you can rep-
resent these people, your people well.
And we did it together.
When I am here, as every spouse who
has someone who comes here, she was
the one who held up our house. She was
a single mom, and we have 8 kids. She
was a single mom with 8 kids. And you
have to be incredibly dedicated and de-
voted and passionate about what we do
in this Chamber if you are going to be
a single mom with 8 kids and let your
husband go off and fight the great fight
of the day.
So I want to tell her how much I love
her and how grateful I am that she has
supported my dream to come here and
fight the good fight.
When I won on my first night, on
election night, I said that the battle
for America’s future is a fight against
socialism. It is a battle to return our
Nation to the principles that made
America different, that made America
better, that made America great. I
think that couldn’t be more true
today.
And with me and Rachel, and my
team, and my kids, I couldn’t be more
grateful that they have stood with me
to help engage in that fight.
So for the final time, as I step out of
this well with a grateful, and it might
not be obvious, but a happy heart, I
want to thank my colleagues for their
friendship.
I want to thank the great State of
Wisconsin for their trust.
I want to thank my whole family for
their support. I want to thank God for
his blessings, and for this opportunity
and for the wisdom to know when my
time is up.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker,
Congress, last week, got back from
their time in district in August, and
quite a bit happened on the immigra-
tion front since then; some good news,
some bad news, but it is important to
address what Congress has yet to do.
I do want to point out the good news.
So far this year, we have built or
rehabbed 66 miles of the wall on the
southern border, and we are on track to
do another 390 miles by the end of 2020.
When that is done, we will have built
700 miles along the 2,000-mile border.
Some more will probably have to be
done at that time, but we are, at last,
doing this.
The other good news is that it is a
tremendous wall. That wall is going to
be 30 feet high and 6 feet under the
ground. I have been down there looking
at parts of that wall. There are things
that we have done on top of the wall
that will make it still more difficult to
get over.
I am told that, so far, four people
have tried to get across the wall and
all have failed.
For those people who thought a wall
does not work, I suggest that they look
at that wall that is currently being
built.
I will point out; the USA will not be
the first country to have success with a
wall. Israel along the Egyptian border

has a wall. India along the Bangladesh
border has a wall; a wall, quite frankly,
a lot—a border a lot longer than the
America/Mexican border; and Hungary
has a considerable border wall with
Serbia.
b 2000
All those other walls are effective. I
am glad the United States is finally
getting going on the wall.
The next thing I will count as good
news on the immigration front is that
I was able to attend a ceremony in
which legal immigrants were being
sworn in, in Milwaukee. Every month
in a city as small as Milwaukee, about
400 new citizens are being sworn in.
Neither Donald Trump nor virtually
any Republican who I am aware of
wants to stop those 400 new citizens
coming here each month.
It is very exhilarating to talk to
them. So many of them have already
founded their own businesses. Obvi-
ously, the rest already have jobs and
have spent a considerable amount of
time working in this country and are
very proud to renounce the citizenship
of their native land and become Amer-
ican citizens.
Overall, we swear in 700,000 new citi-
zens a year and have 4 million people
on work visas. But there is other news
that probably can be considered not
quite as good. We had 64,000 people
cross the border in August. That is
down from 144,000 in May, but it is still
20,000 more than it was last year.
When we talk about 64,000 people
being processed into this country or
processed at the border, we don’t in-
clude other people who haven’t even
been caught, and those are the most
dangerous people of all.
Many of the people being processed
on the border feel that they will be
able to come to this country through
an asylum process legally. When people
are not checking themselves in at the
border, it means they feel they have to
sneak through the border and probably
have something to hide.
While the Border Patrol doesn’t
know exactly how many people they
are not processing, they are guessing it
is over 10,000 people a month. That is
certainly something that has to be ad-
dressed.
The next thing to talk about, as far
as people coming across the border, is
why it is higher than it was a year ago,
and why is that still higher than it was
20 or 30 years ago?
Some people think the reason so
many people try to come across our
border is that things are worse in other
countries. That is not so. There were
times in the relatively recent past in
which we had outright civil wars in
Central America. People did not come
to the United States even though there
were civil wars in their home country
because they felt they couldn’t. They
felt the United States would enforce its
current immigration laws.
The reason we had so many more
people try to get in here in the past
year is because the word was out in
other countries. The word was out
among the cartels that escort so many
people to this country that the United
States was not enforcing its immigra-
tion laws.
I was at the border again at the end
of July, and it was interesting to hear
from the Border Patrol that at the
time Donald Trump was first elected,
they were almost bored at the border.
There was nobody trying to come in
here. Why was that? Because Donald
Trump ran on immigration reform and
immigration stability, and they felt
they wouldn’t have a chance to come
to the United States.
The reason we had 64,000 people
checked in at the border, plus who
knows how many sneaking across, in
August is the word is still out in other
countries that the United States is not
enforcing its laws.
The question is, what can we do to
stop the floodgates of 60,000 people still
coming here?
First of all, we need more personnel.
As we have had a flood of more people
coming on the border, the Border Pa-
trol has to spend their time on paper-
work, and the Border Patrol has to
spend its time babysitting children,
not guarding the border. These new
employees are less costly than the Bor-
der Patrol.
I respect the Border Patrol so much
after being down there three times.
Can you imagine, in the middle of the
night, maybe finding 50 people and hav-
ing to, in essence, arrest them yourself
and escort them back to the border?
We could use some personnel to do—
I don’t know what I can refer to it as—
the babysitting part of the job, the pa-
perwork part of the job, to free up the
Border Patrol so they can enforce the
border.
Secondly, this Congress that is so
quick to spend money on anything can
give us more technology at the points
of entry, and I would also add more
dogs at the point of entry, which do
such a great job of identifying people
trying to sneak across.
Another thing that Congress should
do is get rid of birthright citizenship.
When I was at the El Paso sector and
saw people waiting to come in, it was
obvious there were a disproportionate
number of pregnant women coming
into this country, which is what we
have heard. People 6, 7 months preg-
nant, whether they fly in from Asia or
cross the southern border, they come
here because the United States is one
of only two of the, I believe, the 40th
wealthiest countries in the world to
have birthright citizenship.
Donald Trump had promised to get
rid of that when he first ran for elec-
tion, and I hope that is something he
follows up on.
Another problem we have is that,
right now, families are still allowed in
the United States under the Flores set-
tlement after they are here for maybe
20 days. If they were here for 60 days,
they wouldn’t be able to sneak in this
country and disappear into kind of the
ether, but they would be able to stay
here until they have their court hear-
ing. It is so important for this Congress
to pass a law saying that you can keep
these families at the border or not let
them in the United States for at least
60 days pending their court hearing.
While I talk about families at the
border, I want to make some other ob-
servations that the Border Patrol gave
me. First of all, it frustrates them that
people coming here get such better
healthcare than people who are already
here in America. The vast majority of
us have some sort of large deductible.
They have copays. People coming from
other countries when they come to the
border are given whatever they want
for anything wrong. I can understand
that we don’t want anything bad to
happen to people, but it is an induce-
ment for more people to sneak in here
as long as we give away free medical
care.
The next thing that we need is the
ability to return children to their par-
ents. Under current law, we can return
unaccompanied children to their par-
ents in Canada and Mexico. We cannot
do that to Central American countries.
The Central American countries are
frustrated that we are taking their
youth and bringing them to the United
States.
These bills are available to be
brought to the floor. It is time that
Congress act and say we are not going
to tear apart families. If we catch a 15-
year-old coming into this country from
Honduras, we should be able to return
them to their parents in Honduras. We
shouldn’t, as under current law, be re-
quired to keep them in this country. It
is kind of the ugly America at its worst
that we tear apart families and take
young children who have fled their par-
ents.
The next thing that we have to do is
we have to raise the standard of cred-
ible fear. We cannot continue to have
people come into this country some-
times without the strongest evidence
that they are genuinely in fear of what
is going on in their country, particu-
larly because, right now, immigration
attorneys assist people in allowing
them to come into our country.
We need more money for ICE to re-
move illegal immigrants, particularly
illegal immigrants who are criminals.
Donald Trump must be allowed to con-
tinue on his plan of not letting people
in this country if they are probably
going to wind up on public assistance
or welfare. That would be a disaster for
their country.
If we do these things, I think we can
finally secure our border.
Again, Donald Trump has done a lot
on his own. He has reassigned money
that was originally going to the De-
partment of Defense. He has tried to
change the way we deal with asylum.
Congress has to step up with President
Trump and do something: hire more
personnel at the border; get more tech-
nology at the border; get rid of the

S5583
Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2019 No. 151
Senate
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Savior of humanity, Your unfailing
love sustains us. Stagger freedom’s en-
emies and bring them to their knees.
Use our lawmakers so effectively that
our citizens may rejoice because of
Your mercy.
Lord, be for our Nation a towering
rock of safety, a shelter in the time of
storm. We wait quietly before You. So
use Your strong arms to bring us Your
peace.
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous
consent to address the Senate for 1
minute.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. GRASSLEY. The latest political
ploy by the Democrats is to paint the
Senate majority leader as an obstruc-
tionist because he hasn’t moved to con-
sider certain bills passed by the other
body.
Well, let’s think about that for just a
minute. They can hardly use that talk-
ing point anymore.
Yesterday, the Senate majority lead-
er moved to take up the House-passed
appropriations package, and the Senate
Democrats blocked that motion.
The Senate isn’t obliged to consider
every partisan bill from the House, and
the House doesn’t have to consider
every bill that is passed by the Senate.
But if there is any House bill that the
Senate has the responsibility to take
up, to debate, and to amend, it is the
annual spending bills to keep govern-
ment operating. We have to fund the
government, and that is what we are
doing.
So I hope we don’t hear any of this
bellyaching anymore when we have a
House bill that the Senate doesn’t
somehow take up.
I yield the floor.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I want to thank the senior Senator
from Iowa for his observations this
morning. That is exactly where we find
ourselves with what happened on the
Senate floor yesterday afternoon.
f
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
Senate Democrats blocked this year’s
funding for our national defense. They
voted it down. We can’t move the legis-
lation forward.
Democrats blocked the funding our
commanders need to keep pace with
Russia and China. Democrats blocked
money for the tools and training that
our men and women in uniform badly
need while our adversaries continually
pour money into new weapons and
technology. The Democrats even voted
against a pay raise—a pay raise—for
our servicemembers. All but two Demo-
crats voted to filibuster all of this and
kept the Senate from even considering
the legislation.
Never mind that before we adjourned
in August the Democrats in the House
and Senate all agreed to a carefully ne-
gotiated framework to keep our appro-
priations process on track. In fact, the
Speaker of the House and the Demo-
cratic leader in the Senate publicly
agreed to the exact dollar figure for the
Defense bill they just voted down yes-
terday. They publicly agreed to the
number in the Defense bill they just
voted down yesterday.
We all agreed in the caps agreement
that poison pills, new policy riders, or
any changes to Presidential transfer
authorities were off the table—off the
table—unless both sides were on board.
So the appropriations process, in-
cluding at the committee level with
Chairman SHELBY and Ranking Mem-
ber LEAHY, appeared to be going pretty
smoothly, but, as we have seen a num-
ber of other times in the recent past,
the Democratic leadership seemed to
have a change of heart.
Perhaps it sunk in that actually
meeting President Trump and Repub-
licans halfway, as divided government
obviously requires, might have earned
some criticism from the far left. But
whatever the reason, our Democratic
friends turned on a dime, reneged on
the bipartisan agreement, and began
demanding exactly the kinds of poison
pills and partisan policy changes that
we all promised not to do.
That is how we get to a spectacle like
what happened yesterday. That is how
we get to a place where 42 Senate
Democrats vote to filibuster defense
funding and obstruct a pay raise for
our servicemembers, for all the world
to see, because Democratic leadership
decided they saw more of a political
upside in picking new fights with the
President than in keeping their word
and investing in our men and women in
uniform.
In fact, I understand that just yester-
day, our Democratic leaders were of-
fered even more money for the Labor-
HHS bill, but they declined it. So it is
not about the money. It is not about
compromising and getting to yes. It is
about not wanting to take yes for an
answer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5584 September 19, 2019
I have great respect for our Demo-
cratic friends, but I think this episode
has to go down as a new high-water
mark for the policy consequences of
what some people call ‘‘Trump de-
rangement syndrome.’’
We are at a point where 42 Senate
Democrats would decline to fund the
U.S. Armed Forces essentially just to
spite the occupant of the White House.
If you ask me, that is one heck of a
price to pay to put on a show for ‘‘the
resistance.’’
But yesterday’s vote is now a matter
of record. It is in the past. I really am
hopeful that we can get back on track
with the kind of appropriations process
my Democratic colleagues have al-
ready pledged they would support.
They had already pledged to support it.
When the good work that takes place
in committees is allowed to proceed
without this top-down partisan maneu-
vering, it tends to yield pretty good re-
sults. I think we were all pleased with
the bipartisan funding bill that Chair-
man SHELBY and Senator LEAHY pro-
duced together last year. I understand
this morning’s appropriations markup
is expected to be bipartisan as well.
For example, I am proud the Finan-
cial Services and General Government
bill would include a bipartisan amend-
ment providing another $250 million for
the administration and security of
elections, to help States improve their
defenses and shore up their voting sys-
tems.
I am proud to have helped develop
this amendment and to cosponsor it in
committee. That would bring our total
allocation for election security to more
than $600 million since fiscal 2008.
It is a crucial issue. The Trump ad-
ministration has made enormous
strides to help States secure their elec-
tions without giving Washington new
power to push the States around. That
is how we continue the progress we saw
in 2018, and that is exactly what we are
doing.
This is exactly the kind of positive
outcome that is possible when we stop
posturing for the press and let Chair-
man SHELBY and Senator LEAHY con-
duct a bipartisan committee process.
As time grows shorter before the end
of September, I hope the critical de-
fense funding that Democrats blocked
yesterday will soon earn the same kind
of productive treatment, because I
don’t think the American people will
have much patience with the notion
that Democrats’ first responsibility is
irritating the White House and funding
the Department of Defense coming sec-
ond.
I hope we can reboot this process and
move forward for the sake of our Sen-
ate process, for the sake of stable fund-
ing for our government, and for the
sake of our Nation’s security.

THE JUDICIARY
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last
week, the Senate confirmed President
Trump’s 150th judge. That is a signifi-
cant milestone and one that has been
harder to achieve than it normally
would be thanks to the Democrats’ de-
termination to delay judicial confirma-
tions. Again and again, the Democrats
have used the time-consuming cloture
vote process to delay the confirmations
of President Trump’s nominees—even
of nominees they ultimately chose to
vote for.
By this point in President Obama’s
first term, the Republicans had re-
quired cloture votes on just three of
President Obama’s judicial nominees—
three. Compare that to today. As of
September 12, the Democrats had re-
quired cloture votes on a staggering
71.7 percent of President Trump’s picks
for the bench—71 percent. Basically,
for more than two out of every three
judges, the Democrats have required
cloture votes. That simply means they
have filibustered that particular nomi-
nee. The way you end the filibuster is
by invoking cloture.
When the Republicans were in the
minority when President Obama was in
the White House, at this point in Presi-
dent Obama’s first term, the Demo-
cratic majority had invoked cloture
just three times for three judges whom
the Republicans had tried to block. As
I said, right now, at the same point in
President Trump’s first term, we are
talking about almost 72 percent of all
of the nominations combined having
been filibustered. If you think about
that and if you add it up totally, cumu-
latively, it is about 100 now compared
to 3 during President Obama’s first
term at the same time in office.
As I have said, many of these were
nominees the Democrats ultimately
went on to vote to confirm. In other
words, it was not that President Trump
nominated scores of extreme nominees
whom the Democrats felt they couldn’t
support. Again and again, the Demo-
crats have delayed a nominee, then
turned around and voted in favor of
him or her.
In one particularly memorable exam-
ple, in January of 2018, the Democrats
forced the Senate to spend more than a
week considering four district court
judges even though not one single
Democrat voted against their con-
firmations—not one single Democrat.
These judges could have been con-
firmed in a matter of minutes by voice
votes. Instead, the Democrats forced
the Senate to spend more than a week
on their considerations—time that
could have been spent on genuinely
controversial nominees or on some of
the many important issues that face
our country.
So far this September, the Senate
has confirmed six district court judges.
The Democrats forced cloture votes on
four of them despite the fact that all
four were eventually confirmed by
huge bipartisan margins. In fact, one
was confirmed by a unanimous vote of
94 to 0.
If the Democrats had had a serious
reason for their obstruction of the
President’s judicial nominees, they
would not have been repeatedly turn-
ing around and voting for them. Their
obstruction isn’t based on principle; it
is based on partisanship. They don’t
like this President, so they are ob-
structing his nominees even when they
agree they are well qualified for their
positions. As a result, we are forced to
spend hours upon hours of Senate floor
time on uncontroversial nominations—
time we could be using for other prior-
ities.
Democratic delays are also not help-
ing the judicial vacancy rate, which is
still high despite the Republicans’ ef-
forts to get judges confirmed. High
numbers of vacancies result in there
being long waits to get cases heard,
which serves nobody.
While Democratic obstruction is bad
enough, unfortunately, we have a lot
more to worry about. In recent
months, the Democrats have moved be-
yond obstruction and into directly
threatening the independence of the ju-
diciary. Court-packing—an idea that
pretty much everybody thought had
been consigned to the dustbin of his-
tory almost a century ago—is enjoying
a revival among members of the Demo-
cratic Party.
For anyone who needs a refresher on
this concept, the theory of court-pack-
ing is quite simple. If the Supreme
Court is not deciding cases to your lik-
ing, add more judges to the Court until
you start getting the decisions you
want. It is not hard to see why this is
a terrible idea, but that hasn’t stopped
it from gaining traction in the Demo-
cratic Party. In fact, five prominent
Democrats—including a Democratic
Presidential candidate and the second-

September 19, 2019
ranking Democrat in the Senate—re-
cently filed an amicus brief with the
Supreme Court that threatened the
Court if it failed to rule according to
the Democrats’ preference.
They wrote:
The Supreme Court is not well, and the
people know it. Perhaps the Court can heal
itself before the public demands it be re-
structured in order to reduce the influence of
politics.
Translation: If you don’t rule the
way we want you to, you will not like
the consequences.
Threatening members of the judici-
ary is within the domain of dictators
and despots, not Members of the U.S.
Congress, and it is deeply disturbing
that prominent Democrats apparently
now see nothing wrong with trying to
intimidate the Supreme Court.
Unfortunately, it is becoming appar-
ent that there are few lengths to which
the Democrats will not go in their in-
creasingly desperate partisanship. Just
this week, we saw the Democrats leap
on the opportunity to drag Justice
Kavanaugh’s name through the mud
again based on yet another vague and
unsubstantiated rumor.
More than one Democratic Presi-
dential candidate instantly cried that
he should be impeached. What was the
basis for such a drastic suggestion? It
was a New York Times article that
was, as the leader pointed out, so short
on reporting that it ran on the opinion
page of the New York Times instead of
in the news section, not to mention
that after running this piece, the
Times had to quickly issue a correction
and note a glaring omission in the
original story. What was the omission?
It was the fact that the supposed vic-
tim of Justice Kavanaugh’s supposed
behavior declined to be interviewed
and that her friends said she had no
memory of the alleged incident.
It is not hard to see what is behind
the Democrats’ relentless campaign to
smear Justice Kavanaugh’s name. They
are furious that it was a Republican
and not a Democratic President who
had the opportunity to choose a Jus-
tice to replace a perceived swing vote
on the Supreme Court, and they are
afraid that Justice Kavanaugh will not
issue the rulings they want.
Here we get to the heart of the prob-
lem with the Democrats’ increasingly
unhinged leftism and attacks on the ju-
diciary. The Democrats aren’t looking
for judges or a judiciary that will rule
according to the law; they are looking
for a judiciary that will rule in accord-
ance with the Democrats’ preferred
policies whether they have anything to
do with the law or not, and that is a
very dangerous goal.
Sure, it might seem nice when an ac-
tivist judge who shares your political
opinions reaches outside the meaning
of the statute and rules for your pre-
ferred outcome. Yet what happens
when that same judge reaches beyond
the law to your detriment? What pro-
tection do you have if the judge and
not the law becomes the highest au-
thority? The only way to ensure the
protection of individuals’ rights is to
ensure the rule of law, and that means
having judges who will make decisions
according to the law, not according to
their personal preferences or the prin-
ciples of a particular political party’s.
In the wake of the Democrats’ threat
to the Supreme Court, all 53 Repub-
lican Senators sent a letter to the Jus-
tices that underscored our commit-
ment to protecting the independence of
the judiciary. We noted in the letter:
There is no greater example of the genius
of our Constitution than its creation of an
independent judiciary. . . . Time and again,
our independent federal courts have pro-
tected the constitutional rights of Ameri-
cans from government overreach even when
that overreach was politically popular.
If we want our courts to continue
protecting Americans’ constitutional
rights, then we need to ensure they re-
main independent.
The Democrats’ interest in having
judges who will rule according to their
preferred outcomes is not new, but in
the past, their interest has not led
them to attempt to bully judges into
voting their way. I hope the Democrats
will think better of their repressive
tactics before our independent judici-
ary becomes the victim of their polit-
ical agenda.
I yield the floor.

AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President,
I could stay here all day, listening to
the names of the brave men and women
whom I was lucky enough to serve with
in the military. I could stay here all
night, telling stories about their her-
oism and courage. I could stay here all
week, all month, talking about the
troops who are serving overseas right
now and about those who are on their
eighth or ninth tours of duty or about
those teenagers who weren’t even alive
when the Twin Towers fell, yet who are
ready to ship off to Afghanistan at this
very moment if that is what is asked of
them. I could go on and on all year if
I wanted, and I still wouldn’t be able to
convey the sacrifices they are making
because they love this country and
would do anything to defend her.
I will not stand idly by and let a sin-
gle one of them shed blood in an avoid-
able conflict because Donald Trump
has abdicated matters of war and peace
to a despot who regularly flouts basic
human rights and openly murders jour-
nalists. Yet, after tensions spiked be-
tween Saudi Arabia and Iran this past
weekend, that is exactly what he
seemed to be willing to do. He tweeted
that the U.S. was ‘‘locked and loaded’’
and just waiting for the Crown Prince
to tell him how to proceed. We can’t let
that slip by.
The President—the Commander in
Chief of the greatest military of the
greatest democracy on the face of the
Earth—just suggested that he was out-
sourcing the powers of war to a foreign
monarch—powers that aren’t even his
to hand over—and he did it in a tweet.
While Trump may have never read
the Constitution, I have, so let me di-
rect his attention to article I, which
makes it clear that the President does
not have the authority to declare war.
Only Congress has that power. We are
the ones tasked with deciding when
and how Americans are sent into com-
bat. We are the ones charged with that
most solemn duty, not Donald Trump
and certainly not Muhammad bin
Salman. Yet Trump is acting as if arti-
cle I simply doesn’t exist, as if he could
just usurp this power from the legisla-
tive branch and trade it to whomever
he pleases, as if obeying the Constitu-
tion is optional even while he tweets
that he is willing to obey a foreign
prince.
This should not be a partisan issue.
No matter if you are struggling to pay
rent or if your name is plastered in
gold on the front of a building on Fifth
Avenue, no one can overrule the Con-
stitution. Trump doesn’t get to mire us
in yet another Middle East conflict
just because he has a bizarre tendency
to bow down and kiss up to the world’s
cruelest tyrants.
Whether you ask constitutional
scholars or high school students taking
U.S. history classes, they will tell you
the same thing—that on matters of
military force, whether they are our al-
lies or our adversaries, American Presi-
dents do not get to choose to take or-
ders from foreign leaders. They take
direction from Congress—full stop.
I am here to say that we have not au-
thorized him to ensnare us in another
endless, senseless war.
We haven’t debated and passed a new
authorization for the use of military
force in more than 15 years, and there
is just no way that the AUMF passed to
go after the perpetrators of 9/11 can
justify military action against Iran
nearly two decades later, sending
troops overseas who may not have even
been alive when that AUMF was voted
on.
Listen, it is not just me who believes
this. It is not just my fellow Democrats
in the Senate either. During the con-
firmation hearing for now-Secretary of
Defense Mark Esper, I asked Trump’s
own nominee point-blank whether the
existing AUMF gives this administra-
tion the right to conduct a war with
Iran. His answer? His answer was: No.
No, they do not.
Even in decades past, when prior
Presidents have gotten us entangled in
bad wars based on bad intelligence, at
the very least they made sure to loop
in the United Nations, but Trump is
acting as if he wouldn’t even do that.
He is too busy thumping his chest and
catering to the whims of autocrats. He
is too infatuated with maximum pres-
sure to consider even minimum diplo-
macy, too distracted beating the drums
of war to even think about how many
troops he would be sending into harm’s
way.
For what? To protect the Saudi oil
industry or the Crown Prince’s per-
sonal profits?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5586 September 19, 2019
Once again, the Trump foreign policy
doctrine has proven reckless, senseless,
and dangerous, full of gaslighting and
bluster, a doctrine in which fact and
fiction are one in the same.
It is shameful. It is terrifying that
we have a Commander in Chief who
comes to military decisions by virtue
of temper tantrum and then announces
them via tweet, a President who
doesn’t seem to care that if he keeps on
the path of fire and fury he has been
treading, our own homeland will be in
greater danger, more wounded warriors
will be sent to Walter Reed, and more
fallen heroes will be laid to rest in the
hallowed grounds of Arlington.
Donald Trump may never have
deigned to put on our Nation’s uni-
form, so he probably doesn’t know that
the commander’s greatest responsi-
bility is to safeguard the troops so they
are able to carry out the mission. That
means we do not send them into harm’s
way recklessly and without full sup-
port both logistically and legally.
As a former unit commander, I ran
for Congress so that when the drums of
war sounded, I would be in a position
to make sure our elected officials fully
consider the true costs of war, not just
in dollars and cents but in the sac-
rifices of our troops and their families.
That was the vow I made to my buddies
that I deployed with and all those who
have served since I hung up my uni-
form.
Now, as the drums of war are pound-
ing once again, I am here today to keep
my promise to do our troops justice
and to make sure Donald Trump does
not outsource overseas yet another
American job—Congress’s job to de-
clare war. If the Trump administration
wants to go to war, they must bring
their case to Congress and give the
American people a say through their
elected representatives. They must re-
spect our servicemembers enough to
prove why war with Iran is worth turn-
ing more moms and dads into Gold
Star parents. They must testify about
what the end state in Iran actually
looks like.
Then, when their case has been made,
when Congress’s debate is done, we
should vote. It is our duty. It is the
least we owe to the troops we would be
sending into harm’s way. If the vote to
authorize military force passes, then I
will be the first person to volunteer to
deploy. I am ready to pack my
rucksack, to dust off my uniform. I am
ready to fly helicopters, take on the
grunt work, do whatever else it takes
to uphold that oath that all service-
members and veterans have sworn: to
protect and defend this Nation we love,
no matter what.
It would be nice if we had a President
willing to do the same instead of one
who thinks he looks tough by pushing
us to the brink of a needless conflict.
Listen, Trump may think he comes
off as strong by using phrases like
‘‘locked and loaded’’ and by spewing
threats 280 characters at a time, but he
has never seemed weaker to me. A real
Commander in Chief would not dole out
matters of war to the highest bidder. A
true leader would not bend to the
whims of despots just because of the
size of their bank accounts. A strong
President would not care more about
keeping tyrants happy than safe-
guarding our most precious resource:
the brave men and women willing to
lay down their lives to defend our Na-
tion. Yet, day after day, Donald Trump
wraps himself in the flag in the morn-
ing and then abandons our servicemem-
bers and our democratic norms by the
afternoon.
While he may have already shirked
his duty as an elected official, I refuse
to abandon mine. So as many times as
is necessary, I am going to keep com-
ing back to this Chamber, keep raising
my voice under this great Capitol
dome, and keep demanding what is ac-
tually in our Nation’s best interest be-
cause, you see, I don’t take my orders
from war criminals or dictators or
princes or monarchs. I don’t serve for-
eign regimes. I serve the American peo-
ple. Trump would do well to try that
sometime.
I yield the floor.

APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
yesterday, the Senate failed to advance
a motion to proceed to a package of ap-
propriations bills, demonstrating
something that Leader MCCONNELL al-
ready knew: There are not enough
votes in the Senate for the President’s
wall.
The Senate refuses to fund the border
wall that the President promised Mex-
ico would pay for, especially not at the
expense of our troops and their families
and important public health programs
like childcare and Head Start. Just
yesterday, the Pentagon warned of dire
outcomes if the money to fund the
military is not provided.
Read today’s Washington Post. Our
military people are upset with this.
Now, their chain of command is not
going to publicly say it, but we know
it. Over 120 military projects stand to
lose funding, and we aren’t talking
about fixing parking lots. We are talk-
ing about military readiness. We are
talking about medical facilities for
troops in North Carolina. We are talk-
ing about schools for military families
in Kentucky. We are talking about ex-
plosives stored in unsafe conditions.
We are talking about a very important
engineering lab at West Point to train
our future soldiers. Even hurricane re-
covery projects in Florida are at risk.
The Defense Department was very
clear that without this funding, lives
would be at risk, but that is what Re-
publicans on the Appropriations Com-
mittee proposed. The Senate rightly re-
jected that idea.
The Republican leader is saying we
are hurting the military? Give me a
break. We are defending the military.
How much bull does the majority lead-
er think the American public will swal-
low? They are taking money out of the
military to put it in the wall, and he
says that we are hurting the military?
Oh, no. Leader MCCONNELL is hurting
the military, and we defended them.
We defended them because we want the
money to go to the military, not to the
wall.
By the way, in that regard, Leader
MCCONNELL did not stick with the
agreement. The agreement was not
only on the 302(a)s but there would be
bipartisan agreement on where the
money on the defense side and the non-
defense side would be distributed.
Instead of consulting Democrats,
they tried to jam something down our
throats, taking money out of defense,
out of Head Start and other programs
in the health and human services budg-
et and put it into the wall. Well, that
wasn’t going to stand, it isn’t going to
stand, and it will not stand.
I hope Leader MCCONNELL has
learned his lesson. Shutting down the
government or trying to eyeball for the
wall isn’t going to work. Let’s roll up
our sleeves and work together.
My friend the Republican leader and
Chairman SHELBY have now shown the
President that they tried again to fund
his wall. They have seen, once again,
that the votes are not there. They have
seen, once again, that when the Senate
Republicans do the President’s bidding
and refuse to engage the Democrats,
the only thing they accomplish is wast-
ed time.
The pattern repeats itself far too fre-
quently. The same impulse to do the
President’s bidding—they are so afraid
of this President—and that is what led
to the 35-day Trump shutdown earlier
this year. Let’s not repeat that, Repub-
licans. Let’s learn our lessons.
The same impulse led Republicans to
deny for months disaster aid to Puerto
Rico. In each case, whether it be tak-
ing money out of needed places like the
military and putting it into the wall or
not being fair to Puerto Rico when it
came to aid, they had to relent and
work with Democrats. I am glad they
did for the good of the country.
So enough time has been wasted this
work period. Leader MCCONNELL,
Chairman SHELBY, let’s sit down. It is
time for you to sit down and negotiate
with Democrats on the way forward.
(Mr. SCOTT of Florida assumed the
chair.)

allow appropriators to get a bipartisan
agreement for fiscal year 2020.
One program that has not received
enough attention is the agricultural re-
lief program known commonly as the
Commodity Credit Corporation. This is
an important program that should help
all farmers suffering from certain ex-
igencies of the market, like price de-
clines and natural disasters.
Unfortunately, over the past year,
the President turned this important
agricultural relief program that we all
support into a giant slush fund. The re-
lief payments have gotten political.
Crops in red States have received out-
sized subsidies, while crops in blue
States were shortchanged. Cotton, for
example, has gotten a huge subsidy,
compared to dairy and specialty crops,
fruits and vegetables. The payments
were not matched to the damage
caused to each crop. Even soybeans,
the supposed reason for this at the be-
ginning, were greatly shortchanged for
cotton, and even now cotton is being
treated better.
In addition—and just as bad, if not
worse—there have been huge amounts
of waste and abuse in the program.
Large agribusinesses, including some
foreign agribusinesses, like a Brazilian
beef corporation, are receiving funding
through this program while American
dairy farmers are passed over.
There are limits on the CCC program.
If you make over $900,000, you
shouldn’t get any money. The most
any farm can get is $250,000 if there are
two farmers in the family, a husband
and a wife. Those don’t seem to abate
either.
We are very pleased that Republicans
acceded to our wish. Democrats were
able to inject some transparency into
the agricultural relief program.
In this short-term CR, we require re-
porting on whether the funding is
going to foreign sources and justifica-
tion for why money went where it did.
We are going to look at this report be-
fore we move to the full appropriations
bill in a month or two to make sure the
money is going to our American farm-
ers who need it—not foreigners, not
wealthy agribusiness, not all slanted to
one product like cotton when there are
so many other needs.
This is a good victory for Democrats
in a day of some victories for Demo-
crats.
ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. President, there is another
bright spot, election security. This
morning, after months and months of
Republican resistance and months of
insistent Democratic pressure, Senate
Republicans have finally agreed to sup-
port our Democratic request for addi-
tional election security funding in ad-
vance of the 2020 elections.
This is similar to an amendment
Democrats offered during last year’s
appropriations process to help States
harden their election infrastructure to
protect against Russian or Chinese or
Iranian interference.
A year ago, our Republican friends,
unfortunately and shortsightedly, re-
jected this amendment. Maybe, just
maybe, Republicans are starting to
come around to our view that election
security is necessary; that if Ameri-
cans don’t believe their elections are
on the up and up, woe is us as a coun-
try and as a democracy.
It is not all the money we requested
and doesn’t include a single solitary re-
form that virtually everyone knows we
need, but it is a start. Leader MCCON-
NELL kept saying that we don’t need
the money. I made umpteen speeches
here, in this chair, and the Republican
leader denied the need. But now, thank
God, he has seen the light. We need
more money for election security; ask
election officials, Democrat or Repub-
lican, throughout the country. I hope
today’s vote means Senate Republicans
are beginning to see the light on elec-
tion security.
While this funding is important, it is
not the only thing we need to do to se-
cure our elections from Russian, Chi-
nese, Iranian, or any other foreign
country’s interference. There are mul-
tiple bipartisan pieces of legislation
awaiting action on the floor that would
counter foreign influence operations
against our democracy, safeguard our
elections, and deter foreign adversaries
from even attempting to interfere.
We have been warned time and again
by our national security leaders—near-
ly all of them Republicans appointed
by President Trump—that China and,
of course, Russia are potential threats
in 2020. We cannot sit on our hands
while our adversaries try to replicate
and outdo what Putin accomplished in
2016.
Leader MCCONNELL should bring the
bipartisan bills. We are getting the
money in approps, but we need more
legislation to refine where the dollars
are.
Leader MCCONNELL, now that you
have seen the light on the money, go
one step further: Bring the bipartisan
bills—the Defending American Secu-
rity from Kremlin Aggression Act, the
Secure Elections Act, and the DETER
Act—to the floor for a debate and a
vote. Otherwise, the job will remain in-
complete and our democracy vulner-
able.
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Mr. President, finally on guns, yes-
terday, according to reports, Attorney
General Barr came to Capitol Hill to
discuss a one-page proposal on gun leg-
islation that he had put together. It be-
came clear soon after that the White
House, seemingly out of fear of reprisal
by the NRA, was unwilling to embrace
its own Attorney General’s proposal.
Once again, the White House refused to
take a stand on what they propose to
do on the question of gun violence.
President Trump and Senate Repub-
licans are trying to find a way to have
their cake and eat it too—searching for
a plan that the public will accept and
won’t offend the NRA. It is a fool’s er-
rand.
Leader MCCONNELL, President
Trump, you can’t please the NRA and
at the same time do good gun legisla-
tion that will save lives. You cannot
please the NRA unless you do some-
thing that is either regressive or, at
the very best, toothless. Get it through
your heads. That is how it is.
If you want to do something real on
gun legislation and save lives, you have
to reject the NRA’s ministrations. The
NRA is wildly out of step with the
views of the American public. Its poli-
cies are reactionary; its leadership, re-
calcitrant and divided.
Look no further than the universal
background check bill. Ninety-three
percent of Americans, the great major-
ity of gun owners, and 80 percent of Re-
publicans support the idea. But not the
NRA. As for yesterday’s plan floated by
the Republican Attorney General, a
plan that would only modestly expand
background checks, representatives of
the NRA called it a nonstarter.
The views of the NRA and the views
of the American public are fundamen-
tally incompatible. President Trump,
Leader MCCONNELL, Senate Repub-
licans, which side are you on? Are you
with the NRA or are you with the
American people?
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today
Speaker PELOSI unveiled the House’s
plan to try to lower out-of-pocket costs
for prescription drugs. This, of course,
has been a priority for many of us in
Washington, including the Presiding
Officer.
We have been working on it really
hard here in the Senate. Actually,
three standing committees of the Sen-
ate have now reported out legislation
dealing with this issue: the Judiciary
Committee, the Finance Committee,
and the HELP Committee, or the
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. All are working to-
gether to try to come with up bipar-
tisan packages to lower prescription
drug costs.
These bills, of course, include ideas
from Republicans and Democrats.
Mr. President, apparently, we have
some technical difficulties here.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. I can
hear you better now.
Mr. CORNYN. It sounds like we have
fixed that. Thank you.
As I was saying, while these bills in-
clude ideas from both Republicans and
Democrats, it shouldn’t surprise people
that in an area as complex as this,
there are going to be some disagree-
ments along the way. But that is what
we do here: We work through those dis-
agreements and try to build consensus.
While I know that it is only a bipar-
tisan bill that has any chance at all to

make its way to the President’s desk
for his signature, Speaker PELOSI ap-
pears to have a different approach.
House Democrats want to replace our
free-market healthcare system with
the heavyhanded government approach
that puts us on a path to socialized
medicine. They want to allow the gov-
ernment to set prices and put bureau-
crats at the center of our healthcare
system, instead of patients.
The Speaker’s plan is just the latest
example of a partisan messaging docu-
ment masquerading as legislation, and
it has absolutely no chance—zero, zip,
nada—of passing the Senate or becom-
ing law.
In contrast, the ideas we have been
working on would lower out-of-pocket
costs by increasing competition and
transparency, while stopping the bad
actors who try to game the system. Un-
like the House, we have been consid-
ering bills that have broad bipartisan
support, as I said, which means they
have the potential to actually become
law, to get something done.
Speaker PELOSI should take note
that we in the Senate have done the
hard work of finding consensus with
our colleagues on both sides of the
aisle. I encourage our friends in the
House of Representatives to stop wast-
ing time and, instead, start working in
a bipartisan fashion and work on legis-
lation that can actually become law.
Only then will the American people see
the benefit of a reduction in out-of-
pocket costs for their prescription
drugs.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, on another matter,
with the end of the fiscal year just a
week and a half way, we know the
clock is running out for us to pass
funding bills. After the longest govern-
ment shutdown in history earlier this
year, I thought there was bipartisan
support to get the regular appropria-
tions process back on track. Both par-
ties knew there was a funding crisis at
stake this fall if we couldn’t come to-
gether and reach a compromise.
So that is exactly what we did before
the August break. Our colleagues on
the Appropriations Committee, led by
the chairman, Senator SHELBY, worked
day and night to reach an agreement
that was acceptable to both parties in
both Chambers, as well as earning the
support of the President. That is not
easy to do. That was the 2-year budget
caps agreement. But they got it done.
That is until the August recess oc-
curred, and, apparently, memories
faded about what exactly had been
agreed to, or people reconsidered their
previous agreement and decided to
withdraw their consent.
We knew this caps deal, as imperfect
as it was, would lay the foundation for
the appropriations process this fall and
get us out of this reoccurring movie
called the looming shutdown.
At the end of July, we passed a 2-year
budget agreement. It was a fair com-
promise, considering everybody’s inter-
ests. While there are still details to be
hashed out in the individual appropria-
tions bills, it was a strong start. We
thought we had made it past this shut-
down movie and scenario.
We agreed to top-line defense spend-
ing and nondefense spending. There
was a promise not to derail the appro-
priations process with poison pill pol-
icy riders, and we got it done with
plenty of time to spare.
Now it appears that our Democratic
friends are backing down from their
commitments, which is a serious mis-
take on their part. If we can’t work to-
gether in good faith and trust that our
colleagues will actually stick to their
word and keep their commitments,
then, that is going to do nothing but
further erode our ability to function on
behalf of the American people.
Imagine my surprise when, yester-
day, the Senate voted to begin debate
on the first batch of funding bills and
Democrats blocked it. They stopped it
dead in its tracks. Even though they
had agreed to the spending caps and a
process to go forward, they blocked it.
They voted to deny our troops the larg-
est pay raise in a decade. They voted to
withhold vital funding from our mili-
tary at a time when we face growing
threats around the world. They voted
to derail the very process they had
agreed to before August. In so doing,
they once again put partisan politics
above our responsibilities to the Amer-
ican people.
What is the reason for this? A dis-
agreement over funding allocations of
0.003 percent of the total budget—0.003
percent of the total budget. That is
like robbing a bank in order to steal
the change from the gumball machine.
I am really disappointed. We are better
than that, and I hope our colleagues
will reconsider.
Our national security is on the line.
If there is one thing we ought to do
above all else, it is to provide for the
defense and to make sure that the
American people are safe and that
those who put themselves in harm’s
way and who volunteer to wear the uni-
form of the U.S. military are treated
with respect and fairness. It is inappro-
priate and it is just wrong to play
games with national security or with
our military, as our Democratic col-
leagues appear to be doing.
DEBBIE SMITH ACT
Finally, Mr. President, 4 months ago,
the Senate passed a bipartisan bill that
I introduced with the Senator from
California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, to reau-
thorize what has arguably been the sin-
gle greatest driver behind our progress
to reduce the rape kit backlog.
The Debbie Smith Act was first
passed in 2004 to provide State and
local crime labs with the resources
they need to end the backlog of un-
solved crimes. At one point, we learned
there were perhaps as many as 400,000
forensic kits, or rape kits, sitting ei-
ther in evidence lockers or in labs that
had been untested—400,000. In each one
of those kits is the evidence needed to
identify the assailant in a sexual as-
sault or, conversely, to rule out some-
body in a sexual assault.
Also, as a result of uploading of this
information, if it is tested, into the
FBI system, or the CODIS system, it
can help to solve a myriad of crimes,
not just sexual assault cases.
The Debbie Smith Act is one of those
rare cases where there has always been
bipartisan and bicameral support. More
than $1 billion has been provided to fo-
rensic labs because of this law, ena-
bling them to get untested evidence off
the shelf so we can provide victims
with answers and we can take these as-
sailants, which, characteristically,
don’t just do it one time—they do it
multiple times until they are ulti-
mately caught—off the street.
As I said, while the primary goal of
the legislation was to reduce the rape
kit backlog, under the Debbie Smith
Act, this has provided an abundance of
DNA evidence that has been used to
solve other numerous crimes. That is
because once the evidence is tested, it
is uploaded in the FBI’s DNA database,
called CODIS. Similar to the finger-
print databases, this DNA database can
help to identify and convict people who
commit any type of crime that is under
investigation.
For example, if a criminal commits a
burglary in one State, DNA from that
burglary case can later be used to con-
nect this criminal to an unsolved rape
case in other States. It is that power-
ful.
According to the National Institute
of Justice, 42 percent of the hits in the
FBI’s DNA database system are the di-
rect result of Debbie Smith Act fund-
ing—42 percent.
Last month, I visited a living com-
munity in Grapevine, TX, called The
Gatehouse. This is a place where
women and children who have been vic-
timized by domestic violence find the
care and resources they need to restart
their lives. I spoke with survivors of
sexual assault, advocates, and law en-
forcement about the impact of the
Debbie Smith Act and the need to reau-
thorize this critical program before it
expires at the end of the month.
Here is the thing that completely
confounds me. The Debbie Smith Act is
not partisan. It is not even controver-
sial. It is not divisive. The last time we
voted on it, not a single Senator voted
no. So there is no reason for the House
to stall on this critical legislation. If
the House doesn’t act by the end of the
month, it will expire.
Once again, I urge Speaker PELOSI to
allow this bill to go to the floor of the
House without further delay. It would
be simply shameful to allow this pro-
gram to expire, especially when she has
a bipartisan bill in her hand and all she
has to do is allow it to go to the floor
of the House for a vote.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5589
September 19, 2019
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
FISCHER). Without objection, it is so
ordered.
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, in
February of this year, the House of
Representatives passed what is known
as the universal background check in
regard to gun sales. Since that time,
the Senate has had no action whatso-
ever on gun safety issues. Leader
MCCONNELL could bring this bill to the
floor, and I am confident we have the
support to pass it.
I do hear from many of my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle that we
are waiting for the President, and un-
less the President signs off on a bill,
they are not interested in bringing it
up. The last time I checked the Con-
stitution of the United States, the first
article of the Constitution provides for
the legislative branch of government,
and that is us. We make the laws, not
the President of the United States. It
is up to us to deliver and consider leg-
islation and pass legislation. Yet there
is no action from the floor of the Sen-
ate. Leader MCCONNELL will not bring
up gun safety legislation.
Every day we wait—every single
day—100 people in America die from
gun violence. That is why many of us
are frequently speaking on the floor of
the Senate about the need to consider
gun safety legislation.
It has been over 200 days since the
House took bipartisan action on the
universal background checks. Since
that time, we have seen many mass
shootings, including on August 3 in El
Paso, August 4 in Dayton, and August
31 in Odessa. There is no action on the
floor of the Senate. Every day, there
are people dying in our communities
and in our homes from gun violence.
Yet there is no action on the floor of
the Senate.
The United States is an outlier
among the developed nations in the
world. We have 10 times, 20 times, 30
times more instances of gun violence
than in developed countries in the
world. We have more guns in private
ownership than the people of developed
worlds, more suicides, more mass
shootings, more gun violence. Yet
there is no action on the floor of the
Senate.
The issue is kind of simple. Inaction
is not an answer to gun violence in
America. Americans are expecting us—
the Members of the Senate—to con-
sider gun safety legislation. We want
the majority leader to bring that bill
to the floor today before another 100
people die. Let us take action.
I mentioned several times the bill
that passed the House of Representa-
tives over 200 days ago, the universal
background checks. Let me just talk a
moment about why that bill needs to
be considered and passed as soon as
possible. In 1993, we passed the Brady
Handgun Violence Prevention Act. It
provides for a presale check as to
whether an individual is entitled to
own a handgun. As I am sure my col-
leagues are aware, the Supreme Court
of the United States has determined
that the Second Amendment is not ab-
solute. If you have been convicted of a
violent crime, if you have mental
issues, you are not entitled to have a
handgun. The Brady presale check de-
termines whether you fall into those
categories, and they will deny you the
right to buy a handgun if you do.
Since its inception in 1993, 3 million
sales have been stopped. It works. It is
compliant with the Supreme Court,
and it doesn’t interfere with legitimate
Second Amendment rights. It was
passed in 1993. It is now 2019. Sellers of
handguns have figured out a way to get
around the 1993 law with private sales,
gun shows, and internet sales. We
didn’t have internet gun sales in 1993.
We need to close those loopholes.
Here is the situation. Some States
have done this. In the States that have
done it, we see that the results are fa-
vorable. There is less gun violence in
those States that have passed universal
background checks. However, let me
just tell you about the State of Mary-
land. Of the guns that are recovered
from crime scenes in Maryland, 53 per-
cent are guns that were acquired in a
State outside of Maryland. We need
universal background checks in order
to provide the types of results that can
keep our communities safer by keeping
guns out of the hands of people who are
not entitled to have guns.
How do the American people feel
about this? There are 90-plus percent
who believe that we should have uni-
versal background checks. Yet there
has been no action on the floor of the
U.S. Senate. The Republican leader
will not bring the bill to the floor. This
is a bill that should have been passed a
long time ago. Every day that we
delay, there are another 100 deaths
from gun violence.
We shouldn’t stop there. We should
deal with assault-style military weap-
ons. When someone has one of these as-
sault weapons, within a matter of sec-
onds, he can shoot off multiple rounds
and kill multiple numbers of people.
Even if you have those who come to
the rescue—if law enforcement is on
the scene or people are able to deal
with the circumstances—in a matter of
seconds, you can already have multiple
casualties. We need to get rid of these
military-style weapons in private own-
ership.
When you talk to law enforcement
officers and ask them what they fear
the most when they go into a situation
in which someone is armed, it is the as-
sault weapons they fear. It is not fair
to our law enforcement officers, who
put their lives on the line for us and
who rush into harm’s way, to allow for
these types of weapons to be available
to the general public.
We can do something about it. Let us
take up legislation that restricts the
private ownership of assault-style
weapons. There has been no action,
though, on the floor of the Senate. The
Republican leader will not bring up any
issues on gun safety.
I could add legislation with regard to
the large-capacity magazines. We see
that. They are used in mass shootings
because you can shoot off multiple
rounds without reloading. Again, as we
have seen in mass shooting cir-
cumstances, it has added to the num-
ber of deaths. It is not inconveniencing
the public to restrict that type of ca-
pacity from being out there, which is
known to cause harm by those who
want to create a situation of mass cas-
ualties. Again, there has been no ac-
tion on the floor of the Senate by the
Republican leader.
We have bipartisan legislation that
would identify those individuals who
pose extreme risks so that there is a
red flag placed on those individuals
that prevents them from being able to
purchase handguns—bipartisan legisla-
tion. Our States are acting, but there
has been no action on the floor of the
U.S. Senate. The Republican leader
will not even bring that up.
We could go over a whole host of
other issues, such as mental health and
earlier identification—those types of
services. There are a lot of things we
can do. I would hope that the one op-
tion that would be off the table would
be that of doing nothing, but that
seems to be the Republican leader’s
preferred option—to let this issue rest
without there being any action taken
by the Senate. It has been over 200 days
since the House of Representatives
acted, but there has been no action
here on the floor of the Senate.
I urge all of my colleagues to impress
upon the Republican leader that it is
well past time for us to consider gun
safety legislation. Let us bring these
bills to the floor. Let us not wait for
the President of the United States. We
are the legislative branch of govern-
ment. Let us act and do the right thing
to keep our communities and our
homes safer.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

worked long and hard to be elected to

our States but to respond to the chal-
lenges that face us in the United
States. The challenge of gun safety
faces everyone. Thank you to the Sen-
ator from Maryland for making that
point on the floor of the Senate.

leries, sit in the chairs, and wait for
the Senate to act. It is a long waiting
game because, unfortunately, the Sen-
ate does little or nothing under the

S5590 September 19, 2019
leadership of Senator MCCONNELL. I
don’t know why this Senator has not
accepted the fact that the U.S. Senate
has an important role to play. We
speak for people not only in Illinois
and in Maryland but for those all
across the United States, and they are
very concerned.
In the recent trip home over the re-
cess, I visited some of the areas around
Chicago and in the city, and there were
many conversations about the gun vio-
lence that we see across America. That
gun violence has been punctuated by
the horrible events in El Paso and
Odessa, TX, and in other communities
that have been affected by these mass
killings. We have become numb, I am
afraid, to the reality of gun violence in
America. We have decided, I am afraid,
that the Second Amendment to the
Constitution is somehow holding us
back—binding us and restraining us—
from even doing the most basic things.
Overwhelmingly, the people of Amer-
ica, by a factor of over 90 percent—
Democrats and Republicans—believe
that we should have background
checks. We believe that the people who
have been convicted of violent felonies
shouldn’t own guns—period. We be-
lieve, as well, that when it comes to
those who have serious mental insta-
bility, they should also be precluded
from gun ownership. The laws do not
allow us to adequately ask the ques-
tion or to test whether the buyer has
been convicted of a felony or has such
a background.
In the city of Chicago, hardly a week-
end goes by without there being dozens
shot and 9 or 10 or more losing their
lives. Most of them are young people,
but not exclusively. Older people, as
well, are caught in the crossfire.
People say: Well, I thought Chicago
had these tough gun laws. What is
going on there? Why do you have so
many gun deaths?
The answer is obvious for those of us
who spend time in that great city. We
are about 20 minutes away from north-
western Indiana and from the gun
shows that are held there, where people
don’t ask questions when they sell fire-
arms. All you need to do is to have the
money and the open trunk of your car
to fill it up with guns and drive them
back to the city of Chicago. That is
why no State can solve this problem.
We need Federal legislation.
As I talk to people across this coun-
try, they tell me the heartbreaking
stories of sitting down with their chil-
dren who have gone through some drill
or program at school to forewarn them
of what would happen if an active
shooter were to come onto the prem-
ises. As we know, that reality is not be-
yond reach. In Connecticut, we saw a
beautiful first grade class that was at-
tacked by a killer with a weapon who
took the lives of those children. If that
scandalous massacre of children in a
first grade classroom didn’t move this
Congress and this President to act,
what will?
The President said to me in a con-
versation several weeks ago that we
are going to have a background check
bill and that it will be the best in the
history of the world. Well, I was skep-
tical when he said it. I am even more
skeptical today. I knew what would
happen. When the President had a
choice between the public interest of
gun safety and the special interest of
the National Rifle Association, the Na-
tional Rifle Association prevailed.
This President refuses to come for-
ward with any proposal, and Senator
MCCONNELL believes his hands are tied
and cannot bring this issue to the floor
of the Senate. He cannot run the risk
that his Members would have to be on
the record as having taken a vote, as
they were elected to do, on an issue of
this importance.
S. 386
Madam President, this is not the
only issue that we are ignoring—the
only issue that is, frankly, not even
being considered on the floor of the
Senate. There is another one that is
equally important to me and to most
people across this country, and that is
dealing with the challenge of immigra-
tion.
A few years ago, a bipartisan group
of Senators—eight of us—I, Senator
McCain, Senator SCHUMER, and oth-
ers—sat down and wrote a comprehen-
sive immigration reform bill. It was
months of Republicans and Democrats
sitting down, face-to-face, night after
night, going through every section of
our immigration code to come up with
a comprehensive bill to deal with the
obvious shortcomings, but we did it.
We brought it to the floor of the Sen-
ate and it received 68 votes. There were
14 Republicans who joined the Demo-
crats to pass this comprehensive immi-
gration reform. We sent it to the Re-
publican House of Representatives, and
Speaker Boehner refused to even con-
sider it. So all of our effort and all of
our work was really for nothing.
We continue to face the challenge of
immigration. We know what it is like
at the border. Under this President, we
have seen the worst border situation in
modern times. His refusal to acknowl-
edge the three Central American coun-
tries that are sending all of these im-
migrants to the United States has led
to some horrible circumstances.
Recently, the inspector general of
Health and Human Services came for-
ward with a report on the Trump ad-
ministration’s response to this border
crisis. It was a report on the policy of
zero tolerance. I am sure you will re-
member it. It was under Attorney Gen-
eral Sessions, and he somehow found a
quotation in the Bible to justify forc-
ibly removing children from their par-
ents. We removed 2,880 children from
their parents at the border under this
zero tolerance policy before there was
an uprising in the United States
against it and before the President
backed off of it.
I commend the inspector general’s re-
port on what happened to those chil-
dren—to every American. I saw it first-
hand. I witnessed these children as
they were being removed from their
parents and the trauma they went
through as a result.
So why aren’t we debating the immi-
gration policy on the floor of the U.S.
Senate? I am told that perhaps, later
today, the junior Senator from Utah—
at this point, I think he is the senior
Senator from Utah—will come forward
with a unanimous consent request to
consider fixing one part of the immi-
gration problem. I want to fix that
problem and many more.
THE DREAM ACT
Madam President, I want to make
sure that when we come to the floor to
discuss immigration, as we should,
that we take up the issue of the
DREAM Act.
The DREAM Act was a bill that I in-
troduced in the Senate 18 years ago. It
states, if you were brought to the
United States as a child and are un-
documented in this country but you
have gone through school and have had
no criminal record of any serious con-
sequence, you deserve a chance to be
able to earn your way to legal status
and citizenship. I introduced this bill 18
years ago. It passed in the Senate in 1
year and passed in the House in an-
other, but it has never come up with
the 60 votes—the supermajority re-
quirement—in the Senate.
President Obama was a cosponsor
when he was in the Senate, and when
he had the White House under his con-
trol, I asked him to consider an Execu-
tive order to achieve the same goal,
and he did. He created a program called
DACA. There were 790,000 young people
across America who paid the filing fee,
who went through the criminal back-
ground checks, and who then received
the protection to stay in this country
and work legally.
Of course, in September of 2017,
President Trump abolished this pro-
gram. It took away the protection
these young people had. He was chal-
lenged in court, and the court said we
are going to continue this program
until it is resolved at the highest levels
of our Federal judiciary as to whether
President Trump has this authority.
On November 12, across the street,
the U.S. Supreme Court will consider
that case—790,000 lives and more, for
that matter, hang in the balance of
how the Justices will make this deci-
sion on their future.
This should be debated on the floor of
the Senate. It is why we are here. It is
why we were elected. I think we can
find bipartisan answers to many of
these questions, but we need the Sen-
ate majority leader, the Republican
leader, to really accept the reality of
the Senate actually going to work. In-
stead of speeches by individual Sen-
ators on the floor, as impressive as
they may be, we might actually pass a
law. Think of that—a bill coming to
the floor, subject to amendment, and
actual debate in the Senate Chamber.
We would fill the Galleries. It is such a
novelty. It doesn’t happen anymore.

some specific industries in not only my
State but in the country. I want to
work with Senator LEE in addressing
these concerns and come to a resolu-
tion on this very quickly. I commit to
working with him and his team to
make sure we get to a resolution be-
cause we want the exact same thing,
and this is totally consistent with what
President Trump is trying to do in his
long-term work to fix our broken im-
migration system.
With that, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I want to
recognize my appreciation for the Sen-
ator from Georgia, who has expressed a
good-faith, earnest desire to work with
me on this legislation. I want very
badly to get this passed. It needs to
pass. I want to talk for a few minutes
about the reasons this legislation needs
to pass.
I believe this legislation, as amended,
as I proposed to be enacted today with
Lee amendment No. 939, is itself ready
to be passed into law. In my opinion,
there is no justifiable cause for delay.
We will continue to work on it. I wish
we could pass it today. It should be
passed today because it is ready.
The bill we are talking about, of
course, is the Fairness for High-Skilled
Immigrants Act. This is an important,
bipartisan piece of legislation, one that
I have been proud to sponsor, along
with Senator HARRIS, who has been my
Democratic partner on this issue.
The Fairness for High-Skilled Immi-
grants Act has been a priority of mine
for many years, nearly the entire time
I have been in the Senate. During that
time, it has been the subject of strong
debate and a lot of scrutiny on the Hill.
Like most bills, its path to becoming
law has not always been straight or
clear and certainly not clear of obsta-
cles. But with the passage of the com-
panion bill in the House of Representa-
tives by an overwhelming bipartisan
vote of 365 to 65, I believe that now is
the moment we really can finally move
forward with this small but critically
important fix to our immigration sys-
tem. We could do that. We would be in
a position to do that today had an ob-
jection not been raised.
Notwithstanding that objection, I am
going to continue to work in the com-
ing days to make it a reality because
this is a reform whose time has come,
and I would like to take a moment to
explain why it deserves support from
my colleagues.
Again, we have to take into account
that this passed the House of Rep-
resentatives with a vote of 365 to 65. It
is not easy to find something that can
garner that much bipartisan support.
Wrangling over the nuts and bolts
and fine-print details of the policy, as
extremely as important as that is, can
at times allow us to lose sight of more
basic foundational principles that
should shape any law or any set of laws
we put on the books.
Among other things, our laws should
be consistent with our Nation’s deeply
held beliefs and values. A system of
laws should also be clear and coherent,
meaning that it should not only give
adequate notice of what is required in
order for a person to comply with the
law, but it also should be something
that is capable of being complied with.
Finally, the means employed by any
law should be consistent with the ob-
jectives that law seeks to accomplish.
These are not partisan principles. They
are simple yet incredibly important
guideposts that should direct the ac-
tions of anyone entrusted with crafting
a legal system, as we certainly are in
this Chamber.
Unfortunately, the laws we pass don’t
always live up to the standards of fair
and effective and consistent law-
making. One of the starkest examples
of our failure to abide by these same
principles involves the way we allocate
employment-based green cards.
Few ideas are more central to who we
are as Americans than the notion that
people should be judged and treated by
their government based on their own
merits as individuals—as individuals
with inherent God-given rights—and
not on the basis of the color of their
skin or of the country in which they
were born.
Our Founders wrote: ‘‘We hold these
truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal.’’ Those words are as
much a part of our national creed in
this moment as they were when they
were written some 243 years ago. Our
laws should reflect this. They should
reflect the enduring truth found in
those words, which I believe were in-
spired. They are inspirational to this
day. I believe they were inspired at the
time they wrote them, and that is why
they are lasting in their importance
and their persuasive effect.
Despite this ideal, section 1152 of the
Immigration and Nationality Act pro-
vides that ‘‘the total number of [em-
ployment-based] visas made available
to natives of any single foreign state
. . . in any fiscal year may not exceed
7 percent . . . of the total number of
such visas made available.’’ That rath-
er antiseptic language, technical and
clinical on its face, is, on closer inspec-
tion, deeply out of step with our coun-
try’s commitment to nondiscrimina-
tion and to equal treatment under the
law.
In practice, section 1152’s 7 percent
cap on immigrants from any one coun-
try means that, if two immigrants
apply for an employment-based visa at
precisely the same moment and have
the exact same skills and education
and other factors taken into account
on their applications, one of them may
wait 12 months for a green card while
his counterpart languishes in the green
card backlog for decades. That is not
an exaggeration—literally decades.
The only factor that accounts for
this gross and unfair, difficult to jus-
tify or defend disparity in treatment is
the fact that the second immigrant in
my hypothetical example happened to
have been born in a different country
than the first. They are otherwise iden-
tically situated to each other, but one
may be processed within a year, and
the other may languish for decades.
This is because, under the per-country
cap system, immigrants from larger,
more populated countries are only eli-
gible to receive the same number of
green cards annually as immigrants
from smaller countries. As a result, the
wait times for immigrants from larger
countries have grown and grown decade
after decade, with no end in sight. This
amounts to a de facto country-of-origin
discrimination, plain and simple, and
no amount of legalese or wonkish pol-
icy arguments can cover up that fact.
Beyond its incompatibility with the
deep and abiding principles upon which
this country was founded, the per-
country cap system violates another
one of those commonsense maxims of
good lawmaking that I mentioned ear-
lier: the need for clarity and for con-
sistency in the law.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act pro-
vides that it is unlawful for an em-
ployer ‘‘to discriminate against any in-
dividual with respect to his compensa-
tion, terms, conditions, or privileges of
employment, because of such individ-
ual’s race, color, religion, sex, or na-
tional origin.’’ Yet the conditions cre-
ated by the per-country caps virtually
guarantee that employers on some
level must take into account the na-
tional origin when recruiting certain
immigrant workers.
If prospective hires from one country
will be able to obtain a green card in 12
months, while those from another—
even a person who happens to have su-
perior training and skills—will be un-
able to obtain a green card for possibly
decades, it is virtually unavoidable
that the employer will take national
origin into account. Think about that.
One section of the U.S. Code forbids
employers from taking national origin
into account when making employ-
ment decisions; another section makes
it impossible for an employer not to
take that into account. The grounds on
which that kind of system can be de-
fended as sound public policy are be-
yond me.
The pernicious consequences of this
intrinsically flawed system do not stop
there, as 95 percent of immigrants
stuck in the green card backlog are al-
ready in the United States on tem-
porary visas. In many cases, they have
brought their spouses and their chil-
dren with them to build a life in this
country. Yet, because temporary visa
holders can only sponsor their foreign-
born child up until the time the child
turns 21, many in the backlog, waiting
decades for a green card, are forced to
choose between separating from their
child as the child ages out of the tem-
porary visa or abandoning their dream
of settling in America in order to re-
turn to their home country in order to
keep their family together. In the most
heartbreaking among those cases—of
VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:52 Sep 20, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G19SE6.020 S19SEPT1

which there are sadly far too many—
the child was brought here at a very
young age and may have no memory of
the country to which they would be
forced to return.
It bears repeating. This is happening
not because these individuals broke the
law—they haven’t done anything
wrong—and it is not because they don’t
satisfy the merit-based eligibility cri-
teria needed to receive an employment-
based green card. I understand that im-
migration laws do have consequences,
and we have to follow the law, but it
doesn’t stem from any violation of the
law or any lack of eligibility stemming
from any factor other than country of
origin. It happens for no reason other
than the country in which they happen
to have been born.
If that made sense, if there were
some sound principle and public policy
that anyone could point to, then per-
haps we wouldn’t have occasion to be
talking about changing this law. Per-
haps we wouldn’t have gotten 365 votes,
Democrats and Republicans joining to-
gether in the House of Representatives
voting to pass this. The fact is, I have
yet to meet anyone in this body or in
the House of Representatives who can
defend this flawed policy on its merits
because it makes no sense.
Finally, the per-country cap system
is irredeemably flawed because, among
its other problems, it is also incompat-
ible with the goals that our employ-
ment-based visa system are meant to
advance in the first place. The employ-
ment-based visa system is supposed to
enable American businesses to bring
the best and the brightest to this coun-
try. Yet, under the per-country caps, a
factor that has nothing to do with a
person’s skills or merit distorts and in
many cases ultimately determines the
recruitment process. This weakens the
merit-based portion of our immigra-
tion system. Indeed, it is directly at
war with the supposed purpose of our
employment-based green card system.
Despite its obvious deficiencies, the
per-country caps have been part of our
immigration laws since the 1950s. This
is something that came into our law
during the Elvis Presley era, during
the Buddy Holly era—not exactly
something that was intended to remain
on the books very long. Regardless of
what they intended at the time as far
as how long it should last, I don’t be-
lieve they had good, legitimate reasons
to put it into law then. Whatever rea-
sons they had then certainly don’t
apply now. They are not even discern-
ible to anyone I know today.
It is long past time that we replace
that flawed policy with a more rational
and equitable approach. Fortunately,
the solution to these problems is not
only straightforward, but it is agreed
upon by a broad bipartisan coalition of
Senators and Representatives. We must
simply eliminate the per-country caps
in order to ensure a fair and reasonable
allocation of employment-based green
cards. That is exactly what the Fair-
ness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act
would accomplish. Without the per-
country caps, our skills-based green
card system would operate on a first
come, first served basis, ensuring that
immigrants would be admitted into the
United States based purely on their
merit rather than their country of ori-
gin.
This reform would also ensure that
the hardships caused by decades-long
wait times are eliminated. As I have
said in the past, there is no question
that immigration is one of if not the
most politically fraught issues in Con-
gress right now. It makes it all the
more important for us, at least, to
come together to get something done
in the areas where we can find common
ground. The Fairness for High-Skilled
Immigrants Act is an important point
of common ground.
Any immigration bill that has 35
Senate cosponsors—20 Republicans and
15 Democrats, as this bill does—pre-
sents a unique opportunity to secure a
victory for the American people. The
reason this bill commands such wide-
spread support from all points along
the political spectrum is because, as I
have explained, the arguments in its
favor are not your typical partisan or
ideological arguments. No. They are
commonsense arguments about the
way any rational legal system should
work in that it makes clear that the
per-country caps system must go.
That is what is needed to make our
immigration laws consistent with our
principles, consistent with other laws
on the books, and consistent with the
merits-based objectives this component
of our immigration system is meant to
promote.
The other reason the Fairness for
High-Skilled Immigrants Act has been
so successful in attracting support
from both sides of the aisle is because
we have scrupulously avoided the typ-
ical poison pills that so often doom
many good-faith attempts at immigra-
tion reform. This bill is not com-
prehensive in its approach. It is not a
comprehensive immigration reform
package. It is not even close to that.
That is, in fact, why this bill is some-
thing we can actually get done now.
That is why this bill is so close to
being passed. It is why this bill really
should pass into law today.
While it does not fix many of the
other flaws that plague our broken im-
migration system, it is a great and a
vitally important start to reform. If we
are ever to have a chance at modern-
izing and repairing our immigration
laws, we need to recognize that we can-
not necessarily solve all of our prob-
lems at once. The fact that this is the
case shouldn’t stand in the way of us
starting to work on the issues the
American people sent us here to solve.
We cannot allow the perfect to be the
enemy of the excellent. That is why I
have come to seek unanimous consent
to pass this legislation today.
Look, I understand it has drawn an
objection, but it has drawn an objec-
tion in a way that drew an objection a
few weeks ago from another Member.
We have been able to work through
that Member’s concerns. I am hopeful,
I am optimistic that my colleague who
raised an objection today can be per-
suaded that this bill needs to be passed,
we can address his concerns, and that
we can resolve them.
I will be working with my distin-
guished friend and colleague from
Georgia throughout this weekend to
try to find a solution, some expla-
nation, or, if necessary, language that
can win his support. We are very close
on what we believe is appropriate and
acceptable.
I remain steadfastly convinced that
this law, as written, as amended, as of-
fered up by unanimous consent today
could and should be the law of the land.
I believe it is ready for prime time. It
is ready to become law, but when seek-
ing unanimity on a measure in order to
pass it, one must do everything one can
do in order to seek actual unanimity,
and that is what I intend to do in the
coming days. I intend to be back next
week, making yet another attempt to
pass this bill into law, and I hope and
expect we will be able to do so.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 2486
Mr. President, I rise today to appeal
to my colleagues to support the re-
newal of vital funding for historically
Black colleges and universities and all
minority-serving institutions.
I have risen in this body on more
than one occasion to talk about the
importance of HBCUs and minority-
serving institutions.
Alabama is home to 14 HBCUs—more
than any other State in the country.
They are part of the fabric of our econ-
omy in Alabama and a part of the fab-
ric of our society. They are the pride of
their communities. They are the pride
of those folks who went there and had
relatives who went there and even
those individuals who are not alums or
relatives of alums.
Our HBCUs are a source of enduring
pride in our State and across this coun-
try. They serve an incredibly impor-
tant function. They educate those from
underserved communities more than
any other college or university. It is
important that we continue funding
them because their challenges with
funding are great.
They do not have the endowments
that other colleges and universities
have. They don’t have the source of
funding. It is only through our efforts
in Congress and across the country
that we can continue the great work of
these HBCUs.
Recently, the House passed what is
known as the FUTURE Act, which is
H.R. 2486. My colleague Senator SCOTT

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5594 September 19, 2019
the end of September, all funding for
HBCUs is set to end.
Our act would extend that. We need
to make sure that we fund all of our
HBCUs, that they are not left in the
lurch and not left with any uncertainty
about their future funding. I truly be-
lieve this is such a bipartisan effort
that we can get this across the finish
line. I have urged Senator MCCONNELL
to put this on the floor because it is
quite urgent.
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed
to the immediate consideration of H.R.
2486, which is at the desk; that the bill
be considered read a third time and
passed; and that the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator for Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
am reserving the right to object.
The Senator from Alabama is a val-
ued member of the Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions Committee. En-
suring that historically Black colleges
and universities have continued fund-
ing is something we all want to do.
However, instead of the short-term
patch, I favor a long-term solution.
I am ready to do this, along with a
few other bipartisan higher education
proposals that also have bipartisan
support. Such a package could include
permanent mandatory funding of $255
million for historically Black colleges
and universities and reduction of the
number of questions on the FAFSA
that 20 million families fill out every
year for their Federal aid, as Senators
BENNET and JONES have proposed. I
would like to see the Senate pass again
the legislation Senator MURRAY and I
persuaded the Senate to pass that re-
duces the current FAFSA to 22 ques-
tions. Senators SCHATZ, LEE, and DUR-
BIN have proposed Pell grants for pris-
oners. There is a proposal by Senators
PORTMAN and KAINE and many other bi-
partisan Senators on short-term Pell
grants for job training. We could ex-
pand Pell grant eligibility. We could
increase the maximum Pell grant
award.
These are all things we should be
able to agree on, including funding for
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities. I have been talking with Senator
MURRAY now for several years about
reauthorizing the Higher Education
Act. I intend to discuss this all with
her and with our committee members
next week.
We have the time to do it because,
while the legislation expires at the end
of this month, the money doesn’t for
several more months. So, in the mean-
time, I hope we can work together, as
we often do in our committee, to pass
a smaller package of higher education
proposals, including a long-term pro-
posal for historically Black colleges
and universities, while we continue to
work on the reauthorization of the
Higher Education Act.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what
we are seeing here today really dis-
appoints me. We have, today, a
straightforward opportunity to prevent
a critical part of our higher education
system—HBCUs, Tribal colleges, and
other minority-serving institutions—
from having to deal with a lapse in
funding. We should take it. This is bi-
partisan legislation. It has passed the
House. There is no reason at all to
delay it a minute longer here in the
Senate.
I thank the Senator from Alabama
for his leadership on this. I express my
personal strong support for the FU-
TURE Act, which will give us then
time to work out a permanent fix for
funding HBCUs, Tribal colleges, and
minority-serving institutions through
a comprehensive HEA reauthorization,
which is what I have made clear is nec-
essary.
I appreciate what the Senator from
Tennessee said about moving forward
with higher education reauthorization.
I am hopeful we can continue to work
on reaching a compromise, as we have
done on several other pieces of legisla-
tion. As I have said before, I believe
any reauthorization of the Higher Edu-
cation Act needs to have real answers
to the challenges students are facing
today on affordability and access and
accountability and campus safety. I
truly believe we have an opportunity
to get a comprehensive bill done that
helps solve these challenges for our
students.
I hope the Senator from Tennessee
and our colleagues on the HELP Com-
mittee continue to focus on our efforts
there. Meanwhile, I believe we should
listen to the Senator from Alabama.
We should pass the bipartisan FUTURE
Act instead of playing politics with
valuable and underresourced institu-
tions.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

UNITED AUTO WORKERS STRIKE
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, right
now at this moment, thousands of UAW
workers in Ohio—in places like the
Chevrolet plant in Parma-Cleveland
area, the transmission plant in Toledo,
the plant in Defiance, OH, and all over
the country—are going without their
paychecks and without their health in-
surance to demand that General Mo-
tors respect the work they do to make
their companies successful.
In a nutshell, workers are fed up.
More and more of them are beginning
to see that unions are the best way to
make their voices heard. For too long,
General Motors hasn’t listened. Auto-
workers are the engine behind GM’s
success. GM wouldn’t be making a
dime in profit without the workers who
actually make their cars and trucks.
Back up for a moment. Think about
what has happened to General Motors.
The Presiding Officer has autoworkers
in the State of Indiana, as I do in Ohio.
Back up 10 years, when General Motors
and Chrysler went into bankruptcy.
The taxpayers and workers—through
givebacks—rescued both companies.
For 10 years, GM has gotten more and
more profitable. Workers were working
hard, but workers were making signifi-
cantly less money during those 10
years. Then you saw these companies’
profits increase. GM started sending
more jobs to Mexico to build the Chevy
Blazer, for instance. The same day,
they announced the layoff of one shift
in Lordstown. Then there were the
stock buybacks from the Trump tax
cuts, where 80 percent of the tax bene-
fits went to the richest 1 percent of
people in this country. The stock
buybacks with the GM executives
meant tens of millions of dollars more
in their pocket. Yet they continue to
squeeze workers. Now workers are sim-
ply saying: We want to be, in essence,
paid back for the givebacks we did
when we, as taxpayers and workers,
rescued that company.
Rather than invest in American
workers, the company shut down its
most productive plant in North Amer-
ica and laid off hundreds of workers—
4,500 workers, actually—in Lordstown,
OH, while announcing they are going
to build a place in Mexico. They could
retool the Lordstown plant. They could
build the Blazer in Ohio, but instead
they throw workers out of a job, and
they pay workers way less to make
cars in Mexico.
Now GM workers are saying: Enough.
I stand with them. They are standing
up and fighting for increased invest-
ments in their local communities. We
know if that Lordstown plant would re-
open with the Blazer or with an elec-
tric vehicle—a couple of electric vehi-
cles or whatever they put there—we
know what that would mean for those
Lordstown families, those GM families.
We know what it would mean to that
community.
I spoke yesterday with Dave Green,
the former President of GM Local 1112.
He is now working in another GM plant
in the Presiding Officer’s home State.
He is away from his family. He is away
from home. He didn’t choose that. Doz-
ens of workers are in that situation all
because GM wanted to move its produc-
tion offshore. Those workers are say-
ing: Enough.
In Lordstown, the workers whose jobs
GM took are picketing in solidarity
with other UAW workers at the empty
plant. Reporters asked them why, and
they answered: Brotherhood—brother
and sister support. Workers who trans-
fer to other plants in Michigan, Mis-
souri, Kentucky, and Indiana are com-
ing back to join them. That is what the

labor movement is all about: brother-
hood, sisterhood, solidarity. It is about
the recognition that workers should
have a voice and should have a share in
the profits they create for their compa-
nies. GM made more than $10 billion in
North America in 2018. That is $10,000
million. It is the UAW workers who
made that money for the company.
What did GM do? They shut down
plants.
Now they have thrown striking work-
ers off their health insurance. We heard
from one worker in Local 14 in Toledo
who said his 4-year-old daughter,
Chesney, had a doctor’s appointment
scheduled next week to check on the
tubes in her ears that help her hear,
but GM canceled that family’s insur-
ance so they had to cancel the appoint-
ment. That is what has happened. It is
despicable.
GM needs to agree to a contract that
honors the dignity of work—a contract
that recognizes the autoworkers, com-
munities, and families who help drive
the success of the auto industry in
Ohio and across the country.
Again, 10 years ago, taxpayers res-
cued GM out of bankruptcy. Workers
agreed to major givebacks to that com-
pany, taking much less money in order
to save the company. GM profits have
soared. GM executive compensations
have exploded upward. GM owes that to
our communities, and GM owes that to
its workers.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO ALAINA VIK
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is
that time of the week—the end of the
week in the Senate—when I come to
the floor and recognize someone special
in the great State of Alaska, someone
who is doing something important for
their community, for the State, for the
country. It is the highlight of my
week, and I know it is for our pages.
We have some new pages here. It is
commonly recognized as the favorite
speech of the week for the pages be-
cause they get to hear stories about
real people, particularly people in
Alaska.
You will hear a lot of these speeches
as you are here working hard in the
Senate.
We are glad the new pages are here.
As you know, my State is certainly
one of the most interesting, imagined
States in the whole country. By the
way, people watching in the Gallery—
my friend Scott Lee is up there—
watching on TV, come up to Alaska.
You will love it. I guarantee you, it
will be the trip of a lifetime. No one
comes to Alaska and is disappointed.
I like to talk about Alaska on the
Senate floor. People see a lot of what is
going on in the State on the nature
channels and the adventure channels.
There is a story about Alaska on cable
TV, it seems like, daily, almost hourly.
Not nearly enough of these stories
focus on the people who live there—
independent, patriotic, generous men,
women, and, yes, kids, children, who
call Alaska home.
Today, I want to recognize 13-year-
old Alaina Vik, who lives in Eagle
River, AK. That is a beautiful commu-
nity, about 15 miles north of Anchor-
age.
Alaina is a young woman with a big
heart. She lives with her mother, Amy,
who owns her own real estate company,
and her father, Curtis, who is an Alas-
ka State trooper. He is someone I know
well because he and I served together
with the very outstanding Marine
Corps Reserve unit based in Alaska,
Echo Company, 4th Recon Battalion.
Trooper Vik, semper fi.
To you and Amy, great job on raising
such an exceptional daughter.
Why is she so exceptional? Let’s get
into what Alaina has done for us. But,
first, let me talk a little bit about
what is going on in Alaska because I
always like to update what is hap-
pening in this speech.
I was home for the whole month of
August—actually, almost 5 weeks. I did
a week of my own on Marine Corps Re-
serve duty. It was great to be home. I
got to travel all over the State. When
I say ‘‘travel all over,’’ we are talking
hundreds, if not thousands, of miles,
literally, between communities. There
was a lot going on.
Unfortunately, as it happens in so
many summers in Alaska, fires were
taking their toll, but the weather was
amazing, with beautiful blue skies. For
the most part, the sun was out. It was
perfect for fishing, hiking, and camp-
ing—all the things that so many people
in Alaska who come to visit and live
here do in the summer.
Now we are heading into the fall.
Leaves are starting to turn. It is moose
hunting season. The snow isn’t far
away for most of the State. In some
parts of the State, it is actually al-
ready on the ground.
Some might say that winter is com-
ing, but I think it is too soon. Winter
is coming, but not just yet. I will let
you know when that happens.
School has started, and Alaina Vik
has entered eighth grade. Her favorite
subject is art. Like so many Alaskans,
she has been busy. What has she been
busy doing? Why are we honoring this
young Alaskan who is doing a lot for
our State?
First, as a Girl Scout in Troop 690,
under the amazing leadership of the
troop leader, Mrs. Melissa Jones,
Alaina sold more cookies than any
other Girl Scout in the entire State of
Alaska—more than 5,000 boxes. That is
amazing; isn’t it?
I love Girl Scout cookies. I think
they are the best in the country, but
5,000 boxes in one State is pretty darn
impressive.
What is her secret? She said: ‘‘My
mom told me to go out almost every
day to sell cookies, to talk to people
and to interest them in buying the
cookies.’’
Her older brother, Kyle, who, by the
way, is an Eagle Scout—you could see
what a high-achieving family this is—
also helped coach his sister and helped
take her out to sell cookies.
Alaina said: ‘‘I’m a really hard work-
er when it comes to Girl Scout cook-
ies.’’ Obviously, she is—5,000 boxes.
Selling cookies just wasn’t good
enough for her. She wanted to do more
for her Girl Scout project. So she took
her passion to the next level, using her
selling skills to help others and focus-
ing on the men and women in our mili-
tary, particularly those who are de-
ployed.
In Alaska, we proudly boast of hav-
ing the record of more vets per capita
than any State in the country. So this
is something that a lot of our commu-
nities can get behind. She and her fel-
low Girl Scouts began to send our de-
ployed military members Girl Scout
cookies. She got the idea when the fa-
ther of one of the members of her Girl
Scout troop was deployed. Her troop
wanted to make sure he felt remem-
bered on his deployment.
All told, in 2017, she was able to do-
nate 800 boxes to our troops, some of
whom are deployed in Kuwait and
Qatar.
She didn’t stop there. As I have often
said, we live in one of the most patri-
otic States in the country. Alaina Vik
is just one more bit of proof of that.
She wanted to do more for the men and
women in uniform. She said:
They’re fighting for us. They’re protecting
us. They deserved to be appreciated [and re-
membered] and honored.
This is a 13-year-old girl. Remember,
she is also the daughter of a recon ma-
rine.
With the help of her mother, Amy,
and her father, Curtis, and her two
younger brothers, she expanded her ef-
fort into what is now called Operation
Sweet Support. You could find that on
Facebook. In addition to just cookies,
she is also sending snacks, pencils,
duct tape, and toys. Who doesn’t need a
toy or duct tape when they are de-
ployed? You can use it for everything.
When the news got out about this
project, she started to receive dona-
tions from all over the community in
Eagle River and all over Alaska. So far
this year, through this project, she has
sent out over 98 care packages to Alas-
kan troops who are deployed overseas,
particularly in Kosovo and Kuwait. She
is aiming to send out 75 more by the
end of the year—one 13-year-old girl in
the great State of Alaska.
She puts a personalized handwritten
note into each of the boxes thanking
them. ‘‘This is my way of saying thank
you,’’ one of her notes reads.
Here is another one:
You are amazing and appreciated and
loved. Thank you for your service.

That is another note from Alaina to
our service men and women deployed
overseas.
She gets notes back, of course. One
wrote:
Thank you for everything you’ve done for
us. Please keep supporting the troops [and
sending cookies].
Our military members love cookies.
They say it makes a big difference.
Someone also sent her an American
flag that was flown overseas in appre-
ciation of the cookies, as well as a unit
coin, a military coin, sent to Alaina by
our appreciative troops. ‘‘It was amaz-
ing,’’ she said, when she got this.
As someone who has been deployed
myself, away from family and friends, I
know what it means to get such care
packages. It means the world. It means
that people back home are remem-
bering what you are doing.
Alaina, thank you for your great
work supporting our troops, for the ex-
ample you are setting for all the young
men and women, not just in Alaska but
America.
Amy and Curtis, thanks for raising
such a wonderful daughter.

NATIONAL CHILDHOOD CANCER AWARENESS
MONTH
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise
today to introduce a resolution that
would recognize September as National
Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. In
the United States, more than 15,000
kids are diagnosed with cancer every
single year, and more than 300,000 chil-
dren are diagnosed globally.
On average, more than 75 children in
West Virginia alone are diagnosed with
cancer every year, which has been a
steady increase over the last 10 years.
We have made a lot of progress over
the last few decades in research for pre-
vention and care, but there is more
work to be done. That is why I am here
today to continue the drumbeat and
elevate the issue.
I will share a story of a young man I
met just last week. On Friday, I had
the honor of visiting with students and
teachers at George Washington High
School in Charleston, WV. One student
by the name of Nicholas ‘‘Nick’’ Spence
came up to me during my visit and
shared that at age 15 he was diagnosed
with cancer. He later sent me a letter
telling me about his story and asked
me to help raise awareness of childhood
cancer, which I assumed we had al-
ready done since we have done it for
adult cancer.
Nick’s letter goes like this:
Dear Senator Manchin,
Thank you for visiting my school on Fri-
day. It was really cool to meet you. As I
shared with you in person, at age 15 my life
was changed forever. Before then, it never
crossed my mind that I would become a can-
cer patient, much less a pediatric one.
I was diagnosed with cancer and underwent
chemotherapy. As a result, in May 2018, I had
to have my leg amputated.
After two long years, I am proud to say
that I finally overcame and defeated my can-
cer, and I’m currently a senior at George
Washington High School.
I feel very strongly that there needs to be
more awareness about childhood cancer in
West Virginia, and I appreciated speaking
with you about that during your visit.
That’s why I’m writing today to ask you to
continue fighting for West Virginians and to
do whatever you can to help raise awareness
about childhood cancer.
Signed, Nick Spence
Thank you, Nick, for standing up and
reaching out to me. I will never forget
how you walked across the gym after
we were done with the meeting with all
of the students at your high school,
and I was impressed by your willing-
ness to stand up and come over and tell
me, basically, what you were concerned
about and what you want to change.
In addition, I would also like to rec-
ognize some very special guests who
have driven here today from West Vir-
ginia, and they are in the Senate
Chamber today. From Charleston, WV,
we have Kelly Wymer, Ali Wymer, and
Cherie White. I thank them for attend-
ing and being here. They are in town
representing the West Virginia Kids
Cancer Crusaders at the CureFest here
in DC on the National Mall.
When Ali was just 61⁄2 years old, she
was diagnosed with cancer. She under-
went 21⁄2 years of treatment, including
two surgeries and chemotherapy.
We are so proud to have Ali here in
the Chamber with us today. She is cur-
rently 21 years old and healthy as can
be. They said ‘‘healthy as a horse.’’ I
say ‘‘healthy as can be.’’ She is a stu-
dent at BridgeValley Community and
Technical College, majoring in
healthcare—what else?
Nick, I know you are at home watch-
ing this now, and I just want to thank
you. I really want to thank you for
sharing your story with me. It really
touched me how brave you are for
speaking up and advocating for people
other than yourself.
I am glad we were able to do this in
such quick order. Usually things don’t
happen this quickly in Washington,
but, truly, when it comes to the chil-
dren of our country and our home
State, it means so much to us.
I am proud to say that this is a bipar-
tisan resolution, and I have teamed up
with Senator JOSH HAWLEY from Mis-
souri to introduce this resolution. This
resolution is also supported by Senator
JACK REED from Rhode Island and my
fellow West Virginia Senator, SHELLEY
MOORE CAPITO.
In addition to recognizing September
as National Childhood Cancer Aware-
ness Month, this resolution calls on
Federal, State, and local governments,
along with nonprofit organizations, to
create and host programs and activi-
ties that focus on increasing public
knowledge on the risks of cancer.
Finally, this resolution recognizes
the human toll of cancer and makes a
pledge that the United States of Amer-
ica will make the prevention and cure
of cancer a public health priority.
I am proud to introduce this resolu-
tion. And, Nick, thank you again. Ali,
thank you, and thanks to all of those
who are so brave and the families who
support them and help raise awareness
for childhood cancer.
I urge all of my colleagues—all of my
colleagues—to join me in supporting
this resolution.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on be-
half of myself and Mr. REED, as the
chair and ranking member of the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee, as well
as the cochairs of the Senate Army
Caucus, it is our honor to pay tribute
to a great leader, an exceptional offi-
cer, and a senior executive of the U.S.
Army, Mr. Bernard P. Ingold. Mr.

numerous critical issues of enduring
importance to the Army, Congress, and

Bernie Ingold has served our Army

of the Army civilian. A native of
Michigan, Mr. Ingold was commis-
sioned in 1979 as a judge advocate gen-

legislative liaison, and as the deputy
director for legal policy in the Office of
the Secretary of Defense.
After serving 20 years on Active
Duty, Mr. Ingold retired and continued
his service as a civilian in the Depart-
ment of the Army. From 1999 to 2010,
he served as the deputy chief legisla-
tive counsel for the Army’s office of
the chief of legislative liaison. In 2010,
he entered into the senior executive
service and began his role as the prin-
ciple deputy for the office of the chief
of legislative liaison. For the past 10
years, Mr. Ingold has implemented and
enhanced strategic partnerships with
Congress. He has assisted seven Army
chiefs of legislative liaison and helped
the Army significantly advance its re-
lationships with both legislative Cham-
bers and improved and broadened con-
gressional support for Army priorities.
Mr. Ingold managed complex issues
through multiple legislative cycles, en-
abling the Army to receive the nec-
essary resources to improve readiness,
accelerate modernization, and reform
processes to support combat oper-
ations, sustain the all-volunteer force,
and improve the quality of life for sol-
diers, Army civilians, and their fami-
lies. Throughout his career, he has
been a true professional, dedicated sol-
dier, leader, officer, and senior execu-
tive.
On behalf of the Senate, we thank
Bernard P. Ingold, his wife Lolita, and
their entire family for their continued
commitment, sacrifice, and contribu-
tions to this great Nation. We join our
colleagues in wishing him future suc-
cess as he transitions into retirement.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNI-
VERSITY OF TENNESSEE ‘‘PRIDE
OF THE SOUTHLAND’’ MARCHING
BAND
∑ Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
today I wish to recognize the 150th an-
niversary of the University of Ten-
nessee ‘‘Pride of the Southland’’
marching band and congratulate this
esteemed band on 150 years of success.
The ‘‘Pride of the Southland’’ march-
ing band was founded in 1869 by Gusta-
vus Robert Knabe, from Germany. Dur-
ing the 150 years of the marching band,
there have been 10 directors, including
the current director, Dr. Donald Ryder,
who was proceeded by both Dr. Gary
Sousa and Dr. W.J. Julian. It was Dr.
Julian who created the now famous
‘‘Circle Drill.’’
Since the band was formed after the
close of the Civil War, it had a military
style with both uniforms and music.
The marching band maintained a mili-
tary look until 1951, when the then-
band director, Walter M. Ryba,
changed the look of the uniform and
created a new look on the field. When
Dr. W.J. Julian became the director in
1961, the marching band was moved
from the military department and
placed in the music education cur-
riculum. With this change, they re-
ceived new uniforms consisting of navy
blue trousers and jackets with an or-
ange and white military-style vest
overlay with braided shoulder straps
and a white plume with an orange and
white shako. This is the uniform cur-
rently still in use today.
Over the last 150 years, the marching
band has grown dramatically from 13
members to over 350 members. With
such a deep and rich history, it is no
surprise that several families have had
multiple generations who have partici-
pated in the ‘‘Pride.’’
The ‘‘Pride of the Southland’’ march-
ing band has been recognized inter-
nationally for their unique marching
style and music, including the innova-
tive ‘‘Circle Drill,’’ which has become a
strong tradition each fall, and ‘‘Rocky
Top,’’ which started as the band’s half-
time show in October 1972, during the
Vols annual football game versus Ala-
bama.
In 1982, the marching band opened
the World’s Fair in Knoxville and has
performed in 15 Presidential inaugura-
tion—a record unmatched by any civil-
ian organization—with the first being
President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953
and, most recently, President Donald
Trump. The band has appeared in over
50 bowl games, including the Rose
Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Or-
ange Bowl, Citrus Bowl, Peach Bowl,
Sun Bowl, Hall of Fame Bowl and the
1998 National Championship Fiesta
Bowl. They have also performed on the
field with stars such as Charlie Daniels
Band, Kenny Rogers, Kenny Chesney,
Lee Greenwood, Roy Acuff, the Osborne
Brothers, and many others.
At home in Neyland Stadium, the
‘‘Pride of the Southland’’ band has im-
pressed Vol fans with its pre-game
show, which is considered one of the
finest ever performed. The band cre-
ated the ‘‘V–O–L–S’’ chant, the opening
of the ‘‘Power T,’’ ‘‘USA,’’ and more.
I would like to recognize the ‘‘Pride
of the Southland’’ marching band for
its 150 years of rich history and com-
mend the University of Tennessee and
all band members, past and present, for
the part they have played to make the
program such a storied success. When I
was 14, I sold programs at Neyland Sta-
dium. There is nothing more exciting
than watching a football game in
Neyland Stadium, and if your seats are
by the band, that is even better.
There are no other traditions in the
University of Tennessee’s history that
can surpass the astounding accomplish-
ments and success that the ‘‘Pride of
the Southland’’ marching band has in
its 150 years of service to a great uni-
versity.∑

TRIBUTE TO RICK LATER
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
Fire Marshal Rick Later of Beaverhead
County for his 40 years of service pro-
tecting the folks of Dillon and Beaver-
head County.
Later’s experience with firefighting
began in 1974, when he joined the Dil-
lon Volunteer Fire Department as a
volunteer. After decades of volunteer
service, Later became fire marshal in
2003. In his new role, he was given the
responsibility of not only managing
fire safety and prevention in Dillon,
but overseeing the safety of Montanans
across Fire District No. 2.
The district stretches from Glen, to
the south end of the reservoir, to Horse
Prairie to Bannack. Spanning over
5,500 square miles, the county is rough-
ly the size of the State of Connecticut.
As fire marshal, Later ran the fire
hall diligently every day. He oversaw
equipment maintenance and managed
fire investigations and building inspec-
tions. He also worked closely with the
Dillon City Council and developed a re-
lationship with the Beaverhead County
Planning Board and Zoning Commis-
sion.
Later’s service to his community and
commitment to volunteering is exem-
plary of the Montana spirit. I commend
him for 40 years of service, and I join
the folks in Dillon and Beaverhead
County in gratitude for his insight and
leadership over the years.∑

TRIBUTE TO BROOKE MILLS
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am
proud to recognize Brooke Mills of Con-
cord as September’s Granite Stater of
the Month for her work advocating for
concussion awareness and prevention
in New Hampshire and across the coun-
try.
In March of 2014, Brooke, then a
freshman in high school, suffered a se-
vere concussion during a mandatory
handball game in gym class. The rami-
fications of this concussion went be-
yond the physical bruising in her brain
and affected everything from her social
life to her academics.
Brooke suffered from memory loss
and had to wear sunglasses indoors be-
cause the lighting in her school was
too harsh, which led to teasing and bul-
lying from her classmates. She also
had to strictly limit the time she spent
on her phone, which affected her abil-
ity to hang out with friends and use so-
cial media, a difficult situation for
someone who just started high school.
However, instead of letting her con-
cussion get the best of her, Brooke
turned her injury into a platform that
she used to educate people about the
dangers of concussions, while also pro-
viding reassurance for others who were
going through similar trauma that
they too could overcome the lasting
impacts of a concussion.
Brooke started a blog called Finding
My Way, where she writes about her
concussion and how it impacts her day-
to-day life in the hopes of helping oth-
ers suffering from concussions feel less
alone. She also launched an organiza-
tion called Lessen the Impact, dedi-
cated to sharing her story and pro-
viding resources to help identify and
prevent a concussion.

Additionally, Brooke is a peer-to-
peer speaker for the Brain Injury Asso-
ciation of New Hampshire, where she
gives presentations at high schools and
middle schools about how to identify a
concussion and stresses the importance
of being kind and understanding to
those who suffer from this invisible in-
jury.
As a result of Brooke’s advocacy, as
Governor of New Hampshire, I declared
the third Friday in September as Con-
cussion Awareness Day in New Hamp-
shire. This week, with a bipartisan
group of my colleagues, I introduced a
resolution in the U.S. Senate to recog-
nize this day nationally.
Concussion Awareness Day is also
recognized by other States, as well as
by the National Brain Injury Associa-
tion. There is also a companion resolu-
tion recognizing this day that has been
introduced in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives.
I want to thank Brooke for all that
she has done and continues to do to
turn a challenging experience into an
opportunity to educate and bring
awareness to Granite Staters and
Americans about the dangers of con-
cussions. She has truly demonstrated
the grit, resilience, and empathy that
reflects the best of our State.∑

TRIBUTE TO DAN OHNESORGE
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am
pleased to recognize Mr. Dan ‘‘Ohno’’
Ohnesorge on the occasion of his retire-
ment. In his 11 years as the Enid
Woodring airport director, Dan has
been a fixture in the Oklahoma avia-
tion community, even serving as presi-
dent of the Oklahoma Airport Opera-
tors Association for the 2012–13 term.
In recognition of his passionate service
to the Woodring Airport, Dan was
awarded the Oklahoma Airport Man-
ager of the Year in 2016, the same year
that Enid Woodring Regional Airport
was recognized as the Oklahoma Air-
port of the Year by the Oklahoma Air-
port Operators Association.
Dan has been a passionate advocate
for aviation since 1975. After grad-
uating from Florida State University
with a BS in meteorology, he earned a
masters of aero science from Embry-
Riddle Aeronautical University. In his
time in the U.S. Air Force, he flew F–
16s with the 307th Fighter Squadron,
and his dedication to serving the coun-
try has continued to the present.
In his time as president of the Okla-
homa Air Force Association, Dan has
worked tirelessly to ensure the men
and women training to become pilots
at Vance Air Force Base are able to
augment their training by using the
runway at Woodring Airport. He was
instrumental in the decision to locate
a memorial honoring the men and
women who gave their lives in service
to their country during the Vietnam
war at the Woodring Airport. It is a
testament to his vision for this memo-
rial that Oklahomans from across the
State regularly visit this memorial.
Under his leadership, Enid Woodring
Regional Airport expanded the main
runway which enhanced the safety and
capability of Vance Air Force Base’s
pilot training program and built a new
terminal building which will more effi-
ciently serve the general aviation and
military pilots and other users of the
growing airport.
I am thankful that I have gotten to
know Dan through his passion for avia-
tion and his commitment to the men
and women who serve in our Nation’s
Armed Forces. I know that I join his
family, the Enid Woodring Regional
Airport, Vance Air Force Base, and the
city of Enid in thanking Dan for his
years of service and contributions to
the aviation community.
Congratulations on your retirement.∑

REMEMBERING JOYCE ADAMS
∑ Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I
would like to remember in the record a
longtime member of the U.S. Military
Academy West Point’s admissions
team, Ms. Joyce Adams.
For the last 39 years, Joyce Adams
has served with distinction as valued
member of the West Point admissions
family. From 1980 until 2002, Joyce
Adams served as a candidate techni-
cian first in the mid-Atlantic region
and later in the far West region. In this
capacity, she assisted more than 60,000
candidates navigate the West Point ap-
plication process.
In 2002, Joyce was promoted to be
congressional nominations specialist.
In this position, she assisted all 541
congressional offices in navigating the
nomination process. During her more
than 17 years as the U.S. Military
Academy nominations specialist, Joyce
directly impacted more than 100,000
candidate nominations and earned the
respect and admiration of candidates,
parents, admissions officers, and Mem-
bers of Congress.
In addition to this work, Joyce also
volunteered to serve as the candidate
technician for all recruited athlete
files. Thanks to her hard work and at-
tention to detail, all of West Point’s
varsity athletic teams were positioned
to compete at the highest level.
I have it on the highest authority
from West Point that Joyce’s impact
on the directorate of admissions, on
the U.S. Military Academy West Point,
and on the Nation will be felt for years
to come. The candidates she assisted
have risen to the highest levels of mili-
tary and civilian leadership, and she
will be missed.∑

REMEMBERING DR. RAVINDRA
LAL
∑ Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I rise
today with deep sadness, but also with
reverence to remember Dr. Ravindra
Behari ‘‘Ravi’’ Lal, who died on July
23, 2019. Dr. Lal was an esteemed educa-
tor and innovator in the field of phys-
ics. His impact on Alabama A&M Uni-
versity and the Huntsville area is in-
calculable.
Dr. Lal was born on October 5, 1935,
in Agra, India. He was one of three
children born to Avadh Behari and
Radhapyari Lal Mathur. Dr. Lal earned
his Ph.D. in solid state physics from
Agra University in 1962 and married his
wife Usha in the same year. In 1964, Dr.
Lal and Usha moved to Huntsville,
where they raised their son Amit. That
same year, Dr. Lal began his teaching
and research career for the National
Academy of Sciences as a resident re-
search associate at NASA/Marshall
Space Flight Center. It was there that
Dr. Lal conducted groundbreaking
work on the effects of radiation on
thermal control coatings for Apollo
and other spacecrafts. Through a spe-
cial recommendation from famed aero-
space engineer, Dr. Wernher von Braun,
Dr. Lal earned a rare extension of his
postdoctoral associate position with
NASA.
Following his time at Marshall Space
Flight Center, Dr. Lal worked for 2
years as a senior scientist and assist-
ant professor at the Indian Institute of
Technology in Delhi, India. He re-
turned to the United States in 1970 as a
senior research associate for the Uni-
versity of Alabama in Huntsville, leav-
ing in 1973 to become an associate pro-
fessor of physics at Paine College in
Augusta, GA.
Dr. Lal made his return to Huntsville
in 1975 to begin his long and impressive
career at Alabama A&M University—
AAMU—rising from associate professor
of physics to department chair to uni-
versity eminent scholar. In 1978, during
his tenure at AAMU, he was chosen by
NASA as a principal investigator for a
space shuttle experiment on the maid-
en flight of the Spacelab-3 Mission in
1985, making Dr. Lal one of the first
university professors to be selected for
an experiment on space shuttle and the
first from AAMU. During this project,
he worked as one of the pioneers in
crystal growth experiments in micro-
gravity. Dr. Lal later served for 7 years
as the principal investigator for a
project from NASA’s Commercializa-
tion of Space program.
Dr. Lal was deeply committed to
bettering the AAMU and Huntsville
communities during his tenure as an
educator and beyond. In 1997, Dr. Lal
launched the popular Annual Nobel
Laureate Lecture Series, which has
since brought 20 Nobel Prize winners to
Huntsville. He was instrumental in es-
tablishing AAMU’s masters and doc-
torate programs in physics. AAMU
celebrated his commitment to his field
and students in 2005, naming Dr. Lal an
AAMU eminent scholar. Recognized as
one of the first Indian couples in
Huntsville, Dr. Lal and his wife Usha
mentored and advised Indian families
new to their city and were actively in-
volved in helping to build a temple, the
Hindu Cultural Center of North Ala-
bama, for the local Indian community.
Dr. Lal also served on the board for
AshaKiran, an organization that pro-
vides assistance to individuals from
multicultural backgrounds that are ex-
periencing crises.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5599
September 19, 2019
Dr. Lal was highly respected and
celebrated in his field, earning recogni-
tion from the Alabama House of Rep-
resentatives in 1985 for his achieve-
ments on NASA’s Spacelab-3 experi-
ment. He was also awarded NASA’s
Public Service Achievement award for
those same achievements by NASA Ad-
ministrator James C. Fletcher. Dr. Lal
was selected for the Professional of the
Year award by the Huntsville Associa-
tion of Technical Societies, the Noble
prize in Science by the National Asso-
ciation for Equal opportunity in Higher
Education, and the Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award from AAMU Research In-
stitute.
Dr. Lal will be dearly missed by all
whose lives he touched, both through
his work as a brilliant educator and
scientist and as a pillar in the Hunts-
ville community. Both Alabama and
the United States have benefited im-
measurably from his contributions to
the field of physics and space re-
search.∑

REMEMBERING DEB BOWMAN
∑ Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor the life of Deb Bowman.
There is a difference between public
servants and bureaucrats, and we have
known or dealt with both. Our office
spends an incredible amount of time
and energy helping constituents bust
through the Federal bureaucracy, and
unfortunately, we often bump heads
with federal bureaucrats. It is time-
consuming and aggravating for con-
stituents. After experiences like these,
we unfortunately have a tendency to
stereotype all government employees
in that manner.
Thankfully, that is not always the
case. There are examples of legitimate
public servants, often behind the
scenes, who truly seek to make the
lives of our citizens better. One of
those special individuals is Deb Bow-
man.
Deb Bowman was the truest, most
sincere—and brutally honest—public
servant I have had the honor of know-
ing.
For those of us who knew Deb, espe-
cially her family—her husband Randy,
her children Brooke and Jessamine,
and her grandkids—our hearts ache. At
just 65 years old, Deb passed away on
September 17, 2019, after a fairly recent
lung cancer diagnosis. Years earlier,
Deb became a kidney transplant recipi-
ent, and I believe that experience and
the other hardships in her life shaped
her view of public service.
Deb was a loyal friend who worked
with me while I served as Governor.
She was a tremendous asset on my 2002
transition team, as a senior adviser
and cabinet secretary. Prior to that,
Deb was an adviser to Governors
Mickelson and Janklow and she went
on to serve Governor Daugaard before
her retirement in 2014.
It is not hard to understand how four
Governors saw the same value and pas-
sion in Deb. It is a testament to the
legacy she has left.
Deb was a fierce conversationalist.
Her ability to identify with those less
fortunate was her signature quality.
She was able to put a ‘‘face’’ on the
policy decisions that were made and re-
minded Governors, legislators, and
State employees that the monetary
and policy decisions we make impact
real people and families. She was a
tough and relentless advocate for those
less fortunate. And she inspired under-
standing about the role society and
State government played when it came
to children, the poor, and the elderly.
Often, Deb would be outright arguing
a position with me, and she would say,
‘‘Oh now come on Governor, that’s
‘bullcrap’, have you considered . . . .’’
Needless to say, Deb won those debates
multiple times, and our State is better
off for it.
She understood that her value was
not mimicking the opinions being ex-
pressed around the table. She brought
compassion to her advocacy, and I be-
lieve it made me a better Governor.
Her service was not without sacrifice.
On top of time away from her family
and the strain upon her health, her em-
pathy was so deep and pure that she
carried the weight of the vulnerable
through long hours and personal an-
guish. Yet despite many times being
dismissed as the lone, unpopular voice,
she would take a drive around the cap-
itol, think over her argument, and
show up with a new line of reasoning.
She was persistent.
When I think of the rare public serv-
ant like Deb, I am reminded of Mat-
thew 23:11: ‘‘The greatest among you
must be a servant.’’ Deb was a phe-
nomenal public servant, for all the
right reasons.
Deb could have been the CEO of any
organization and made a bunch more
money. She was intelligent, a hard
worker, a professional, a leader. She
chose public service, and in doing so,
she was a friend, to me and to many.
Thank you, Deb, for showing all of us
what a true public servant looks like.∑

REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY

WHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO
COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TER-
RORISM THAT WAS ESTAB-

13224 ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2001—PM

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States, together with an accompanying
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to per-
sons who commit, threaten to commit,
or support terrorism declared in Execu-
tive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001,
is to continue in effect beyond Sep-
tember 23, 2019.
The crisis constituted by the grave
acts of terrorism and threats of ter-
rorism committed by foreign terror-
ists, including the terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001, in New York and
Pennsylvania and against the Pen-
tagon, and the continuing and imme-
diate threat of further attacks on
United States nationals or the United
States that led to the declaration of a
national emergency on September 23,
2001, has not been resolved. This crisis
continues to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity, foreign policy, and economy of
the United States. For this reason, I
have determined that it is necessary to
continue the national emergency de-
clared in Executive Order 13224 with re-
spect to persons who commit, threaten
to commit, or support terrorism.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–137. A joint resolution adopted by the
Legislature of the State of California urging
the United States Congress to enact legisla-
tion to repeal the Government Pension Off-
set and the Windfall Elimination Provision
from the Social Security Act; to the Com-
mittee on Finance.
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 3
Whereas, Two Federal Social Security Ad-
ministration laws, the Windfall Elimination
Provision and the Government Pension Off-
set, passed by Congress more than 30 years
ago without statistical analysis, diminish or
eliminate the fully earned Social Security
benefits or large numbers of public service
employees in California: and
Whereas, These provisions affect workers
who have been employed in a government po-
sition that is not coordinated with the So-
cial Security program, such as California
public school teachers who have not been
able to receive Social Security credits since
1965; and
Whereas, Most peace officers, including the
California Highway Patrol, firefighters, and
many other public servants working for cit-
ies and special districts are not covered by
Social Security, making them subject to
these provisions; and
Whereas, In California, more than 300,000
retirees have had their Social Security bene-
fits diminished or completely eliminated by
these laws; and
Whereas, Effective government requires
highly qualified and motivated personnel,
and California government agencies need to
compete to recruit and retain outstanding
employees, including hiring 16,000 new public
school teachers each year; and
Whereas, The recruitment and retention of
qualified individuals reentering the work-
force is impeded by these two provisions,
which reduce or eliminate the Social Secu-
rity retirement benefits either earned by
workers, themselves, or received through de-
pendent status; and
Whereas, The Government Pension Offset
severely cuts, and usually eliminates, all
spousal and survivor benefits that were
earned from what is deemed by the State of
California to be community property in-
come; and
Whereas, The Government Pension Offset
requires that a recipient of benefits report
any yearly cost-of-living increase in the re-
cipient’s public pension, so that the recipi-
ent’s Social Security benefits may be re-
duced by two-thirds of that amount; and
Whereas, The Windfall Elimination Provi-
sion cuts earned Social Security benefits
from work that is separate from the work for
which the individual earned a pension from a
governmental entity: and
Whereas, The Windfall Elimination Provi-
sion subverts the purpose of Social Security
retirement benefits by eliminating the for-
mula that reimburses low-income workers at
a higher rate than high-income workers,
causing severe hardships for those who have
not had high-paying public service; and
Whereas, Until 2005, there were no require-
ments that a public employer advise new
workers that they would be subject to these
penalties; Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of
the State of California, jointly, That the Legis-
lature requests that the Congress of the
United States enact legislation to repeal the
Government Pension Offset and the Windfall
Elimination Provision from the Social Secu-
rity Act, and further requests that President
Donald Trump sign that legislation; and be
it further
Resolved, That the Secretary or the Senate
transmit copies of this resolution to the
President and the Vice President of the
United States, to the Speaker of the House
of Representatives, to the Majority Leader of
the Senate, to each Senator and Representa-
tive from California in the Congress of the

United States, and to the author for appro-
priate distribution.
POM–138. A joint resolution adopted by the
General Assembly of the State of Arkansas
applying to the United States Congress,
under the provisions of Article V of the
United States Constitution, for the calling of
a convention of the states limited to pro-
posing amendments to the United States
Constitution that impose fiscal restraints on
the federal government, limit the power and
jurisdiction of the federal government, and
limit the terms of office for its officials and
for members of the United States Congress;
to the Committee on the Judiciary.
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 3
Whereas, the founders of the United States
Constitution empowered state legislators to
be guardians of liberty against excessive use
of power by the federal government; and
Whereas, the federal government has cre-
ated a crushing national debt through im-
proper and imprudent spending; and
Whereas, the federal government has
ceased to operate under a proper interpreta-
tion of the United States Constitution; and
Whereas, the federal government has in-
vaded the legitimate roles of the states
through the manipulative process of federal
mandates, most of which are unfunded to a
great extent; and
Whereas, it is the solemn duty of the
states to protect the liberty of our people,
particularly for the generations to come, by
proposing amendments to the United States
Constitution through a convention of the
states under Article V of the United States
Constitution for the purpose of restraining
these and related abuses of power: Now,
Therefore, be it
Resolved, By the Senate of the Ninety-second
General Assembly of the State of Arkansas and
by the House of Representatives, a majority of
all Members elected to each House agreeing
thereto: That the General Assembly hereby
applies to the United States Congress, under
the provisions of Article V of the United
States Constitution, for the calling of a con-
vention of the states limited to proposing
amendments to the United States Constitu-
tion that impose fiscal restraints on the fed-
eral government, limit the power and juris-
diction of the federal government, and limit
the terms of office for its officials and for
members of the United States Congress; and
be it further
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate
is hereby directed to transmit copies of this
application to the President of the United
States Senate, the Secretary of the United
States Senate, the Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives, the Clerk
of the United States House of Representa-
tives, the members of the Arkansas congres-
sional delegation, and the presiding officers
of each house of the legislatures in the sev-
eral states, requesting their cooperation; and
be it further
Resolved, That this application constitutes
a continuing application in accordance with
Article V of the United States Constitution
until the legislatures of at least two-thirds
(2⁄3) of the several states have made applica-
tions on the same subject; and be it further
Resolved, That the General Assembly
adopts this application expressly subject to
the following reservations, understandings,
and declarations:
(1) An application to the United States
Congress to call an amendment convention
of the states pursuant to Article V of the
United States Constitution confers no power
to the United States Congress other than the
power to call such a convention. The power
of the United States Congress to exercise
this ministerial duty consists solely of the
authority to name a reasonable time and
place for the initial meeting of a convention;
(2) The United States Congress shall per-
form its ministerial duty of calling an
amendment convention of the states only
upon the receipt of applications for an
amendment convention for the substantially
same purpose as this application from two-
thirds (2⁄3) of the legislatures of the several
states;
(3) The United States Congress does not
have the power or authority to determine
any rules for the governing of a convention
for proposing amendments called pursuant to
Article V of the United States Constitution.
The United States Congress does not have
the power to set the number of delegates to
be sent by any state to such a convention,
nor does it have the power to name delegates
to such a convention. The power to name
delegates remains exclusively within the au-
thority of the legislatures of the several
states;
(4) By definition, an amendment conven-
tion of the states means that states shall
vote on the basis of one (1) state, one (1)
vote;
(5) A convention for proposing amendments
convened pursuant to this application shall
be limited to consideration of the topics
specified herein and no other. This applica-
tion is made with the express understanding
that an amendment that in any way seeks to
amend, modify, or repeal any provision of
the Bill of Rights of the United States Con-
stitution shall not be authorized for consid-
eration at any stage. This application shall
be void ab initio if ever used at any stage to
consider any change to any provision of the
Bill of Rights of the United States Constitu-
tion;
(6) Pursuant to Article V of the United
States Constitution, the United States Con-
gress may determine whether proposed
amendments shall be ratified by the legisla-
tures of the several states or by special state
ratification conventions. The General As-
sembly recommends that the United States
Congress select ratification by the legisla-
tures of the several states;
(7) The General Assembly may provide fur-
ther instructions to its delegates and may
recall its delegates at any time for a breach
of a duty or a violation of the instructions
provided; and
(8) Delegates are bound to the instructions
provided by the General Assembly and a fail-
ure to follow the instructions provided con-
stitutes a breach of the delegate’s duty and
subjects them to recall and replacement.

By Mr. KAINE (for himself and
Ms. HASSAN):
S. 2521. A bill to award grants for the
recruitment, retention, and advance-
ment of direct care workers; to the
Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. As our
Nation ages, we face a growing need for
direct care professionals to care for
older adults and people with disabil-
ities. The U.S. Census Bureau projects
the number of people aged 65 and older
to more than double between 2015 and
2060, from nearly 48 million to 98 mil-
lion. Approximately 61 million Ameri-
cans are currently living with a dis-
ability. By 2024, 5 .2 million direct care
workers will be needed across all care
settings.
Direct care workers, such as home
health aides and nursing assistants, are
the backbone of the long-term care
workforce, providing daily assistance
to millions of older Americans, people
with disabilities, and others with
chronic care needs. Direct care workers
help ensure that older Americans and
people with disabilities receive the
critical care they need while remaining
active members of their communities.
However, direct care workers are often
paid low wages and may face poor
working conditions and economic inse-
curity. The majority of direct care
workers are women and people of color.
Some direct care workers do not have
education beyond high school and lack
access to a career pathway or advanced
training. Twenty-four percent of home
care workers live below the Federal
poverty level and 52 percent of direct
care workers rely on some form of pub-
lic assistance to support themselves
and their families.
Today, I am pleased to introduce the
Direct Creation, Advancement, and Re-
tention of Employment Opportunity
Act, or Direct CARE Opportunity Act,
with Senator HASSAN. I am proud to
have partnered with my friend and col-
league in the Virginia delegation
Chairman Bobby Scott on this bill, who
has also introduced the bill today in
the House of Representatives. The Di-
rect CARE Opportunity Act provides
support for strategies to recruit, re-
tain, and advance the direct care work-
force pipeline. Our legislation would
support the implementation of models
and strategies to train more people in
the direct care field, while allowing for
local and regional innovation to ad-
dress workforce shortages. We encour-
age retention and career advancement
in a high-demand field where workers
carry a large emotional burden and
face barriers to economic mobility. Our
legislation responds to the needs of our
growing aging population, allowing
older Americans, people with disabil-
ities, and those with chronic illnesses
to remain in their communities while
receiving critical care and support,
helping prevent costlier institutional
care.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to see the Direct CARE Op-
portunity Act as a chance to invest in
the professionals who care for millions
of vulnerable Americans every day, en-
suring they live with dignity and inde-
pendence.
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms.
DUCKWORTH, Mr. BOOKER, and
Ms. HIRONO):
S. 2523. A bill to amend section
455(m) of the Higher Education Act of
1965 in order to allow adjunct faculty
members to qualify for public service
loan forgiveness; to the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 2523
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,

WEEK
Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. RISCH,
and Mrs. FEINSTEIN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to:
S. RES. 320
Whereas the Senate is committed to the
use of forensic science in the investigation of
crimes, the prosecution and conviction of the
correct perpetrators of crimes, and the exon-
eration of innocent individuals falsely ac-
cused of crimes in the United States;
Whereas forensic science service providers

Resolved, That—
(1) it is the sense of the Senate that Na-
tional Forensic Science Week provides a spe-
cial opportunity for—
(A) forensic service providers to—
(i) recognize the contributions of forensic
scientists in the laboratories in which those
individuals work;
(ii) organize community events to encour-
age a better understanding of forensic
science;

uals in gaining better insight into the cur-
rent capabilities of forensic service providers
and future demands that forensic service
providers will face; and
(iv) contact local media outlets and invite
those groups to cover events hosted during
National Forensic Science Week;

NATING SEPTEMBER 2019 AS
‘‘NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER
AWARENESS MONTH’’
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr.
CRAPO, Mr. COONS, Mr. VAN HOLLEN,
Mr. BOOKER, Mr. HAWLEY, Mr. CARDIN,
Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. MARKEY, and Mr.
WYDEN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 321
Whereas more than 2,900,000 men in the
United States live with prostate cancer;
Whereas 1 in 9 men in the United States
will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in
their lifetimes and 1 in 41 men in the United
States will die from prostate cancer;
Whereas prostate cancer is the most com-
monly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the
second-leading cause of cancer-related
deaths among men in the United States;
Whereas the American Cancer Society esti-
mates that, in 2019, 174,650 men will be diag-
nosed with, and more than 31,620 men will
die of, prostate cancer;
Whereas 41.9 percent of newly diagnosed
prostate cancer cases occur in men under the
age of 65;
Whereas the odds of developing prostate
cancer rise rapidly after age 50;
Whereas African-American men suffer
from a prostate cancer incidence rate that is
significantly higher than that of White men
and have more than double the prostate can-
cer mortality rate than that of White men;
Whereas having a father or brother with
prostate cancer more than doubles the risk
of a man developing prostate cancer, with a
higher risk for men who have a brother with
the disease and the highest risk for men with
several affected relatives;
Whereas screening by a digital rectal ex-
amination and a prostate-specific antigen
blood test can detect the disease at the ear-
lier, more treatable stages, which could in-
crease the chances of survival for more than
5 years to nearly 100 percent;
Whereas only 30 percent of men survive
more than 5 years if diagnosed with prostate
cancer after the cancer has metastasized;
Whereas there are no noticeable symptoms
of prostate cancer in the early stages, mak-
ing appropriate screening critical;
Whereas, in fiscal year 2019, the Director of
the National Institutes of Health supported
approximately $271,000,000 in research
projects focused specifically on prostate can-
cer;
Whereas ongoing research promises further
improvements in prostate cancer prevention,
early detection, and treatment; and
Whereas educating people in the United
States, including health care providers,
about prostate cancer and early detection
strategies is crucial to saving the lives of
men and preserving and protecting families:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates September 2019 as ‘‘National
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month’’;
(2) declares that steps should be taken—
(A) to raise awareness about the impor-
tance of screening methods for, and treat-
ment of, prostate cancer;
(B) to encourage research—
(i) to improve screening and treatment for
prostate cancer;
(ii) to discover the causes of prostate can-
cer; and
(iii) to develop a cure for prostate cancer;
and
(C) to continue to consider ways to im-
prove access to, and the quality of, health
care services for detecting and treating pros-
tate cancer; and
(3) calls on the people of the United States,
interest groups, and affected persons—
(A) to promote awareness of prostate can-
cer;
(B) to take an active role in the fight to
end the devastating effects of prostate can-
cer on individuals, families, and the econ-
omy; and
(C) to observe National Prostate Cancer
Awareness Month with appropriate cere-
monies and activities.

HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE ARAB AMERICAN
AND CHALDEAN COUNCIL
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the Arab American and
Chaldean Council (ACC) as they celebrate 40
years of service to Southeast Michigan. The
ACC began as a one-person office in August
1979 with the vision to help the growing num-
ber of Arab immigrants in the Metro Detroit re-
gion. In the first year, over 400 clients sought
assistance through their organization.
Over the years they have served as a valu-
able resource for the immigrant community.
They provide a variety of services including
counseling, health care, language assistance,
employment training, and job placement. More
than that, they have created a safe place for
immigrants to feel welcomed and supported as
they acclimate to their new life in America.
The ACC continues to be a beacon in the
community, serving nearly 70,000 people and
providing over 450,000 services in the last
year. There is no doubt that the ACC will con-
tinue to make a positive difference in the
years to come.
I encourage everyone to visit Michigan and
witness the rich cultural diversity, grit, and de-
termination the citizens of our state have to
offer. On its 40th anniversary, the Arab Amer-
ican and Chaldean Council has much to be
proud of. I ask my colleagues to join me in
celebrating this tremendous milestone.

IN RECOGNITION OF SUSAN JEN-
SEN AND HER SERVICE TO THE
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
HON. JERROLD NADLER
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to thank Susan Jensen for her more than 20
years of service to the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. Susan is one of the preeminent ex-
perts on bankruptcy law, administrative law,
and the federal court system. Although she
will be leaving the Committee, she will con-
tinue in public service as she transitions to the
Office of Legislative Affairs at the Administra-
tive Office of the U.S. Courts.
Susan is highly respected on both sides of
the aisle. It is a testament to her knowledge
and fairness that she worked as Counsel and
later Senior Counsel for Republican and
Democratic House Judiciary Committee
Chairs, including Chairman Henry Hyde,
Chairman Lamar Smith, Chairman and Rank-
ing Member John Conyers, Jr. and myself, as
Ranking Member and now Chairman.
Largely as a result of receiving a generous
scholarship from the Service Employees Inter-
national Union Local 32–B in New York City,
Susan was able to attend New York University
where she received her undergraduate de-
gree. She subsequently obtained her JD and
LLM at NYU.
Before entering law school, Susan worked
as a press aide for Connecticut Governor Ella
Grasso. After graduating law school, she
served as a law clerk for two bankruptcy
judges, initially for one year in the Eastern
District of New York, and then for seven years
in the Southern District of New York. There-
after, she served as Senior Attorney-Advisor
at the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of
the United States Trustee in Newark, New Jer-
sey. She later served as the General Counsel
to the National Bankruptcy Review Commis-
sion from 1996 to 1997, working under the di-
rection of then-Professor and now-Senator
Elizabeth Warren. Susan has authored a trea-
tise on consumer bankruptcy and subsequent
editions for the New York State Bar Associa-
tion and has authored book chapters and nu-
merous articles on bankruptcy and other mat-
ters. She was also elected to the American
Law Institute in 2010.
In 1998 she was hired by Chairman Hyde to
serve as a full committee counsel working on
bankruptcy issues. Under Chairman and
Ranking Member Conyers, Susan expanded
her portfolio, and when I was elected to serve
as Chair, I also asked Susan to serve as the
Committee Parliamentarian, in addition to her
other duties.
Since joining the Judiciary Committee in
1998, she has worked on various matters, in-
cluding bankruptcy legislation, reauthorization
of the Administrative Conference of the United
States, federal courts, oversight of the Justice
Department, privacy issues, and interstate
compacts. She has also assisted in the prepa-
ration and review of an array of Committee
documents, including Committee reports, hear-
ing memoranda, statements, and related ma-
terials.
I can say from firsthand experience that
Susan is not only one of the most knowledge-
able lawyers on Capitol Hill, but she is also
one of the most diligent, thoughtful, and fair-
minded individuals I have ever worked with. I
am fortunate to have been able to work with
her as a staffer and friend. All of those who
have worked with Susan have benefited from
her intelligence, good humor, and mentoring.
I wish Susan well in her new endeavor, and
I thank her for her years of superb work.

CELEBRATING DENISE PENCE
HON. GREG PENCE
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
say Happy Birthday to my most important con-
stituent. She is the mother to Nicole, Lauren,
Emily and John. She is a grandmother and a
small business owner.
Madam Speaker, I am referring, of course,
to my wife, Denise Pence.
On Saturday, September 21, our family will
celebrate Denise’s birthday, and I wanted to
take this opportunity to wish my bride, here on
the floor of the People’s House, a very Happy
Birthday.
The best decision I ever made was to pur-
sue Denise Karen Tullio of Chicago, Illinois,
and our 38 years of marriage have been
blessed with love and joy.
Happy Birthday to Denise Pence.

HONORING JACOB BEDNAR
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize Jacob Bednar.
Jacob is a very special young man who has
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship
and leadership by taking an active part in the
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1180, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout.
Jacob has been very active with his troop,
participating in many scout activities. Over the
many years Jacob has been involved with
scouting, he has not only earned numerous
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably,
Jacob has contributed to his community
through his Eagle Scout project.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in commending Jacob Bednar for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

REMEMBERING IRA A. LIPMAN
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in praise of my friend Ira A. Lipman, founder
of the international private security firm
Guardsmark, who was also a passionate ad-
vocate for social justice, a defender of journal-
istic freedom and a lover of history and the
arts. Ira died Monday in New York at the age
of 78. A native of Little Rock, Arkansas, Ira
was a student at Little Rock Central High
School and was an important anonymous
source for NBC Newsman John Chancellor
during the historic but contentious integration
of the school in 1957. That led to a lifelong
friendship and, in 1995, Ira created the John
Chancellor Award of Excellence at Columbia
University School of Journalism, honoring the
best in the business with a $50,000 annual
award. The selection committee for the award
is led by the Ira A. Lipman Professor of Jour-
nalism, Jelani Cobb at Columbia. This pres-
tigious award is presented at a dinner, a

prized event for those invited. In 2018, Colum-
bia established the Ira A. Lipman Center for
Journalism and Civil and Human Rights. Mr.
Lipman was a leader in social justice organi-
zations, and served as chairman and later as
honorary chairman for life of the National Con-
ference of Christians and Jews. He stood up
to racism wherever it raised its ugly head. In
1983, he received the Distinguished Service
Award from the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He
served on the board of the National Council
on Crime and Delinquency and on the board
of the International Association of Chiefs of
Police. Mr. Lipman held many positions with
the United Way of America, including as the
first chairman of its ethics committee, and
headed up its Memphis United Way chapter
with record-setting donations. In Memphis, Ira
was a model of civic responsibility, a thought-
ful philanthropist and, like ‘‘Mr. Anonymous,’’
was looked to for his leadership, including fi-
nancial support for the Memphis and Shelby
County Crime Commission. In 1992, when
Minister Louis Farrakhan was given the keys
to the city by then-Mayor W.W. Herenton, Ira
stood up and made it clear the decision was
questionable. When he realized his lifelong
dream of moving to New York City, he be-
came one of that city’s leading patrons, serv-
ing on the board of The New-York Historical
Society. As New York City’s quasi-anthem
says, if you can make it there, you can make
it anywhere, and Ira made it there and New
York was the better for it. He was a longtime
member of the Council on Foreign Relations
and, in 2016, his generous gift created the Ira
A. Lipman Chair in Emerging Technologies
and National Security at the Council. Recog-
nized worldwide for his dedication to Jewry, he
was a member of the board of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center for 38 years and last year
received its highest honor, the Humanitarian
Award. He also served as an officer of the
American Jewish Historical Society. Ira served
on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater,
Ohio Wesleyan University, which conferred on
him its Distinguished Achievement Citation for
significant accomplishments and service to
mankind. Mr. Lipman received the Stanley C.
Pace Award for Leadership in Ethics from the
Ethics Resource Center in 2002. That same
year, the Committee for Economic Develop-
ment honored him with its Corporate Citizen-
ship Award. In 2004, he received the Dean’s
Medal of the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania, where he served as a mem-
ber of the Board of Overseers from 1991 to
2004 and again from 2005 to 2016. It was Ira
Lipman who suggested that I sponsor and
pass legislation creating the Tennessee’s Hol-
ocaust Commission in 1984 when I was a
State Senator. In 1963, Mr. Lipman founded
Guardsmark, a private security and security
guard company, in Memphis, and grew it to a
17,000-employee operation before he sold it in
2015. He wrote How to Protect Yourself From
Crime (1975) and was often consulted by law
enforcement and private security officials for
his expertise. Mr. Lipman’s philanthropy will
long be remembered. He will be missed by so
many for his wisdom, courage and willingness
to step up. I want to express my condolences
to his wife, Barbara; his sons Gus, Josh and
Ben; his extended family and his many
friends. His was a life well-lived.
FOSTERING UNDERGRADUATE
TALENT BY UNLOCKING RE-
SOURCES FOR EDUCATION ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. PETER WELCH
OF VERMONT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 17, 2019
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a
strong supporter of Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serv-
ing Institutions (MSIs), and the intent of H.R.
2486, the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by
Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE)
Act. These institutions, which serve high popu-
lations of traditionally underrepresented stu-
dents, need stable and reliable funding. We
have seen the positive impacts that mandatory
funding has had on improving degree comple-
tion, achieving future gainful employment, and
propelling upward mobility for these popu-
lations. However, the funding source, currently
in the bill, comes at the expense of critical
small nonprofit education institutions like the
one in my district, the Vermont Student Assist-
ance Corporation (VSAC).
Unlike some large Guarantee Agencies
(GAs), VSAC does so much more for Vermont
students than just acting as a loan guarantor.
They are a public nonprofit agency that advo-
cates for students and families to ensure that
they have the information, the counseling, and
the financial aid to achieve their education
goals. Their 161 employees provide need-
based education grants, scholarships, loan
services, and community outreach. In this past
year alone, VSAC:
Issued $20.1 million in need-based grants to
11,766 Vermont students;
Provided 3,195 scholarship awards worth
over $5.4 million;
Counseled 6,642 low-income and first-gen-
eration college-bound Vermont students;
Answered 62,000 phone calls from bor-
rowers who needed assistance with their fi-
nancial aid and repayment questions; and
Trained 355 education professionals to bet-
ter serve their students.
The funding source in the bill—eliminating
Account Maintenance Fees paid to GAs for
guaranteeing Federal Family Education
Loans—operates under the misunderstanding
that the program has been eliminated and
therefore no services and resources need to
be provided for these loans. In fact, VSAC
continues to service over $410 million of these
FFELP loans for 26,500 borrowers, and the
funding that accompanies the servicing of
these loans helps VSAC achieve its broader
mission of borrow advocacy and counseling.
This work is particularly important for bor-
rowers in the wake of problems with the new
federal direct loan program and private lend-
ers. VSAC and other organizations are facing
the reality of having no way to replace this lost
revenue stream to continue to help thousands
of borrowers navigate the complicated and dif-
ficult process of finding a way to pay for high-
er education.
This doesn’t have to be an either-or deci-
sion. As we move forward, I urge the Chair-
man to work with me and Senate leaders to
try to identify an alternative funding source.
We must ensure that smaller GAs like VSAC
are protected and able to continue the vital
work they provide to their communities.
HONORING THE ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS OF DR. NINA
MCCLELLAND
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the accomplishments of Dr. Nina
McClelland, a resident of Toledo and a cham-
pion of ensuring safe water starting with her
work at the Toledo water treatment plant and
being the first woman in Ohio to earn a Class
A operator license for wastewater treatment
over 50 years ago.
On Thursday, September 19, 2019, The
University of Toledo honors Dr. McClelland,
former President and CEO of NSF (National
Sanitation Foundation) International, Chair of
the Board of Directors of the American Chem-
ical Society and Dean Emeritus of The Univer-
sity of Toledo, by announcing the creation of
the Dr. Nina McClelland Laboratory for Water
Chemistry and Environmental Analysis.
The laboratory is an important initiative for
The University of Toledo’s efforts to be a lead-
er in solving existing and emerging environ-
mental problems in the region and for the
world. To continue Dr. McClelland’s legacy
and life-long passion for ensuring safe water,
this state-of-the-art analytical laboratory will
focus on the development of innovative sci-
entific methodology to address concerns re-
lated to our water resources, especially issues
important for public health. Together with other
scientists on campus the laboratory will com-
plement their activities and strive to create a
hub for new scientific discoveries and re-
search breakthroughs to address the most
pressing environmental issues. Another mis-
sion of the laboratory is to provide outstanding
training for our students with state-of-the-art
instrumentation and facilities to ensure they
learn in the best environment possible. The
goal is to provide a new generation of re-
searchers to be the new leaders and stewards
for our environment.
Dr. McClelland has been active in various
governance roles in the American Chemical
Society (ACS), the world’s largest scientific or-
ganization, and has served The University of
Toledo as Dean and Professor Emerita, Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences, and Executive-In-
Residence, College of Business and Innova-
tion. Dr. McClelland has served as a Consult-
ant and Principal with The Bartech Group,
T.C. AirTech, LLC, and James Cavnar, Found-
er and President of Cross International of the
International Clean Water Program.
Serving on several major committees
throughout her career, Dr. McClelland has
been a member of U.S. Department of Com-
merce, National Institute of Standards and
Technology; U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency; National Science Foundation; Na-
tional Academy of Sciences/National Research
Council; Centers for Disease Control; State of
Michigan, Governor’s Council on Environ-
mental Quality; and American National Stand-
ards Institute.
The work that Dr. McClelland has done in
her groundbreaking career is inspirational, and
her dedication to public health is laudable. We
congratulate her on all her accomplishments
and wish nothing but the best for the re-
searchers that will work in the newly created

Devine, and Victoria Gray.
Coming on the heels of its historic challenge
to the seating of the all-white Mississippi dele-
gation at the 1964 Democratic National Con-
vention in Atlantic City, the Mississippi Free-
dom Democratic Party (MFDP) moved to un-
seat Mississippi’s all-white Congressional del-
egation the next year. The MFDP revealed
how continued illegal discrimination led to the
election of five white men to represent a state,
where the population was nearly half African
American. Through its Freedom Elections,
open to anyone regardless of race, the MFDP
proved that black voters would exercise their
constitutional rights if given the chance and
that their votes would undermine Jim Crow
politics in America. The MFDP took its chal-
lenge all the way to the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives.
In December 1964, MFDP attorneys not
only rejected the seating of the men who com-
prised the Mississippi delegation ahead of the
1965 Congressional session but asserted that
Fannie Lou Hamer, Annie Devine, and Victoria
Gray should be seated in their stead in their
own respective districts. These three black
women were long-time civil rights activists and
MFPD stalwarts and had attempted to run for
Congress in the Fall of 1964. After they were
denied a place on the official Mississippi bal-
lot, Hamer, Devine, and Gray were elected
through the MFDP Freedom Vote. Though it
had no recognized legal standing, the Free-
dom Vote was the only true democratic elec-
tion in Mississippi. Thus, the MFDP argued
that these women were entitled to the state’s
Congressional seats in their districts as the
only democratically elected officials from the
state.
On January 3, 1965, Hamer, Devine, Gray,
and more than 600 other black Mississippians
welcomed members of Congress to the Cap-
itol in support of the MFDP challenge. When
Speaker of the House John McCormack
began the traditional roll call, Congressman
William Fitts Ryan of New York objected to the
seating of Mississippi’s Thomas Abernethy.
More than sixty U.S. Representatives joined
Ryan in that dissent and forced McCormack to
wait to seat the entire Mississippi delegation
until the rest of Congress had been sworn in.
Then, House Majority Leader Carl Albert of
Oklahoma moved that the MFDP challenge be
recognized as legitimate and that Mississippi’s
all-white delegation be seated until a full hear-
ing could be conducted. Albert’s Resolution
passed the House by a vote of 276 to 149.
With two-thirds of U.S. Congressmen sup-
porting the right to a challenge, the Committee
on House Administration prepared to hear the
MFDP’s arguments.
The state’s segregationist delegation em-
ployed an army of white attorneys, recruited at
the behest of the Mississippi Bar Association,
to mount their defense during the summer of
1965, but the MFDP organized dozens of vol-
unteer lawyers from across the country to pre-
pare its case. They issued subpoenas, con-
ducted depositions, and gathered testimony
from black voters about the discrimination they
had encountered in the state for decades.
Backed by hundreds of pages of documents in
support of the challenge, the MFDP was pre-
pared for a hearing to be held in the Fall of
1965.
When the MFDP challenge was finally heard
on September 13, 1965, Fannie Lou Hamer,
Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray testified in
front of the House Subcommittee on Elections
that they had been denied access to the ballot
because of their race and should be seated to
represent the State of Mississippi in Congress.
Three days later, their challenge came to the
floor of the U.S. House of Representatives for
a vote, and Congressman Ryan of New York,
who had first stood to object to the seating of
the all-white delegation in January, accom-
panied the three women to sit on the House
floor with Congressional Democrats during the
debate. Their presence made them the first
black women on the floor of the U.S. House
of Representatives and the first black Mis-
sissippians there since Reconstruction. Un-
daunted by the vitriol they had faced, Annie
Devine, Fannie Lou Hamer, and Victoria Gray
sat nobly through the deliberations.
Although a vote of 228–143 defeated the
MFPD challenge, nearly 40 percent of Con-
gressmen had gone on record in support of
Hamer, Devine, and Gray. A month before
their challenge was heard, the 1965 Voting
Rights Act had passed, which many members
of Congress believed had rectified the inequi-
ties that the MFDP described, and those Con-
gressmen did not believe they should act on
behalf of the MFDP in the name of past dis-
crimination. Nevertheless, the heroic efforts of
Hamer, Devine, Gray, and the MFDP proved
that African Americans would not sit idly by
but would demand their rights of American citi-
zenship. These three women fought to throw
open the doors that eventually saw Shirley
Chisholm from New York elected as the first
black woman to Congress in 1968, Mike Espy
as the first black Mississippian since Recon-
struction to serve in Congress in 1987, and
the election of the first African American Presi-
dent of the United States, Barack Obama. We
honor them for their courage and sacrifice.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing Jacqueline Hamer-Flakes,
Pastor Cecil Gray, Julie Henderson, Reuben
Adams, Nettsaanett Gray, Barbara Devine
Reed, Tiffany Wilson, William Ryan, Mary Car-
roll (Mac) Ryan, and Elizabeth Ryan as we re-
flect on the contributions of Fannie Lou
Hamer, Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to
their families, communities, and their driving
passion to fight for Civil Rights.

HONORING THE LIFE OF U.S. MA-
RINE CORPS WORLD WAR II VET-
ERAN YSABEL CISNEROS
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the life of U.S. Marine Corps
World War II Veteran Ysabel Cisneros.
Ysabel Cisneros was a lifelong resident of
Orange County. He was born on October 6,
1925 in Anaheim, CA and raised in the seg-
regated La Jolla barrio in the city of Placentia.
Mr. Cisneros joined the United States Ma-
rine Corps at the age of 18 in 1943 at the
height of World War II. When given the choice
of waiting two weeks, or joining immediately,
he chose to enlist immediately and served his
boot camp at Camp Pendleton.
Ysabel Cisneros served in the Guam and
Palau campaigns that freed the South Pacific
from Fascist Japanese oppression. Mr.
Cisneros and his company were then chosen
to be a part of the invasion of Iwo Jima, a de-
cisive battle in World War II.
Ysabel Cisneros was among the many
brave Americans to storm Mount Suribachi, in
one of the deadliest battles in American His-
tory. During this time, Mr. Cisneros served
with and befriended the legendary Ira Hayes,
the Native American soldier who helped lift the
American flag on Mount Suribachi.
Mr. Cisneros was wounded in battle and
spent the remainder of the war recuperating
from his injuries. Mr. Cisneros was honorably
discharged from the U.S. Marine Corps on
June 26, 1946.
Mr. Cisneros settled back in his hometown
of Placentia and married his loving wife Amel-
ia in 1947 and lived the remainder of his life.
Ysabel Cisneros is survived by four of his
children, 17 grandchildren, 24 great-grand-
children and seven great-great grandchildren.
Let us remember World War II Marine Vet-
eran Ysabel Cisneros, a true American hero.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE TALLADEGA
SUPERSPEEDWAY
HON. MIKE ROGERS
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize
the 50th anniversary of the Talladega Super-
speedway in Talladega, Alabama.
In the mid-1960s, NASCAR founder Bill
France, Sr., envisioned a bigger and faster
track on the NASCAR circuit. After meeting
with local race car driver and race fan, Bill
Ward of Anniston, Alabama, the location was
selected for the track and the groundbreaking
ceremony for the Alabama International Motor
Speedway (today known as Talladega Super-
speedway) took place on May 23, 1968.
The first race, the Talladega 500 (now the
1000Bulbs.com 500), was held on September
14, 1969, with Richard Brickhouse winning the
race. The race played a major role in
NASCAR’s history as many of the top stars of
the sport walked out the day before the race
due to concerns of tire wear on the nearly 200
mph track. Mr. France said the race would go
on and recruited drivers from the smaller
NASCAR Touring Series, the Bama 400, the
day before.
The Talladega Superspeedway is the most
competitive race track on the NASCAR sched-
ule (record 88 lead changes in 188 laps), the
highest-banked (33 degrees) and the longest
(2.66 miles) as well as the most fun and fan-
friendly.
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the 50th anniversary of the Talladega
Superspeedway.

stock. Peyton is a very special young man
who has exemplified the finest qualities of citi-
zenship and leadership by taking an active
part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop
1180, and earning the most prestigious award
of Eagle Scout.
Peyton has been very active with his troop,

scouting, he has not only earned numerous
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Pey-
ton has contributed to his community through
his Eagle Scout project.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in commending Peyton Comstock for his
accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.
IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF MR. G.
BROWN LOFLIN
HON. TED BUDD
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Mr. G. Brown Loflin.
Brown was born November 23, 1934 in Da-
vidson County to Justice Snow Loflin, Sr. and
Alice Elliott Loflin. He was an active member
of Chapel Hill United Methodist Church, the
Denton Lions Club, and Denton Lodge No.
404 AF and AM.
Over the course of his life, Brown wore
many hats. Some that come to mind are U.S.
Army Reserve veteran, Davidson County
Commissioner, owner of the Loflin Garage,
and bluegrass enthusiast, just to name a few.
But Brown will probably be most remem-
bered as the visionary behind the Denton
FarmPark, which started back in 1970. It all
began when Brown and a buddy decided to
offer airplane rides to raise money for the local
rescue squad. But the crowds and wait time
for airplane lines grew so much that they
needed another attraction. They quickly added
antique farm machinery and tractors for folks
to view while waiting in line. Brown would
eventually abandon the airplane rides and
transition to farm equipment, which was a
major attraction. He also brought the Handy
Dandy Railroad to Denton FarmPark, which
features an old steam train that runs during
the show and provides rides to visitors of all
ages.
Today, the Southeast Old Threshers’ Re-
union is the largest steam, gas, and unique
farm machinery show in the Southeast. The
property has 15 restored buildings, including a
church, grist mill, general store, plantation
house, and blacksmith shop.
In 2018, Loflin told local reporters that there
were more than 1,200 tractors at the South-
east Old Threshers’ Reunion. Even when his
health declined a few years ago, Brown re-
mained the driving force behind what has be-
come one of the largest events of its kind in
the entire country. I’m grateful to have met
Brown and know that his many contributions
to Davidson County will live on for years to
come.
Brown is survived by his wife Ruby John-
son, who he had been married to for over 60
years along with his son, Gordon Keith Loflin,
a daughter, Karen Loflin Miller, four grand-
children, and a great grandchild.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
honoring Brown Loflin for his service to David-
son County.

TRIBUTE TO BERNARD WILLIAMS
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to the
life and legacy of a fellow Texan, former staff-
er, and my friend, Bernard Williams, Jr.
Mr. Williams was born on January 28, 1928,
in Dallas, Texas, as an only child to Bernard
Williams, Sr. and Nellie Mae Mayes. He grad-
uated from Booker T. Washington High School
in 1945, after which he attended West Virginia
State College in Institute, West Virginia, where
he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Mathe-
matics. There, Mr. Williams met the love of his
life, Marguerite Reddick. They married in Sa-
vannah, Georgia, in 1952 and had two chil-
dren, Martha Nell and Susan Kay.
Mr. Williams answered his country’s call to
service, serving as a Lieutenant in the United
States Army following his college graduation.
At the conclusion of his military service, Mr.
Williams was hired as one of the first African
American lab technicians in the
cardiopulmonary lab at Southwestern Medical
School in Dallas, now known as the UT South-
western Medical Center. He would later take a
position with the IBM Corporation in Dallas as
one of the first African American systems en-
gineers. Following a brief retirement, Mr. Wil-
liams joined my Dallas district office, where he
served the constituents of the 30th district of
Texas for seven years.
Mr. Williams generously gave his free time
to our community—working with multiple orga-
nizations such as the Dallas Alumni Chapter
of Kappa Alpha Psi, Inc., Big Brothers Inc., the
Moorland Branch YMCA, and the Dallas Black
Chamber of Commerce. He also served as a
board member on the DART Citizens Advisory
Committee and Senior Source.
Mr. Williams was a faithful and active mem-
ber of the New Hope Baptist Church for over
half a century. During his time with the church,
he served as Chairman of the Deacon Board
for 17 years before being named Deacon
Emeritus. Mr. Williams was widely regarded as
a mentor for the youth in the church and was
a strong supporter of religious education pro-
grams like vacation bible school.
Mr. Williams was preceded in death by his
parents, Bernard Williams, Sr. and Nellie Mae
Mayes. He is survived by his wife, Marguerite
Williams (née Reddick); daughters, Martha
Bedford (Louis III) and Susan Williams
McElroy; granddaughters, Erica Chiles and fa-
ther Don Chiles, Opal McElroy and father
Daniel McElroy; sister-in-law, Charlesetta
Reddick Lacy; brother-in-law, Thomas Reddick
(Margaret); and many loving nieces, nephews,
cousins, and friends.
Madam Speaker, I would like to extend my
deepest sympathies to Mr. Williams’ family,
friends, and to those he influenced over the
course of his life. The Dallas community will
dearly miss him.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1181
September 19, 2019
Health and Medical Co-Director of Cancer Ge-
netics at Northern Westchester Hospital,
Northwell Health. Until 2018 he was a Full
Academic Professor of Surgery at SUNY
Downstate and Surgeon-in-Chief at VA New
York Harbor Health Care System, Brooklyn,
NY.
Dr. Weber’s career includes significant ac-
complishments in multiple arenas including
clinical surgical leadership, academic appoint-
ments, mentoring of young investigators, and
international recognition for innovation and
leadership in cancer prevention and collabo-
rative translational cancer research. In addition
to his clinical and academic appointments he
led at least 10 national and international orga-
nizations, such as the National Colorectal
Cancer Round Table, the Collaborative Group
of the Americas and the NYC Health Depart-
ment sponsored ‘‘Citywide Colorectal Cancer
Control Coalition’’ (C5).
Dr. Weber was an early and passionate ad-
vocate for addressing the early age onset
colorectal cancer (EAOCRC) issue. He orga-
nized and chaired the nation’s first Summit fo-
cused on EAOCRC and was instrumental in
the American Cancer Society’s 2018 rec-
ommendation that Americans be screened for
colorectal cancer at the age of 45 instead of
50. He published extensively on hereditary
and early age onset colorectal cancer and was
a frequently invited speaker on both subjects
at national and international meetings.
Dr. Weber was a pillar of the colorectal can-
cer community and has been recognized for
his philanthropic leadership and contributions.
He founded New York City’s first colon cancer
awareness event in 2003, the Colon Cancer
Challenge, which led to the formation of the
Colon Cancer Foundation. With Dr. Weber at
the helm, the Foundation supported research
into the causes, potential cures and most ef-
fective treatments for colorectal cancer. The
Foundation has increased public awareness of
the disease, educated the public about the im-
portance of early detection, and advocated on
behalf of thousands of colorectal cancer pa-
tients and their families.
He has been recognized for his leadership
in public health, cancer control and research
by New York City Health Commissioner Thom-
as Farley, the Health Department of New York
State, the AliveAndKickn Foundation, the
American Cancer Society, the Prevent Cancer
Foundation, the National Colorectal Cancer
Roundtable and the National Institutes of
Health.
Year after year, Dr. Weber would travel to
Washington to meet with lawmakers, including
members of my staff and myself, to discuss
the importance of scientific research funding at
the National Institutes of Health (NIH), remov-
ing barriers to colorectal cancer screening,
and other priorities in the health care commu-
nity.
Dr. Weber leaves behind a remarkable leg-
acy of civic and community engagement. Indi-
viduals suffering from colorectal cancer and
their families are better off today because of
his work. He is survived by his loving wife
Clare, sons Luke and Nick, sister Jeannie and
her husband David Aplin, and family.
Madam Speaker, I urge my fellow Members
of Congress to join me in recognizing Dr. We-
ber’s many years of service to the community
and in sending our sincerest condolences to
his family, friends and colleagues.

Dearborn Area Chamber of Commerce.
The Dearborn Area Chamber of Commerce
was established in 1944 to serve business
owners throughout the Dearborn and South-

75 years ago, the Dearborn Area Chamber of
Commerce has been creating a forum for
business members to meet and network with
other local businesses to create lasting part-
nerships, generate exposure, and inspire eco-
nomic growth. The Chamber provides a
strong, unified voice for the entire business
community and actively advocates on their be-
half at all levels of government, striving to as-
sist members in meeting each of their busi-
ness objectives. Through its five core strate-
gies of member development, community pro-
motion, travel and tourism, government affairs/
advocacy, and education, the Dearborn Area
Chamber of Commerce is committed to culti-
vating a strong local business climate in our
community.
The Dearborn Area Chamber of Commerce
continues to support the expanding business
communities in Dearborn and Southeast
Michigan. Today, these communities are more
vibrant and diverse than ever, but the Cham-
ber works tirelessly to meet the challenges of
an increasingly dynamic and ever-changing
business world. The Chamber’s dedicated ef-
forts have been paramount in ensuring Dear-
born continues to be a welcoming destination

fessionals, and the like, and that businesses
have the tools necessary to thrive. Thanks to
its tremendous work, the Dearborn Area

ELEVATION OF THE EDUCATION
PROFESSION ACT
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO
SABLAN
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Elevation of the Education Profes-
sion Act. This legislation sets up within the
U.S. Department of Education an advisory
committee of teachers and other stakeholders.
Their job: to make recommendations on how
we can improve recruitment and retention of
teachers and school leaders for the benefit of
America’s children.
Every child in the United States deserves
quality instruction from quality teachers. Unfor-
tunately for our children, however, far too
many of their most qualified teachers are leav-
ing the profession. As a nation, we need to
understand why. Because these departures
are having a serious, negative impact on the
quality of education, especially on the edu-
cation of children from low-income families
and on children of color. In fact, the Learning
Policy Institute reports teacher turnover rates
are 50 percent higher in Title I schools, which
serve low-income children, than in non-Title I
schools.
Testimony from teachers at an Education
and Labor subcommittee hearing I chaired in
July cited various reasons that lead teachers
to leave their profession. We heard teachers
are not being well prepared, especially when
it comes to serving students whose back-
grounds and experience with trauma and pov-
erty may differ from the teachers’ own. We
learned school systems are not giving teach-
ers the support they need. And, of course, we
were told teachers are underpaid.
It is important to raise these issues in a con-
gressional hearing. More important is that we
provide a forum for teachers and other edu-
cation stakeholders to come together to take a
deep dive in the issues our hearing could only
glancingly examine. Most important is to find
solutions.
That is what the Elevation of the Education
Profession Act does. The Act brings together
teachers and the unions that represent them;
state, territory and local education agencies;
school administrators; parents; civil rights or-
ganizations; teacher colleges; and others who
can comprehensively assess the concerns
raised in our hearing. How can we increase
the value of pre-service and in-service training
for teachers? Are certification and
credentialing practices setting an adequate
standard? And are these quality controls suffi-
ciently uniform across our nation? These are
the kinds of questions we want answered.
Having made these assessments, the advi-
sory committee is charged with recommending
rigorous standards and compiling evidence-
based best practices for educating and train-
ing profession-ready teachers and school
leaders and supporting them once they are at

work with our children. The bill also requires
the U.S. Department of Education to make
these recommended standards and best prac-
tices electronically accessible, so schools,
teachers, and policymakers around the coun-
try can put them to use improving our schools.
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-

educators by bringing stakeholders together to
evaluate what is working, where we are defi-
cient, and to recommend the actions nec-

CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE AMERICAN ASSO-
CIATION OF SERVICE COORDINA-
TORS
HON. STEVE STIVERS
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
on behalf of the people of Ohio’s 15th Con-
gressional District to celebrate the 20th anni-
versary of the American Association of Service
Coordinators.
Service coordinators work in all U.S. states
and territories, but Ohio is where they look to
for training, advocacy and support thanks to
AASC. In 1999, Janice Monks founded the
membership organization out of her home in
Central Ohio, which was one of the first re-
gions where service coordinators joined the
staff of affordable housing properties with the
help of federal grants.
Over the past two decades, AASC has cre-
ated a documentation system for service coor-
dinators to more easily track and report resi-
dent outcomes and has collaborated with the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment to create a formal guidebook outlining
industry standards and practices. This year,
the organization hosted its largest annual Na-
tional Service Coordinator Conference in Den-
ver, Colorado and membership exceeded
3,300.
AASC’s purpose is to serve as a constant
support for service coordinators who empower
their residents to live well. Service coordina-
tors serve as a lifeline for hundreds of thou-
sands of low-income seniors and families who
need connected to vital supports that keep
them living independently or help them move
up and out of poverty. In the course of that
work, service coordinators also play an inte-
gral role in realizing nationwide policy goals
such as reducing healthcare costs, keeping
older adults in their communities and increas-
ing self-sufficiency.
In honor of AASC’s anniversary, service co-
ordinators across the country are celebrating
Service Coordinator Day today. My colleagues
may be hearing from service coordinators who
are recognizing the anniversary by sharing
with Congressional offices the profound impact
this profession has on our nation’s most vul-
nerable.
I wish to congratulate President Janice
Monks and the American Association of Serv-
ice Coordinators on this milestone anniversary
and convey my most sincere appreciation for
their dedication to service.

HONORING DOWNTOWN FLORIST
FOR FIFTEEN YEARS OF BUSI-
NESS IN MASSENA, NY
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Downtown Florist on
their 15th anniversary serving the Town of
Massena.
Downtown Florist was founded in 2005 by
Patty and Kenny Wells. With their vision, they
transformed a long-vacant gas station into a
community staple. Small businesses like
Downtown Florist are the backbone of the
North Country’s economy. They generate the
majority of employment and job creation, while
driving investment in our local communities.
However, most small businesses do not make
it longer than five years. For that reason, the
15th anniversary of a business is an achieve-
ment worth celebrating.
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional
District, I want to congratulate Patty and
Kenny Wells for reaching this impressive mile-
stone. They are a great example of the entre-
preneurial spirit that defines New York’s 21st
district. I look forward to their continued suc-
cess.
THE MODERN ASSOCIATION OF
GRADUATES TAKES SHAPE: AOG
HISTORY PART III (1946–1995) SEC-
TION B
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
clude in the RECORD section B of the third in-
stallment of an article by Keith J. Hamel hon-
oring the 150th Anniversary of the West Point
Association of Graduates:
WPAF DISSOLVED
AOG celebrated its centennial in 1969, al-
though there is no mention of the Associa-
tion recognizing its 100th year of existence in
any AOG publication that year (it wasn’t
even brought up at the annual meeting!). In
the first year of the Association’s second
century, two events occurred that signifi-
cantly changed the direction of AOG: First,
Paul Thompson ’29 was elected President;
second, Major General William Knowlton
’43JAN took over as Superintendent from
Major General Samuel Koster ’42. Thompson
and Knowlton, as it turned out, were made
for each other, as each was interested in re-
organizing and reforming the work of AOG.
Weeks before his departure, Koster had an-
nounced plans to raise $10 million through
WPAF in order to endow cadet activities,
calling the plan the ‘‘$10 Million Cadet Ac-
tivities Endowment.’’ Ambitious (since, from
its inception in 1961, the West Point Fund
had raised just $1.02 million), Koster’s plan
reportedly resulted in a 369-percent increase
in contributions over FY1969, but Knowlton
suspended it in the spring of 1970 fearing
‘‘that there may be some duplication of our
fund-raising efforts’’ and announcing that ‘‘a
study is being made to sort out our alumni-
related fund-raising efforts.’’ A year later, in
the 1971 Annual Report of the Super-
intendent, Knowlton declared, ‘‘Pending at
present is a reorganization and consolidation
of the West Point Alumni Foundation and
the Association of Graduates.’’ To hasten
this shakeup, Knowlton had earlier intro-
duced plans to remove the active duty officer
from the Office of Assistant to the Super-
intendent (Gifts Program) who had been
working for AOG, and thus limiting the As-
sociation’s ability to solicit funds for USMA,
and to establish the Alumni Affairs and Gifts
Program Division, a precursor to today’s Di-
rectorate of Academy Advancement.
While Knowlton forced the merger between
AOG and WPAF, it was up to Thompson to
seal the deal. As noted in Lamb’s report, the
leadership at WPAF feared that funds raised
would be directed to AOG ‘‘and that USMA
at most would get crumbs.’’ At a fall 1970
meeting, Thompson convinced George
Olmsted and Cortlandt Schuyler, both Class
of 1922 and key WPAF Board members, that
this would not be the case. Just a few years
earlier, Schuyler had served as AOG Presi-
dent, and his views were valued by Board
members of both organizations. Schuyler
agreed to work with Thompson on the de-
tails of the reorganization, and the following
fall they presented these details to the
WPAF Board of Managers, who ultimately
‘‘decided that it would be in USMA’s best in-
terests to transfer its fundraising and pub-
lishing responsibilities and all its assets to
AOG.’’ On February 8, 1972, AOG and WPAF
signed two memorandums of agreement (one
for fundraising and one for publishing) to
that effect. To that point in time, WPAF had
raised $1.8 million for the Academy. It con-
tinued its existence as a backup to AOG from

1972 to 1987, receiving more than $1,450,000 in
gifts and bequests, all of which were trans-
ferred to AOG before the Foundation finally
voted itself out of business on March 21, 1988.
SEEDS OF ‘‘WPAOG’’ SOWN
Stepping back a bit, one more significant
event occurred closely after AOG’s centen-
nial, but it’s unclear whether it had a direct
impact on Thompson and Knowlton’s vision
to reorganize the Association. In 1972, AOG
received a $1.5 bequest gift from the estate of
Leah and Clement Trott, Class of 1899. Ac-
cording to Lamb’s report, ‘‘The Trott gift
gave the AOG the financial flexibility and
capability to expand program and activity
support of the Academy, as the Cullum gift
had provided graduates their administrative
center and ‘alumni house’ at West Point.’’
Lamb would certainly know: Even though
AOG was losing its active duty officer in the
Superintendent’s office, who did a tremen-
dous amount of work for the Association, the
Trott gift allowed AOG to now hire and pay
a full-time Executive Vice President, and the
person the Association hired was Robert
Lamb. He retired from his position as Alum-
ni Secretary on the Superintendent’s staff on
August 31, 1972 and the next day reported to
AOG in his new role, which he labels in his
report as ‘‘managing director.’’ The Trott
gift also allowed AOG to hire Stephen O.
Fuqua ’33 as Director of Development, Mi-
chael Krisman ’39 as Director of Publica-
tions, and a handful more staff personnel for
its offices on the lower floors of Cullum Hall.
The early 1970s were an exciting time for
the Association. Its membership among
graduates was hovering around 97 percent, it
completed a record annual appeal in 1970
($61,996), and in 1972 AOG’s Endowment Fund
exceeded the $3 million mark, providing
more than $100,000 in interest and dividend
income to annually fund the Association’s
operating expenses (in recognition of its sur-
plus, AOG presented a gift of $25,000 to the
Academy). ‘‘By the summer of 1973, the basic
elements of the reorganization of the Acad-
emy’s alumni affairs were in place,’’ noted
Lamb in his report. Despite these positives,
there were still challenges for the reorga-
nized AOG, none bigger than trying to con-
vince more and more graduates to support
the Academy with a donation. Most of these
graduates had served in an Army for which
almost all recreational activities and facili-
ties were paid by appropriated dollars, and
they did not comprehend why the Academy
needed private funding. Lieutenant General
Sidney Berry ’48, the 50th Superintendent,
addressed this matter in his March 1976 AS-
SEMBLY letter, stating: ‘‘Public funds sup-
port the necessaries of cadet life, education
and training. Privately contributed funds
augment programs and activities supported
by public funds, provide extracurricular op-
portunities for cadets, and in general im-
prove the quality of education and training
at West Point. In short, they provide the
margin of excellence we desire and expect for
the Military Academy and the Corps of Ca-
dets,’’ coining a phrase that is essential to
AOG’s mission today.
More changes familiar to today’s AOG
came in the 1980s. As the new decade began,
AOG had just inaugurated its new travel pro-
gram with a cruise from Texas and added
new trips (three-to-five annually) in the
coming years, and it had launched the West
Point Preparatory Scholarship Program,
which provided funds to deserving candidates
who needed additional instruction at a mili-
tary junior college to ensure success at West
Point. In 1981, AOG President George Dixon
Jr. ’40 convened a long-range planning con-
ference in Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania,
one of the outcomes of which was the estab-
lishment of a West Point Societies Program.
Dozens of West Point Societies had been in
existence by this time, most assisting the
Academy with its Admissions efforts, but
they had been relatively autonomous. The
new program, which was finally imple-
mented in the fall of 1986 with Morris Her-
bert ’50 as its first Director (aided by James
‘‘Skip’’ Wensyel ’52 as Deputy Director of In-
formation), sought to align the 75 or so ac-
tive societies and encouraged them to assist
AOG in achieving its objectives toward the
Academy, rather than their own individual
objectives. On May 1, 1987, AOG held the first
West Point Societies Presidents Conference,
a forerunner of today’s Leaders Conference,
during which Denis Mullane ’52, Chairman of
AOG’s Societies Committee, discussed four
key topics with the 53 society representa-
tives present: admissions support, informa-
tion dissemination, community relations,
and strengthening support between AOG and
societies. Around this time, AOG also estab-
lished a new development program to assist
West Point classes in their efforts to support
the Academy, latter known as Class Giving,
complete with support from AOG Financial
Services to administrate the funds, ensuring
that interest on said funds was properly rein-
vested (Williams Harrison Jr. ’52 became
AOG’s first Director of Financial Services
and Treasurer). Finally, in 1992, AOG intro-
duced the Distinguished Graduate Award
(DGA), its second major annual award (the
first being the Thayer Award). James Van
Fleet, Class of 1915; Matthew Ridgeway,
Class of APR1917; Andrew Goodpaster ’39,
and Thoralf Sundt Jr. ’52 were the first re-
cipients of the DGA.
CONCLUSION—AOG’S NEW HOME
By the end of the 1980s, AOG was taking in
more than $5 million annually in donations,
establishing a financial position that finally
allowed it to realize a decades-long desire to
eliminate membership dues, which it did
starting with the Class of 1994. What’s more,
in 1990, Thomas Russell ’59, a Planned Giving
Officer, took a phone call from the son of
graduate who was inquiring about how much
money it would take to have a building at
West Point named for his father, James K.
Herbert, ’30. Russell explained that the
names for public buildings at the Academy
were made by the Secretary of the Army and
not named for donors, but that AOG would
be willing to name its long-desired alumni
center after his father. Thus, upon his death
in 1990, Herbert bequeathed $3 million to
AOG, which became the lead gift in a cam-
paign to build what became known as the
Herbert Alumni Center. Ground was broken
for AOG’s new home on April 8, 1993, and its
cornerstone was dedicated on October 12, 1993
during Homecoming ceremonies. When the
AOG staff moved into Herbert Alumni Center
on March 1, 1995, the Association had just
completed two banner years: its Develop-
ment staff raised $11.04 million from 14,454
gifts in 1994, with graduate participation in-
creasing to 24 percent, an all-time high; and,
a year earlier, it stood up its Office of Alum-
ni Support (derived from the West Point So-
cieties Program and complete with Society,
Classes, and Communication divisions). But
this was just the start of some amazing suc-
cesses for AOG. Now that it was working out
of Herbert Alumni Center, it was about to re-
alize a goal it had established for itself at
the 1990 Board of Trustees strategic planning
conference, a goal to raise $100 million for
USMA in 10 years, a goal that became known
as the Bicentennial Campaign for West
Point, and it’s the opening subject in the
next and final installment of AOG’s 150-year
history.
RECOGNIZING STATESVILLE BRICK
COMPANY FOR 115 YEARS OF
BUSINESS
HON. TED BUDD
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Statesville Brick Company for 115
years of business.
Due to the Southeast’s unique rivers that
produce red clay deposits, North Carolina has
long been at the center of the brick making
economy. This includes company’s like States-
ville Brick Company which opened its doors in
1904. As times changed though and the post-
World War II building boom began to slow,
brick makers began closing shop, and small,
local operations transitioned into large, inter-
state corporations. Statesville Brick Company,
however, bucked that trend, and remains at
heart the same family-run operation it was
over a century ago.
For Statesville Brick Company President
and General Manager Michael Foster and Ex-
ecutive Vice President Scott Rankin, the brick
business is a generational affair. Scott’s
grandfather E.R. ‘‘Roy’’ Rankin joined the
company in 1916 and oversaw the construc-
tion of an early iteration of the firm’s plant
while Michael’s father, H.B ‘‘Bob’’ Foster
joined as a partner in 1969. Today, Statesville
Brick Company currently employees over 90
people and their work can be found at some
of our nation’s most prestigious academic in-
stitutions such as Princeton University, Ohio
State University, and Davidson College.
Statesville Brick Company’s 115 years of
business are a source of pride for our region,
demonstrating how an operation dedicated to
high craftmanship with deep local roots can
succeed and thrive in a changing landscape.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
celebrating Statesville Brick Company for 115
years of business.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF HABITAT FOR HUMAN-
ITY NORTHEAST MICHIGAN
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize the 30th Anniversary of
Habitat for Humanity Northeast Michigan.
Through their dedicated service and steadfast
devotion to their community, HFHNEMI has
become an indispensable part of Michigan’s
First District.
Habitat for Humanity was founded in 1976
with the goal of helping Americans in need ful-
fill the dream of home ownership while fos-
tering safe and healthy communities. In total,
Habitat for Humanity has helped build or re-
pair more than 800,000 homes and served
more than 4 million people around the world.
With their first home built in 1990, the volun-
teers and staff of HFHNEMI have served the
people of Northern Michigan for three dec-
ades. In 2013, it implemented Habitat for Hu-
manity’s ‘‘A Brush With Kindness’’ program,
providing critical repair services to low-income
homeowners who are physically or financially
unable to maintain their homes. These
projects have included painting, landscaping,
roofing, and accessibility improvements
throughout Northeast Michigan. Since its
founding, HFHNEMI has built, rehabbed, or re-
paired more than 80 homes for low-income
families in Alcona, Alpena, and Presque Isle
counties. Day after day, Habitat for Humanity
Northeast Michigan shows what can be
achieved when the people of a community
work together for the common good.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize
Habitat for Humanity Northeast Michigan for
decades of success and service to Northern
Michigan. Michiganders can take great pride in
knowing the First District is home to such
dedicated citizens. On behalf of my constitu-
ents, I wish them all the best in their future en-
deavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 20TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE PROGRAM
IN BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 20th anniversary of the
Program in Biomedical Sciences at the Univer-
sity of Michigan Medical School.
In 1999, the Program in Biomedical
Sciences (PIBS) at the University of Michigan
Medical School was established to offer stu-
dents a unique flexibility in their academic pur-
suits. As an interdisciplinary gateway, the pro-
gram allows students to access 14 different
Ph.D. programs through one application. Al-
though students can immediately begin train-
ing in one program, PIBS is designed to give
students the opportunity to immerse them-
selves in a variety of different research rota-
tions to find their ideal mentor and project
match. Based on their discovered research in-
terests and the help of over 500 faculty mem-
bers, program directors, and academic advi-
sors, students choose a permanent program
to continue by the end of their first PIBS year,
sometimes in a far different research area
than originally anticipated.
The biomedical sciences are demanding
disciplines, but PIBS has made the fields of
study less daunting for many students who
have entered its Ph.D. programs. Throughout
the past two decades, PIBS has been helping
students become more confident in their ca-
reer paths by allowing them to take the time
to cultivate their interests and explore different
opportunities to discover their research pas-
sions. Thanks to the program, countless stu-
dents have been trained to guide the nation in
scientific discovery, truly becoming the leaders
and best.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the Program in Biomedical
Sciences at the University of Michigan Medical
School for its significant work in the bio-
medical sciences. For twenty years, PIBS has
played a fundamental role in educating our na-
tion’s sharpest minds.

HONORING ANNIE ‘‘ANNA’’ MAE
STEWART
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues in the U.S. House of Representatives
to join me as I rise to pay tribute to Annie
‘‘Anna’’ Mae Stewart after her passing on Au-
gust 3, 2019.
On April 9, 1917, Anna Mae Johnson en-
tered the world as the eldest child born to
Elder Allen Waters and Elizabeth Johnson in
Washington, DC.
She met and married Charles Earl Stewart
on Oct 8, 1937 at St Augustine’s Catholic
Church. She chose to follow her husband in
his faith and converted to Catholicism in 1951
at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church
(OLPH).
Anna began working at St Teresa’s convent
and later worked at the OLPH rectory, a ca-
reer that would last for more than 20 years.
There she fostered close relationships with
many priests and seminarians, such as
George Leary, Jr., a man who would become
a surrogate son.
She was actively involved in parent, school
and church organizations, including
Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, Baptism
and Confirmation prep, catechist and a pas-
sionate Catholic Youth Organization advisor.
She was an active member of other organiza-
tions, such as St Joseph’s Ladies’ Auxiliary
No. 213 KOSJI Sodality, Legion of Mary,
Catholic Charities, Cursillistas, OLPH
Hilltoppers, OLPH Women’s’ Ministry, and her
two favorites, Eucharistic Ministry and Lector.
She enjoyed being of service to her church
community in every way possible.
Anna was also a dedicated community ac-
tivist. She joined her local Orange Hat Coali-
tion and helped rid her neighborhood of drug
dealers at the height of the crack cocaine epi-
demic. She was instrumental in getting the
Eastover Shopping Center integrated, which
led to her recognition for her commitment to
the civil rights movement. She was acknowl-
edged by Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc as
a Village Keeper for that effort and received
other honors, including Mother of the Year
1960 and 1963 by the Afro American news-
paper. She participated in the March on
Washington in 1967 and took much pride in
voting for the first Black President in 2008.
Madam Speaker, I know my fellow members
of the U.S. House of Representatives agree
that Anna Mae Stewart deserves to be recog-
nized at the time of her passing for her dedi-
cation to her church, her family, and her com-
munity.

Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the life and accomplishments of
Jessi Combs, who passed away on August
27, 2019 from injuries sustained during a land
speed record attempt.
Jessi was born in Rockerville, South Dakota
on July 27. 1980. After graduating from High
School, Combs established a career in metal
fabrication. and graduated from the Collision &
Refinishing Core Program at Wyo Tech in
2004. Her unique blend of technical and per-
sonal skills led to her rapid career growth, and
she frequently appeared on television shows
showcasing different aspects of the auto-
motive industry. This included serving as host
of Mythbusters and Xtreme 4x4.
As a competitor, Jessi was fierce and
unrivaled. She competed in the Baja 1000, the
Rallye Aicha des Gazelles, and was the first
woman to place at Ultra4’s King of the Ham-
mers. In 2016 she followed up her earlier King
of the Hammers success by finishing first in
the 2016 Smittybilt Everyman Challenge Modi-
fied Class. In 2013. Combs successfully set
the women’s land speed record at the Alvord
Desert in Oregon, holding a record of 398
mph with a top speed of 483.227 mph.
Jessi was an incredible person who was
taken from this Earth far too soon. My condo-
lences are with her family, friends. and the en-
tire automotive industry as they continued to

RECOGNIZING NANCY WHEELER-
NICHOLS AS THE KERN COUNTY
FAIR PERSON OF THE YEAR
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 19, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Nancy Wheeler-Nich-
ols, who has been selected as the 2019 Per-
son of the Year by the Kern County Fair, a
county that I’m honored to represent in this
Chamber.
Nancy, a graduate of Bakersfield’s Garces
High School and the University of San Diego,
first started volunteering with the Kern County
Fair in 1989, almost 30 years ago, when she
was painting faces, putting together buttons,
and inspiring a new generation of leaders to
become involved in Agriculture. Nancy was
appointed to the Board of the Kern County
Fair in 2003 and has been a consistent pres-
ence for over 15 years in the fair’s operations.
Her agricultural insights have taken her be-
yond the needs of my district, however, as she
was recently appointed by then Governor
Jerry Brown to the Board of Directors for Cali-
fornia’s Mid State Fair.
Outside of her work with the Kern County
Fair, Nancy has served our community
through a variety of organizations, including
the Junior League of Bakersfield. She has
been a tireless and much-needed voice for
children experiencing abuse and neglect as a
Court Appointed Special Advocate, and also
on the board of the California Living Museum,
an animal rehabilitation facility in my district
that specializes in nursing back to health
many of California’s most vulnerable species.
In Kern County, agriculture is the lifeblood
of our community, and the Kern County Fair
has emerged as one of the biggest showcases
of livestock and talent in our agricultural com-
munity. Although Nancy no longer lives in Ba-
kersfield or Kern County, she is one of our
own who consistently makes Kern County
proud. Through her time and expertise, Nancy
has made a tangible impact in our community
and has made her a staple of the Kern County
community.
Kern County Fair Person of the Year is a
well-deserved honor for Nancy, who has pro-
vided years of public service to our community
and has contributed to countless events, suc-
cessful animal shows, and old-fashioned fam-
ily fun. A selfless leader, Nancy juggles her
volunteer and board work along with raising
