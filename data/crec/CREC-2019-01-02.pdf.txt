PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
O God, from whom all desires and
good counsels proceed, rise mercifully
upon our darkened hearts, and deliver
us from the trench warfare of yet an-
other government shutdown. Wipe out
all our old, secret, and selfish desires
so that we may be true instruments for
Your glory. Lord, remind our law-
makers that You are our strength and
that those who abandon You cannot ul-
timately prevail.
Be near to this Nation, O Lord. We
are Your children and find our protec-
tion in You.
We pray in Your mighty Name.
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
(Mr. GARDNER assumed the Chair.)
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
YOUNG). The majority leader is recog-
nized.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
would like to wish my colleagues
happy new year. It is a time for new be-
ginnings. Tomorrow, we will kick off
the 116th Congress.
Of course, there is urgent business
that the new House and the new Senate
will need to tackle immediately.
Democrats will finally have to get seri-
ous about border security so a govern-
ment funding agreement can be
reached that can pass the House, earn
60 votes in the Senate, and get a Presi-
dential signature. All three of those
things are needed to make a law. One
partisan vote in the House tomorrow is
not going to solve anything.
I made it clear to the Speaker that
we are not interested in having show
votes in the Senate. We are interested
in bringing up something the House
has passed, 60 Senators will support,
and the President will sign; in other
words, make a law.
The legislation House Democrats are
reportedly planning to introduce and
have voted on tomorrow will not be a
serious contribution to the negotia-
tions that are going on between the ad-
ministration and the incoming Demo-
cratic majority in the House. It isn’t
comprehensive. It ignores the needs of
border security. It is exactly the kind
of proposal you would expect if the in-
coming House Democrats were choos-
ing to stage a political sideshow rather
than doing the hard work of helping to
govern the country; in other words, it
is a total nonstarter.
Will these new Democrats come to
Washington ready to roll up their
sleeves, work together, and make laws
or are they going to waste time on par-
tisan show votes that will do nothing
to move the country in a forward direc-
tion? That is the question, political
performance art or responsible govern-
ance?
We will get an early signal in the
next few days, but let me make it per-
fectly clear one more time, as I have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8052 January 2, 2019
said consistently for the last 2 weeks:
The Senate will not waste its time con-
sidering a Democratic bill which can-
not pass this Chamber and which the
President will not sign.
NOMINATIONS
Mr. President, on another matter, I
am pleased to announce this evening
that the Democratic leader and I have
reached an agreement to confirm a
number of the administration’s nomi-
nees. In a few moments, I will be ask-
ing unanimous consent to confirm a se-
ries of several well-qualified individ-
uals to serve in important executive
branch posts. Each of them will be con-
firmed. I am glad the President will
have more of his rightful team in place,
and I am glad this group of newly con-
firmed nominees will be able to get to
work on important business for the
American people.

EXECUTIVE SESSION
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following treaty on today’s
Executive Calendar No. 7. I further ask
unanimous consent that the treaty be
considered as having passed through its
various parliamentary stages, up to
and including the presentation of the
resolution of ratification; that any
committee conditions, declarations, or
reservations be agreed to as applicable;
that any statements be printed in the
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD as if read; fur-
ther, that when the resolution of ratifi-
cation is voted upon, the motion to re-
consider be laid upon the table and
that the President be immediately no-
tified of the Senate’s action.
There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded to consider Treaty Docu-
ment No. 114–7, U.N. Convention on the
Assignment of Receivables in Inter-
national Trade.
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask for a division
vote on the resolution of ratification.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
question is on the resolution of ratifi-
cation.
All in favor stand and be counted. All
opposed stand and be counted.
Two-thirds of the Senators present
having voted in the affirmative, the
resolution of ratification is agreed to.
The resolution of ratification is as
follows:
Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators
present concurring therein),
Section 1. Senate Advice and Consent Sub-
ject to Understandings and Declarations.
The Senate advises and consents to the
ratification of the United Nations Conven-
tion on the Assignment of Receivables in
International Trade, done at New York on
December 12, 2001, and signed by the United
States on December 30, 2003 (the ‘‘Conven-
tion’’) (Treaty Doc. 114–7), subject to the un-
derstandings of section 2 and the declara-
tions of sections 3 and 4.
Sec. 2. Understandings.
The Senate’s advice and consent under sec-
tion 1 is subject to the following under-
standings, which shall be included in the in-
strument of ratification:
(1) It is the understanding of the United
States that paragraph (2)(e) of Article 4 ex-
cludes from the scope of the Convention the
assignment of—
(A) receivables that are securities, regard-
less of whether such securities are held with
an intermediary; and
(B) receivables that are not securities, but
are financial assets or instruments, if such
financial assets or instruments are held with
an intermediary.
(2) It is the understanding of the United
States that the phrase ‘‘that place where the
central administration of the assignor or the
assignee is exercised,’’ as used in Articles
5(h) and 36 of the Convention, has a meaning
equivalent to the phrase, ‘‘that place where
the chief executive office of the assignor or
assignee is located.’’
(3) It is the understanding of the United
States that the reference, in the definition of
‘‘financial contract’’ in Article 5(k), to ‘‘any
other transaction similar to any transaction
referred to above entered into in financial
markets’’ is intended to include transactions
that are or become the subject of recurrent
dealings in financial markets and under
which payment rights are determined by ref-
erence to—
(A) underlying asset classes; or
(B) quantitative measures of economic or
financial risk or value associated with an oc-
currence or contingency. Examples are
transactions under which payment rights are
determined by reference to weather statis-
tics, freight rates, emissions allowances, or
economic statistics.
(4) It is the understanding of the United
States that because the Convention applies
only to ‘‘receivables,’’ which are defined in
Article 2(a) as contractual rights to payment
of a monetary sum, the Convention does not
apply to other rights of a party to a license
of intellectual property or an assignment or
other transfer of an interest in intellectual
property or other types of interests that are
not a contractual right to payment of a mon-
etary sum.
(5) The United States understands that,
with respect to Article 24 of the Convention,
the Article requires a Contracting State to
provide a certain minimum level of rights to
an assignee with respect to proceeds, but
that it does not prohibit Contracting States
from providing additional rights in such pro-
ceeds to such an assignee.
Sec. 3. Declarations to be Included in the
Instrument of Ratification.
The Senate’s advice and consent under sec-
tion 1 is subject to the following declara-
tions, which shall be included in the instru-
ment of ratification:
(1) Pursuant to Article 23(3), the United
States declares that, in an insolvency pro-
ceeding of the assignor, the insolvency laws
of the United States or its territorial units
may under some circumstances—
(A) result in priority over the rights of an
assignee being given to a lender extending
credit to the insolvency estate, or to an in-
solvency administrator that expends funds of
the insolvency estate for the preservation of
the assigned receivables (see, for example,
title 11 of the United States Code, sections
364(d) and 506(c)); or
(B) subject the assignment of receivables
to avoidance rules, such as those dealing
with preferences, undervalued transactions
and transactions intended to defeat, delay,
or hinder creditors of the assignor.
(2) Pursuant to Article 36 of the Conven-
tion, the United States declares that, with
respect to an assignment of receivables gov-
erned by enactments of Article 9 of the Uni-
form Commercial Code, as adopted in one of
its territorial units, if an assignor’s location
pursuant to Article 5(h) of the Convention is
the United States and, under the location
rules contained in section 9–307 of the Uni-
form Commercial Code, as adopted in that
territorial unit, the assignor is located in a
territorial unit of the United States, that
territorial unit is the location of the as-
signor for purposes of this Convention.
(3) Pursuant to Article 37 of the Conven-
tion, the United States declares that any ref-
erence in the Convention to the law of the
United States means the law in force in the
territorial unit thereof determined in ac-
cordance with Article 36 and the Article 5(h)
definition of location. However, to the extent
under the conflict-of-laws rules in force in
that territorial unit, a particular matter
would be governed by the law in force in a
different territorial unit of the United
States, the reference to ‘‘law of the United
States’’ with respect to that matter is to the
law in force in the different territorial unit.
The conflict-of-laws rules referred to in the
preceding sentence refer primarily to the
conflict-of-laws rules in section 9–301 of the
Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in each
State of the United States.
(4) Pursuant to Article 39 of the Conven-
tion, the United States declares that it will
not be bound by chapter V of the Convention.
(5) Pursuant to Article 40, the United
States declares that the Convention does not
affect contractual anti-assignment provi-
sions where the debtor is a governmental en-
tity or an entity constituted for a public
purpose in the United States.
Sec. 4. Self-Execution Declaration.
The Senate’s advice and consent under sec-
tion 1 is subject to the following declaration:
This Convention is self-executing.

f
TREATY WITHDRAWALS
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President,
today I wish to call attention to Presi-
dent Trump’s recent decisions to with-
draw or threaten U.S. withdrawal from
four treaties: the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty, INF Treaty;
the Universal Postal Union, UPU, trea-
ty; the Optional Protocol to the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations,
‘‘VCDR Option Protocol’’; and the
Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations
and Consular Rights between the
United States and Iran, ‘‘Treaty of
Amity’’. The President made these de-
cisions without notice or meaningful
consultation with the Senate Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, the con-
gressional committee charged with re-
sponsibility and jurisdiction over trea-
ties.
As the ranking member of that com-
mittee, I am compelled to strenuously
object to the manner in which the
President has acted, but all Senators
should protest, regardless of their
views on the substance of the respec-
tive agreements. The President’s ac-
tions erode the constitutional powers
of this body and our institutional pre-
rogatives.
Article 2 of the Constitution endows
the President and the Senate with
shared power over treaties. The Presi-
dent, it states, ‘‘shall have power, by
and with the advice and consent of the
Senate, to make treaties, provided two
thirds of the Senators present concur.’’
While the Constitution does not ex-
pressly dictate a procedure for termi-
nating treaty relationships, Senators
have long asserted that the shared
treaty power extends to withdrawal
and therefore also requires Senate ad-
vice and consent. Even though the ex-
ecutive branch may not agree with this
position, what is unacceptable is that
Senators are first learning about these
withdrawals online or in the newspaper
instead of through proactive outreach
by and meaningful dialogue with the
executive branch.
President Trump has regrettably
shown exceedingly little respect for the
Constitution and for the institutional
prerogatives of this body. I stand today
to highlight one area in which he has
actively undermined the Senate’s con-
stitutional role and authority. I plan
to do everything in my power to pro-
tect the Senate’s role and responsibil-
ities over treaties and urge all of my
colleagues to join in this effort.
f
TRIBUTE TO ALISE ORLOFF
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, be-
fore the 115th Congress draws to a
close, I want to recognize and thank
Alise Orloff, who retired on July 1,
2017, after serving more than 36 years
as a U.S. Capitol tour guide.
Alise is a proud Marylander and life-
long resident of Silver Spring. An
alumna of Northwood High School, she
graduated cum laude from the Univer-
sity of Maryland College Park in 1981
with a bachelor of science in education.
While at UMCP, she was inducted into
the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society in
recognition of her academic excellence,
integrity, and service to the commu-
nity and into Kappa Delta Pi, the
international honor society in edu-
cation.
Between her junior and senior years
in college, in 1980, Alise worked as a
seasonal Capitol guide and was invited
to return for the summer of 1981. Al-
though Alise received several job offers
in teaching, she relished the oppor-
tunity she had at the Capitol to learn
something new every day and to make
a difference in the lives of visitors. On
December 19, 1981, she became a full-
time Capitol guide, first with the U.S.
Capitol Guide Service and then, after
the opening of the U.S. Capitol Visitor
Center, with the Architect of the Cap-
itol.
Capitol guides are Congress’s front-
line representatives to the visiting
public. To a great extent, our visiting
constituents’ opinions of us are formed
by their experiences on tours. Alise is a
patriotic American who loves the Cap-
itol Building and treasured the privi-
lege and honor of working in it to edu-
cate people about our government. As a
professional educator, she enjoyed re-
searching and learning about Congress,
art, architecture, history, and the leg-
islative process. She could give an ac-
curate and diplomatic answer to any

visitor’s question. In doing so, she
hoped that we might be more unified as
a country, love our country, and appre-
ciate each other’s differences. At the
end of a tour, she found it gratifying
when Capitol visitors would say,
‘‘Thank you. I learned something
new.’’ Her colleagues especially appre-
ciated the graciousness and poise she
maintained while providing first-class
constituent service. She was a role
model to her peers.
Alise’s 36 years as a guide began dur-
ing the 96th Congress and concluded
during the 115th, spanning many his-
toric events within the Capitol and
seven Presidencies, from Jimmy
Carter’s to Donald Trump’s. In addi-
tion to leading public and special
tours, she worked at Presidential inau-
gurations, Congressional Gold Medal
Ceremonies, Joint Sessions of Con-
gress, statue and bust dedications, and
lying-in-state ceremonies, including
those of Senators Claude Pepper and
Daniel K. Inouye. Having been at work
on September 11, 2001, she was espe-
cially touched by the Congressional
Gold Medal ceremony honoring the
fallen heroes of that day. Much of her
extended family was lost in the Holo-
caust, which made working at the Hol-
ocaust Days of Remembrance cere-
monies especially meaningful for her.
Another special moment included
Speaker Tip O’Neill asking her, ‘‘Are
you a baseball fan?’’ when she went to
his office to give a tour to the Boston
Red Sox. Likewise, the day she gave a
tour to the team of NASA astronauts
who brought Dr. Shannon Lucid back
to earth was one she will never forget.
Today I ask my colleagues to join me
in expressing our gratitude and appre-
ciation to Alise Orloff, who inspired
and educated visitors to the U.S. Cap-
itol for more than 36 years. We wish
her well in her new role as scholarship
coordinator for the University of Mary-
land College Park Chapter of the Phi
Kappa Phi Honor Society.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
150TH ANNIVERSARY OF FORT
SILL
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my
honor to pay tribute to Fort Sill in
Oklahoma in preparation of this great
military installation’s 150th anniver-
sary on January 8, 2019. For 150 years,
Fort Sill has played a critical role in
our national defense, from an outpost
to prevent border raids, to today as the
home of the Fires Center of Excellence
and Basic Combat Training site. The
history of Fort Sill can be traced back
to January 8, 1869, when Major General
Philip H. Sheridan staked out the site
of Fort Sill in a campaign into Indian
Territory to prevent border settle-
ments from being raided in Texas and
Kansas. The garrison was initially
named Camp Wichita and was later re-
named after Brigadier General Joshua
W. Sill, in honor of General Sheridan’s
West Point classmate and friend who
was killed during the American Civil
War.
The first post commander was Brevet
Major General Benjamin Grierson, and
the first Indian agent was Colonel Al-
bert Gallatin Boone, grandson of Dan-
iel Boone. The last Indian lands in
Oklahoma opened for settlement in
1901, and 29,000 homesteaders registered
at Fort Sill during July for the land
lottery. On August 6, 1901, the town of
Lawton was established and quickly
grew to become the third largest city
in Oklahoma and was later renamed
Lawton-Fort Sill.
With the disappearance of the fron-
tier, the mission of Fort Sill gradually
changed from cavalry to field artillery
as the first artillery battery arrived at
Fort Sill in 1902, and the last cavalry
regiment departed in May 1907. In 1917,
the Henry Post Army Airfield was con-
structed for artillery observation and
spotting. The School of Fire for the
Field Artillery was founded at Fort Sill
in 1911 and continues to operate today
as the world-renowned U.S. Army Field
Artillery School. At various historic
times, Fort Sill has also served as
home to the Infantry School of Mus-
ketry, the School for Aerial Observers,
the Artillery Officers Candidate
School—Robinson Barracks—the Air
Service Flying School, and the Army
Aviation School. Fort Sill is the birth-
place of military combat aviation, 1st
Aero Squadron. It is home to Henry
Post Army Airfield, the oldest airfield
in the Army. In August 1917, Captain
H.R. Eyrich surveyed a new airfield lo-
cation at Fort Sill and established the
airfield, which is named after Second
Lieutenant Henry D. Post.
Fort Sill remains the only Active
Army installation of all the forts on
the South Plains built during the In-
dian Wars and was designated as a Na-
tional Historic Landmark in 1960. Fort
Sill serves as home of the U.S. Army
Field Artillery School; the U.S. Army
Air Defense Artillery School; the 428th
Field Artillery Training Brigade; the
30th Air Defense Artillery Training
Brigade; the 434th Field Artillery Basic
Combat Training Brigade; the Marine
Corps Field Artillery Military Occupa-
tional Specialty school, the 75th
(Forces Command) Fires Brigade; and
the 31st (Forces Command) Air Defense
Artillery Brigade.
Thousands of soldiers and marines
have been trained for service in the
field artillery at Fort Sill. Notable
alumni include President Harry S. Tru-
man, who during World War I became
the commander of Company D, 129th
Field Artillery, entering combat in the
last few months of the war, moving his
horse-drawn battery to engage the
enemy and supporting the infantry, fir-
ing his last shot on the day of the ar-
mistice.
It is also important to recognize the
positive impact and connectivity of the
Lawton-Fort Sill relationship. The
connection between the community
and the military installation is what
makes Fort Sill so unique and success-
ful. The community members and rep-
resentatives are equally responsible for
the rich history and successes of Fort
Sill. Based on exemplary community
support and vision, Fort Sill has actu-
ally benefited from five rounds of Base
Realignment and Closure. Through
these five rounds, the mission and im-
portance of Fort Sill has increased.
This highlights the fact that Fort Sill
is more than just a military installa-
tion, for 150 years Fort Sill has been a
part of the community.
As Fort Sill turns 150, the senior
leadership at the installation represent
the long history of high-caliber mili-
tary personnel who have set foot at
Fort Sill. I would like to recognize the
following personnel: the Fires Center of
Excellence and Fort Sill commanding
general MG Wilson Shoffner, Jr.; Fires
Center of Excellence CSM John W.
Folley; Fort Sill garrison commander
COL Don A. King, Jr.; Fires Center of
Excellence Field Artillery School com-
mandant BG Stephen G. Smith; and
Fires Center of Excellence Air Defense
Artillery School commandant BG
Brian W. Gibson.
On behalf of Congress and the United
States of America, I want to congratu-
late Fort Sill on 150 successful years
and thank the men and women who
have served their nation while assigned
to Fort Sill for their continued com-
mitment, sacrifice, and contributions
to this great Nation.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petition or memorial
was laid before the Senate and was re-
ferred or ordered to lie on the table as
indicated:
POM–320. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
urging the United States Congress to pass
the language from the Hemp Farming Act of
2018, as contained in the Farm Bill of 2018,
removing industrial hemp from the Schedule
1 Controlled Substance List and legalizing
commercial industrial hemp production in
the United States; to the Committee on the
Judiciary.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 421
Whereas, A bipartisan effort has taken
place at both the Federal and State levels to
pass legislation which would allow American
farmers to compete with foreign nations in
industrial hemp production; and
Whereas, The United States relied upon
hemp production from the time period of the
Mayflower voyage to the War of 1812 and
through every world war; and
Whereas, Hemp production in Pennsyl-
vania has a 260-year history due to the favor-
able climate and soil, and
Whereas, Industrial hemp plants are cul-
tivated for products derived from the whole
plant, including stalk, seeds, flower and
roots for products including fiber, food, oil
and extracts; and
Whereas, Industrial hemp has thousands of
applications and can be refined into a vari-
ety of commercial products including paper,
textiles, biodegradable plastics,
cannabinoids, paint, insulation, biofuel, food
and animal feed; and
Whereas, Each year, American companies
are forced to import millions of dollars’
worth of industrial hemp seed and fiber prod-
ucts annually from China, Canada, Europe
and other countries; and
Whereas, Industrial hemp has often been
confused with marijuana, as it is a member
of the cannabis family; however, it has no
psychoactive effect due to a very low level of
tetrahydrocannabinol; and
Whereas, Chapter 7 of Title 3 of the Penn-
sylvania Consolidated Statutes defines in-
dustrial hemp as the plant Cannabis saliva
L. and any part of the plant with less than
three-tenths of one percent
tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC;
and
Whereas, Uncertainty about Federal laws
inhibits investment in the United States and
Pennsylvania hemp industry by agricultural
producers, manufacturers, processors and
other businesses; and
Whereas, Section 7606 of the Agricultural
Act of 2014, the Farm Bill of 2014 and the Om-
nibus Appropriations Act of 2016, authorized
State industrial hemp agricultural pilot re-
search programs and the activities associ-
ated with such programs; and
Whereas, The Department of Agriculture of
the Commonwealth, farmers, researchers and
industry leaders recognized the potential for
opportunities in industrial hemp production
and products and in investment in Penn-
sylvania’s industrial hemp industry where
this Commonwealth could become a national
leader to take advantage of the potential $1
billion national market for growing, pro-
ducing, processing and selling industrial
hemp and industrial hemp products; and
Whereas, To this end, in 2016, the General
Assembly and Governor of the Common-
wealth enacted Act 92 of 2016, which estab-
lished Chapter 7 of Title 3 of the Pennsyl-
vania Consolidated Statutes and authorized
an industrial hemp research pilot program to
commence the initial research into such po-
tential opportunities; and
Whereas, In the fall of 2018, the Congress of
the United States is poised to pass the lan-
guage from the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, as
contained in the 2018 Farm Bill, which re-
moves industrial hemp from the Schedule I

Controlled Substance List and legalizes com-
mercial industrial hemp production in the
United States; and
Whereas, The Department of Agriculture of
the Commonwealth is encouraged to imme-
diately commence a study of this Common-
wealth’s industrial hemp pilot program and
other industrial hemp pilot programs in
other states and their regulations to rec-
ommend any draft statutory or draft regu-
latory language to the General Assembly to
expedite the entry of this Commonwealth
into the commercial industrial hemp market
upon passage of the language from the Hemp
Farming Act by the Congress of the United
States: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress of
the United States to pass the language from
the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, as contained
in the Farm Bill of 2018, removing industrial
hemp from the Schedule I Controlled Sub-
stance List and legalizing commercial indus-
trial hemp production in the United States;
and be it further
Resolved, That the Senate of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania urge the Department
of Agriculture of the Commonwealth to
begin a study of the industrial hemp re-
search pilot programs established under Act
92 of 2016 and similar research pilot programs
in other states and their regulations to pre-
pare any recommended draft legislation for
submission to the General Assembly and a
framework for any draft regulatory provi-
sions that incorporate the following:
(1) The growth and cultivation of indus-
trial hemp produced in compliance with Fed-
eral law is an agricultural crop.
(2) The producers of industrial hemp within
the Commonwealth have access to United
States-supported seed, germplasm, rooted
cuttings and other genetics.
(3) All industrial hemp products, including
genetics, that are produced in this Common-
wealth shall be able to be freely shipped
across State lines into and out of this Com-
monwealth.
(4) The Department of Agriculture of the
Commonwealth prepares a process for insti-
tutions of higher education in this Common-
wealth to obtain approval to conduct indus-
trial hemp research that complies with exist-
ing law and is eligible for Federal grant
funding.
(5) The Department of Agriculture of the
Commonwealth prepares educational pro-
grams and materials for the education of
youth and the public on the growth, cultiva-
tion and market potential for industrial
hemp; and be it further
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be
transmitted to the Governor, the Secretary
of Agriculture of the Commonwealth, the
presiding officers of each house of Congress
and to each member of Congress from Penn-
sylvania.

ANNIVERSARY OF THE NA-
TIONAL DAY OF PRAYER ESTAB-
LISHED UNDER THE ACT ENTI-
TLED ‘‘AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR
SETTING ASIDE THE FIRST
THURSDAY IN MAY AS THE
DATE ON WHICH THE NATIONAL
DAY OF PRAYER IS CELE-
BRATED’’, APPROVED MAY 5,
1988, WHICH WAS SIGNED BY
PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN ON
MAY 5, 1988
Mr. LANKFORD (for himself, Mr.
KING, Mr. COTTON, Mr. WICKER, Mr.
DAINES, Mr. RISCH, Mrs. ERNST, Mr.
BLUNT, Ms. HEITKAMP, Mr. HOEVEN, Mr.
CASSIDY, Mr. BOOZMAN, Mr. KENNEDY,
and Mr. RUBIO) submitted the following
resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on the Judiciary:
S. RES. 744
Whereas section 119 of title 36, United
States Code, states that, ‘‘The President
shall issue each year a proclamation desig-
nating the first Thursday in May as a Na-
tional Day of Prayer on which the people of
the United States may turn to God in prayer
and meditation at churches, in groups, and
as individuals.’’;
Whereas May 3, 2018, marks the 30th anni-
versary of the National Day of Prayer estab-
lished under the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to pro-
vide for setting aside the first Thursday in
May as the date on which the National Day
of Prayer is celebrated’’, approved May 5,
1988 (Public Law 100–307; 102 Stat. 456) (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘Public Law
100–307’’), which was signed by President
Ronald Reagan on May 5, 1988, and later
codified as section 119 of title 36, United
States Code;
Whereas, as Senator Jesse Helms stated on
the day the vehicle that would become Pub-
lic Law 100–307 passed the Senate—
(1) ‘‘Designating the first Thursday in May
as the National Day of Prayer allows the
people of the United States to plan and pre-
pare to intercede as a corporate body on be-
half of the Nation and its leaders from year
to year with certainty.’’; and
(2) ‘‘[T]he magnitude of America’s prob-
lems, within and without the country, evi-
dence a need for divine healing and guid-
ance.’’;
Whereas, as Representative Tony Hall stat-
ed on the day the vehicle that would become
Public Law 100–307 passed the House of Rep-
resentatives, ‘‘This will help to bring more
certainty to the scheduling of events related
to the National Day of Prayer, and permit
more effective long-range planning. For the
past 7 years, the day has been observed in
May, but before this period it was observed
at different times of the year. Clarifying leg-
islation is needed to ensure consistent and
dependable observance of the National Day
of Prayer.’’;
Whereas the United States has a long his-
tory of turning to prayer both in times of
crisis and in times of thanksgiving, as dem-
onstrated on the following occasions:
(1) President Barack Obama stated in Pres-
idential Proclamation No. 9441 of May 4, 2016
(81 Fed. Reg. 27983), ‘‘In times of steady calm
and extraordinary change alike, Americans
of all walks of life have long turned to pray-
er to seek refuge, demonstrate gratitude, and
discover peace. Sustaining us through great
uncertainty and moments of sorrow, prayer
allows us an outlet for introspection, and for
expressing our hopes, desires, and fears. It
offers strength in the face of hardship, and
redemption when we falter. Our country was
founded on the idea of religious freedom, and
we have long upheld the belief that how we
pray and whether we pray are matters re-
served for an individual’s own conscience. On
National Day of Prayer, we rededicate our-
selves to extending this freedom to all peo-
ple.’’;
(2) President Donald Trump stated in Pres-
idential Proclamation No. 9634 of September
1, 2017 (82 Fed. Reg. 42439), ‘‘I urge Americans
of all faiths and religious traditions and
backgrounds to offer prayers today for all
those harmed by Hurricane Harvey, includ-
ing people who have lost family members or
been injured, those who have lost homes or
other property, and our first responders, law
enforcement officers, military personnel, and
medical professionals leading the response
and recovery efforts. Each of us, in our own
way, may call upon our God for strength and
comfort during this difficult time. I call on
all Americans and houses of worship
throughout the Nation to join in one voice of
prayer, as we seek to uplift one another and
assist those suffering from the consequences
of this terrible storm.’’.
(3) On September 5, 2017, in response to
Hurricane Harvey, Minority Leader of the
Senate Chuck Schumer said on the floor of

the Senate, ‘‘Right now, large parts of the
fourth largest city in our country remain un-
derwater. I extend my most heartfelt sym-
pathies to the people of Houston and to those
across parts of Texas and Louisiana who are
just beginning a long road to recovery from
Hurricane Harvey. Having lived through
Hurricane Sandy in my home State of New
York, I remember the agonies of families
who lost their homes, lost their businesses,
and, particularly in the first month, had a
sense of helplessness about what had hap-
pened to them. Our thoughts and prayers are
with everyone in Houston.’’.
(4) On June 14, 2017, after the shooting in
Alexandria, Virginia—
(A) Senator James Lankford said in a pray-
er on the floor of the Senate, ‘‘[A]s I have
walked through the hallways heading back
and forth to different meetings, I have been
interested to see many doors that I have
walked by, and when those doors were open,
I could hear people inside praying. There
have been at least three organized prayer
meetings on the Hill today, specifically re-
lated just to that, and others spontaneously
occurring. Just for a moment we have the
opportunity to be able to reflect and say to
God: Thank You so much for protecting the
people on that field. Thank you again to the
Capitol Police, who literally put their lives
on the line to protect the guests and the
Members and staff here every single day . . .
I would like to be able to join what is hap-
pening all over this Hill for just a moment in
this room—for us to be able to pray for a mo-
ment . . . .’’;
(B) Minority Leader of the House of Rep-
resentatives Nancy Pelosi said on the floor
of the House of Representatives, ‘‘You may
not know this, my colleagues, but every time
I pray, which is very frequently, and cer-
tainly every Sunday, I pray for all of you, all
of you together. In the earlier years, I used
to pray for your happiness, for the fact that
we would, working together, heed the words
of President Kennedy in the closing of his in-
augural address when he said: ‘. . . God’s
work must truly be our own.’ How do we
view what God’s will is for us? How do we
come together to give confidence to the
American people? As our Founders intended,
we would have our disagreements and we
would debate them, and we would have con-
fidence in our beliefs and humility to listen
to others. But in more recent years, I have
been praying not only for that, but for our
safety . . . My prayer is that we can resolve
our differences in a way that furthers the
preamble to the Constitution, takes us closer
to ‘e pluribus unum.’ And today, again, it is
in the family. It is an injury in the family
for the staff and for our colleague and for his
leadership.’’; and
(C) Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives Paul Ryan said on the floor of the
House of Representatives, ‘‘My colleagues,
there are so many memories from this day
that we will want to forget, and there are so
many images that we will not want to see
again. But there is one image in particular
that this House should keep, and that is a
photo I saw this morning of our Democratic
colleagues gathered in prayer this morning
after hearing the news . . . So before this
House returns to its business, let’s just slow
down and reflect to think about how we are
all being tested right now, because we are
being tested right now. I ask each of you to
join me to resolve to come together, to lift
each other up, and to show the country, to
show the world, that we are one House, the
people’s House, united in our humanity. It is
that humanity which will win the day, and it
always will. God bless.’’.
(5) On September 28, 2017, Representative
Steve Scalise, marking his return to the
House of Representatives after being shot on
a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, said
on the floor of House of Representatives,
‘‘[W]hen I was laying out on that ball field,
the first thing I did once I was down and
couldn’t move anymore is I just started to
pray. And I’ll tell you it gave me an unbe-
lievable sense of calm knowing that at that
point it was in God’s hands. But I prayed for
very specific things, and I will tell you pret-
ty much every one of those prayers was an-
swered, and they were some pretty chal-
lenging prayers I was putting in God’s hands.
He really did deliver for me and my family.
And it just gives you that renewed faith and
understanding that the power of prayer is
something that you just cannot underesti-
mate.’’.
(6) On October 2, 2017, after the shooting in
Las Vegas, Nevada, Majority Leader of the
Senate Mitch McConnell said on the floor of
the Senate, ‘‘The news we awoke to this
morning was heartbreaking. What happened
in Las Vegas is shocking, it is tragic, and for
those affected and their families, it is dev-
astating. It is hard to even imagine their
pain. I hope they will know that we are pray-
ing for them now. I hope they will find
strength in the love and kindness of those
around them in these hours of such darkness
and pain. I hope they will see that our coun-
try is standing by their side today.’’;
Whereas the act of prayer is both an ex-
pression of religious belief and an act of
speech that is protected by the First Amend-
ment to the Constitution of the United
States;
Whereas the National Day of Prayer—
(1) is consistent with the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States;
(2) belongs to all people in the United
States; and
(3) ‘‘is very much in keeping with the plu-
ralistic spirit of the Establishment Clause of
the First Amendment. No single religious
group can claim ownership or control of the
National Day of Prayer; rather, it truly be-
longs to all Americans who seek divine guid-
ance for themselves and for the country,’’ as
Representative Mervyn Dymally noted on
the day the vehicle that would become Pub-
lic Law 100–307 passed the House of Rep-
resentatives;
Whereas calling for prayer in times of cri-
sis and thanksgiving creates a sense of unity
in the United States, and, as President Ron-
ald Reagan noted in a radio address in 1982,
‘‘[P]rayer is one of the few things in this
world that hurts no one and sustains the
spirit of millions.’’; and
Whereas declaring a National Day of Pray-
er sets the United States apart as a country,
and, as Representative William Dannemeyer
noted on the day the vehicle that would be-
come Public Law 100–307 passed the House of
Representatives, ‘‘A Nation in prayer has
traditionally given this great Republic of
ours the efficacy required to sustain it. A
National Day of Prayer should be more than
a mere commemorative occasion, it should
be the spiritual sustenance that sets Amer-
ica apart from the rest of the world, the dif-
ference between freedom under God or slav-
ery under the rule of men.’’: Now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes the 30th anniversary of the
National Day of Prayer established under
the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to provide for set-
ting aside the first Thursday in May as the
date on which the National Day of Prayer is
celebrated’’, approved May 5, 1988 (Public
Law 100–307; 102 Stat. 456), which was signed
by President Ronald Reagan on May 5, 1988,
and later codified as section 119 of title 36,
United States Code;
(2) encourages all people in the United
States to reaffirm the importance prayer has
played in the heritage of the United States;
and
(3) expresses support for the continued rec-
ognition each year of—
(A) the National Day of Prayer; and
(B) the importance that prayer and faith
have played in the history of the United
States.

the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations:
S. RES. 746
Whereas, in late February 2014, the Russian
Federation invaded and illegally occupied
Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, in full con-
travention of the United Nations Charter
and the Helsinki Final Act, which condemn
the threat or use of force as means of alter-
ing international borders;
Whereas the Russian Federation’s at-
tempted illegal annexation of Crimea is also
a direct violation of its pledges as a signa-
tory to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on
Security Assurances to respect Ukraine’s
sovereignty and existing borders and to re-
frain from the threat or use of force against
Ukraine;
Whereas the inclusion of the United States
and the United Kingdom as signatories to
the Budapest Memorandum was essential in
order to provide Ukraine the security assur-
ances needed to give up its nuclear arsenal;
Whereas, on November 25, 2018, military
forces of the Russian Federation attacked
and seized three Ukrainian Navy vessels and
their crews as they attempted to transit the
Kerch Strait between the Black Sea and the
Sea of Azov;
Whereas the Government of the Russian
Federation still has not released the Ukrain-
ian crew members or returned the Ukrainian
ships that were seized illegally;
Whereas European Commissioner Julian
King stated that the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation launched a disinformation
campaign over a year ago designed to paint
Ukraine and NATO as provocateurs in the
Kerch Strait;
Whereas, as part of the Russian Federation
disinformation campaign, Russian state
media outlets spread demonstrable false-
hoods, including claims that Ukraine was
dredging the Kerch Strait seabed to facili-
tate the stationing of a NATO fleet, that
Ukraine had intentionally infected the sea
with cholera, and that Ukrainian and British
clandestine services were conspiring to de-
stroy the Kerch Strait bridge with a nuclear
weapon;
Whereas the United States has important
national interests in the Black Sea region,
including the security of three NATO littoral
states, the promotion of European energy
market diversification by ensuring unfet-
tered European access to energy exporters in
the Caucuses and central Asia, and combat-
ting use of the region by smugglers as a con-
duit for trafficking in persons, narcotics, and
arms;
Whereas the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a
proposed underwater natural gas pipeline
project that would provide an additional
55,000,000,000 cubic meters of pipeline capac-
ity from the Russian Federation to the Fed-
eral Republic of Germany through the Baltic
Sea;
Whereas the Russian Federation’s state-
owned oil and gas company, Gazprom, is the
sole shareholder of the Nord Stream 2
project;
Whereas, in 2017, there was spare capacity
of approximately 55,000,000,000 cubic meters
in the Ukrainian gas transit system;
Whereas Gazprom cut off natural gas ex-
ports to Europe via Ukraine in 2006, and
again in 2009, over supply and pricing dis-
putes with Ukraine’s state-owned oil and gas
company, Naftogaz;
Whereas transit of Russian natural gas to
Europe via Ukraine declined precipitously
after the completion of Nord Stream 1 in
2011, falling from 80 percent to between 40
and 50 percent of Russia’s total exports to
Europe;
Whereas, in 2017, Russian gas accounted for
37 percent of Europe’s natural gas imports,
an increase of 5 percent over 2016;
Whereas, on December 12, 2018, the Euro-
pean Parliament overwhelmingly passed a
resolution condemning both the Russian
Federation’s aggression in the Kerch Strait
and the construction of the Nord Stream 2
pipeline; and
Whereas, on December 11, 2018, the United
States House of Representatives passed a
resolution calling upon the European Union
to reject the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and urg-
ing the President to use all available means
to promote energy policies in Europe that re-
duce European reliance on Russian energy
exports: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) calls upon the President to work with
United States allies to promptly lead a ro-
bust multinational freedom of navigation op-
eration in the Black Sea to help demonstrate
support for internationally recognized bor-
ders, bilateral agreements, and safe passage
through the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov
and to push back against excessive Russian
Federation claims of sovereignty;
(2) calls upon the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to enhance allied maritime
presence and capabilities, including mari-
time domain awareness and coastal defense
in the Black Sea in order to support Free-
dom of Navigation Operations and allied in-
terests;
(3) urges the President to use the authority
provided under section 1234 of the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2018 (Public Law 115–91; 131 Stat. 1659) to en-
hance the capability of the Ukrainian mili-
tary;
(4) urges the President, through the De-
partments of State and Defense, to provide
additional security assistance to Ukraine,
especially to strengthen Ukraine’s maritime
capabilities, in order to improve deterrence
and defense against further Russian aggres-
sion;
(5) reiterates that the President is required
by statute to impose mandatory sanctions
on the Russian Federation under the Coun-
tering America’s Adversaries Through Sanc-
tions Act (Public Law 115–44);
(6) stresses that sanctions against the Rus-
sian Federation are a direct result of the ac-
tions of the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration and will continue and increase until
there is an appropriate change in Russian be-
havior;
(7) calls upon United States allies and part-
ners in Europe to deny Russian Navy vessels
access to their ports to resupply and refuel;
(8) notes the resolution passed by the
House of Representatives on December 11,
2018, calling on European governments to
cancel the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and urging
the President to support European energy se-
curity through a policy of reducing reliance
on the Russian Federation;
(9) applauds and concurs with the Euro-
pean Parliament’s December 12, 2018, resolu-
tion condemning Russian aggression in the
Kerch Strait and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,
calling for the pipeline’s cancellation due to
its threat to European energy security, and
calling on the Russian Federation to guar-
antee freedom of navigation in the Kerch
Strait; and
(10) urges the President to continue work-
ing with Congress and our allies to ensure
the appropriate policies to deter the Russian
Federation from further aggression.

ROUNDS, Mr. THUNE, Mr. BURR, Mr.
PERDUE, and Mr. ENZI) submitted the
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary:
S. RES. 747
Whereas the Bible has played a prominent
role in the culture of the United States and
has been a significant influence throughout
the history of our nation;
Whereas, in 1956, Congress passed a Joint
Resolution adopting ‘‘In God We Trust’’ as
the official motto of the United States;
Whereas, in 1982, Congress passed the Joint
Resolution entitled ‘‘Joint Resolution au-
thorizing and requesting the President to
proclaim 1983 as the ‘Year of the Bible’ ’’
(Public Law 97–280), finding that the Bible
‘‘has made a unique contribution in shaping
the United States as a distinctive and
blessed nation and people’’;
Whereas, on November 17, 2017, the Mu-
seum of the Bible opened a 430,000 square
foot nonprofit museum in Washington, D.C.,
3 blocks from the Capitol, and will be free to
all visitors;
Whereas the Museum of the Bible is a non-
sectarian institution that does not promote
any faith or denomination;
Whereas, in 2014, the architectural concept
submission for the Museum of the Bible was
approved by the Commission of Fine Arts,
the local Washington, D.C., Advisory Neigh-
borhood Commission, and the Historic Pres-
ervation Review Board, and the primary
building of the Museum of the Bible was
awarded historical status by the Historic
Preservation Review Board;
Whereas the Museum of the Bible will have
3 primary exhibit floors focused on the his-
tory, narrative, and impact of the Bible;
Whereas the entrance to the Museum of
the Bible will feature 2 40-foot-tall bronze
panels that contain the first lines of Genesis
in Latin, as originally printed in the Guten-
berg Bible, and art glass panels featuring a
papyrus containing the 19th psalm; and
Whereas the Museum of the Bible is an in-
novative, global, nonsectarian educational
institution the purpose of which is to permit
all people to engage with the Bible: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate, That Congress—
(1) recognizes the opening of the Museum
of the Bible in Washington, D.C., the first
nonsectarian museum of its kind in the cap-
ital of the United States focused exclusively
on the history, narrative, and impact of the
Bible; and
(2) commends the leadership, staff, schol-
ars, designers, construction workers, and
volunteers who worked tirelessly to realize
the goal of opening a museum, free to the
public, with the nonsectarian purpose of ‘‘in-
viting all people to engage with the Bible’’.

HONORING REV. DR. KEITH ELIJAH
THOMPSON
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 2, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor a
dear friend who has made such a remarkable
impact in our community for more than 40
years, Reverend Dr. Keith Elijah Thompson of
Bronx Miracle Gospel Tabernacle Word of
Faith Ministries.
Many have referred to Rev. Thompson as
the ‘‘Man in the Community’’ due to his four
decades of service to the northeast Bronx.
After a successful career as an entrepreneur,
he answered the call from God and entered
full-time ministry in 1980. From the inception
of the ministry, Rev. Thompson integrated a
holistic approach, giving special attention to
the Tripartite nature of human beings to estab-
lish communication beyond the confines of
church. Starting out as a simple storefront,
Bronx Miracle Gospel Tabernacle World grew
by leaps and bounds. In 1993 the Church
moved locations to accommodate the growing
congregation. Now located on Burke Avenue,
the church began to expand further into the
community through a series of outreach pro-
grams including GED and college prep
courses, in addition to Missions and radio out-
reach.
Rev. Thompson was also instrumental in
spearheading several other high-profile com-
munity initiatives and groups, including the
Clergy Coalition of the 47th Precinct and the
White Plains Road/Burke Avenue Merchant
Association. He also served as Dean of El
Shaddai Christian School, Vice President of
the 49th Precinct Clergy Council, member of
the 47th Precinct Community Council, and has
been active with Bronx Community Board 12
and the Williamsbridge and Bronx branches of
the NAACP. As Chancellor of the Bronx Re-
source Community Center, which he helped
form, Rev. Thompson oversaw a facility that
provided high school equivalency diplomas,
job training, and basic computer training to the
community.
In October 2014 Bronx Miracle Gospel Tab-
ernacle World moved once again to accommo-
date growing membership. The move has al-
lowed Rev. Thompson to further expand serv-
ices, which now include Back to School Fes-
tivals and clothing donation distribution.
Rev. Thompson has accomplished so much
for his congregants and for the entire north-
east Bronx community as a whole. This year,
Bronx Miracle Gospel Tabernacle World is
celebrating his 38th Pastoral Anniversary. On
this wonderful occasion, I want to congratulate
Rev. Thompson and thank him for the wonder-
ful work he and his ministries continue to do.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF MR.
THOMAS CHARLES BRAUN
HON. KEITH ELLISON
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 2, 2019
Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the life of my constituent and neigh-
bor, Mr. Thomas Charles Braun. A beloved
artist, activist, family man, and small business
owner, Mr. Braun passed away in October
2018. I join my neighbors in recognizing the
tremendous gifts he gave to our community.
Born in Lake City, Minnesota, Mr. Braun
was always an artistic and passionate person.
After getting his degree in theater from Law-
rence University, Mr. Braun taught theater at
Lea College, Ekerd College, and Normandale
Community College. He inspired countless
young adults through his commitment to fun
and daring productions before he left aca-
demia to run Wild Rumpus in Minneapolis in
1988.
Consistently recognized as one of the most
inventive bookstores nationwide, Wild Rumpus
is symbolic of the type of person Mr. Braun
was—open and inviting, passionate about hav-
ing fun, and always up for trying something
new and mischievous. Under his devoted
management, the store garnered national
awards, including being named Bookstore of
the Year by Publisher’s Weekly in 2017. As
described in his obituary, ‘One never really
‘‘worked for’’ Tom. Rather, you became a co-
conspirator in his sense of mischief and phi-
losophy of ‘‘why not?’’ ’
But Mr. Braun was passionate not only
about light-hearted ventures. He founded Lin-
den Hills Power & Light, an organization that
fights for climate action on the grassroots
level. They were a key constituency pushing
for citywide door-to-door compost collection,
spearheading the first pilot program with the
City of Minneapolis and Hennepin County. Mr.
Braun’s drive to model the world he wanted to
see through his own choices and actions was
a driving force for some of our most important
city-wide sustainability efforts.
Though Mr. Braun is no longer with us, the
impact he has made on our community will be
visible for years to come. I am grateful that he
gave us so much of his energy and vision,
and that he created lasting organizations that
will continue to model his commitment to
being a good person, doing right by his neigh-
bors, and fighting for a better world. I thank
Mr. Braun for all that he has given to Min-
nesota.

HONORING TARYN DUFFY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 2, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, our community
here in New York’s 16th Congressional District
is very fortunate to have Taryn Duffy, a friend
who this year is being honored by the Ancient
Order of Hibernians for all her outstanding
work. I want to take a moment to recognize
her on the occasion.
Taryn has extensive experience within the
New York State public policy arena, as well as
public relations and communications. As Vice
President of Corporate Communications &
Public Affairs for Empire City Casino at Yon-
kers Raceway, Taryn oversees public relations
and external affairs. She is also principal of
TSD Strategies, Inc., a public relations and
communications firm founded in 2014.
As a former Vice President at Mercury Pub-
lic Affairs, a national public strategy firm,
Taryn put her experience to work for clients in
a variety of industries. She has worked on
dozens of political campaigns and briefly de-
parted the political world to serve as Director
of Admissions of Mercy College’s Bronx Cam-
pus.
Recognized as an advocate for volunteer
service and civic engagement, Taryn was a
recipient of City & State Magazine’s Above
and Beyond Award, a Bronx Chamber of
Commerce Honoree for distinguished service,
and honored as a Women of Influence by the
Irish Voice.
Outside of her many professional accom-
plishments, Taryn is passionate about men-
toring young women in their careers and
served as a panelist for the Workforce Devel-
opment Institute’s ‘‘Women in Leadership: Se-
curing a Seat at the Table’’ forum hosted by
Senate Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and
then-Assembly Member Shelley Mayer. She
was also a panelist at City & State Magazine’s
‘‘On Advocacy’’ conference to assist non-profit
organizations in their advocacy efforts and has
led campaign readiness trainings for women
interested in running for political office.
Active in numerous civic and professional
organizations, Taryn serves on a variety of
boards including United Way of Westchester &
Putnam Counties, Business Council of West-
chester, ArtsWestchester, Yonkers Workforce
Development Board, the Yonkers Mayor’s
Women’s Advisory Council, Bronx Advisory
Council for Visions Services for the Blind,
Yonkers Career & Technical Education Advi-
sory Council, and Bronxville Terrace Owners
Corporation. She is also a member of The
Public Relations Society of America.
Taryn Duffy has accomplished a great deal
and has made some tremendous contributions
to the community. AOH picked a most deserv-
ing honoree. Congratulations to Taryn.
