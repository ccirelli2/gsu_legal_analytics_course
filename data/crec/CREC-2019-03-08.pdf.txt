f
REDISTRICTING REFORM
(Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I
am pleased and proud to stand here in
support of H.R. 1, but I am especially
proud that H.R. 1 contains the Redis-
tricting Reform Act, legislation that
was introduced by Representatives
LOFGREN, BROWNLEY, and myself.
This legislation would require States
to create independent redistricting
commissions to draw congressional
seats, removing politicians and par-
tisan gerrymandering from the process.
I have worked for decades on this
cause. I helped to lead in the California
Legislature on redistricting efforts,
which ultimately led to the creation of
the California independent redis-
tricting commission, which is now rec-
ognized as one of the best practices in
redistricting.
Let’s follow this example across the
country. Let’s have Members here who
represent fair and equitable districts
and who are elected to represent their
districts and not just to protect incum-
bency.

H2590 March 8, 2019
PROMOTING AMERICAN VALUES
THROUGH PEACE CORPS
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, 58 years ago this
week, President John F. Kennedy
signed an executive order establishing
the United States Peace Corps. Since
then, more than 200,000 Americans have
participated in international service
opportunities through the Peace Corps.
International service organizations
like the Peace Corps and student ex-
change programs operated by the De-
partment of State play an important
role in promoting the image of Amer-
ica around the world. These programs
provide American volunteers with a
chance to learn about their host coun-
try’s society and values, and, in turn,
volunteers share American culture and
values with the people of their host
country. This fosters a great under-
standing of and strong friendship be-
tween our country and those around
the world.
The Peace Corps was created with
the strong belief that Americans are
willing to contribute part of their life
to the country. President Kennedy said
that we must not merely aim to have
an economic advantage in life, but we
must strive for a greater purpose.
Madam Speaker, for 58 years, the
United States Peace Corps has provided
thousands of Americans with that
greater purpose.
f
EXPANDING VOTING OPPORTUNI-
TIES FOR ALL AMERICANS
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of H.R. 1 so that
more Americans can exercise their
right to vote.
On election day of last year, voters in
my district on the central coast of
California set a new record for turnout
in a midterm election.
In San Benito County, we saw one of
the highest increases in the State for
folks registering to vote.
In Monterey County, the majority of
registered voters voted by absentee
ballot and by mail. These are service-
members who filled out their ballot
from where they were stationed and
also folks at home who could take time
to thoughtfully cast their vote.
Unfortunately, on that same election
day, voters around this country didn’t
have that opportunity, and they had to
go to polling places where they faced
malfunctioning voting machines and
found their registration frozen or
purged.
These instances left thousands of
citizens without a vote and without a
voice in our democracy. That is why we
need to pass H.R. 1.
The most important persons in our
democracy are not those who hold of-
fice, but it is those educated and in-
formed voters who put us in office.
Let’s give those types of voters more
opportunity to participate in our de-
mocracy and pass H.R. 1.
f
GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY
(Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, last Congress, the Judiciary
Committee interviewed multiple DOJ
and FBI officials about their actions
regarding the 2016 elections.
People anticipate the Mueller report
soon. Will he find any so-called collu-
sion, or was the only collusion among
agency personnel who hated the Presi-
dent and started this investigation?
Our interview transcripts were perti-
nent to a congressional investigation;
but the 115th Congress ended, the in-
vestigation was closed, and copies were
shared with certain Members of Con-
gress.
Out of an abundance of caution, we
gave DOJ an opportunity to review
them for information that would en-
danger national security; but after
many months and little progress, our
patience grows thin.
The proposed redactions had nothing
to do with national security and are
anathema to our goal of government
transparency. I am, therefore, today
making one of those transcripts public.
Madam Speaker, to avoid burdening
GPO with a 200-page transcript, I in-
clude in the RECORD the link
www.dougcollins.house.gov/ohr so the
American people can review the tran-
script of Bruce Ohr.
I intend to make other transcripts
public soon. I am willing to consider
any reasonable redactions DOJ makes
in a timely manner but won’t allow
these transcripts to remain shrouded in
secrecy.
f
A VICTORY FOR AMERICAN
FAMILIES
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, we
are delivering a major victory for
American families today, a victory for
transparency, integrity, and account-
ability in our democracy.
I am proud to have helped introduce
H.R. 1, the For the People Act, be-
cause, in every corner of Illinois, I hear
from folks who are frustrated about
politics. They are frustrated with the
secret and dark money that enters pol-
itics; they are frustrated by the self-
dealing in Washington; and they are
frustrated by the culture of corruption
that rewards the powerful while the
voices of hardworking Americans are
drowned out.
Our For the People Act will bring
fundamental change to Washington.
Our bill will end the dominance of big
money in politics; it will ensure that
elections are fair; and it will make sure
Congress is working for the people in-
stead of for themselves, banning Mem-
bers from serving on corporate boards.
Our For the People Act will make it
easier to vote.
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple sent us here to clean up the mess in
Washington. Today we are delivering
on that promise.
f
HONORING VETERAN OF THE
MONTH PETER LUITWIELER
(Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor
Peter E. Luitwieler, an American hero
and a true friend to our country’s vet-
erans.
Mr. Luitwieler served in military in-
telligence during the Vietnam war, and
in January of 1968, when his compound
was surrounded by enemy troops and
the machine gunners abandoned their
posts, Mr. Luitwieler and a brave ma-
rine manned the machine guns for
hours, keeping the enemies at bay and
protecting the lives of their team. For
this act of bravery, he was awarded the
Vietnamese equivalent of the Bronze
Star.
After he retired, Mr. Luitwieler dedi-
cated his time to fellow veterans. He
now serves as a program manager for
Warrior Partnerships of Eastern Okla-
homa and the Oklahoma Veterans Con-
nections, and he is a mentor to vet-
erans going through the Tulsa Vet-
erans Treatment Court, going above
and beyond to enrich the lives of Okla-
homa’s veterans.
Mr. Luitwieler is an incredible exam-
ple of the great men and women who
have served our country every day. He
is the First District’s March 2019 Vet-
eran of the Month, and I am honored to
recognize him with this award.
f
HONORING POLICE CHIEF KRISTEN
ZIMAN ON INTERNATIONAL WOM-
EN’S DAY
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I
rise today on International Women’s
Day to honor a woman who has been a
pillar of strength in my community
during a particularly difficult time.
Last month, in Aurora, Illinois, we
had five neighbors killed in a terrible
act of gun violence. If you watched the
news following that tragedy, you saw a
woman, Chief of Police Kristen Ziman,
exuding strength, compassion, resolve,
and leadership following an event we
never imagined would happen in our
community.
Chief Ziman leads the second biggest
police department in our State of Illi-
nois—no small feat considering that

there are only 219 female chiefs in the
more than 14,000 police departments
nationwide.
Chief Ziman’s compassionate leader-
ship and barrier-breaking approach to
law enforcement inspires us all across
the Fox Valley region. We truly are
Aurora strong.
Her strength and her service to our
community makes us so proud, and I
look forward to watching all the little
girls in our community grow up know-
ing they can be anything they want to
be, from a police chief to a Congress-
woman, because they grew up seeing it
firsthand.
There are women like Chief Ziman
lifting all of our communities all over
the 14th District and all over our coun-
try, and I am so glad to celebrate them
today.
f
FLORIDA STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate a tradition
that has come to define a small town in
rural Florida.
Every winter, Plant City transforms
for the Strawberry Festival, an event
to celebrate the annual strawberry har-
vest.
When the festival was founded in
1930, it was a way for the residents of
Plant City to not only mark a new crop
of strawberries, but also was one of the
few times a year locals could eat straw-
berries, due to their short shelf life.
Today, the 11-day event attracts
guests far beyond Plant City, and the
strawberry growers in the community
now supply virtually all winter straw-
berries grown in the United States.
This success comes at the hard work of
growers in Plant City.
These entrepreneurial men and
women work tirelessly to bring us the
strawberries many of us enjoy, and I
want to take this opportunity to thank
them for all that they do for us. Straw-
berries have become the lifeblood of
Plant City, and our community
wouldn’t be what it is today without
them.
I also want to take this time to con-
gratulate Kendall Gaudens, who was
crowned this year’s Strawberry Fes-
tival Queen. Kendall joins the illus-
trious ranks of many great women be-
fore her, including Florida’s current at-
torney general, my friend Ashley
Moody.
I also want to congratulate Madilyn
Conrad, who was named first maid, and
Kennedy Cullins, Jada Brown, and
Olivia Frazier, who were selected for
the court.

CONGRATULATING THE
MCFARLAND HIGH SCHOOL
GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAM
(Mr. COX of California asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. COX of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate
the McFarland High School girls bas-
ketball team. Undefeated in regular
season Division IV play, our girls were
moved up to Division III for State. Un-
daunted, the team’s motto is ‘‘relent-
less,’’ and that is what they have been.
On Tuesday night, our girls brought
home the school’s first Southern Cali-
fornia Regional Championship. They
are a textbook example of what can be
accomplished through hard work, prac-
tice, and teamwork.
Led by coaches Johnny Samaniego
and Gino Barajas, the girls: Lucia
Barajas, Heiry Bojorquez, Neli Diaz,
Angelica Gonzalez, Emily Gonzalez,
Julie Hernandez, Adilene Lopez, Shania
Perry, Lucia Rocha, Kathy Rodriguez,
and Pilar Samaniego are now playing
Oakland High School, represented by
my friend and colleague, BARBARA LEE,
in tonight’s State Championship game.
I ask my colleagues to join me in
sending them the best of luck. We are
so proud of our girls and their families.
Go Cougars.

FUND THE POLITICIANS ACT
(Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker,
today I raise my objection to H.R. 1,
the so-called For the People Act. This
act should really be called the Fund
the Politicians Act. It is a Federal
takeover of our election system. It
opens up our precious election system
to fraud, and it violates free speech
rights.
This bill would allow for the funding
of politicians’ campaigns. They would
be given a 6-to-1 match with govern-
ment money for their campaigns. I
don’t believe Americans want their
money going to help pay for more
robocalls from politicians that they
don’t even support.
It also will give $25 to citizens to give
to a campaign of their choice. What a
terrible use of our tax dollars.
It also opens up our system to fraud
by requiring that they have to allow
for online registration, same-day reg-
istration, and it nullifies all the State
protections. No Secretary of State was
even consulted about this bill.
And finally, it violates our free
speech rights by requiring the pub-
lishing of the names and addresses of
donors to organizations who may speak
about a candidate.
This bill is terrible. Every vote
should count, and no government
money should go to line politicians’
campaigns.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2592 March 8, 2019
across the country ahead of their 18th
birthday.
To be clear, my amendment does not
lower the voting age; it simply allows
individuals to pre-register so they are
registered and ready to vote when they
turn 18.
Today, 14 States, including my home
State, the great State of Colorado, as
well as the District of Columbia, per-
mit pre-registration beginning at 16
years old. Four States permit pre-reg-
istration beginning at 17 years old, and
five other States allow for pre-registra-
tion a few months ahead of voters’ 18th
birthday.
States across the Nation are taking
up pre-registration to integrate young
people in the democratic process early,
and I think it is time for us to take up
these reforms at the Federal level.
We see young people interacting with
the government agencies most fre-
quently when they are 16 and getting
their driver’s license or learner’s per-
mit. This is common sense to allow our
young folks to register early when they
are already at the Department of
Motor Vehicles in their respective
State, where voter registration serv-
ices are typically offered, to ensure
that when they turn 18, they have no
barriers to casting their ballot on elec-
tion day.
Madam Chair, the foundation of our
democracy is built on the ability of our
citizens to vote. We must hold this
right precious and sacred, and we must
encourage, in my view, our citizens of
every age, from every background and
every locality and every local party to
engage in our political process. Pre-
registration helps us do that by invest-
ing in our next generation and by en-
couraging democratic participation
from an early age.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I claim the time in oppo-
sition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I thank my new col-
league, Mr. NEGUSE, and welcome him.
I am glad he is participating in the
process.
I am going to oppose the gentleman’s
amendment; not because of the process,
just because it adds another layer of
burden to our States and our localities.
Many States already accept pre-reg-
istration forms, and that is within
their State’s jurisdiction to do so. I
just don’t like this top-down approach
which this now upwards of 700-page
mammoth bill called H.R. 1 is putting
on to our States and our local election
officials.
Our county offices, our local offi-
cials, they are bleeding from unfunded
mandates from State and Federal Gov-
ernments, and this is one more of
those.
I agree, we ought to get more 16- and
17-year-olds interested in government.
I have got twin boys who are 18; I try
and get them interested. Sometimes
they are not even interested in me and
what we do.
But the key is we, as Members of
Congress, ought to go take our message
to the high schools. And I just recently
was in Boston with a bipartisan group
in and around our colleague, JOE KEN-
NEDY’s district.
JOE, MARKWAYNE MULLIN, and LISA
BLUNT ROCHESTER and I, we visited nu-
merous high schools. And I hope all
four of us standing there in a bipar-
tisan way actually inspired some
young people in the Boston area to get
engaged.
My colleague, JIMMY PANETTA and I
visited schools in my district last fall
to do the exact same thing, to show
people that we can work together in a
bipartisan way.
Unfortunately, this process in H.R. 1
has been nothing but partisan; and that
is not the message that we need to send
to 16- and 17-year-olds.
I have put my hand out with an olive
branch. I have accepted many Demo-
cratic amendments throughout the last
few days, and not one single amend-
ment, either in the markup of the only
committee that marked this bill up,
House Administration, where we of-
fered 28, not one Republican amend-
ment to this bill that is now 700 pages
has been accepted. Every amendment
has been a Democrat-led amendment.
I thought the new Democratic major-
ity was going to be bipartisan. I
thought the new Democratic majority
was going to be transparent. I thought
the new Democratic majority was
going to not work with special inter-
ests to write mammoth 700-page bills.
But I guess, Madam Chair, I was mis-
taken.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I thank
my colleague from the other side of the
aisle for his thoughtful comments. I
would say that I think this amendment
is a bipartisan amendment in the sense
that it will apply equally to every 16-
and 17-year-old across the country, ir-
respective of their political affiliation.
In Colorado actually, in some months
we have had more Republican 16- and
17-year-olds pre-register than Demo-
crat 16- and 17-year-olds. So really
what this is all about is just ensuring
that young folks in our country are
able to integrate into the political
process and engage in their civic duties
at an earlier age.
From my perspective—I appreciate
the gentleman’s comments with re-
spect to visiting high schools. I cer-
tainly do that quite a bit in my dis-
trict, to meet with young folks, to talk
to them about how to become better
citizens and engaged in their commu-
nity. And often the question I get is,
How? And I think this is a great an-
swer.
The ability to say to them that if
they go, when they get their driver’s li-
cense, and pre-register to vote so that,
ultimately, when they turn 18 they are
automatically registered and ready to
participate in our elections; I think
that, at the end of the day, it will do a
great service to our country and get
more young people involved in our po-
litical process.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN), a distinguished colleague and
the chair of our Immigration Sub-
committee and, of course, the chair of
the House Administration Committee.
Ms. LOFGREN.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I just
want to express my thanks to the gen-
tleman from Colorado for offering this
refining amendment. I think he is ex-
actly right. In order to fully engage the
American people, we need to make
every effort for them to participate.
And for young people who feel that
they really don’t have a say, allowing
them to pre-register helps them buy in
to our American system of govern-
ment.
You know, somebody on the other
side of the building said, well, this is a
power grab, to make sure that—H.R. 1
is a power grab. It is. It is a power grab
for the American people, to take the
power away from the special interests
and give it to the American people. The
gentleman’s amendment helps further
that worthy goal, and I thank him for
offering it.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I thank my colleague,
Mr. NEGUSE, again. I admire his tenac-
ity, and admire his willingness to come
down and legislate. I stand ready to
come to his district and talk to high
schoolers with him, and I would hope
he would reciprocate, come to mine. If
the gentleman will have his team call
mine, we will figure out a way to work
something out. I think that is the best
way for us to send a message to high
schoolers to get them engaged, get
them involved.
This is just an administrative burden
that is going to affect our State and
local officials. To process—I mean,
there are provisions in this 700-page
mammoth bill that don’t allow our
local election officials to clean voters
off the rolls that they know no longer
may live in their jurisdiction. So we
are hindering local officials’ ability to
clean up their rolls; and then decide,
you know, later on, that we are going
to be ahead and pre-register people
that we don’t know, may or may not
want to vote in their college town of
residence.
So it just is a burden that I think is
unnecessary. Although, again, I respect
the gentleman’s willingness to come
down here and debate; this is an issue
that goes further than Mr. NEGUSE’s
amendment.
I am going to oppose the amendment.
I urge folks to vote ‘‘no’’ on it. But
more importantly, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill that is
going to eventually cost taxpayers bil-
lions of dollars and add billions upon
billions to the campaign coffers of
Members of Congress. That is not what
the taxpayers in my district are asking

for. It is not what the taxpayers of
America are asking for. It is only what
the Democratic majority is asking for.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I cer-
tainly will take my colleague up on his
invitation, and look forward to visiting
his district and having him come to
Boulder and Fort Collins, where I know
there are plenty of 16- and 17-year-olds
who are very eager to be able to advo-
cate for other young folks to be able to
pre-register in other States, as they
have been able to in Colorado, thanks
to the incredible election reforms that
we have enacted in our State.
I understand that we have a respect-
ful disagreement with respect to the
merits of the underlying bill, but I
would hope that, on this particular
amendment that is not particularly
controversial and that, as I said, is
really a nonpartisan approach to just
getting young folks of all political af-
filiations involved in our political
process.
I would hope and trust that col-
leagues in both parties here in this
Chamber would think about this
amendment thoughtfully, and I would
certainly urge them to support it.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, we know this bill is not
going to be signed into law. I look for-
ward to working with the gentleman
on other amendments that we might be
able to come up with some good plans
to engage our 16- and 17-year-olds, en-
gage the next generation of leaders.
I hope maybe a visit that we can do
together could inspire somebody to do
what we do one day, and that would be
that we would manage to call ourselves
successful in legislating to inspire the
next generation.
This bill, H.R. 1, is not going to in-
spire the next generation. I appreciate
Mr. NEGUSE; I appreciate his willing-
ness to serve.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Colorado will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 71 OFFERED BY MRS.
KIRKPATRICK
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 71 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 365, strike lines 15 through 24 and in-
sert the following:
‘‘(6) SAFE HARBOR FOR PLATFORMS MAKING
BEST EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY REQUESTS WHICH
ARE SUBJECT TO RECORD MAINTENANCE RE-
QUIREMENTS.—
‘‘(A) AVAILABILITY OF SAFE HARBOR.—In ac-
cordance with rules established by the Com-
mission, if an online platform shows that the
platform used best efforts to determine
whether or not a request to purchase a quali-
fied political advertisement was subject to
the requirements of this subsection, the on-
line platform shall not be considered to be in
violation of such requirements.
‘‘(B) SPECIAL RULES FOR DISBURSEMENT PAID
WITH CREDIT CARD.—For purposes of subpara-
graph (A), an online platform shall be consid-
ered to have used best efforts in the case of
a purchase of a qualified political advertise-
ment which is made with a credit card if—
‘‘(i) the individual or entity making such
purchase is required, at the time of making
such purchase, to disclose the credit
verification value of such credit card; and
‘‘(ii) the billing address associated with
such credit card is located in the United
States or, in the case of a purchase made by
an individual who is a United States citizen
living outside of the United States, the indi-
vidual provides the online platform with the
United States mailing address the individual
uses for voter registration purposes.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentlewoman
from Arizona (Mrs. KIRKPATRICK) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Arizona.
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Chair, I
strongly support H.R. 1, and I commend
Congressman JOHN SARBANES for his
persistent work on this legislation. We
have an opportunity here to reduce the
role of dark money in politics and
make it easier for Americans to par-
ticipate in our democracy.
This is not a partisan issue. This is
an American democracy issue, and H.R.
1 is the best solution to cleaning up
corruption in Washington.
I am proud of my colleagues for
working on this historic and necessary
package.
b 0930
You see, Madam Chair, I ran as a
publicly funded candidate in Arizona
under our public financing law called
Clean Elections when I first ran for the
legislature. This meant I had to go out
and get a certain number of $5 con-
tributions from constituents in my dis-
trict, which I then turned in to get my
public financing.
It was the same for everyone who was
running as a Clean Election candidate,
regardless of party. It equalized every-
thing.
One of my favorite stories is that I
was walking from my law office down
to the post office to check my mail,
and this cowboy pulled up in his pickup
truck at a stoplight and rolled down
the window, and he said, ‘‘Hey, ANN.
You don’t know me, but I gave you $5.’’
So he felt empowered in my election.
I walked over, and we had a conversa-
tion in the middle of the street.
That is the way it should be. This
puts power in the pocket of the people,
not special interests, and that is the
way it should be.
It is the For the People Act, and that
empowers people, and that makes our
democracy work.
I offer my amendment because it cre-
ates transparency in the process. This
amendment was actually suggested by
a Republican colleague. It requires the
disclosure of credit card verification
value and billing address information
for purchases of online advertising. The
credit card verification value is an
antifraud security technology designed
to protect us and to reduce fraudulent
activity.
We know that there are bad actors
and foreign nationals out there that
have an interest in influencing our
American elections through online ad-
vertising. Haven’t we seen that very,
very well in the last couple of years.
We have loopholes that allow them to
do so, but we can fix that. Not only can
we fix it, we must fix it.
This amendment is a commonsense
solution to help protect the integrity
of our elections and prevent bad play-
ers from compromising our outcomes.
This amendment is focused on pro-
tecting our democracy through trans-
parency in the digital age.
Madam Chair, I urge you and all my
colleagues to support my amendment
and the entire H.R. 1 package to clean
up Washington and put the American
people first.
Remember that cowboy who stopped
me in the middle of the road who felt
like he was empowered in his election
and in his selection of his representa-
tive. That is the way it should be.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I claim the time in oppo-
sition to the amendment, even though
I am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I welcome back my col-
league, Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. It is great to
have her back in this institution.
The gentlewoman’s amendment is an
amendment that I support. However,
the underlying bill, H.R. 1, is the fur-
thest thing that can be considered ‘‘for
the people.’’ This bill is nothing but a
bill that is for loading billions upon
billions of dollars into the coffers of
Members of Congress.
I don’t think anybody in my district
who stops me in the street is saying,
‘‘Hey, we want you to take taxpayer
dollars away from investing in infra-
structure, take taxpayer dollars away
from investing in pediatric cancer re-
search, and you know what, load up
your campaign coffers with that so you
can go enrich some political operatives
and maybe buy some more TV commer-
cials and radio ads, send some more
mail pieces that get thrown away im-
mediately when they come into your
house.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2594 March 8, 2019
This has to be one of the worst exam-
ples of self-preservation that I have
ever witnessed in my 22 years working
for the U.S. House of Representatives
and serving in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives.
I can’t think of one person in my dis-
trict who has come up and said, ‘‘I
want you to take tax dollars away
from building bridges and roads, find-
ing cures for deadly diseases, and put it
in your campaign fund.’’
That is why this bill is terrible.
This bill has not been open; it has not
been a bipartisan process; it has not
been regular order, all the things that
the Democratic majority promised us
that they would do when they took
over.
This bill was introduced on January
3. I certainly hope every Democratic
Member actually read the bill before
they signed on as a cosponsor, but I
think they are reading it now. And
there are a lot of problems, which is
why we have so many amendments.
Let me go through some of the proc-
ess. We requested a CBO score—it was
delivered last Friday; it was updated
yesterday—which actually agrees with
me that taxpayer dollars are going to
be taken away from other priorities
that we can spend here in Congress,
like roads and bridges, cancer research,
Alzheimer’s research, and others, and
go toward Members of Congress’ cam-
paigns.
Hours before the only committee
markup that we saw with the majority,
an amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute with new text, including a mag-
ical, new freedom from influence fund
that would supposedly support the en-
richment of Members of Congress’ cam-
paigns, it had no details on how that
fund would be filled.
We went through the markup. Only
one committee, the smallest com-
mittee in Congress, House Administra-
tion, it was the only committee that
marked this up. That is not regular
order. Forty percent of the bill has
never gone through regular order.
Yet we see now 72 amendments over
the last few days. Twenty-eight of
them that we offered to try to make
the bill better in committee were all
turned down on a partisan roll call.
Then we went to Rules. I actually
had a good time in Rules. I have to
thank my colleague, Chairperson LOF-
GREN, for that debate during the Rules
Committee.
We again received new text of the bill
10 minutes before I walked in, 10 min-
utes before, including 51 new pages.
Where was this in the markup process?
After the Rules hearing and before
consideration on the floor, we learned
through leaks to the press that the new
freedom from influence fund would be
filled with some magical surcharges of
corporate fines, but we had no details.
I had no idea that the Democrats’ so-
lution to campaign finance reform and
their goal to take corporate money out
of politics was to use corporate money
to now fund our campaigns, which we
now legally cannot accept.
That is the height of hypocrisy. No
one is asking for more corporate dol-
lars to line the campaign coffers of
Members of Congress.
This bill and the process are just a
sham. Look, a joint committee report
with revenue stream projections for
this new magical freedom from influ-
ence fund was not shown to us. It was
just submitted for the RECORD. We
found it. We saw it.
The new CBO report clearly says this
fund will be out of money in just a few
years after it becomes activated, be-
cause the costs are going to exponen-
tially rise, and clearly, taxpayer dol-
lars will have to bail it out.
The corporate fund, even the CBO
and The Washington Post realize that
that corporate tax fund, the tax rate of
corporate dollars now being funneled
into our campaigns that we can’t take
right now, those corporate dollars and
fines will take away from being able to
be spent on the priorities of my con-
stituents who stop me in the streets.
They say, ‘‘We want to build new
bridges. We want new roadways. We
want to make sure that this bill goes
down, because it is a travesty on the
American people and the American
taxpayer.’’
Madam Chair, vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Chair,
while I have the utmost respect and ad-
miration for my colleague across the
aisle—in fact, he is one of my favorite
Members of Congress—I strongly dis-
agree with his characterization of H.R.
1.
No one knows more than I about dark
money, secret money being spent in
elections. I have had tens of millions of
dollars spent to defeat me, yet I prevail
because I have the power of the people.
That is what this bill does. It empow-
ers people just like that cowboy who
stopped me with his pickup and con-
tributed $5 to my legislative election.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this election. There is noth-
ing more important than elections in
our democracy and empowering the
people to participate, nothing. That is
the cornerstone of our democracy.
Madam Chair, I yield the balance of
my time to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LOFGREN), my esteemed
colleague.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I con-
gratulate the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. KIRKPATRICK) on this very
smart amendment. I am not surprised.
It is typical that she would make this
a bipartisan amendment. It is very
helpful. It is very smart. I am glad that
she is back here in Congress to show
this leadership.
Just one word on the CBO: It shows
that there is indeed no tax money in-
volved in the freedom from influence
fund.
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. KIRK-
PATRICK).
The amendment was agreed to.

The text of the amendment is as fol-

‘‘(c) PROHIBITING CERTAIN CANDIDATES
FROM QUALIFYING AS PARTICIPATING CAN-

House Resolution 172, the gentleman

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maine.
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Chair, before I
talk about my amendment, I would
first like to thank Congressman SAR-
BANES for his work on this bill.
H.R. 1 is a comprehensive, good gov-
ernment bill that goes a long way in
wresting power away from elites who
abuse our political system for narrow
self-interests. This legislation would
return power where it belongs: in the
hands of working people.
As long as corporations and mega-do-
nors finance campaigns, well-connected
insiders will continue to call the shots.
Mainers have seen firsthand what can
happen when the power is returned to
the people. In 1996, our State’s voters
passed a referendum establishing the
Maine Clean Elections Act.
By collecting small donations from
people in their communities, Maine
candidates refuse the donations of lob-
byists and the well-heeled, and con-
centrate instead on face-to-face con-
versations with their neighbors. This
empowers a community to choose a
representative in a battle of ideas in-
stead of a battle of bank accounts.
Maine’s clean election reforms have
been supported and used by candidates
of all parties in my State. Republican,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2595
March 8, 2019
Democratic, Green Party, and inde-
pendent candidates have used our clean
election system.
In fact, in 2018, a Republican can-
didate for Governor used the system
because he understood that it was
going to free him up to spend his time
going door to door and talking to the
very people who he wanted to represent
as Governor of the State of Maine.
Today, we have the opportunity to
follow Maine’s lead and bring needed
reform to the rest of the country.
H.R. 1 allows candidates to refuse do-
nations from mega-donors by imple-
menting a matching system for small-
dollar donations from everyday people.
As we have seen in Maine, candidates
who use this system are good stewards
of the funds they receive. But as with
any system, there is potential for bad
actors, and it is important that they be
held accountable.
My amendment to H.R. 1 ensures
that any bad actors are cut off from
the matching system and sets high
standards for participation. The legis-
lation bars a candidate from using
matching funds if the FEC assesses
three or more civil penalties against a
candidate for violating election laws.
More importantly, if a candidate
willfully, knowingly violates the law,
my amendment permanently bars them
from the program.
Finally, my provision reaffirms that
egregious violations of campaign fi-
nance laws should result in imprison-
ment of up to 1 to 5 years.
With H.R. 1 and my amendment, we
are creating an accountable election
system.
The funds for the matching program,
as was just discussed, come from bad
corporate actors. These are fines, pen-
alties, and settlements from corporate
malfeasance, tax crimes, and other
breaches of the public trust. That
money can be used to ensure that ev-
eryday people who don’t have a net-
work of deep money around them, just
everyday, working people, will be given
the opportunity to compete in a cam-
paign, to go out and represent their
people, to go out and spend their time
talking to them face-to-face instead of
spending their time dialing for dollars
and talking to just the very wealthy.
It is time that the people take the
power back. By passing my amendment
and H.R. 1, we will take that first step.
Americans aren’t going to let our de-
mocracy be taken out from under us
any longer.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment and
‘‘yes’’ on final passage.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I claim the time in oppo-
sition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I don’t have the best
Nickelback lyrics to introduce my next
speaker, but I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCARTHY), our Republican leader.
b 0945
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I
thank the ranking member for his
work and his love of music.
This new Democrat socialist major-
ity wants the Federal Government to
interfere in our free and fair elections.
This bill today, the majority’s most
important bill, is a massive Federal
Government takeover that would un-
dermine the integrity of our elections.
But before I explain why, I want to
highlight how the majority has gone to
great steps to actually hide their prize
legislation from the American people.
Madam Speaker, the American public
need to understand, when you become
the majority, you reserve 1 through 10
of the numbering of bills, and you want
to make your number one bill the most
important thing you do for America
today.
Two years ago we were in the major-
ity, Madam Chair, and we made the
most important bill to make sure the
people’s money went back to them. We
wanted to cut your taxes.
The most important bill that the
Democrat socialist majority has is to
take more of your money and give it to
the politicians who want to vote for
this bill. How ironic.
Now, because H.R. 1 has had such a
broad spectrum of where to go, it was
referred to 10 committees. Imagine
that, 10 committees.
But 40 percent of this bill has not
even been marked up because, what did
they do? They only went to one com-
mittee.
What committee did they go to?
They went to the very special com-
mittee, House Administration.
This House Administration, the
Members who sit on House Administra-
tion, I am sure they are probably se-
lected from the conference committee
that goes forward to select individuals
for it.
Oh, no, no, no. That is not the com-
mittee we went to. House Administra-
tion is selected just by two people: the
Speaker and the leader. The Speaker
and the leader.
And do you know what? It is one of
the smallest committees we have. Be-
cause if H.R. 1 is so important to the
American public, I am sure we would
want everybody to see it. But, no, it is
just nine people of this House.
And in their jurisdiction, they didn’t
get to mark up the whole bill. They
only had about 60 percent of the bill to
mark up.
But I want to thank our Republican
colleagues on this committee: first of
all, Ranking Member RODNEY DAVIS,
MARK WALKER, and BARRY
LOUDERMILK. They were very thought-
ful.
They realized, even though the chair
of the House Administration, when
asked during the markup, would the
other committees mark up this bill,
she promised—she promised—that the
other nine committees would see it,
that the other nine committees could
mark up that other 40 percent that
House Administration didn’t get to
mark up.
But lo and behold, that is not true.
Just as this new Democrat socialist
majority said there will be 72 hours be-
fore things come to the floor, no. Yes-
terday we learned that can mean an
hour; those other 71 don’t matter.
But what the Republicans on the
other side of the aisle did, they wanted
there to be a thoughtful approach on
the issue. They provided 28 amend-
ments to improve H.R. 1.
Do you know how many the Demo-
crats on the other side that the Speak-
er selected, those six Members—they
didn’t vote for one of them. They could
not find a way that, of those 28 amend-
ments, one of them could be accepted.
I guess the Speaker selected the right
people for the House Administration.
Now, they call this bill the For the
People Act, but I want to explain why
I actually think it is for the politi-
cians, because everyone who votes for
this bill today, they are all going to go
home a little more excited. Do you
know why? They just got the taxpayers
to actually fund their elections, and
they picked it in a manner where you
don’t even know, and the multiplying
effect of the 6 to 1, who provided it.
So let’s talk about ‘‘For the Politi-
cians Act.’’
First, H.R. 1 wants to give American
taxpayer dollars to political candidates
and campaigns, regardless of whether
you support it. We are not talking just
Republicans or Democrats running.
Any view they want with any impres-
sion they want to say.
We just had a bill on the floor yester-
day about hate. I imagine there are
going to be quite a few people who run
for office who get taxpayers’ money
who talk a lot of hate. I don’t think
America wants their money spent on
that.
This bill will give candidates a gov-
ernment match of 6 to 1, not a dollar
for dollar. No, no, no, no. The ‘‘For the
Politicians Act’’ multiplies it. So, if a
citizen gives $200, the government gives
$1,200.
That is why the new Democrat so-
cialist party is so excited by this bill.
That is why they made it their number
one priority. Hard-earned taxpayer
money should go toward building
roads, bridges, or giving a boost to
struggling Americans, not just to polit-
ical campaigns.
I am not sure about these other dis-
tricts, but when I campaigned, no one
came to me and said: ‘‘Let’s make sure
you take more of my taxpayer money
to give to you to run.’’ I can’t remem-
ber one time anybody on any side of
the aisle asked for that.
Worse, this bill would allow political
candidates to profit off actually run-
ning for office on the American tax-
payers’ dime. The bill expands the use
of taxpayer funds to include the
childcare, the rent, the mortgage, or
even professional development.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2596 March 8, 2019
We have now just created a new in-
dustry. Think of the individual who
just wants to run for office, who wants
to spew hate, and says: ‘‘The taxpayers
are going to pay for it. I am just going
to keep doing it.’’
Second, H.R. 1 legalizes the vote for
convicted felons, even if that person
was convicted of election fraud. Can
you imagine that? We are going to vote
on a bill today that provides more tax-
payer money to politicians, that is
going to allow felons to vote, because
we don’t care what States say. But
even if you are convicted of election
fraud, come on down; we have got
something special for you.
And this wasn’t created by one new
member of this Democrat socialist
party. It is the most important bill
that they selected. It is H.R. 1. No
other bill matters to them but this. It
just doesn’t make sense to me.
Third, H.R. 1 would weaken the secu-
rity of our elections and make it hard-
er to protect against voter fraud. It
automatically registers voters from
the DMV.
Voting is a right. It is not a mandate.
This legislation would also prevent
officials from ever removing ineligible
voters from the rolls or even verifying
the accuracy of voter information.
To that point, H.R. 1 exposes our
election system to widespread fraud.
Take ballot harvesting, for example.
We have one less Member in this body
because of the harvesting of ballots, a
practice where a third-party activist
can collect your absentee ballot from
other voters and turn them in for you,
or potentially not even turn them in at
all.
Can you imagine putting the trust of
your vote in the hand of a stranger? If
that doesn’t scare you, it should.
Sadly, this practice was weaponized
in California and North Carolina not so
long ago, but now we want to make it
everywhere.
You know, The Washington Post
highlighted the peril of this practice.
Let me read you the headline: ‘‘Don’t
Be Shocked by the North Carolina
Fraud Allegations. Absentee Ballots
Are Much Less Secure Than Polling
Places.’’
Absentee ballots are less secure than
polling places.
The piece goes on to say: ‘‘No one
oversees voters filling out absentee
ballots to ensure that they fill out the
ballot and return it without tampering.
‘‘Campaigns and parties have taken
advantage of this by turning to cam-
paign and party workers to deliver and
return absentee ballot materials for
voters—on the honor system.’’
And, finally, this bill wants to stack
the deck in favor of the party in power
at the Federal Election Commission.
We talk a lot about bipartisanship.
We have talked a lot about it in dif-
ferent ways. The committee that could
only mark up 60 percent of this bill,
you might say it is bipartisan. But it is
not level. It is six to three. That is why
not one of the 28 amendments got
adopted.
But the Federal Election Commission
is an even six Commissioners, a panel
of three on one side and three on the
other.
So what does this bill do that the
new Democrat socialist majority cares
most about? Let’s stack the deck. Let’s
stack the deck a little further. Let’s
not make it three and three. Let’s put
the party in power to get that one
more, to put the thumb on the scale a
little further. So they want to make it
a five-member panel.
This week, The New York Times
wrote:
Republicans, arguably, have spent more
time trying to define this bill than Democrat
socialists have spent trying to promote it.
I wonder why. If it is your most im-
portant bill, the bill that is going to
define your Congress, let’s look at
what it is. They want to take more
taxpayer money. They want to give
you less freedom.
Those who vote for it today, I guess
they walk away with a raise in their
campaign. They are asking the tax-
payer to give them 6 to 1. Pretty good
return, I would say. But it doesn’t even
matter if the taxpayer supports you or
not because you are just going to make
government larger and take the money
away.
It is going to let people who are con-
victed felons open the door. Come on
and vote, even if you are convicted of
election fraud.
It is kind of interesting to me that
you would make it your number one
priority. It is kind of interesting to me,
a structure of Congress, if you referred
to a committee, that you wouldn’t
have it all marked up. It is kind of in-
teresting to me the only committee
you would pick to mark it up is the one
chosen by the Speaker. It is interesting
to me that this is where you spend
your time.
We can do better, and I hope today
we have a big voice to say taxpayers
should not pay for our elections, that
politicians should not vote to take
more of taxpayers’ hard-earned money
so they could say things that people
disagree with.
The Acting CHAIR. All Members are
reminded to address their remarks to
the Chair.
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Chair, I think
I am going to go home this weekend to
my district feeling comfortable that I
understand what my constituents
want.
As I said earlier, in 1996, Maine vot-
ers actually voted for a public funding
program in the State of Maine. They
liked the program so much that they
actually upped the ante in 2015 through
another voter referendum where Maine
voters actually voted that they wanted
to continue this program and they
wanted to increase the funding to keep
regular people competitive against the
dark money that was flown into elec-
tions in the State of Maine.
In the State of Maine, we actually
allow convicted felons to vote. They do
it from prison. Because while we be-
lieve in holding people accountable for
their crimes, we don’t feel the need, in
Maine, to take their voice away from
them.
So I am going to go home knowing
that I understand my district.
I also just want to take a moment—
you know, some of the comments from
the Republican leader, whom I respect
very much, but you want to talk about
spewing hate. H.R. 1 is a piece of legis-
lation that Democrats have put for-
ward to show that one of their top pri-
orities is to protect our democracy,
and I know a little something about it.
I fought in two wars for this country,
in Afghanistan and Iraq, and I reject
this socialist rhetoric. I am an Amer-
ican. Democrats are Americans. Repub-
licans are Americans. We need to put
this hateful speech behind us and talk
about how we can work together.
I understand that there is some frus-
tration being expressed by other side
about amendments and whether or not
Republicans are involved in this proc-
ess. Look, I will wrap it up, but let me
just say: I have voted for a number of
Republican amendments in the last
couple of weeks, so I would encourage
them to support this amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I thank Mr. GOLDEN for
his service to our country. Our country
thanks the gentleman, and everyone in
this institution thanks him for that
service.
This bill, however, is a very bad idea.
Public funding of elections is a very
bad idea.
At the last second before we vote on
H.R. 1, Democrats have decided they
are afraid of the CBO score for their
massively expensive bill. We haven’t
even debated it and want to hide it
from consideration in this Chamber.
So they created this gimmick called
the freedom from influence fund, which
is proposed to add an additional 2.75
percent penalty against law-breaking
or malfeasant corporations and offi-
cials at corporations. They claimed it
would generate enough funds to pay
the massive cost of funding political
campaigns for Members of Congress.
Late last night, we got that CBO re-
port, and the score for H.R. 1 that
projects the impact of this new shell
game called the freedom from influence
fund and its proposed funding source,
corporate fines—again, voting for this
bill will allow corporate money to, for
the first time, lawfully flow into the
campaigns of each and every one of us
in this institution.
b 1000
The CBO score tells a very different
story from what Democrats want you
to believe. According to the CBO, this
new fund will result in a reduction of
income and payroll taxes, meaning cor-
porations will have less money to
spend on their payrolls, which equates
to less jobs.
To quote the CBO report:
VerDate Sep 11 2014 00:12 Mar 09, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K08MR7.015 H08MRPT1

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2597
March 8, 2019
The assessment on civil monetary pen-
alties and settlements would reduce the base
for income and payroll taxes. Consequently,
the revenues from the assessments will be
partially offset by lower income and payroll
taxes.
Put another way, H.R. 1 takes Amer-
ican jobs away in order to fund the
campaign coffers of Members of Con-
gress.
Furthermore, the CBO notes that, as
a result of this funding source, less
money will be available for other gov-
ernment programs that we want to
prioritize in this institution.
I quote again from the CBO report:
CBO and JCT expect the increased assess-
ment of criminal and civil penalties would
reduce the amount of penalties and settle-
ments collected under current law.
The CBO report confirms what Re-
publicans have been saying all along:
H.R. 1 is a shell game that will, in the
end, hurt taxpayers because this pro-
posal to publicly fund campaigns will
be funded by the taxpayers.
However, you are going to likely hear
Democrats say, instead, that this fund
will run at a surplus over the first few
years of its existence, which is true be-
cause they designed the bill to not
make any expenditures for the first 6
years of this program.
But pay very close attention. What
the Democrats won’t tell you is that,
once the fund starts making its ex-
penditures, the fund will be nearly
broke in 5 years, and that is assuming
that the cost of running campaigns will
stay static today and not exponentially
increase like it has.
Again, this Democratic funding gim-
mick was concocted just to result in a
more desirable CBO score. I don’t see
that as a result.
The new fund will collect money for
6 years with no expenditures, resulting
in the accumulation of a large balance.
Then, once the money starts flowing to
every Member of Congress in this insti-
tution, it is going to run out in 5 years.
Democrats should be ashamed for
making this bill H.R. 1.
When Republicans took over this in-
stitution, after 50 years in the minor-
ity, our H.R. 1 was the Congressional
Accountability Act, to make Congress
work better.
H.R. 1 in the last Congress, put more
money in the pockets of middle-class
taxpayers, families back home.
This H.R. 1 will do nothing but put
taxpayer dollars in the campaign funds
of every Member of Congress, and that
is not acceptable to me, and that is
why we should have a ‘‘no’’ vote on
H.R. 1.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN).

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to the
rule, it is now in order to consider a
final period of general debate which
shall not exceed 10 minutes equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and
the ranking minority member of the
Committee on House Administration.
The gentlewoman from California
(Ms. LOFGREN) and the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) each will
control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, for 8 years, this Cham-
ber has been silent, a silence that
harms people. We have allowed meas-
ures to reduce people’s access to vote,
measures that caused the Fourth Cir-
cuit to find that African American vot-
ers were targeted with surgical preci-
sion, measures that excluded voters on
Indian reservations and that wrong-
fully tried to remove 95,000 naturalized
Texans from the rolls.
Today that silence ends. This bill is
not for its own sake. A Member of the
U.S. Senate said that H.R. 1 is a power
grab. He is right. It grabs power away
from the special interests, the elites,
and the 1 percent and gives it to the
American people.
I tell you plainly what it does: auto-
matic voter registration to allow 50
million eligible citizens to vote, pro-
hibits deceptive practices, increases ac-
cess to polls for voters with disabil-
ities, helps States replace outdated
voting machines, and requires disclo-
sure of dark money donors, not lim-
iting their speech but simply asking
them to stand by it. These reforms
aren’t difficult, but they will require
courage to make.
Mr. Frederick Douglass saw what our
democracy was and what our democ-
racy could be and said: ‘‘Where all is
plain there is nothing to be argued.’’
For that reason, I do not argue. But
I look forward to joining and doing the
will of the people and supporting this
bill.
I reserve the balance of my time,
Madam Chair.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. HAALAND).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2599
March 8, 2019
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, before I get started, I
ask for a point of personal privilege to
have the Members of this institution
and the gallery recognize the Chair as
the first Native American woman to
ever chair the House proceedings.
The Acting CHAIR. The Chair thanks
the gentleman from Illinois.
The gentleman from Illinois is recog-
nized.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, as my home State Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan once said: The
most terrifying words in the English
language are: ‘‘I’m from the govern-
ment and I’m here to help.’’
I am for the American voter. I sup-
port every eligible voter having easier
ways to register to vote and easier ac-
cess to the polls. What I am not for is
Washington, D.C. taking over our elec-
tions.
I have said it before: I agree with my
colleagues across the aisle that there is
a role for the Federal Government to
play in election infrastructure, cam-
paign finance disclosure, ballot access,
transparency, and, most importantly,
election security. However, H.R. 1, mis-
uses taxpayer dollars, takes power
away from the States to administer
their own elections, and threatens to
limit Americans’ constitutional rights.
I cannot support this legislation.
This bill, a 700-page mammoth bill,
takes power away from States given to
them by the U.S. Constitution to des-
ignate the time, place, and the manner
of their elections. I know the author of
this legislation said yesterday that
H.R. 1 is simply implementing the best
practices of States, but that is federal-
izing our election system, no matter
how nicely you phrase it.
Congress should partner with the
States who understand the unique
needs of their own residents and pro-
vide support to increase voter registra-
tion and improve election security in-
stead of federally mandating, what this
bill does, which is a one-size-fits-all ap-
proach.
There is a limited role for the Fed-
eral Government to play in elections
when patterns of discrimination have
occurred, and when we will continue to
address those patterns, we can do it in
a bipartisan way through the Voting
Rights Act.
I cannot stress enough that Congress
should absolutely be in favor of in-
creasing access to the polls, but we
cannot do that without adding the nec-
essary checks and balances to ensure
that these accesses are protected.
We should allow States to maintain
their own voter rolls to help them
process voters in a timely manner,
avoid unfunded mandates, and manage
voter lists to avoid registration and
voting irregularities. A few voting
irregularities can change the outcome
of a single election.
Just look at what happened recently
in North Carolina. A political operative
working for a Republican candidate il-
legally harvested ballots which led to
the North Carolina State Board of
Elections calling for a new special elec-
tion. Ballot harvesting is the practice
when a political operative or volunteer
can come to your home, pick up your
ballot, and deliver it to the polling pre-
cinct. This process, while illegal in
most States like North Carolina, is a
perfectly legal practice in places like
California.
Republicans, both at the House Ad-
ministration Committee markup and
at Rules Committee, offered amend-
ments to prohibit ballot harvesting,
and both attempts were rejected by
Democrats. We can no longer be naive
to think that this is a practice that
will simply help your elderly neighbor
who can no longer get to the polls. Just
ask my former colleagues from Cali-
fornia. Ballot harvesting is an un-
guarded instrument that is occurring
on a large scale as a practice used by
political operatives to manipulate the
outcome of elections.
If we want to improve election secu-
rity, we must eliminate ballot har-
vesting and its risks to taking away
the choice of the American people.
Every American deserves their vote to
be counted and protected.
H.R. 1 limits free speech and imposes
vague standards that disadvantage
American citizens who want to advo-
cate on behalf of what they believe in.
Organizations like the National Right
to Life, the Chamber of Commerce, and
even the ACLU have spoken out
against this bill for that very reason.
Every American should be able to
speak on an issue that they are pas-
sionate about.
We also recently received the revised
CBO score of H.R. 1 which egregiously
underestimated H.R. 1’s cost to the
taxpayers because the Congressional
Budget Office said they needed more
time to develop a comprehensive score.
Instead of giving them more time, we
are preparing right now to vote on this
700-page bill.
My colleagues across the aisle are all
about transparency—at least that is
what I keep hearing. But I have yet to
see it in action, especially when it
comes to funding their own campaigns.
H.R. 1 is creating public subsidies
through the new government match
program. For every $200, $1,200 will be
going to a politician’s campaign. The
majority has changed this provision so
many times throughout the last couple
weeks. This money will come from the
U.S. Treasury through corporate fines
and go into this nebulous Freedom
From Influence Fund, but the bottom
line is it is going into Members of Con-
gress’ own campaigns.
Why are we allocating money to go
to politicians when there are so many
other causes like transportation, infra-
structure, and cancer research that our
tax dollars, your tax dollars, and the
Americans’ tax dollars should be fund-
ing?
b 1045
The Democratic majority claims
they want to take money out of poli-
tics but have created a scheme that
will, for the first time ever, make it
legal for Members of Congress to take
corporate money into their own cam-
paigns.
This is exactly why we need to vote
‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1. It is a travesty.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. SARBANES), leader of H.R. 1,
the author of the bill.
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Chair, my
colleagues, somewhere in America
there is a family in their living room
looking at the television, hearing an-
other report about how billionaires and
super-PACs and insiders and lobbyists
are running Washington and calling
the shots on what happens in their
lives.
And they are asking themselves: Do
we matter anymore? Do we count? Will
our voice be heard?
H.R. 1 says to that family and mil-
lions of families across the country
who feel the same way: We get it. We
hear you. We want to change this place
and give you your voice back by restor-
ing ethics and integrity, by pushing
back on the influence of big money in
our politics and by making sure that,
when you go to vote, you don’t have to
run an obstacle course to the ballot
box in America.
That is what we stand for.
Our colleague JOHN LEWIS reminds us
all the time that we have to keep our
eyes on the prize. Well, on this day, at
this moment, in this House, the prize is
H.R. 1. Let’s pass H.R. 1.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, may I
inquire how much time remains.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from California has 21⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield
the remainder of my time to the gen-
tleman from Georgia, the Honorable
JOHN LEWIS, hero of the voting rights
and civil rights movement.
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
strong support on H.R. 1, and I urge
each and every one of our colleagues to
support this bill.
Madam Chair, you have heard me say
on occasion that the right to vote is
precious—almost sacred. In a demo-
cratic society, it the most powerful
nonviolent instrument or tool that we
have.
In my heart of hearts, I believe we
have a moral responsibility to restore
access for all of our citizens who desire
to participate in the democratic proc-
ess.
Many people marched and protested
for the right to vote. Some gave a little
blood. Others gave their very lives.
This weekend, many of our col-
leagues traveled with us to Alabama—
to Birmingham, to Montgomery, and to
Selma. They saw the signs in the muse-
ums that said, ‘‘White only.’’ ‘‘Colored
only.’’
They visited the First Baptist
Church in downtown Montgomery

where we feared for our lives as a mob
waited outside to attack and kill us.
They stood on the Edmund Pettus
Bridge—crossing the Alabama River—
where we were beaten, trampled, and
tear-gassed for attempting to march
from Selma to Montgomery to drama-
tize the need for voting rights.
Madam Chair, you have heard me tell
this story before, and you know our
work is not finished. It makes me sad.
It makes me feel like crying when peo-
ple are denied the right to vote.
We all know that this is not a Demo-
cratic or a Republican issue. It is an
American one.
For the past few days, I listened to
the debate on this bill. I spent some
time having what I call an executive
session with myself.
The words of Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., came to mind. He would often say
that the ‘‘arc of the moral universe is
long, but it bends toward justice.’’
This vote is an opportunity to be on
the right side of history. It is a chance
to cast a vote by the people, of the peo-
ple, and for the people.
So I ask you: If not us, then who? If
not now, then when?
The time has arrived to tear down
the barriers to the ballot box. Today,
we are able to do our part in this long
fight for the very soul of our Nation.
Let’s save our Nation and redeem the
soul of America.
Ms. LOFGREN. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-
eral debate has expired.
Under the rule, the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.
DEGETTE) having assumed the chair,
Ms. HAALAND, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration
the bill (H.R. 1) to expand Americans’
access to the ballot box, reduce the in-
fluence of big money in politics, and
strengthen ethics rules for public serv-
ants, and for other purposes, and, pur-
suant to House Resolution 172, she re-
ported the bill, as amended by that res-
olution, back to the House with sundry
further amendments adopted in the
Committee of the Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
Is a separate vote demanded on any
further amendment reported from the
Committee of the Whole? If not, the
Chair will put them en gros.
The amendments were agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I
have a motion to recommit at the
desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. CRENSHAW. I am, in its current
form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Crenshaw moves to recommit the bill
H.R. 1 to the Committee on the Judiciary
with instructions to report the same to the
House forthwith with the following amend-
ment:
Add, at the end of the bill, the following
(and conform the table of contents accord-
ingly):
DIVISION D—UPHOLDING SUFFRAGE IN
AMERICA
TITLE XI—UPHOLDING SUFFRAGE IN
AMERICA
SEC. 11001. SHORT TITLE.
This division may be cited as the ‘‘Uphold-
ing Suffrage in America Act’’ or the ‘‘USA
Act’’.
SEC. 11002. FINDINGS.
Congress finds as follows:
(1) Voting is fundamental to a functioning
democracy.
(2) The Constitution prohibits discrimina-
tion in voting based on race, sex, poll taxes,
and age.
(3) It is of paramount importance that the
United States maintains the legitimacy of
its elections and protects them from inter-
ference, including interference from foreign
threats and illegal voting.
(4) The city of San Francisco, California, is
allowing non-citizens, including illegal im-
migrants, to register to vote in school board
elections.
(5) Federal law prohibits non-citizens from
voting in elections for Federal office.
SEC. 11003. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that allowing il-
legal immigrants the right to vote devalues
the franchise and diminishes the voting
power of United States citizens.
Ms. LOFGREN (during the reading).
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the reading be dispensed
with.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I ob-
ject.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Clerk will continue to read.
The Clerk continued to read.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker,
this is the final amendment to the bill.
It will not kill the bill. If adopted, the
bill will immediately proceed to final
passage, as amended.
Much has been made of election secu-
rity as of late, much of it for good rea-
son. In the end, these concerns, the
concerns that many Americans right-
fully share, are built around the funda-
mental notion that our vote should
count, our vote should mean some-
thing; and we should know that, when
we cast it, it is sacred and unchanging.
Our vote is a signal of what direction
we want our country to move toward,
and that vote is an element of trust
that we place in the men or women
elected to take it in that direction.
We vote because this country is gov-
erned by the people, by the citizens of
this country. We in this body humbly
serve at their pleasure.
The quickest way to erode a democ-
racy, erode faith in our institutions, is
to erode that trust, erode the notion
that your vote truly counts.
The truth is this is already hap-
pening. In places like San Francisco,
Democrats have fought hard to ensure
that U.S. citizens must share their
civic duty, their vote, with illegal im-
migrants. The city of San Francisco
has effectively canceled out the votes
of its citizens and replaced it with
illegals.
When I say it out loud, it sounds like
I am making it up, because what kind
of government would cancel out the
votes of its own citizens and replace
them with noncitizens—but not just
any noncitizens, ones who entered our
country illegally.
It is with this in mind, this sacred
duty to protect our citizens, protect
their vote, protect their voice, that I
propose this motion to recommit.
This motion to recommit would show
the American people that, despite the
deep and growing differences between
us, we can at least agree that the peo-
ple who vote for us are citizens of this
country.
Madam Speaker, this is a simple af-
firmation. It is an affirmation of the
fact that the elected representatives of
this body answer to the citizens of this
country who voted for us. We will not
stand by and let their voices be muted.
We will not let their trust be eroded.
We will not let our democracy be ques-
tioned.
Last year, Congress voted on this
very idea. Forty-nine Democrats
crossed the aisle to vote with us.
It should not be a partisan idea that
the people who do not legally live in
our country cannot legally vote in our
elections. If you are not legally here, if
you entered our country against the
laws and wishes of our citizens, then
you should not vote for representation
in our government, diluting the voices
of Americans.
I am proposing this MTR not because
it feels good, not because we want to
attack anyone, but because it is clear
to all of us that voter integrity actu-
ally needs to be defended.
It has become clear because San
Francisco is not the only municipality
that has fallen into this radicalism.
Other cities have done or attempted to
do the same.
The men and women in this body are
here because we were duly elected as
such.
Our citizens expect much of us. They
expect us to protect their most funda-
mental rights: the right to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness. They ex-
pect us to respect their voice. Often,
the only way they have to express that
voice is through their vote.
If we no longer agree to protect that
voice, as we did last Congress—if we
don’t, in this moment, agree that their
voice should not be canceled out but
protected, then I worry a great deal

about our democracy. I worry that
radicalism has made its way into this
sacred body, as it already has in so
many other places across our great
country.
I urge my colleagues to vote for this
motion to recommit. Vote to protect
the voices of your constituents. Vote
to preserve the notion that our Na-
tion’s government is elected by—and
only by—the citizens of this country.
Anything less is a disservice to the
very people who put us here.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
b 1100
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
claim the time in opposition.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, H.R.
1 already prevents noncitizens from
voting in Federal elections, whether
they are here lawfully or undocu-
mented. In fact, the motion to recom-
mit notices that. They say: ‘‘Federal
law prohibits noncitizens from voting
in Federal elections.’’
H.R. 1 utilizes the authority in Arti-
cle I, Section 4 to extend in Federal
elections the opportunity for every
American to vote.
This motion to recommit is an effort
to divert us from the mission that we
are on to expand voting rights to every
American citizen in Federal elections.
I urge its defeat.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ROSE).
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to
this motion. I rise today as a new
Member who ran for office on cleaning
up our system. And admittedly, I rise
today as someone who has voted for
Republican MTRs in the past.
In fact, I was eager to hear how my
colleagues and friends across the aisle
would propose a solution today for how
they are going to finally drain the
swamp. I was eager to hear how they
would protect and enshrine the rights
and freedoms and liberties that we all
are endowed in the Constitution.
But what they have given us today
does nothing to drain the swamp, noth-
ing to uphold our freedoms. Only in
Washington would we see a group of
people actively trying to sabotage
anticorruption measures.
This is a political stunt meant to di-
vide us, meant to sow hatred. It is a
game, nothing less. Nothing less.
This right here is why the American
people hate politics. Honestly, if this is
your strategy to win future elections,
we wish you Godspeed because it will
never work. It will never work because
the question before us today, and the
thing that this joke of an MTR that is
seeking to distract us from is, whose
side are you on?
Let’s show the American people that
this is the people’s House, not the
House of corporate interests and lobby-
ists and dark money.
Again, I stand in opposition to this
motion.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, may
I ask how much time remains.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 21⁄2 min-
utes remaining.
Ms. LOFGREN. At this point, Madam
Speaker, I yield the balance of my time
to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
LEWIS), the hero of the voting rights
movement.
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I be-
lieve in the way of peace, in the way of
love. I believe in the philosophy and
the discipline of nonviolence.
Can we come together and support a
simple piece of legislation to open up
the political process and let all of our
people come in?
I ask you to remember what I said a
few moments ago. With this vote, we
have an opportunity to be a headlight
and not a taillight.
Some of our colleagues are com-
plaining that we didn’t have enough
time. We have the time. This piece of
legislation was introduced more than 7
years ago, and the other party didn’t
do anything.
We are prepared to act. We are pre-
pared to open up the political process
and let all of the people come in. It is
the right thing to do. It is a good thing
to do, to set our country on a path, a
path that can be a model for the rest of
the world.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, on that I demand the
yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-
minute vote on the motion to recom-
mit will be followed by 5-minute votes
on:
Passage of the bill, if ordered; and
Agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of
the Journal, if ordered.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 197, nays

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
HOYER), the House majority leader, for
the purpose of explaining the week to
come.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
As I have expressed, the gentleman
from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND), my
friend, would like to have a moment.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
RICHMOND).
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I
thank both the majority leader and the
minority whip for yielding me time.
Today is a great day, but it is also a
sad day for me. I am losing my chief of
staff, the only one that I have had
since I have been here, Virgil Miller,
who, the funny story is, John Dingell
made the reference for me to hire him.
The one thing I appreciate now is
that when I called John Dingell for a
recommendation, he was on the House
floor, but told his staff, ‘‘No matter
where I am, pull me off so I can talk
about how great Virgil Miller is.’’
Some of you may have seen the news,
but Virgil proposed. More importantly,
Kirby said yes. So he is getting mar-
ried and starting another chapter of his
life.
It was great to have him here in this
body, and I hope for him the best. He is
not only my chief, but he has come to
be part of our family and like a young-
er brother to me. I just want to wish
him the best as he goes off to start a
more exciting part of his life and wish
him the best.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority
leader for allowing me to say a few
words.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for his comments.
I know that I speak on behalf of all
the Members of the House to wish Vir-
gil Godspeed, great success in the fu-
ture, and great happiness.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, if I may
reclaim my time from the majority
leader.
Mr. Speaker, I do also want to thank
Virgil for his time and his service to
the House for so long and to work so
closely with my friend, CEDRIC RICH-
MOND, but also with the entire Lou-
isiana delegation. We have had a long
history of working incredibly well to-
gether on issues that are important to
our State and the country.
Virgil has been right there from the
beginning of CEDRIC’s career and a
great part of the Louisiana delegation
but also a great part of what makes
this House work.
Mr. Speaker, while we will miss Vir-
gil, I wish him well on his new life
ahead, a lot of exciting times. I con-
tinue to look forward to seeing you in
New Orleans at our great restaurants.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER).
b 1130
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman
for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House
will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-hour
debate and 2 p.m. for legislative busi-
ness, with votes postponed until 6:30
p.m.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-
hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative
business.
On Thursday, the House will meet at
9 a.m. for legislative business, with last
votes no later than 3 p.m.
We will consider several bills under
suspension of the rules. A complete list
of suspensions will be announced by
the close of business today.
The House will also consider H. Con.
Res. 24, expressing the sense of Con-
gress that the report of Special Counsel
Mueller should be made available to
the public and to Congress.
Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman
for walking through the schedule, and I
would like to ask the gentleman from
Maryland about the process that we
have had so far this Congress in terms
of amendments that have been sub-
mitted on the House floor on legisla-
tion and the way that it has been in-
credibly closed, especially in a partisan
way to Republican amendments.
If you look just at the bill we debated
a few minutes ago, H.R. 1, only 11 per-
cent of Republican amendments were
made in order. More than 60 amend-
ments of Democrat amendments were
made in order. And if you look at the
entire Congress so far this year, there
were only 16 percent of Republican
amendments made in order while 73
percent of Democrat amendments were
made in order, which does reflect poor-
ly on the promise that this would be a
more open process.
I would ask the gentleman from
Maryland, can you address at least in
the future to make this a more fair and
open process so that you are not clos-
ing out opportunities over and over
again for Republican amendments to be
made in order?
And I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman
for his question. I want to put it in
context.
For the first time in history, we
started this Congress with a govern-
ment shutdown. For the first time in
history. The business was not com-
pleted, the government was not fully
funded, and it was necessary for us, as
we began this session, to have numer-
ous votes to open up the government.
We didn’t get a lot of help from your
side of the aisle on doing that, and it
was not about a debate; we had consid-
ered six bills that essentially had been
agreed to. There was clearly a disagree-
ment on Homeland Security.
But let me remind you, on H.R. 1, the
largest bill that we considered during
the last Congress, you brought that to
the floor and you had no committee
hearings. Not a single committee hear-
ing. You had no witnesses. No member
of the public was able to testify. It was
a closed rule, and zero amendments
were made in order.
Now, let me make a comparison for
you on H.R. 1, the bill we just passed.
This bill had five hearings across sev-
eral committees, 19 witnesses testified,
the primary committee of jurisdiction
had markup, and 72 amendments were
made in order.
Now, H.R. 1, last Congress, zero
Democratic amendments made in
order. Now of course there were no Re-
publican amendments made in order ei-
ther because it was a closed rule, no
amendments at all, no hearings, no
committee hearings, no witnesses.
So that we have, as we said we would,
had a process, opportunity for the pub-
lic to testify, opportunity for amend-
ments to be made in order. I forget ex-
actly how many amendments you said,
Republican amendments, but that is,
whatever that number was, whether it
was 10 or 15 or 25 or 35, more than we
had in order.
As the gentleman knows, the last
Congress was the most closed Congress
in history. In history. We did not see a
single open rule, not one under Speaker
Ryan, not one. I am committed to en-
suring, however, that we have a limited
amount of closed rules.
Again, the gentleman is correct, the
government was shut down and we had
rules that we put forward to get the
government open. It was not an amend-
ment to say partially open this. It was,
let’s get it open.
So that my answer to the gentleman
is we said what we were going to do on
bills. We had 72 amendments on this
bill. The proportion of amendments,
the gentleman’s concerned about, cer-
tainly want to make sure that we have
substantive amendments considered
from both sides of the aisle; that was
done here. The gentleman thinks not
enough, but as I said, it was, as opposed
to zero, a substantial increase.
Mr. SCALISE. Well, I thank the gen-
tleman. I would like to point out, of
those 72 amendments that you identify
that were made in order, only nine
were Republican amendments. So when
we talk about a fair and open process,
the government shutdown has nothing
to do with the fact that your side com-
mitted to having a more open process,
and it is not. In fact, it is the reverse
of what we saw last Congress.
If you look at the entire last Con-
gress, the entire 2-year period, there
were more Democrat amendments
made in order under a Republican Con-
gress than there were Republican
amendments made in order. In fact, if
you look at the numbers for the entire
2-year period, 38 percent of Republican
amendments were made in order; 45

percent of Democrat amendments were
made in order. In the overall number,
752 Democrat amendments made in
order, 752. There were only 640 Repub-
lican amendments made in order. So
more Democrat amendments were
made in order under our majority than
Republican amendments.
In this Congress so far, it is been a
harshly partisan process through the
Rules Committee. Again, the entire
year, only 16 percent of Republican
amendments made in order; 73 percent
of Democrat amendments made in
order.
And just looking at H.R. 1 again, we
had on our side a colleague of ours,
Representative FITZPATRICK. He actu-
ally led the FBI’s agency on campaign
finance and election crimes enforce-
ment. He actually put people in jail
who committed voter fraud, and this is
a voter bill, a bill on voting rights, and
you have a Member of Congress who ac-
tually worked with the FBI to put peo-
ple in jail for voter fraud. He submitted
seven different amendments to clean
up some of the corruption that was in
your bill that you just passed. Not one
of his amendments was made in order.
This is an FBI agent who actually put
people in jail for voter fraud, not a par-
tisan issue, and yet not one of his
amendments was made in order.
So you want to talk about a closed
process, let’s also talk about the policy
that is being closed out, and if you
want to shut out efforts to clean up
voter fraud, that is your prerogative,
but ultimately it is not what you
promised when you took the majority
and if you compare it to the last Con-
gress. Again, the entire 2-year period,
more Democrat amendments were
made in order than Republican amend-
ments were made in order under our
Republican majority.
I would hope in the future this proc-
ess is less partisan and more fair, as it
was promised to be.
On that note, I would like to ask the
majority leader about a word that is
swirling around regarding changes to
the motion to recommit. Now, when
you look at the history of Congress,
this motion to recommit is more than
100 years old. It had been a custom. It
had been a custom where the majority
party brings a bill to the floor under a
rule, and regardless of all the amend-
ments that are allowed, at the very end
of that process, the minority party
gets an opportunity to make a final
amendment to the bill. That is the mo-
tion to recommit.
It wasn’t in the rules for a long time.
And then towards the end of the Demo-
crat majority, right before the 1994 rev-
olution, there were efforts to take that
away from the minority. So when the
Republicans took over in 1994, the
Newt Gingrich majority, they actually
put in the rules the motion to recom-
mit. Again, it was a custom going back
100 years. They formalized it. As the
majority, they gave the minority that
right in the rules. And it has always
been there. It was cleaned up a little
bit over the years, but it is a tool that
has been always allowed to the minor-
ity.
We are hearing—and it is rumor
maybe—I would like to ask the major-
ity leader to clarify, are there any ef-
forts or attempts being made to change
and diminish the motion to recommit?
And I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman
for yielding. Of course, we both know,
certainly since the time I have been
here, that motions to recommit, on
both sides of the aisle, have been
gotcha amendments. They have been
amendments to use for political ads to
talk about partisanship. Both sides did
that, understand.
So is there consternation about
them? There is. Did you have an MTR
today? You did. It was a difficult MTR.
Of course, it dealt with a problem that
does not exist at the Federal level, and
it said so in the resolution, that there
was not a problem that they were solv-
ing, just a sort of a sense that local
communities ought to be directed what
to do.
Having said that let me go back to
the gentleman’s question again. You
said you had nine amendments. We had
zero. So you could say it was 900 per-
cent, 9,000 percent, but whatever you
want to say, on H.R. 1 in your Congress
and H.R. 1 in our Congress and all
those figures, I think, are probably lost
on the public, but what is not lost on
the public or the press that has covered
it extensively, last Congress was the
most closed Congress in history, just as
the Government being shutdown at the
beginning of this Congress was the first
time that happened in history, because
you didn’t get your job done.
But I would tell the leader, I under-
stand the rights of the minority. We
want to honor the rights of the minor-
ity, and, yes, there is a lot of discus-
sion, but as you know, nothing has
been done, and I am sure those discus-
sions will continue.
But I understand the gentleman’s
point. We used the motion to recom-
mit. You have used the motion to re-
commit. There is no proposed change
currently under consideration.
Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman
for clarifying that. And I hope that tra-
dition continues on, that this motion
to recommit stays in order, because
there are some Members that, if the
motion to recommit passes, would vote
for final passage. So that is one of the
tools that are used. And if you cite, as
you did, the motion to recommit that
we had on H.R. 1 just a little while ago,
it actually was identifying a serious
problem.
It mentioned in that motion to re-
commit what happens in some commu-
nities where they are allowing illegals
to vote, people that are here illegally,
to vote in elections, whether it is
school board elections or any other,
and then you have a process where
somebody has an ID, they are auto-
matically sent to the voter registra-
tion files. And it creates a process
where corruption can occur, where peo-
ple who are here illegally can get on
voting rolls and maybe you catch it at
the local level and maybe you don’t,
but it creates that opportunity. So we
had a motion to prevent that from hap-
pening, and, unfortunately, that mo-
tion to recommit failed. But again,
that is a tool that has been available
for any minority to use.
And in fact, when you bring up H.R.
1 from last Congress, our bill to cut
taxes for working families so that we
can rebuild our middle class, which we
are finally doing now because we cut
taxes for everybody, people are seeing
more money in their pockets; higher
wages because of that bill. Heavily de-
bated in committee; lots of amend-
ments in committee on both sides.
When it came to the floor, yes, there
were no amendments on your side or on
our side, but you did have a motion to
recommit. So you had an amendment
opportunity that we didn’t have on
that bill. But at the end of the day, ob-
viously all Members on your side voted
‘‘no.’’
But you can see how the economy has
taken off and how families actually
have more money in their pockets and
wages are up for working families be-
cause we cut those taxes.
So I would point that out as we move
forward, hopefully, those rules don’t
change in a way that would try to di-
minish even further the opportunities
that both sides have to bring amend-
ments to the floor.
Finally, I would like to ask about the
resolution that we had on the floor yes-
terday, the resolution to condemn all
forms of bigotry, hatred. Unfortunately
many of our Members felt it fell short
of the objective that was stated by the
majority at the beginning of the week,
that there would be a resolution
brought forward to actually condemn
comments that were made, that were
anti-Semitic by one of our Members.
And I would like to ask the gen-
tleman, is there going to be any action
taken, especially as it relates to the
Foreign Affairs Committee, to remove
the Member that we are talking about?
And I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HOYER. I tell the gentleman, I
have heard that question raised before.
You removed Mr. KING from the com-
mittees after 10 years of comments,
speeches, and support for groups that
did not comport with what we said yes-
terday in terms of rejecting bigotry
and prejudice and hate. Ten years.
b 1145
We have now twice taken action to
make clear that hate and prejudice and
bigotry are not the policies of this Con-
gress, of this country, and should not
be the policy of any of our Members,
rhetorically.
Debating policy, having differences
of opinion are clear. I don’t know
whether the gentleman heard my
speech on the floor, but I could not, I
think, have articulated more forcefully
that anti-Semitism is unacceptable,

that anti-Semitism has led to grievous
results, unacceptable results, the Holo-
caust, of course, being the most hor-
rific.
I made that very clear. The resolu-
tion made that very clear. And yes, it
did include other forms and other ob-
jects of hate and prejudice and bigotry.
And I was disappointed that 23 of
your Members voted against it. Every
one of my Members, without exception,
voted for that resolution. So that reso-
lution, I thought, that got over 400 of
us, spoke very strongly to our opposi-
tion to anti-Semitism, to racism, to
sexism, to Islamophobia.
And I haven’t seen any resolution on
the floor of the House when you were
in charge that responded to the Presi-
dent of the United States stoking
Islamophobia.
I saw no resolution. I saw no resolu-
tion on the floor when the President of
the United States made a comment
that, well, there are bad people on both
sides, in Charlottesville—those holding
Swastikas; those who were saying we
are not going to allow the Jews to take
over; those who had racist epithets and
who, in fact, of course, killed one of the
participants. I saw no resolution. We
ultimately did get to a resolution.
But I would say to my friend, frank-
ly, those of us on our side of the aisle
think that the President too often uses
words and actions that undermine the
sentiment of the resolution that I
voted for, that you voted for, and the
overwhelming majority of the House
voted for saying that is not and should
not be the policy of the United States.
I won’t go into more specifics, but
the gentleman, I am sure, knows that I
could.
What is positive is that yesterday
some 400-plus of us voted to say to
America and to each of our citizens and
those who view America as a beacon of
liberty and justice that we reject out of
hand any comments, any actions that
would be recognized by most people as
stoking bigotry and prejudice and hate.
So, yes, that language you are talk-
ing about, as introduced, was not a
final product. The final product came
about through a lot of discussions and
addressing the hate and bigotry and
prejudice that is directed at too many
people who are somehow viewed as dif-
ferent.
The remarks to which the gentleman
referred were pointed out very clearly
as being remarks which had been used
through the millennia as ways to di-
minish the integrity of Jewish citizens
and to imply that somehow their sup-
port for Israel was an indication of
their lack of loyalty to their country.
You and I both know that was used for
centuries, millennia, to marginalize
Jewish citizens and to make them feel
unwelcomed and rejected.
So I think the resolution was a good
thing for us to do. It passed over-
whelmingly. I am sorry that 23 of your
Members decided not to vote for it.
Let me go back to the MTRs.
We had a very strong statement that
your side offered on anti-Semitism.
And you all voted for it; we all voted
for it. Not a single Democrat voted
against it. And when it came for final
passage, I don’t recall how many Re-
publicans, but it was the overwhelming
majority of your caucus voted against
it.
So offering an amendment, having
the amendment adopted, which we ac-
cepted because we thought that it was
important to make that powerful
statement against anti-Semitism, we
adopted it.
Unfortunately, when it came to the
real vote—not the political gotcha
vote, but when it came to the real
vote—your side all voted against it—or
if not all, pretty close.
Mr. SCALISE. And as we disagree
with the underlying bills, we all agree
that anti-Semitism is wrong. We have
been very vocal in rejecting anti-Semi-
tism and any form of bigotry.
The issue with the resolution that
was brought forward—first of all, as
the gentleman, over months, has prom-
ised a 72-hour rule where there would
be 72 hours to review legislation, as
you acknowledged, that resolution con-
tinued to change over and over again.
By the time it was filed, before Mem-
bers had the opportunity to vote, there
wasn’t a 72-hour rule. In fact, there
wasn’t even a 72-minute rule. There
was less than an hour to review the
legislation
As Members went through it, it in-
cluded some things that we all agree
should be rejected. But many Mem-
bers—and I would refer the gentleman
from Maryland to the statements made
by the gentleman from New York (Mr.
ZELDIN), who eloquently stated why
that resolution fell short at its original
objection: to equivocate anti-Semi-
tism, to refuse to acknowledge that as
Members spew anti-Semitism. If we
can say that anti-Semitism is unac-
ceptable—and I agree. If we say that we
should reject those policies, the dual
citizenship question, which is anti-Se-
mitic, the money influence, which was
offensive and anti-Semitic, we keep
coming back to this because these
statements continue to be made.
But if that is unacceptable, if you
agree that anti-Semitism is unaccept-
able and bad policy, then why do you
continue to leave a Member who is
anti-Semitic on the committee that
deals with the policy of the foreign pol-
icy of this Nation?
It is a high-profile committee. The
Foreign Affairs Committee is a plumb
spot. Many Members on both sides
want to get on that committee because
it is so important at stating our for-
eign policy to the world, at standing
with our allies.
When you go to other countries and
meet with officials, if you say you are
on the Foreign Affairs Committee, it is
a higher level of respect and acknowl-
edgment that implies that your views
represent the views of the United
States Congress.
That is the concern where the resolu-
tion fell short.
And so many of our Members said:
How many times are we going to have
to keep voting on resolutions that talk
generally but don’t act specifically to
address the problems?
And if you want to talk about the
President, President Trump has been
very clear and vocal, speaking out
against anti-Semitism.
You saw him, just a few weeks ago,
from this podium, in his State of the
Union Address so eloquently bringing
members to the gallery, people to the
gallery: the three men who stormed
Normandy Beach on D-day to liberate
France and to defeat Nazis; the gen-
tleman from Pittsburgh, the Holocaust
survivor, over 90 years old, who sur-
vived the Pittsburgh shooting, who
also was at Dachau.
And then for the President to so elo-
quently refer to one of our heroes who
stormed Normandy Beach and then a
year later help liberate Dachau, what a
special moment for this House to see
how hatred and bigotry is evil but how
the might and power of the United
States stands up against it.
We should all speak out against it,
but we should also take the actions
that, if somebody is continuing to ex-
hibit those kind of beliefs in this Con-
gress, they shouldn’t be making policy
on the committee that has jurisdiction.
That has been the concern.
I hope we don’t have to come back to
it. I hope we don’t have to keep coming
back to address this problem. It
shouldn’t be a growing problem.
We should all stand up against it
when we see it. And hopefully, we don’t
see it anymore because we are so
clear—not just in our words, but clear
in our actions.
So as we continue to, hopefully, find
common ground—and there is common
ground to be found. This wasn’t a good
week for the United States Congress to
see the kind of divisions, to see it take
days to come up with a simple resolu-
tion that should have taken minutes to
stand up clearly against anti-Semitic
actions.
So, hopefully, next week we can re-
turn to making policy where we are
able to come together in a bipartisan
way to address concerns and problems
of this Nation.
And I know I look forward to work-
ing with the gentleman if we find that
common ground. And we will, we ulti-
mately will.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER).
Mr. HOYER. First of all, Mr. Speak-
er, let me say I reject out of hand the
premise that we didn’t speak directly
to anti-Semitism in the resolution that
was adopted yesterday, period. It spoke
strongly to that.
Not only did it speak strongly, but if
the gentleman heard my remarks, they
were very strong with respect to an ab-
solute rejection of anti-Semitism.
Now, apparently, the problem is we
also spoke against racism. We also
spoke against xenophobia.
I mentioned the President on xeno-
phobia, the denigration of the dignity

of immigrants who have been so impor-
tant to this country at the highest lev-
els of our government, the allegations
of widespread criminal activity in a
broad bush. That resolution yesterday
spoke to that.
It spoke about Islamophobia. It
spoke about hatred of immigrants, of
LGBT members of our society. It spoke
against discrimination and hate. And,
yes, it spoke directly about anti-Semi-
tism, as it should have.
As I was absolutely committed, and
the Members of this House were abso-
lutely committed—save 23. I don’t
know why that 23 voted against it, but
they did, not on our side of the aisle.
And I agree with the gentleman.
Hopefully, we can continue to not use
this as a political football, as I think it
is being used.
And I am not going to cite some of
the remarks of the minority leader
with respect to Mr. Soros, Mr. Steier or
others, Mr. JORDAN, Mr. KING. There
was a difference, Mr. Speaker. We
didn’t wait 10 years.
Initially, we acted—the entire Demo-
cratic leadership—with a very pointed
and direct letter that anti-Semitism
was not acceptable, period. No confu-
sion.
And within days, we put a suspension
bill—which, by the way, the rules are
waived on suspension bills. As the gen-
tleman knows, you don’t necessarily
have to give 72 hours. But there were 72
hours that that was being discussed,
and people knew it was being discussed,
and the leader—and the whip has re-
ferred to that.
b 1200
But I hope that nobody would dimin-
ish what we said yesterday about anti-
Semitism, or racism, or any other kind
of ism.
Let us not diminish what we did yes-
terday. I think this was a good week,
Mr. Speaker, for the House of Rep-
resentatives. We spoke about making
sure that voting rights were protected
for every American, and not only that,
protected, but facilitated, made easier
to register and to vote so that all
Americans could express their opinion
on the policies of their country and
their State, and their municipality, or
whatever office they were voting for.
It was a good day to say that we are
going to have redistricting which is not
run by the politicians, and I have been
one of them that has done it so every-
body understands that. Every State,
not just a few, would have to have a re-
districting process that was fair and
balanced, and not just the politicians
drawing their own districts.
It was a good day, Mr. Speaker. It
was a good week, because we also spoke
about making sure that we have cam-
paign finance that discloses to every-
body who the contributors are. It is
ironic, Mr. Speaker, that I was here
when we considered McCain-Feingold
and the Republican leadership in the
House and the Senate both said: ‘‘You
don’t need caps. You don’t need to
limit spending. What you need is dis-
closure. Let people know who is con-
tributing.’’
Well, of course, Citizens United un-
dermined that pretty substantially,
and we have millions and millions of
dollars nobody knows where it comes
from, so this bill did that.
This bill also said that we ought to
have better ethics. We ought to not be
serving on boards of profit-making cor-
porations while we are making policies
that affect them in this House. And,
yes, it said the President of the United
States, as every President since I have
been a Member of Congress which has
been since 1981, should disclose their
tax returns so that the people know,
are they acting in their own interest,
or in the people’s interest.
We called this bill the For the People
Act, for voting rights, for fair registra-
tion, for campaign finance that is hon-
est and above board and transparent,
and for good ethical behavior by us and
by the President.
So I disagree with my friend, the mi-
nority whip. I think this was a good
week. In some ways, it was a tough
week, but it was a good week. I am
very pleased that not only did we adopt
that resolution against hate, and preju-
dice, and bigotry against all, including
and very pointedly, starting out with
anti-Semitism.
We also adopted a bill that will give
more trust and faith to the American
people in their government and more
access to the ballot box. It was a good
bill. It was a good week.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, if we
talk about H.R. 1, what the gentleman
fails to mention is that bill gives bil-
lions of dollars of taxpayer money to
politicians. Many have called it the
‘‘For the Politicians Act.’’ Most Ameri-
cans across this country are hard-
working. I don’t want to see their tax-
payer dollars go to some politician
that they strongly disagree with so
that they can run negative attack ads,
things that people don’t like to see on
TV.
If somebody wants to contribute to a
campaign, that is their prerogative,
but no taxpayer should be forced to
give billions of dollars of their tax-
payer money to politicians, whether
they agree or disagree with them, by
coercion from the Federal Government.
That is in the bill. It has felons voting.
Many States have laws against felons
voting.
For example, somebody brought this
up and we weren’t even able to get a
clear answer. If somebody was con-
victed of child molestation in a State
that prohibited them from going to
schools, under your bill if they go to a
school to vote—because now as a felon,
as a child molester, even though that
State bars them from voting, and that
State bars them from going into a
school—the bill gives them a hall pass
to go into that school as a child mo-
lester, who, otherwise, under their
State law, would be prohibited from
going into that school where children
are.
So there are obviously a lot of other
things in that bill that concern many
Americans across the country.
Getting back to the anti-Semitism
debate we are having. The gentleman
brought up the minority leader and
other Members. The minority leader
has been very vocal against anti-Semi-
tism. Clearly, when you saw people giv-
ing outside money, over $100 million of
their own money to influence cam-
paigns, of course, that is a subject peo-
ple talk about.
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman
yield on that point?
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I will
yield on that point, but I would like to
make the point that the minority lead-
er has been very vocal against anti-
Semitism, and I just wanted to make
sure that the gentleman wasn’t infer-
ring anything different in his com-
ments.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, why in his
comment did he mention three Ameri-
cans of Jewish descent but didn’t men-
tion the Koch brothers, and by the
way, didn’t mention the gentleman
from Nevada?
Mr. SCALISE. Who is also Jewish.
Mr. HOYER. Exactly. The three Jews
that were mentioned were all Demo-
crats, and the Koch brothers were not
mentioned.
Mr. SCALISE. We have supporters on
both sides that, regardless of their
faith, give lots of money to politics.
Mr. HOYER. I agree with that.
Mr. SCALISE. Now, if the criticism
was that there were big donors to
Democrats, of course, that is who was
being mentioned. Regardless of their
faith, those were the people who were
giving large amounts, tens of millions
of dollars each. As you have criticized,
or brought up the name of the gen-
tleman from Nevada, nobody questions
that you are making a comment about
his religious faith.
Mr. HOYER. Of course not.
Mr. SCALISE. And neither should
the assertion be made to anyone who
brings up the three gentlemen who
were mentioned.
Reclaiming my time, the bigger issue
is, it is interesting that the gentleman
mentioned a bunch of names. He men-
tioned a lot of names, but the one
name he didn’t mention is Ms. OMAR,
who, at the beginning of this week,
that was initially what the resolution
was going to be, trying to address the
comments made by Ms. OMAR.
Ultimately, the resolution went
much further and left out that key
component that many of us wanted to
see addressed, many of us expected to
see addressed, but a lot of people found
it real interesting.
For example, in section 7 of the reso-
lution, it condemns death threats re-
ceived by Jewish and Muslim Members
of Congress. Why, interestingly, were
death threats to other Members of Con-
gress left out? I surely can speak to
that as so many others of our col-
leagues can.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2607
March 8, 2019
All death threats against Members of
Congress are wrong. Why did the reso-
lution fall short in so many areas? Be-
cause it was so hastily put together.
That is not the way we should address
an issue this important.
It was supposed to be a narrow reso-
lution. Clearly, on your side, you had a
lot of division over it. There shouldn’t
have been division over it. This is what
we ended up with, and so, yes, many of
our Members felt that while we have
been very clear in rejecting anti-Semi-
tism or anti-racism, or any kind of big-
otry, that the resolution fell short of
what its original objective was.
Again, I hope we don’t have to come
back to this. I hope it doesn’t continue.
We can continue speaking about this,
but let’s be clear about who is speaking
out against it, and who is continuing to
engage in it.
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land, if he would like to comment fur-
ther.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
I urge both sides, when the leader of
our Government says things that clear-
ly offend minority groups of all stripes
that we speak out. I think that is a
good thing for us to do, and I am sure
that we can be joined together to do
exactly that.
I would also ask the gentleman to
perhaps observe the extraordinary di-
versity representing all of America on
this side of the aisle. You ought not to
be surprised that in representing that
diversity, they bring forward issues
that we tried to also address in a reso-
lution that said hate, bigotry, and prej-
udice is wrong. It is un-American.
Unfortunately, none of us have an-
cestors today that were free from pur-
suing hateful policies. We ought not to
be, as I said on the floor, too sanctimo-
nious. We are a Nation that allowed
slavery and went through an extraor-
dinary Civil War to eliminate that blot
on ‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evi-
dent.’’
So, yes, we have a lot of diversity on
our side of the aisle, and that diversity
is representing its people. They are
Americans, but they represent a num-
ber of Americans who are perceived as
different than other Americans for
some designation, either because of
race, gender, color, sexual orientation,
or immigrant. You name it.
Yes, we have a lot of diversity on this
side of the aisle, and we tried to re-
spect that diversity and make sure
that every American knew when they
read this resolution; we are against dis-
crimination against anybody.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, we ap-
preciate the diversity that we have. We
obviously strive to be even more di-
verse, but the most important diver-
sity that we have and that we are
proud of is our diversity of thought.
We are proud to respect people of all
faiths. This was a Nation founded
under a deep belief in God, but we don’t
have an established religion. We appre-
ciate and respect people of all religious
backgrounds.
One of the things I love most about
going to Israel as a Catholic is that so
much of the history of my faith of
Jesus Christ is represented there in
Israel, where you can walk the streets
of Jerusalem and literally walk in the
steps of Jesus. The fact is that Jewish
people in Israel respect that diversity;
they respect people of all faiths. And
that is one of the proud, crowning
achievements of the Jewish state of
Israel.
If you look at where we are as a Na-
tion, clearly, slavery is one of the
stains, probably the greatest stain, of
this Nation. The country struggled
with it in its founding, and, ultimately,
President Lincoln—the first Repub-
lican President—President Lincoln
gave his life fighting to end slavery. It
was in this Chamber, newly built,
where they had that great debate to fi-
nally pass the 13th Amendment, one of
the proudest moments of our Nation.
It was very contentious, but, ulti-
mately, it was a struggle that had fi-
nally come to a head. Again, President
Lincoln gave his life for that fight, and
we still honor and respect him. In fact,
we have a room right down the hall,
the Lincoln Room where Abraham Lin-
coln as a House Member in the 1840s
spent time, and we can all go, literally,
sit or talk in the same place that Abra-
ham Lincoln sat and talked as he was
starting to build coalitions to end slav-
ery, which he was ultimately able to
secure.
So we continue to fight. It was won-
derful to see JOHN LEWIS on the floor, a
true hero, not just a hero of this Con-
gress. We had the honor to serve with
Sam Johnson, who was a great hero. He
spent 7 years in the Hanoi Hilton.
It is a true honor to serve with JOHN
LEWIS. And whether we disagree some-
times on politics, to be able to sit and
talk with somebody who truly lived
some of the toughest history of our Na-
tion, and has the scars to prove it, and,
yet, he still has love in his heart. He
exhibits that love and that passion, so
we are honored to be able to celebrate
that diversity.
Ultimately, it is a diversity of
thought that we all should fight to
achieve, equality and opportunity for
all men and women in this great Na-
tion.
I yield to the gentleman, if he has
anything else.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for his yielding and his
comments.
Let me simply add, we can honor
that by our words and our actions
today, and tomorrow, and every day
thereafter.
Mr. SCALISE. I agree. We should
continue to honor all of those goals
with our words and our actions.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

DENOUNCING ANTI-SEMITISM
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
first want to acknowledge the passing
of a dear friend, Congressman Ralph
Hall, who was a great leader and a
great Texan.
But I also rise today, Mr. Speaker, to
ensure that the American people know
what we did this week; and that is con-
demning anti-Semitism as hateful ex-
pressions of intolerance that are con-
tradictory to the values and aspira-
tions that define the United States of
America. This is the strongest, most
definitive denouncing of anti-Semitism
that the United States Congress has
ever voted on—407 votes.
This summer I will be in my almost
30th year of sending young people to
Israel in a kibbutz program named
after former Congressman Mickey Le-
land.
We understand the value of applaud-
ing all people, and, yes, we don’t want
Americans who happen to be Muslims
to be discriminated against or associ-
ated with the burning towers, Muslims
who have served in the United States
military or white nationalists who will
be willing to talk about the hatefulness
against African Americans, Latinos,
Native Americans, Asians, and Pacific
Islanders.
Mr. Speaker, this is an important
statement, and I am glad to have been
associated with it. We should applaud
all those who voted for it.

RECOGNIZING JOE M. STEELE OF
THE STEELE CANNING COMPANY
(Mr. WOMACK asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and legacy
of the late Joe Steele, the founder of
Steele Canning Company in Arkansas.
Joe grew up in northwest Arkansas
and eventually enrolled at the Univer-
sity of Arkansas. To cover his tuition,
he began canning tomatoes. This side
job quickly turned into the Steele Can-
ning Company.
The business continued to grow and
relocated to Springdale. There Joe
made history by shipping the first
trainload of canned food in the United
States and introducing Popeye brand
spinach. During World War II, 70 per-
cent of Steele’s products were sent to
our brave troops. One soldier even com-
mented on the beans, saying that the

reason they are so good is because they
were canned in Arkansas.
His legacy also includes the creation
of the Beaver Water District, which is
the primary source of water for north-
west Arkansas.
For these contributions, he was post-
humously inducted into the Arkansas
Business Hall of Fame. I congratulate
his family on this great honor.
f
VOTING RIGHTS
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, last week-
end Members of Congress traveled to
Alabama for a civil rights pilgrimage.
In Selma we marched across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge alongside Con-
gressman JOHN LEWIS.
Mr. Speaker, 54 years ago yesterday,
Congressman LEWIS was on that same
bridge with hundreds of other brave
Americans young and old. They were
marching for the right to vote, and
they were met with a wave of teargas
and billy clubs. Representative LEWIS
was beaten unconscious.
The trip for me was a powerful and
terrible history lesson.
Today States no longer use terror to
prevent citizens from voting, but they
do use other means. Since the Supreme
Court’s 2013 Shelby decision, nearly
two dozen States have implemented re-
strictive voter ID laws, closed polling
places, and used other means to sup-
press minority voting.
H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act, will erase these trends, and
H.R. 1, which we passed today,
strengthens democracy by ensuring
clean, fair elections, prohibiting voter
roll purges, and ending gerry-
mandering. Democracy means govern-
ment by the people for the people. It
lives up to the legacy of those march-
ers 54 years ago. Ultimately, it means
making voting easier, not harder.
Let’s keep our eye on the prize.
f
HONORING SENATOR LOUIS PATE
(Mr. ROUZER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, Senator
Louis Pate, of Mount Olive, North
Carolina, recently retired from the
North Carolina General Assembly after
more than 16 years of serving the great
people of eastern North Carolina. I had
the pleasure and honor to serve with
Louis in the North Carolina Senate. We
shared representation of Wayne Coun-
ty, and I can attest to what a great
member he was.
Senator Pate is known across the
State for his leadership, compassion,
and commitment to public service. He
is a Vietnam war combat veteran, hav-
ing served 20 years in the United States
Air Force earning multiple service
medals for his bravery while defending
our country. His commitment to advo-
cating for those who serve our country
was a top priority during his time in
public office, and I know he has been
honored to represent the fine men and
women serving at Seymour Johnson
Air Force Base in Goldsboro, North
Carolina.
During his tenure in the State sen-
ate, Louis spent much of his time
working to implement policy to
strengthen and improve access to qual-
ity healthcare, including major re-
forms to Medicaid so the program
would better meet the needs of those
for whom it was designed to help.
Senator Pate’s legacy as a states-
man, mentor, and friend to many will
continue to impact all those who cross
his path. I wish him and his family
many blessed days ahead.

SPECIAL INTERESTS AND BIG
MONEY IN POLITICS
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the historic vote the
House took to strengthen our democ-
racy. The For the People Act will help
combat corruption and bring ethics and
accountability back to our political
process.
I am particularly happy that the leg-
islative changes of the Let It Go Act
will be part of this bold piece of pro-
gressive legislation.
Currently, no laws exist that limit
how long candidates or former govern-
ment officials can hold on to their
campaign funds after their campaign
ends or following the conclusion of
their public service. It is not their
money. They should let it go.
Limits to how long surplus funds can
remain in campaign accounts and how
that money can be utilized must be es-
tablished. With the inclusion of my
amendment, this legislation will do
just that.
For far too long, powerful special in-
terests and big money in politics have
silenced the voices of the American
people. H.R. 1 will help shift the bal-
ance of power from a wealthy, powerful
few back to the American people.
Today I cast an enthusiastic vote, a
‘‘yes’’ vote For the People.

MOURNING THE LOSS OF GREENE
COUNTY SHERIFF BRIAN TENNANT
(Mr. RESCHENTHALER asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to express my condolences on
the recent passing of a true public serv-
ant from my district, Greene County
Sheriff, Brian Tennant. All who knew
Brian will remember his devotion to
our community. He served as a police
officer, emergency medical technician,
and volunteer firefighter. In 2010, Brian
risked his own life to save several oth-
ers during a terrible house fire in
Waynesburg.
Shortly after this heroic act, Brian
learned that he had an inoperable
tumor. Despite this diagnosis and dur-
ing medical treatment, Brian contin-
ued to serve. In 2014, he started his
service as Greene County Sheriff.
Brian fought his illness for years, all
while serving his community. He was a
devoted husband and father of four
sons. I am proud to have met Brian,
and my thoughts and prayers go out to
his loved ones during this difficult
time.

NATIONAL COLORECTAL CANCER
AWARENESS MONTH
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, Wednesday
marked the seventh anniversary of the
death of my father, the late Congress-
man Donald Payne. My father was a
tireless advocate in this House, but he
lost his life to colorectal cancer too
early.
That is why each year I sponsor a
resolution recognizing March as Na-
tional Colorectal Cancer Awareness
Month, a time to educate the public
about the disease and the need for
screening. I introduced that resolution
on Wednesday, the anniversary of the
loss of my father.
I also introduced the Removing Bar-
riers to Colorectal Screening Act, a bi-
partisan bill joined by Representatives
RODNEY DAVIS, DON MCEACHIN, and
DAVID MCKINLEY as co-leads. More
than 100 Members have joined on as co-
sponsors, and I hope the remaining
Members will join as well.
Mr. Speaker, when people use Medi-
care to get colonoscopies, they are hit
with an unexpected bill if polyps are
removed. That is a monetary barrier to
screening, and screening saves lives.
My father, unfortunately, did not get
screened for colorectal cancer. It
wasn’t something that people of his
generation did. But we can honor his
legacy by improving education and re-
moving barriers to screening.

RECOGNIZING COACH MIKE GUZZO
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

marks.)
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Coach Mike
Guzzo of Silver Bay, Minnesota, for im-
pacting the lives of countless young
athletes across the great State of
northern Minnesota.
When Mike and his wife moved back
to his hometown of Silver Bay in 1984,
they thought the move might be tem-
porary. However, not long after his re-
turn, Mike began to coach youth hock-
ey. Arguably it was his most important
role as a coach and mentor that caused
him to stay in Silver Bay for the long
term.
Mike spent over 30 years coaching

State of hockey. At the end of this sea-
son, Mike hung up his skates and whis-
tle and retired. When asked what he
would miss most, Mike said it would be
his players.
Growing up playing the sport of ice
hockey myself, I will always remember
the coaches for whom I played. I have
carried the lessons that they taught
me throughout my adult life.
Coach Guzzo, I thank you for serving
as a role model to these athletes both
on and off the ice. I know from my ex-
perience as a player that they will al-
ways appreciate everything that you
have given to the hockey community.
I also want to thank Coach Guzzo for
his dedication to the Silver Bay com-
munity and rural Minnesota. This com-
munity of Silver Bay matters, and
Coach Guzzo, your life made it better.
Coach Guzzo, to you and your wife, I
wish you a happy, healthy, and long re-

ARI HALBERSTAM AND THE
JEWISH CHILDREN’S MUSEUM
(Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr.
Speaker, in light of the undeniable
spikes in hate speech and hate crimes
and conversations we have had in the
House over the past few days, I rise
today in memory of Ari Halberstam, a
young neighbor of mine whose life was
taken 25 years ago this week when
anti-Semitic hatred morphed into ter-
rorism.
Tragically, on March 6, 1994, Ari
passed away at age 16 due to gunshot
wounds to the head after a terrorist at-
tack on the ramp leading to the Brook-
lyn Bridge.
Mr. Speaker, we must confront ha-
tred in all of its manifestations, be it
anti-Semitic attacks that took our be-
loved Ari’s life or the hate-fueled neo-
Nazi march through Charlottesville
that took the life of Heather Heyer.
Devorah Halberstam, Ari’s mother
and my dear friend, is a crusader for
justice and a forceful advocate in New
York State for the passage of Ari’s Law
as part of a comprehensive gun control
bill prohibiting interstate gun traf-
ficking.
Determined to bring about something
symbolic of resilience, tolerance, and
beauty, in 2004 Ms. Halberstam estab-
lished Brooklyn’s iconic Jewish Chil-
dren’s Museum in my district in mem-
ory of Ari. The award-winning chil-
dren’s museum is Ari’s legacy. It is our
legacy.
The uptick in acts of anti-Semitism
targeting Jewish communities are
truly alarming, but must be con-
fronted. Let us remember that these
acts are in no way reflective of who we
are as a Nation and/or our core values
of tolerance, respect, and human de-
cency.
Let us celebrate Ari’s life and legacy
by coming together in respect, toler-
ance, and, above all else, love.
MOURNING THE LOSS OF KYLE
FORTI
(Mr. BANKS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, it is with a
heavy heart that I rise today to mourn
the loss of my friend, Kyle Forti. A na-
tive of DeKalb County, Kyle was the
epitome of what it means to be a Hoo-
sier. A strong man of faith, he held
deep love for his God, his family, and
his country.
Mr. Speaker, as a young man, Kyle
was one of the first to believe in me as
I began running for public office. He
worked tirelessly to help me advance
the conservative values that we hold
dear. On Sunday, though, Kyle’s life
was tragically cut short after his heli-
copter crashed in northern Kenya.
No amount of words can describe my
pride as I watched Kyle grow and de-
velop into a husband to Hope, a father
to Max, and a successful businessman.
As his mother correctly stated, he
had a passion for humanity and the
human soul. Although he left us too
soon, his love for people and passion for
liberty will serve as an inspiration for
me for the rest of my life.

CONGRATULATING THE NATE
MACK ELEMENTARY AND
GREENSPUN JUNIOR HIGH RO-
BOTICS TEAMS
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was
given permission to address the House

Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, on
behalf of Nevada’s Third Congressional
District, I rise today to congratulate
the robotics teams at Nate Mack Ele-
mentary and Greenspun Junior High
School for advancing to the VEX Glob-
al Robotics Competition.
Nate Mack and Greenspun schools
will be representing Nevada in the
global robotics competition in Louis-
ville, Kentucky, beginning April 27
through May 1.
Though these communities served by
Nate Mack and Greenspun face chal-
lenges, these students will proudly
show the rest of the world the great di-
versity and intellect in Nevada’s Third
District.
On International Women’s Day, it is
only fitting that I recognize that these
teams embrace girl-powered movement
in STEAM and are 50 percent girls.
Just this week, I visited the Nate
Mack and Greenspun teams and talked
to the students about their experience.
I even got to test-drive a robot, which
was pretty cool.
Today, I want to congratulate the
Nate Mack Elementary and Greenspun
Junior High School robotics teams,
thank them on behalf of the people of
Nevada’s Third District for rep-
resenting us at the VEX World Robot-
ics Competition, and wish them the
best of luck.
HONORING DR. FRANCIS GRAHAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. FLORES) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Dr. Francis Graham of
Waco, Texas, who passed away on Jan-
uary 10, 2019.
Frank was born on March 19, 1930, in
Sparta, Wisconsin, to Francis Graham,
Sr., and Theresa Snyder Graham. He
was the second of nine children.
In 1947, at the age of 16, Frank
dropped out of high school and enlisted
in the United States Army Air Corps.
Frank later served in the U.S. Navy
from 1950 to 1954 as a member of an un-
derwater demolition team, a prede-
cessor unit to the Navy SEALs. In 1955,
Frank returned to the Army and served
until 1971, when he retired as a ser-
geant major serving with the Special
Forces.
After he retired from the military,
Frank decided to continue his edu-
cation and obtained his doctorate in
psychology at the University of South-
ern Mississippi in 1976.
In 1982, Frank and his wife, Patricia,
moved to Waco. For over 20 years,
Frank practiced as a psychologist with
the U.S. Department of Veterans Af-
fairs and the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice.
Frank was an active member of the
local Special Forces chapter, the
Woodway Veterans of Foreign Wars,
and was the past president of both the
local American Heart Association and
the Italian Club of Waco. He was also
involved with Saint Jerome’s Catholic
Church and was a Fourth Degree mem-
ber of the Knights of Columbus.
Frank had a variety of hobbies, in-
cluding breeding horses for racing,
traveling, reading, movies, having fam-
ily and friends over for game night, and
being a connoisseur of fine wines and
food.
Frank was also a member of my Mili-
tary Service Academy Review Board,
which assists in selecting candidates
for nomination to our Nation’s service
academies.
Mr. Speaker, Frank’s life was defined
by his service to his family, to our
country, and to our community. He
will be forever remembered as a hus-
band, a father, a grandfather, a vet-
eran, a selfless servant, and a great
friend.
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest
and heartfelt condolences to the Gra-
ham family. We also lift up the family
and friends of Frank Graham in our
prayers.
I have requested that a United States
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol
to honor the life and legacy this hum-
ble servant.
As I close today, I ask all Americans
to continue praying for our country,
for our military, for our veterans, and
for our first responders who keep us
safe at home.

HONORING JACK RESTIVO
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Jack Restivo of Bryan,
Texas, who passed away on March 1,
2019.
Jack was born on July 17, 1925, in
Bryan, Texas, to Andrew and Corrine
Restivo. He was one of 11 children.
Growing up in Bryan, he graduated
from Stephen F. Austin High School
and later attended Texas A&M Univer-
sity in College Station as a member of
the class of 1946.
In 1943, in the midst of World War II,
Jack left Texas A&M to join the United
States Army Air Corps, and he trained
to be an aerial gunner.
He was discharged in 1946 and, soon
thereafter, met the love of his life,
Mary Jo. They married in 1947, and
Jack began his career in the insurance
business in Bryan, Texas. In 1955, he
was promoted and transferred to Waco.
In Waco, Jack later founded A–1 Fire
and Safety Equipment Company. He
and his family continued to grow this
company until Jack retired in 2000.
Jack was active in supporting St.
Louis Catholic Church and Reicher
Catholic High School. Jack was on the
school board of Reicher, and in 1986, he
and Mary Jo received the Cougar
Award for Excellence for their dedica-
tion to this school.
Jack loved spending time with his
family and friends, golfing, traveling
with Mary Jo, and everything related
to Texas A&M. He was a longtime sea-
son ticket holder for Texas A&M foot-
ball, baseball, men’s basketball, and
women’s basketball. He was a member
of the Texas A&M Champions Council,
the Texas A&M Foundation’s Legacy
Society, and an endowed member of the
12th Man Foundation. He also served
on the executive committee of the 12th
Man Foundation.
Mr. Speaker, Jack’s life was defined
by his service to his family, to our
country, to Texas A&M, and to our cen-
tral Texas communities.
He will be forever remembered as a
husband; a father; a grandfather; a
great-grandfather; a veteran; a mentor;
a selfless servant; and a great, great
friend.
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest
and heartfelt condolences to the
Restivo family. We also lift up the fam-
ily and friends of Jack Restivo in our
prayers.
I have requested that a United States
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol
to honor the life and legacy of this
humble servant.
As I close today, I ask all Americans
to continue praying for our country,
for our military men and women who
protect us abroad, for our first respond-
ers who protect us here at home, and
for our veterans.
HONORING JOHN PAUL FRITZ
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor John Paul Fritz of Col-
lege Station, Texas, who passed away
on January 8, 2019.
John Paul was born on August 31,
1989, in Houston, Texas, to John Mark
and Cathy Jane Fritz. He was the
fourth of seven children.
John Paul was known for his love of
the outdoors, whether it was climbing
trees and building forts, or bringing
home animals like rabbits, turtles,
frogs, and snakes.
John Paul was initially
homeschooled but later continued his
education when he joined the United
States Navy on November 9, 2009.
In the Navy, John Paul attended Nu-
clear Field ‘‘A’’ School and Nuclear
Power School. Upon completion of his
training, he was selected as a junior
staff instructor for the modifications
and additions to a reactor facility pro-
totype.
In 2013, John Paul was stationed
aboard the submarine USS Florida and
completed missions that were vital to
our national security.
In 2017, he was selected to become an
instrumentation and control equip-
ment instructor, the final course for
nuclear electronics technicians.
It came as no surprise to anyone who
knew John Paul that he was passionate
about science, specifically chemistry
and nuclear physics.
This last year, during Christmas,
John Paul returned home and built a
heat shield out of several household
items. He and his friends were trying
to develop a new type of efficient rock-
et fuel, and they hoped to start a com-
pany once he retired from the Navy.
John Paul was also known for his
love of his family. He was engaged to
be married this summer, and he dearly
loved his daughter, Madeline Elizabeth
Ann Fritz.
Unfortunately, his time on this
Earth was cut short way too early.
Mr. Speaker, John Paul’s life was de-
fined by his service to his family and to
our country. He will be forever remem-
bered as a father, a sailor, a son, a
brother, and a friend.
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest
and heartfelt condolences to the Fritz
family. We also lift up the family and
friends of John Paul Fritz in our pray-
ers.
I have requested that a United States
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol
to honor the life and legacy of this
young sailor.
As I close today, I urge all Americans
to continue praying for our country,
for our veterans, for our military men
and women who protect us, and for our
first responders who keep us safe at
home.
HONORING RED CASHION
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Red Cashion of College
Station, Texas, who passed away on
February 10, 2019.
Red was born on November 10, 1931, in
College Station on the Texas A&M Uni-
versity campus. His father was the sec-
retary of the YMCA when it was housed
on the campus, and Red welcomed
many Aggies to campus by letting
them ‘‘rent’’ his red wagon as they
moved into the dorms.
After graduating from A&M Consoli-
dated High School in 1949, Red at-
tended Texas A&M University on a
baseball scholarship and graduated in
May 1953.
He was then commissioned as a sec-
ond lieutenant in the United States
Army. Red served in the Army for 4
years, working with the National Secu-
rity Agency, primarily in Washington,
D.C., and at Fort Meade.
During the Cuban Missile Crisis in
1963, he was recalled to Washington,
where he briefed President Kennedy on
the ongoing situation with Cuba.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Red raised his
family in the Brazos Valley and started
a business with his father-in-law and
best friend. Together, they opened Bur-
gess, Cashion & Haddox, which later
became Anco Insurance. For many
years, Red served as chairman emer-
itus at Anco.
Red’s father-in-law got him inter-
ested in officiating football games. Red
began to officiate junior high school
games while still in college, and he
eventually became a line judge for the
National Football League in 1972.
In 1976, Red became a head NFL ref-
eree and ultimately officiated Super
Bowls XX and XXX.
Overall, he served as an official for
the NFL for 25 years, officiating more
than 500 games. He was inducted into
the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1989
and was named the NFL’s Referee As-
sociation Honoree in 2011.
In 2015, he received the Art McNally
Award to recognize exemplary profes-
sionalism, leadership, and commitment
on and off the field.
After his retirement from the field,
Red continued to work as a trainer of
NFL referees and served as the ref-
eree’s voice on John Madden’s video
game, ‘‘Madden NFL.’’
Although Red spent a lot of time
traveling across the United States, he
stayed involved in the Brazos Valley
community. He served as chairman of
the Bryan-College Station Chamber of
Commerce, the Brazos County Indus-
trial Foundation, the Brazos County
Association of Independent Insurance
Agents, and the Region VI Education
Service Center.
In 1972, he was honored with the
Brazos County volunteer award, and in
1994, he received the Brazos County
Citizen of the Year award.
Red was also a bell ringer every holi-
day season with the Salvation Army.
Red was involved with many church-
es in Brazos Valley, first as an elder at
the A&M Presbyterian Church, which
his father helped found. Later, Red was
a deacon at First Baptist Church in
Bryan and, most recently, a member of
the A&M United Methodist Church.
Like most Aggies, Red loved Texas
A&M University. In 1990, Red served as
the campus Muster speaker. He was
also honored in 2003 by being named a
Texas A&M Distinguished Alumni and
has the football official’s locker room
inside Kyle Field named for him. Red
was also later named a Mays Business
School Outstanding Alumni and a Fish
Camp Namesake.

HONORING DR. JAMES EARLE
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Dr. James Earle of Col-
lege Station, Texas, who passed away
on February 4, 2019.
Jim was born on May 2, 1932, in Jack-
sonville, Texas, to Herbert and Edna
Earle. While attending Jacksonville
High School, Jim excelled in sports,
particularly boxing. Jim won many
Golden Gloves titles and earned the
nickname ‘‘The Mangler’’ in high
school. In high school, he also started
drawing caricatures.
After graduating from high school,
Jim attended Texas A&M University,
where he was a member of the Corps of
Cadets. While at Texas A&M, Jim orga-
nized the first boxing club and lettered
in both boxing and track and field.
Jim graduated from Texas A&M in
1954 with a degree in architecture.
Upon graduation, he was commissioned
as a second lieutenant in the United
States Air Force.
While serving in the Air Force, Jim
was stationed at Dyess Air Force Base
in Abilene, Texas. It was at a base
event in the summer of 1957 where he
met his future wife, Theresa. She sat in
front of him for a caricature, and he
said: ‘‘You’re so pretty, I think I’m
going to marry you.’’ They married
just a few months later and raised two
loving daughters. They had been mar-
ried 61 years at the time of his passing.
Jim completed Active Duty in 1957
and returned to Texas A&M to begin
his career as an educator. He began
teaching mechanical drafting to first-
year engineering students. He later be-
came the head of the Engineering De-
sign Graphics Department. In 1964, Jim
earned his Ph.D. in education. He con-
tinued to teach until 1995, when he re-
tired.
Throughout his career, Jim was ac-
tive in the American Society for Engi-
neering Education and held many lead-
ership positions in the Engineering De-
sign Graphics division. From 1986 to
1991, he served as chair of the Annual
Conference Committee of that organi-
zation. He was named professor emer-
itus of Civil Engineering in 1995 and ‘‘A
Legend of Aggieland’’ in 2000.
During his time as a student and pro-
fessor at Texas A&M, Jim created and
drew a beloved cartoon character,
Cadet Slouch. Jim depicted Slouch as
an undergraduate cadet trying to navi-
gate campus life. Topics included class
assignments, the Aggie football team,
and life in the Corps of Cadets. Cadet
Slouch and his friends, Simp, Cedric,
Squirt, and Fish Jethro, were published
in The Battalion, the student news-
paper, from 1955 to 1985.
When drawing Cadet Slouch car-
toons, Jim was often influenced by his
time as a student and, later, as a pro-
fessor. The Cadet Slouch cartoon series
was a commentary on the many
changes going on at Texas A&M, in-
cluding the enrollment of women and
the voluntary participation in the
Corps. Cadet Slouch was beloved by
generations of Aggies while it was pub-
lished.
In addition to the cartoon’s run in
the student newspaper, collections of
Cadet Slouch cartoons were published
in several books.
On a personal note, during my time
at Texas A&M in the mid-seventies, I
always enjoyed reading the Cadet
Slouch cartoon in The Battalion news-
paper.
In 1979, Jim and Theresa started their
own publishing company. Jim wrote
and published drafting workbooks at
affordable prices, which were sold to
more than 125 universities and colleges
across the United States. Many more
high schools used his textbooks to
teach students mechanical drafting.
It was in these workbooks that many
of Jim’s graduate students advanced
their own careers by contributing to
the content of these books. These
books introduced the concepts of tech-
niques of engineering graphics to over
a million students across the country
and around the world. Jim completed
his last workbook, ‘‘Engineering
Graphics Designs,’’ when he was 80
years old.
Jim’s career bridged the gap between
drafting by hand to three-dimensional,
computer-aided design. Jim believed
that one must always adapt to changes
in technology, so he bought a computer
and mastered AutoCAD to the extent
that he was a beta tester for Autodesk.
Nevertheless, he never let technology
cloud the basics of good drafting and
design.
Jim also had an interest in history.
He served as an officer of many histor-
ical societies, including the West-
erners, the National Outlaw and Law-
man Association, the Western Outlaw
and Lawman Association, and the
Texas Gun Collectors Association.
Jim became an expert on many his-
torical figures and published a book in
1988 about Billy the Kid. Through his
publishing company, he worked with
friends to bring stories of western
lawmen and outlaws into reality.
Mr. Speaker, Jim’s life was defined
by his service to his family, to his stu-
dents, to our country, and to Texas
A&M University. He will be forever re-
membered as a husband, a father, a
grandfather, a veteran, an educator, a
mentor, a selfless servant, and a great
friend.
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest
and heartfelt condolences to the Earle
family. We also lift up the family and
friends of Jim Earle in our prayers.
I have requested the United States
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol
to honor the life and legacy of this
humble servant.
As I close, I urge all Americans to
continue praying for our country, for
our veterans, for our military who pro-
tects us, and for our first responders
who keep us safe at home.
HONORING ED BERRY
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Ed Berry of Bryan,
Texas, who passed away on February
24, 2019.
Ed was born on April 22, 1940, in
Waco, Texas, to Ed Berry, Sr., and to
Udis White Berry. He graduated from
Waco High School and attended Texas
A&M University, where he was a mem-
ber of the class of 1962. While at Texas
A&M, Ed was a member of the Corps of
Cadets, where he was a member of
Squadron 4 and, ultimately, the com-
manding officer of Squadron 8. He was
also a member of the Ross Volunteer
Company. He received his degree in
mathematics, and was also in the first

master’s degree in computer science.
On August 31, 1963, he married the

the chairman of the deacons and the
president of the choir.
After graduating from Texas A&M,
Ed went to work at NASA for IBM and
contributed to the Gemini and Apollo

For the last 15 years, Ed worked as a
Realtor. He spent 10 years as the execu-
tive director of the Bryan-College Sta-
tion Association of Realtors. During
his tenure, the association became one
of the top three in the State of Texas.
Mr. Speaker, Ed’s life was defined by
his service to his family, to Texas, to
our country, and to God. He will be for-
ever remembered as a husband, a fa-
ther, a grandfather, a community lead-
er, a selfless servant, and a great
friend.
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest
and heartfelt condolences to the Berry
family. We also lift up the family and
friends of Ed Berry in our prayers.
I have requested the United States
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol
to honor the life and legacy of this
humble servant.
Also, as I close today, I urge all
Americans to continue praying for our
country, for our veterans, for our mili-
tary who protects us, and for our first
responders who keep us safe at home.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
f
ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for the re-
mainder of the hour as the designee of
the minority leader.
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I was
listening to the colloquy earlier. I have
listened to comments here during de-
bate. I have seen comments made in
the media by some of the folks here in
the House over the vote that was
taken, basically, on an anti-hate reso-
lution that was originally intended to
address anti-Semitic remarks that
were made by a Member of the House.
Yet, instead of addressing the anti-
Semitic remarks, it was made a global,
general: Oh, we are against almost all
hate—well, not all hate. Apparently,
not the kind of hate for Republicans
that would cause our minority whip,
STEVE SCALISE, to be shot and almost
killed; not the violence being per-
petrated on supporters of President
Trump, including on college campuses.
But even they, as horrendous as they
were, have no moral equivalence to the
Holocaust.
Expanding the resolution from a sim-
ple condemnation of anti-Jewish, anti-
Semitic remarks to a panoply of other
items—actually attempted to give ev-
erything ever done to anyone, except a
few hate-filled actions, of course—at-
tempting to give them the moral
equivalence of the Holocaust where
none exists, that is tragic.
And then to compound that regret-
table action by the majority in trying
to please everyone, instead of standing
up and calling out anti-Jewish, hate-
filled remarks, biased, bigoted re-
marks, then came here and condemned
those of us who call them out for not
standing up against anti-Semitic re-
marks and accuse us of being hate-
filled because we took a principled
stand against anti-Semitic remarks
that needed to be singularized, needed
to be addressed, needed to be con-
demned.
And not only that, to come in and
also take the occasion to slander
STEVE KING, saying: Well, he should
have been called out 10 years ago.
No allegations, no specifics. Let’s
just generally slap somebody down be-
cause we don’t like them; we don’t like
what they have said.
This is outrageous. This was no place
for any of those actions, any of those
comments, and I deeply regret people
for whom I have had respect who would
come in here and try to draw moral
equivalence to every little action.
Look, I bet most of us—I know a lot
of us have had plenty of death threats.
We have had plenty of nasty comments
made. But we don’t go running to the
media every time somebody threatens
to kill us or somebody makes these
outrageous threats or allegations.
The Holocaust was different. The suf-
fering caused during the years of slav-
ery in the United States really were
unforgivable. It was a horrible thing to
inflict on anybody.
I was shocked to find out here in Feb-
ruary that there are more slaves in the
world today—40 million—than there
have ever been in the world’s existence.
That is horrendous.
We ought to take actions to stamp
out slavery wherever it is, against
whatever race or nationality, what-
ever. It has no place in the world.
But we know what leads to a Holo-
caust, the killing of millions of Jews
simply because they were Jewish. It
starts with maligning comments
against Jews.
At first people will say, you know,
that is really not appropriate. But then
it gets watered down to where, well,
there are a lot of bad comments
against all kinds of people. You know,
we are not for any of those.
And that is where we find ourselves
this week in the House of Representa-
tives. It has started.
People in this body knew which
Members have made anti-Semitic feel-
ings known in the past, so it is kind of
hard to imagine that anybody would
put someone who has espoused very
strong anti-Semitic feelings in the
past, put them on the committee where
they can do the most damage to Israel
and our relationship with Israel and
then act like they had no idea: Let’s
just say that there are problems with
all kinds of hate.
Well, there is a problem with not
calling out the kind of comments that
start the ball rolling toward another
Holocaust.
b 1300
Those of us who believe in the God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and be-
lieve, as it says up here, in that God we
trust, that is the God it is talking
about. That is why Moses, his full face,
is up here in this body, because of the
respect for the moral laws that he
gave.
But there is a danger to any civiliza-
tion, any country, that will not call
out anti-Semitic comments when they
happen. It is not enough to put in lan-
guage so that if you accuse somebody
of anti-Semitic comments because they
have actually made them, but they
happen to be of a certain race or reli-
gion, then you get condemned. They
say, oh, you are against this race, or
you are against this religion, because
you called them down for their anti-Se-
mitic remarks.
That resolution yesterday leaves
that kind of ambivalence out there and
available to people who make anti-Se-
mitic remarks.
It needs to stop. It needs to be called
out before this body loses its moral rel-
evance to make a difference in the
world.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
f
ADJOURNMENT
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I move

ingly (at 1 o’clock and 1 minute p.m.),
under its previous order, the House ad-
journed until Monday, March 11, 2019,
at noon for morning-hour debate.

ERICA BASSETT
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Erica Bassett
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service
Ambassadors for Youth award.
Erica Bassett is a student at Drake Middle
School and received this award because her
determination and hard work have allowed her
to overcome adversities.
The dedication demonstrated by Erica Bas-
sett is exemplary of the type of achievement
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels
strive to make the most of their education and
develop a work ethic which will guide them for
the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Erica Bassett for winning the Arvada Wheat
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
I have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

RECOGNIZING MS. PATSY SQUIRE
HON. TJ COX
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize Ms. Patsy Squire for
her service and dedication to the United
States Postal Service in Corcoran, California.
After thirty-six years of exceptional customer
service and commitment, Ms. Squire will be
retiring.
Ms. Squire began her career at the Post Of-
fice in 1983 and everyone in the community
can attest that she has gone above and be-
yond her daily duties. Ms. Squire is an integral
part of the City of Corcoran and has become
a dear friend to all her customers and col-
leagues. From working as a letter carrier, to
being a friendly face behind the counter, Ms.
Squire has spent close to four decades serv-
ing the people of Corcoran at the Post Office.
Throughout the years, Ms. Squire has seen
children grow up, graduate, get married and
even have children of their own. She has
played an important role in the lives of every-
one in the community and her customers and
colleagues alike will miss her presence dearly.
Ms. Squire plans on spending her well-de-
served retirement working within her home,
golfing, taking road trips, and going hunting
and camping.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in commending and congratulating Ms.
Patsy Squire for her service to the City of Cor-
coran and her retirement from the United
States Postal Service.
HONORING REPRESENTATIVE
WALTER B. JONES, JR.
SPEECH OF
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Ms. DELAURO, Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor late Congressman Walter Jones, Jr.
Farmville, North Carolina is quite a distance
away from my hometown of New Haven, Con-
necticut. But, they are closer than at first ap-
pearance. Both have loving families and hard-
working Americans, dedicated to giving their
children a better life.
Congressman Walter Jones and I may ap-
pear as far apart as Farmville and New
Haven. But in more than two decades together
in this body, it was clear how much we
shared.
We both understood that our faith informs
and motivates what we do and how we vote
in the U.S. Congress.
And we fought side by side and successfully
against the Trans Pacific Partnership on be-
half of working men and women.
Now, Walter and I did not agree on every
point or policy. But the friendship we shared
and the collaboration we achieved is what we
should aspire to in the Congress.
As I have seen in my years here, Members
will always fight for their constituents. But, it is
so much better to be fighting together than
fighting one another.
And, it was an honor to fight alongside Con-
gressman Jones.
He was a man of conviction, a man of faith,
a man of honor and kindness, a gentle man,
who served his constituents and our country
ably.
I will continue to cherish our partnerships,
our victories and our friendship. But, impor-
tantly, I will continue to follow his lead, with re-
gards to compromise and collaboration. May
we all. Then, we can best honor Congressman
Walter Jones, Jr.’s memory.

ZEKARIYA BEARCE
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Zekariya
Bearce for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge
Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
Zekariya Bearce is a student at Mandalay
Middle School and received this award be-
cause his determination and hard work have
allowed him to overcome adversities.
The dedication demonstrated by Zekariya
Bearce is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and
perseverance. It is essential students at all
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will
guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Zekariya Bearce for winning the Arvada Wheat
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
I have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

RECOGNIZING THE 2018–2019 PRINCE
WILLIAM COUNTY PUBLIC
SCHOOLS DIVISION ON OBTAIN-
ING CERTIFICATION OR RECER-
TIFICATION BY THE NATIONAL
BOARD FOR PROFESSIONAL
TEACHING STANDARDS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
congratulate the educators serving in the
Prince William County Public Schools Division
on obtaining certification or recertification by
the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards.
Founded in 1987, the National Board was
established by teachers for teachers as the
premier vehicle for defining and recognizing
accomplished educators. Today, this inde-
pendent nonprofit organization remains dedi-
cated to supporting excellence in education
and is governed by classroom teachers,
school administrators, school board leaders,
governors, state legislators, higher education
officials, teacher union leaders, and business
and community leaders.
A National Board Certification denotes the
most respected professional certification avail-
able in the education field. Obtaining certifi-
cation and completing the renewal process is
a personal and public statement of one’s com-
mitment to the evolution of effective instruction
methods. In order to obtain the distinction,
teachers must display a mastering of the
standards established by the National Board
by successfully completing a rigorous multi-

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1
HON. MARC A. VEASEY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
proud of the passage of H.R. 1—the ’For the
People Act.’ H.R. 1 not only restores faith
back into our elections; it’s a promise that
House Democrats will deliver to the American
public.
Despite what MITCH MCCONNELL says, H.R.
1 is not a ‘‘power grab.’’ It’s a plan to restore
public confidence back into our electoral sys-
tem. It says, in our democracy, everyone’s
voice and vote must count. So again—let’s
recap all the good H.R. 1 will do: it will in-
crease access to the ballot box, end gerry-
mandering, create automatic voter registration;
limit the power of restrictive voter ID laws, and
make critical investments in election infrastruc-
ture and technology.
We all know Republicans have intentionally
rigged our system of free and fair elections in
their favor. Republican governors and state
legislatures across the country have sup-
pressed voting among: communities of color;
poor people; seniors; and people with disabil-
ities, using targeted, racist voting laws.
The right to vote, our most basic democratic
right, is under siege. But today, with the pas-
sage of H.R. 1, we say enough is enough.
We’re putting an end to the Republican culture
of voter intimidation. We are giving power
back to the people.

Lorenzo Becerra is a student at Mandalay

The dedication demonstrated by Lorenzo
Becerra is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and
perseverance. It is essential students at all

cation and develop a work ethic which will
guide them for the rest of their lives.

HONORING AND REMEMBERING
THE LIFE OF JAY A. ARCANGELI
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and remember the life of Jay A.
Arcangeli.
Jay Arcangeli was born on December 11,
1967 in Montour Falls, New York. He grew up
on his family’s dairy farm in Burdett, New
York, where he developed his love for farming.
To many, farming is a full time job. To Jay,
farming was his passion. Jay would finish a
full day of work to come home to his family
and then tend to his cattle and crops. To his
very last day, Jay chased his farming dreams.
Jay was the model of hard work and public
service. By day, Jay served as the Highway
Deputy Superintendent for Schuyler County.
Before taking his current position, Jay served
as the Town of Hector Highway Super-
intendent and before that as the bridge fore-
man for Silverline Construction for over two
decades. In his free time, Jay volunteered with
the Burdett Fire Department. Whether he was
on the clock or not, Jay was serving his com-
munity.
Jay will be remembered as a husband, a fa-
ther, and a friend to many. We salute him now
and stand with his family in somber remem-
brance of his life, his love, and his passions.
I thank him for his service and pray he will
rest in peace.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
remember the life of Jay Arcangeli.
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 6, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 1) to expand
Americans’ access to the ballot box, reduce
the influence of big money in politics, and
strengthen ethics rules for public servants,
and for other purposes:
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise
today to voice my support for H.R. 1—The For
The People Act of 2019. This once in a gen-
eration legislation will increase access to the
ballot box, end gerrymandering, and limit the
influence of big money in politics. This essen-
tially is a down payment on a promise to the
American public to create tangible voting re-
form, to eliminate discriminatory voting laws,
and to make critical investments in election in-
frastructure and technology.
Voting is an integral part of our democracy,
as elections are the method in which America
chooses its elected officials and what it de-
sires from its government. We are currently
enduring a time in which the right to vote is in-
creasingly under siege. Decision makers
across the country have worked to suppress
voting in communities of color, and among
poor people, seniors, and people with disabil-
ities using targeted, racist voting laws. They
have intentionally rigged our system of free
and fair elections in their favor.
In my home state of Texas, strict identifica-
tion laws that largely penalize African-Amer-
ican, Hispanic and Native American voters
have been enacted. Texas even went so far
as imposing voter ID requirements and restric-
tions on college students, a prominent voting
bloc in local and national elections. Closed
and changed polling locations, inoperable vot-
ing machines, and unavailable translators in
immigrant-heavy communities have also con-
tributed to voter confusion.
Needless to say, we need to counter this
culture of voter intimidation. Simultaneously,
we must also invest in technological advance-
ments and repeal discriminatory voting laws.
In order to do this, we must restore public
confidence that everyone’s vote and voice
counts. I urge my colleagues to support this
bill.

RECOGNIZING THE 2019 OCCOQUAN-
WOODBRIDGE-LORTON VOLUN-
TEER FIRE DEPARTMENT OFFI-
CERS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the incoming 2019 officers of the
Occoquan-Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer Fire
Department. OWLVFD is located in Prince
William County, Virginia, 25 miles from our
Nation’s Capital. The OWLVFD goes on an
average of 20,000 runs per year, aiding
80,000 residents in a 27 square mile area.
Incorporated in the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia in 1938, the OWLVFD is comprised of
committed community members who volunteer
their time, energy, and financial resources to
ensure the safety of the families and property
in and around Woodbridge. During its 80 year
history, the Department has continued to ex-
pand and there are now three stations staffed
by approximately 250 volunteers who serve
and protect an ever-growing local population.
From their bravery in action to their presence
with the youth in the community, OWLVFD is
readily available for the families of
Woodbridge.
It is with great honor I include in the
RECORD the names of the following Occoquan-
Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer Fire Department
Officers:
Department President—Dave Williams.
Department Chief—James McAllister.
Executive Vice President—George Smith.
Membership Secretary—Scott Shaw.
Board of Directors—Michelle Bauer, Kevin
Lewis, Melissa Payne, Rebecca Barnes, Zach
Wessolleck, Jonathan Baldwin, Michael Clark,
Anna Smith.
Election Officer—Sabrina Brandon Ricks.
Treasurer—Debbie Haight.
Sergeant-At-Arms—Rick Moore.
Assistant Chiefs—Kurt Bolland, Ernest
DeSantis, Steve Godin, Wayne Haight, Rick
Michaels.
Rescue Chief—Ed Craig.
Fire Captains—Ben New, Justin Witt.
Rescue Captain—Stephanie Powers.
While a new executive board has been
elected and new officers sworn in, the mission
of OWLVFD remains the same. The volun-
teers of the OWLVFD continue to put them-
selves in harm’s way for the benefit of the
residents of the area and have educated and
mentored the youth in Woodbridge, not only
teaching fire safety education, but also
strengthening community relations.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in recognizing the men and women of
the Occoquan-Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer
Fire Department for their service to our coun-
try and steadfast commitment to their commu-
nity and in congratulating the newly-elected of-
ficers and board members. I thank them for
their dedication and to all I say: ‘‘Stay safe.’’

COMMEMORATING 54TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY,
TURNAROUND TUESDAY, AND
THE FINAL MARCH FROM SELMA
TO MONTGOMERY
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, fifty-
four years ago, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds
of heroic souls risked their lives for freedom
and to secure the right to vote for all Ameri-
cans by their participation in marches for vot-
ing rights on ‘‘Bloody Sunday,’’ ‘‘Turnaround
Tuesday,’’ or the final, completed march—from
Selma to Montgomery.
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, brave and
determined men and women, boys and girls,
persons of all races and creeds, loved their
country so much that they were willing to risk
their lives to make it better, to bring it even
closer to its founding ideals.
The foot soldiers marched because they be-
lieved that all persons have dignity and the
right to equal treatment under the law, and in
the making of the laws, which is the funda-
mental essence of the right to vote.
On March 15, 1965, before a joint session
of the Congress and the eyes of the nation,
President Lyndon Johnson explained to the
nation the significance of ‘‘Bloody Sunday’’:
I speak tonight for the dignity of man and
the destiny of democracy. . . .
At times history and fate meet at a single
time in a single place to shape a turning
point in man’s unending search for freedom.
So it was at Lexington and Concord.
So it was a century ago at Appomattox.
So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.
The previous Sunday, March 7, 1965, more
than 600 civil rights demonstrators, including
our beloved colleague, Congressman JOHN
LEWIS of Georgia, were brutally attacked by
state and local police at the Edmund Pettus
Bridge as they marched from Selma to Mont-
gomery in support of the right to vote.
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ was a defining moment in
American history because it crystallized for the
nation the necessity of enacting a strong and
effective federal law to protect the right to vote
of every American.
No one who witnessed the violence and
brutally suffered by the foot soldiers for justice
who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge
will ever forget it; the images are deeply
seared in the American memory and experi-
ence.
Madam Speaker, what is so moving, heroic,
and awe-inspiring is that the foot soldiers of
Selma faced their heavily armed adversaries
fortified only by their love for their country and
for each other and their audacious faith in a
righteous cause.
The example set by the foot soldiers of
Selma showed everyone, here in America and
around the world, that there is no force on
earth as powerful as an idea whose time has
come.
These great but nameless persons won the
Battle of Selma and helped redeem the great-
est nation on earth.
But we should not forget that the victory
came at great cost and that many good and
dear persons lost their lives to win for others
the right to vote.
Men like Jimmy Lee Jackson, who was shot
by a Alabama state trooper as he tried to pro-
tect his mother and grandmother from being
beaten for participating in a peaceful voting
rights march in Marion, Alabama.
Women like Viola Liuzzo, a housewife and
mother of five, who had journeyed to Selma
from Detroit to join the protests after wit-
nessing on television the events at Edmund
Pettus Bridge on ‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ and who
was shot and killed by Klansmen while driving
back from a trip shuttling fellow voting rights
marchers to the Montgomery airport.
Persons of faith, goodwill, and non-violence
like the Reverend James Reeb of Boston, a
minister from Boston who heeded the call of
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to come
to Selma and who succumbed to the head in-
juries he suffered at the hands of his white su-
premacists attackers on March 9, two days
after ‘‘Bloody Sunday.’’
Madam Speaker, in the face of unspeakable
hostility, violence, brutality, and hatred, the
foot soldiers of Selma would not be deterred—
would not be moved—would not be turned
around.
They kept their eyes on the prize and held
on.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E274 March 8, 2019
And help came the very next week when
President Johnson announced to the nation
that he would send to Congress for immediate
action a law designed to eliminate illegal bar-
riers to the right to vote by striking down ‘‘re-
strictions to voting in all elections—Federal,
State, and local—which have been used to
deny Negroes the right to vote.’’
On Adjust 6, 1965, that legislation—the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965—was signed into law
by President Johnson and for the next 48
years did more to expand our democracy and
empower racial and language minorities than
any act of government since the Emancipation
Proclamation and adoption of the Civil War
Amendments.
But our work is not done; the dreams of Dr.
King and of all those who gave their lives in
the struggle for justice are not behind us but
still before us.
Madam Speaker, in the wake of the Su-
preme Court’s 2013 ruling in Shelby County v.
Holder, which severely crippled the Voting
Rights Act, we have seen many states across
our nation move to enact legislation designed
to limit the ability of women, the elderly, and
racial and language minorities to exercise their
right to vote.
To honor the memory of the foot soldiers of
Selma, we must rededicate ourselves to a
great task remaining before us—to repair the
damage done to the Voting Rights Act by
working to pass H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act of 2019, which I am proud to
be one of the original co-sponsors.
As I have stated many times, the 1965 Vot-
ing Rights Act is no ordinary piece of legisla-
tion.
For millions of Americans, and for many in
Congress, it is a sacred treasure, earned by
the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordi-
nary Americans who showed the world it was
possible to accomplish extraordinary things.
As we remember and honor the foot sol-
diers of Selma, let us resolve also to restore
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, so that it re-
mains a lasting monument to their heroism
and devotion to the country they loved.

COMMEMORATING THE TWO HUN-
DREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
FIRST STEUBEN COUNTY FAIR
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the two hundredth anniversary
of the first Steuben County Fair.
In Steuben County we are proud of our
farmers and the hard work they do. The Steu-
ben County Fair is a celebration of that hard
work and an opportunity for friends and neigh-
bors to come together to join in the festivities.
The County Agricultural Society held their
first ever countywide fair in 1819. This would
be the first of many festivals that would come
to be known as the Steuben County Fair. The
creation of the new Steuben County Agricul-
tural Society in 1853 led to the establishment
of an annual county fair. The following year
marked the first time the fair was held at its
current site and by 1862 the Agricultural Soci-
ety had purchased the fairgrounds to ensure
the longevity and continuity of the event. As
the years have gone by, the fairgrounds have
added fair houses, grandstands, a Judges
Hall, and even a pioneer log cabin—each ad-
dition enhancing the experience for visitors
and participants of the fair.
The Steuben County Fair holds a special
place in my heart. I have many fond memories
of going to the fair with my mother and eleven
older siblings as we grew up in Corning and
I’m glad to share this tradition with my son
and daughter today. Everyone in our family
has a part of the fair they like best, but the fa-
mous demolition derby has always been my
favorite event and I make sure not to miss it.
Two hundred years of community tradition is
certainly a cause for celebration. I congratu-
late the Steuben County Agricultural Society
on this impressive milestone and look forward
to many more fairs in the years to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of the
Steuben County Fair.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1, THE FOR
THE PEOPLE ACT
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in support of H.R. 1, The For the
People Act.
In November, Americans took to the polls to
make their voices heard—and this Democratic
Congress has heard them, loud and clear.
H.R. 1 will implement common-sense meas-
ures to give Congress and our elections more
transparency.
It’s long been said that sunshine is the
greatest disinfectant.
We need to limit the influence of money in
our politics and make critical updates to our
campaign finance laws.
We need to make sure that voters elect
their representatives and not the other way
around.
We need to give every American a seat at
the table, so we can drive progress for every
family in every community.
H.R. 1 does all these things and more.
It expands access at the ballot box by ad-
dressing systemic and institutional barriers to
voting.
It prohibits voter roll purges and ends par-
tisan gerrymandering.
It expands early and absentee voting.
It also protects our elections systems from
attack.
I am also proud that H.R. 1 lays the ground-
work for H.R. 4, The Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act, which will restore the VRA’s
preclearance provision.
Madam Speaker, voting is the very corner-
stone of our democracy. And THIS is what
Democracy looks like.

CULTURAL COMPETENCY OF POLL
WORKERS AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1

I represent New York’s 6th district in

Poll workers are a crucial component to
elections at every level of our democracy.
These individuals check with voters to verify
information and either hand voters a ballot or
direct individuals to a voting machine. They
ensure order and efficiency on Election Day.
My amendment requires that poll worker
manuals contain cultural competency training
information. Those who work our polls will
learn strategies to help voters who come from
diverse backgrounds, live with disabilities, or
have limited English proficiency—regardless of
gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
Cultural competency training will decrease
congestion at the voting booth and ensure that
all voters are able to participate in our democ-
racy to the fullest.
I thank my colleagues Representative CHU,
Representative GRIJALVA, and Representative
PRESSLEY for co-sponsoring this amendment
with me. I look forward to continuing my work
on the expansion of voting rights in the 116th
Congress.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Mary Berna-
dette Chambers for receiving the Arvada
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth
award.
Mary Bernadette Chambers is a student at
Standley Lake High School and received this
award because her determination and hard
work have allowed her to overcome adversi-
ties.
The dedication demonstrated by Mary Ber-
nadette Chambers is exemplary of the type of
achievement that can be attained with hard
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of
their education and develop a work ethic
which will guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to Mary
Bernadette Chambers for winning the Arvada

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF
RICHARD CHISOLM
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the life of Richard
Chisolm, who passed away on Monday, March
4th.
Richard, originally from Meridian, Mis-
sissippi, joined the Marine Corps as soon as
he graduated high school. He served our
country for four years before retiring. It was
during this time he married his high school
sweetheart, Diane Chisolm.
Upon retiring from the Marine Corps, Rich-
ard was employed by Mississippi Power and
moved to my home town Union, Mississippi.
This is where Richard planted his roots and
became involved in the community around
him. He became a Boy Scout leader, helping
many young men including myself, become an
Eagle Scout. Richard was an avid outdoors-
man, spending as much time as he could bass
fishing and playing softball. It was through
Richard’s example, so many young men knew
how to be devoted to their country, family,
work and community.
Richard was a great community leader and
very formative in the lives of many young men
through being a scoutmaster of Troop 29 in
Union. He was a great mentor and taught us
as Scouts, the value of God, community, and
country. He lived the core values of the Boy
Scouts and Marine Corps and developed all
his Scouts to observe the same values and to
learn leadership skills to be community lead-
ers of the future. I have no doubt that I am a
sitting Member of Congress because of the
values instilled in me by my beloved Scout-
master Richard Chisolm. There is no way to
quantify the countless lives Richard impacted
through his leadership.
Richard was preceded in death by his wife,
Diane Chisolm and son, my friend and Scout,
Robby Chisolm. Richard leaves behind his two
daughters, Tammy Livingston and Melissa
Dienheart, along with four grandchildren and
four great grandchildren. Richard was loved by
all that knew him. Semper Fi my friend, you
will be missed.

Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Vienna Business Association
(VBA) and to congratulate the incoming mem-
bers of the 2019 Board of Directors.
Vienna is known for its local charm and
strong small business community. Money

States. The vibrant community spirit exhibited
by its residents and local businesses has fos-
tered an exceptional quality of life that is cher-
ished by so many.
The Vienna Business Association is the
voice of the greater Vienna business commu-
nity. It promotes business opportunities and
development through networking and in-
creased interaction between the commercial
and residential communities within the town.
Its members help maintain Vienna’s small
town feel by hosting and supporting many an-
nual community events.
The VBA has thrived thanks to the diversity
of its members and the leadership of its
Board.
I am pleased to include in the RECORD the
following names of the incoming members of
the 2019 Board of Directors:
Incoming Chairman: Mark Sweeney.
Incoming Board Members: Ann Cole, Kari
Cannistraro, Michael Amouri, Karen Thayer,
Bettina Lawton, Preeti Swaminathan, Jeff
Bollettino, Greg Kunstbeck, Tim Fricker, Holly
Siebold.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in congratulating the incoming board
members and in commending the Vienna
Business Association for their commitment to
promoting the business community while en-
couraging social responsibility. I wish them
continued success in all their future endeav-
ors.

INTRODUCTION OF THE LET EV-

PORTUNITIES FOR NATIONAL
SERVICE ACT
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, the Amer-
ican Legion is the largest veterans service or-
ganization in the United States. Originally
chartered and incorporated by Congress in
1919, the American Legion has consistently
advocated for our nation’s servicemembers
and their families for 100 years. In that time,
the American Legion has fostered a commu-
nity of support for our men and women who
have served in the Armed Forces.
Currently, only veterans who served during
formally recognized periods of hostilities are
eligible to join the Legion. Therefore, I am in-
troducing the bipartisan LEGION Act, which
will enable all veterans who have fought for
our country to join and enjoy the benefits of
the American Legion. Specifically, the bill ex-
pands membership eligibility to veterans who
have served honorably in unrecognized peri-
ods of conflict since World War II. This bill rec-
ognizes and thanks our brave servicemembers
and veterans for their service to our country.

HONORING STEVE SANDERS
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
honor Steve Sanders of The Woodlands,
Texas in recognition of his dedication and
service to our community and the State of
Texas.
This marks the 25th year that Steve has
worked with The Woodlands Chamber of
Commerce. In this capacity, Steve has labored
tirelessly to promote the local businesses of
The Woodlands and developed leadership
projects within the community.
In addition to his distinguished service to the
Chamber of Commerce, Steve has dedicated
his life to the well-being of others through his
work as a healthcare professional. For 32
years, Steve worked with the Memorial Her-
mann Health System (MHHS) to strengthen
the medical community’s commitment to and
treatment of patients. 20 of those years were
spent serving as CEO of the Memorial Her-
mann Southeast Hospital, where he was rec-
ognized for his exceptional leadership in gen-
erating grassroots activity and was presented
the Grassroots Champion Award for Texas.
Steve has also served on several non-profit
boards in our community and has spear-
headed many successful charity events. In
recognition of his efforts, Steve has been the
recipient of the Citizen of the Year Award, the
Martin Luther King Drum Major Award, the
Home Town Hero of The Woodlands Award,
and the Interfaith of The Woodlands Service of
Excellence Award for Health—all prestigious
and distinguished honors that demonstrate his
commitment to his community.
During his years spent in the medical field,
Steve developed a deep understanding of the
challenges faced by cancer survivors—both in
our community and across the nation. This in-
spired him to cultivate ‘‘The Canopy’’, the fore-
most cancer survivorship center in the Hous-
ton area. This development offers a wide vari-
ety of programs and services designed specifi-
cally for cancer survivors and their families to
address their emotional, physical, and social
needs. The Canopy is a revolutionary, innova-
tive center that offers free services to those in
need while educating the public on the signs
of cancer and how to reduce its risks—all of
this simply would not have been possible with-
out Steve’s passion, vision, and guidance.
Steve Sanders is someone The Woodlands
is incredibly proud to call one of our own.
Though his career has been a long and suc-
cessful one, what I most admire in Steve is his
deep passion for helping others and empow-
ering those in and around any community with
whom he is associated. On behalf of the
Eighth Congressional District of Texas, I want
to thank Steve for all he does for our commu-
nity and for our country.

IN RECOGNITION OF PASSAGE OF
THE HOUSE RESOLUTION
AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM, BIG-
OTRY AND HATRED
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York.
Madam Speaker, today, Congress made clear
that there is no place for anti-Semitic, anti-
Muslim, or any other hate-based rhetoric in
America. In doing so, we are echoing the
words of George Washington who pledged to
the Jewish community in Newport, Rhode Is-
land, that ‘the Government of the United
States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to
persecution no assistance, requires only that
they who live under its protection should de-
mean themselves as good citizens, in giving it
on all occasions their effectual support.’
The language of anti-Semitism is often sub-
tle, but it is very painful to Jewish Americans:
they hear the implied threat and the ‘othering’
of them as Americans. We all must be mindful
of the impact of our words. All hatred on the
basis of religion is abhorrent, including the
suggestion that all Muslims are terrorists or
that Catholics owe allegiance to the Pope, ac-
cusations that have tarnished our political dis-
course in recent memory.
We are currently witnessing an alarming
spike in anti-Semitic rhetoric and hate crimes.
Just a few months ago, we witnessed the
deadliest attack on American Jews in our na-
tion’s long history, with 11 worshippers mur-
dered while praying at Tree of Life Synagogue
in Pittsburgh. In my community in New York
City, we’ve had a 72 percent increase in hate
crimes against Jews with Jewish men being
attacked and beaten on the street; schools
and walls defaced with Nazi symbolism; and
synagogues vandalized. Elsewhere in the
U.S., attacks on Jews are growing.
Last year, we heard the shameful chants of
white supremacists in Charlottesville saying,
‘Jews will not replace us.’ Recently, we’ve
heard the suggestion that Israel hypnotizes
the world into overlooking its actions. We’ve
heard that pro-Israel groups purchase U.S.
support for Israel, as if the only reason Amer-
ican politicians would support Israel is cam-
paign contributions and not because of our
shared values and interests. We’ve heard the
ancient anti-Semitic trope of dual loyalties—
one that goes back thousands of years.
Words and ideas lead to action. Anti-Semitic
language and hate-filled rhetoric have no
place in this country and must be condemned
in the strongest possible terms, which is why
I was proud to join my colleagues in voting for
today’ s resolution.
But we also need to be proactive, and not
just reactive, in our fight to combat hate and
anti-Semitism, which is why I have introduced
the Never Again Education Act, H.R. 943, so
that all Americans can learn about the Holo-
caust and the impact of anti-Semitism. We
must do everything we can to eliminate anti-
Semitism in the United States.
f
RECOGNIZING THE VIETNAM VET-
ERANS OF AMERICA, CHAPTER 17
HON. SUSIE LEE
OF NEVADA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and honor the Vietnam
Veterans of America (VVA) from Chapter 17 in
Las Vegas, Nevada.
I foremost acknowledge their service to our
country as veterans of one of the nation’s
deadliest wars. These brave men and women
answered our nation’s call to serve without
hesitation and with the utmost commitment to
service and country. Upon returning from this
war, they continued their service to their broth-
ers and sisters in arms by becoming active
members of the Vietnam Veterans of America.
VVA members in southern Nevada and
across the country are dedicated to improving
their communities and the lives of their fellow
veterans. From supplying wheelchairs to Las
Vegas area veterans with disabilities, to pro-
viding countless resources to homeless vet-
erans—including job training, providing show-
ers and haircuts, VVA goes above and beyond
in serving their community. They also advo-
cate for their fellow returning service mem-
bers, helping them with Department of Vet-
erans Administration disability claims and ap-
peals assistance. These forms of aid are the
bedrock of their continued commitment to
service of both community and their fellow vet-
erans.
Their duty to serving their country is unwav-
ering, and our duty to them is as well. We all
are responsible to care for every veteran and
servicemember as they have cared for us. No
veteran should be without adequate health
care, housing, or employment. Health benefits
need to extend to mental health services and
suicide prevention, along with benefits for Viet-
nam veterans suffering from the effects of
Agent Orange. After service, veterans become
teachers, police officers, mechanics, and
more, which requires the best job training and
education to set them up for success. This is
our duty as citizens and elected officials, and
we must do our best to uphold our end of the
deal.
The positive impact and influence of the
VVA Chapter 17 extends as far as the moun-
tains that encircle the Las Vegas Valley and
as close as the lives they touch through their
public works. In an area with a population of
hundreds of thousands of veterans, we should
be so lucky to count these individuals amongst
our friends and advocates.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing VVA Chapter 17 for their commitment to
service, to country, and to improving the lives
of countless veterans of the Las Vegas Valley.
RECOGNIZING THE 50TH
ANNIVERSARY OF LEIDOS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Chairman/CEO Roger Krone and
the 32,000 employees of Leidos on the occa-
sion of the company’s 50th anniversary.
Founded in 1969 by Dr. J. Robert Beyster
as Science Applications Incorporated (SAl),
the company that would become Leidos was a
result of Dr. Beyster’s lifelong commitment to
innovation. Born in Detroit, Michigan in 1924
and raised in the midst of the Great Depres-
sion, Dr. Beyster watched as his family strug-
gled through incredible hardships to provide
for themselves. He joined the Navy after grad-
uating from high school and served on a de-
stroyer during World War II. With the help of
the GI Bill, he attended the University of Michi-
gan after his naval career and earned several
degrees, including his Ph.D. in nuclear physics
in 1950.
After earning his doctorate, Dr. Beyster
spent five years working at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory before spending a dozen
years with General Atomics in San Diego. His
time there came to an end shortly after Gulf
Oil acquired General Atomics. Dr. Beyster felt
that senior management had little interest in
the research his department was performing.
He resolved to create a company where that
would never be the case and which nurtured
a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.
That vision led to the creation of SAI, which
changed its name to SAIC in 1984.
I served as Director of Community Relations
for SAIC from 2002 to 2008 and will always
remember fondly my time with the company. I
was pleased to be present in Congress in
2009 when SAIC made the decision to relo-
cate its headquarters from San Diego to my
district in Tysons. I’m not sure anyone, includ-
ing Dr. Beyster, could have foreseen the
growth that this company would experience.
What began as a $50,000 loan with Dr.
Beyster’s house as collateral has evolved into
a $7 billion Fortune 500 powerhouse. In 2013,
SAIC bifurcated its company into two entities;
Leidos, the solutions-focused parent company
and a services business spin-off which carried
on the SAIC name. I am confident that both of
these companies will continue the fine legacy
that has been left by Dr. Beyster, Roger Krone
and so many others over the last 50 years.
The impact of Leidos and SAIC is not solely
confined to a profit margin or a balance sheet.
Both companies have received numerous ac-
colades for their work in their communities, in-
cluding being named one of the Best Places
to Work by the Human Rights Campaign in
2017, receiving an Annual Corporate Equality
Index Score of 100 percent and being named
one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by
the Ethisphere Institute just last year. When I
served as Director of Community Relations, I
saw firsthand the engagement in and care for
the community that SAIC/Leidos exhibited.
The community was not merely where their fa-
cilities were located; it was their home and
they treated it accordingly. We could all stand
to learn from their example.

COMMEMORATING 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF PASTOR MICHAEL
PENDER’S PASTORSHIP OF
FALLBROOK CHURCH IN HOUS-
TON, TEXAS
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 8, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, this
weekend I will have the pleasure and honor of
paying tribute to Pastor Michael Pender on the
25th anniversary of his having assumed the
pastorship of Fallbrook Church in Houston,
Texas.
I include in the RECORD my remarks pre-
pared for delivery at the Pastoral Appreciation
Weekend event that will be held at the Wood-
lands Waterway Marriott Hotel and Convention
Center.
I am Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,
representing the 18th district of Texas.
It is a pleasure to speak to you all for the
Fallbrook Church 25th Pastoral Appreciation
Weekend and to honor Pastor Michael
Pender for his commitment to not only this
community but this congregation.
In 1994, Pastor Michael was just beginning
to form what is now Fallbrook Church.
Pastor Michael’s leadership and obedience
to God has created a church that began with
just four families and is now serving thou-
sands of members every Sunday.
Fallbrook Church is committed to reach-
ing the community and has formed partner-
ships with multiple organizations in order to
continue to spread positive service and influ-
ence to the community.
Spring, Aldine and Klein school districts,
the national Prison Fellowship, Compassion
International Ministry, and most recently,
Lone Star College are just a few examples of
how influential Fallbrook and Pastor Mi-
chael have been to this community.
It warms my heart to see such a servant of
God that leads with such obedience, focus,
and dedication to this ministry.
I would also like to take this time to rec-
ognize Michael’s beautiful wife of almost 32
years, Janice and their four lovely children
Bailee, Michael Jr., Arnelle, and Colin.
I applaud everything that this ministry is
doing, and I congratulate Pastor Michael
Pender on his 25 years of service and leader-
ship.
Thank you so much for giving me the op-
portunity to speak before you today.
