The House met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,
December 4, 2019.
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on
this day.
NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by
the majority and minority leaders for
morning-hour debate.
The Chair will alternate recognition
between the parties. All time shall be
equally allocated between the parties,
and in no event shall debate continue
beyond 11:50 a.m. Each Member, other
than the majority and minority leaders
and the minority whip, shall be limited

LONG-OVERDUE FEDERAL BENE-
FITS FOR THE LUMBEE TRIBE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, at 2 p.m. today, the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources Sub-
committee for Indigenous Peoples of
the United States will hear the Lumbee
Recognition Act, which would afford
the Lumbee Tribe long-overdue Federal
benefits. Although the Federal Govern-
ment provided partial recognition to
the Tribe in 1956, the Lumbee remain
excluded from Federal benefits and
legal status.
This bill is no symbolic gesture. No
other recognized Tribe is denied the
right to self-government and sov-
ereignty. Full recognition will finally
allow the 55,000 Lumbee I represent to
have fair access to the benefits and
programs available to all other recog-
nized Tribes.
As a State senator, I sponsored legis-
lation to clarify the status of the
Lumbee as a State-recognized Tribe to
ensure access to appropriate grants and
programs. Now, I am proud, as a United
States Congressman, to continue to
fight for the Lumbee Tribe on the Fed-
eral level. In fact, cosponsoring this
crucial legislation was one of my first
official acts in Congress.
I applaud my colleagues, Representa-
tives BUTTERFIELD and HUDSON, for in-
troducing this important legislation to
right this fundamentally unfair wrong.
I look forward to casting my vote on
the House floor to give the Lumbee the
recognition they so rightfully deserve.
f
HONORING THE SERVICE OF
MAYOR C. BRUCE ROSE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD) for 5
minutes.
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor my friend of more
than 40 years, Mayor C. Bruce Rose.
Tomorrow, the city of Wilson, North
Carolina, will pause to observe Bruce
Rose Day and will rename the Head-
quarters Fire Station to the C. Bruce
Rose Headquarters Station, recog-
nizing 60 long years of continuous serv-
ice to our city.
Mr. Speaker, Mayor Rose graduated
from Charles L. Coon High School and
received an associate degree in applied
science in fire science technology from
Wilson Technical Community College.
He also proudly served our country in
the United States Army for 2 years.
Mayor Rose served for 30 years with
the Wilson Fire Department, 7 of which
he served as fire chief. He attended fire
schools throughout North Carolina,
Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, in-
cluding the National Fire Academy in
Emmitsburg, Maryland. He is a grad-
uate of the Executive Development
Course of Chief Fire Officers in Em-
mitsburg.
Mayor Rose is a life member of the
North Carolina Association of Fire
Chiefs and served on its board of direc-
tors for 4 years. He is also a life mem-
ber of the North Carolina Association
of Retired Fire Chiefs and served, by
appointment of Governor James B.
Hunt, on the North Carolina Fire Com-
mission. Mayor Rose received the 1999
Governor’s Award for Outstanding Vol-
unteer Service.
Mayor Rose continued to serve as a
goodwill ambassador for the city of
Wilson as he was elected mayor, begin-
ning in 1992. He has been proud to cele-
brate the progress of the city through
events such as ribbon cuttings and
groundbreakings and presentations of
proclamations. He speaks at commu-
nity events, works to bring industries
into the city, and has worked dili-
gently to see the city community
thrive.
He is especially proud of the
Whirlygig project, which is bringing
economic development to our city.
Under his leadership, an $18 million
surface transportation project is now
in progress in the eastern section of
our city, which is the African Amer-
ican community. The city invested $2
million into this project; the North
Carolina Department of Transportation
invested $6 million; and, with my as-
sistance, the city received a TIGER
grant, under Secretary Anthony Fox,
of $10 million for the project.
During his tenure, Mayor Rose has
been involved in several projects and

initiatives, such as creation of the
Buckhorn Reservoir and Greenlight
Community Broadband, which is a mu-
nicipal broadband, and it is successful.
He has been Wilson’s longest serving
mayor, after serving 27, nearly 28, con-
secutive years and eight consecutive
terms.
Mayor Rose is a lifetime member of
Wilson First Pentecostal Holiness
Church, where he served as deacon and
Sunday school superintendent.
He is married to Rebecca Davis Rose.
They continue to be active in our com-
munity and involved in church func-
tions throughout the city. Mayor Rose,
Mr. Speaker, is father to four children
and one delightful grandchild.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
join me today in congratulating and
honoring my friend, Mayor C. Bruce
Rose, as he is recognized for 60—I will
repeat that again, 60—consecutive
years of unselfish service to the city of
Wilson, North Carolina. The contribu-
tions of Mayor Rose to the city cannot
be overstated.
f
SECOND AMENDMENT WEEK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this
week is Second Amendment Week in
our office to celebrate our God-given
right to keep and bear arms.
Each year at the start of the hunting
season, I can’t wait to get out in the
field and enjoy one of my very favorite
pastimes. Hunting is an American tra-
dition shared across generations; and
this Thanksgiving weekend I was able
to sneak away with my oldest son to go
duck hunting near our home in Great
Bend.
Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you, I
have never seen so many ducks. The
folks at D.U., all the conservation
groups are doing an incredible job.
Many Kansans use firearms for hunt-
ing, but also, in many of our most rural
parts of the State, carrying a firearm
can be the difference between life and
death. In over 70 counties in Kansas,
the closest law enforcement officer is
often 30 minutes to an hour away; and,
thus, you may need a firearm to pro-
tect yourself, your loved ones, and
your property.
In both rural and urban areas, many
Kansans responsibly open or conceal
carry on a daily basis for self-defense.
Many more Kansans keep a gun for
home defense as well, maybe locked
away in a master bedroom or in a safe
down in the basement.
Whether it be a handgun, rifle, or
shotgun, whatever a citizen’s firearm
of choice, the right to defend ourselves
must not be infringed upon. As I rep-
resent Kansas in Congress, I remain
staunchly opposed to any laws restrict-
ing what kind of firearms a law-abiding
citizen can buy or keep in their posses-
sion.
Any politician trying to implement
mandatory buyback programs, which I
really call gun confiscations, or uncon-
stitutional red flag laws in Congress
will be met with a groundswell of oppo-
sition because these types of laws vio-
late our Second Amendment rights.
In Congress, we need to keep fighting
for programs that address the under-
lying cause of gun violence, which is
mental illness, to reach out to those
who are struggling so they can get the
proper care and attention early so they
don’t fall through the cracks and harm
themselves or others.
We also need to make sure our exist-
ing background check system is work-
ing properly to continue to prevent
tragedies, while not infringing on the
rights of mentally stable, law-abiding
citizens.
The solutions to preventing gun vio-
lence can be found at dinner tables, in
our churches, and in our communities.
Individually, we must practice and pro-
mote responsible gun ownership while
collectively ensuring every law-abiding
citizen’s Second Amendment right is
upheld with due process.
Gun ownership and hunting have
been a tradition for my family and for
this great land for many generations,
each one passing on their knowledge
and skills to the next. That is our way
of life in Kansas. We must continue to
uphold it and our constitutional right
to keep and bear arms for the purpose
of self-defense and individual freedom.
PASS USMCA NOW
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, today
marks more than 1 year since Presi-
dent Trump signed the USMCA trade
agreement, and it is still collecting
dust on Speaker PELOSI’s desk. That is
an entire year that NANCY PELOSI and
House Democrats have made Kansas
businesses, farmers, ranchers, and
workers wait.
There is no excuse for holding up this
trade agreement, which is expected to
create 176,000 jobs across America and
deliver a $70 billion boost to our United
States economy. In Kansas, it would
mean thousands of jobs and hundreds
of millions of dollars. This agreement
will make us stronger in our next trade
negotiations with China as well.
With all due respect, Speaker PELOSI,
there are no more excuses. It is time.
Let’s deliver a win for our economy
and pass USMCA now.
IMPEACHMENT IS ALL ABOUT POLITICS
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this
week, House Republicans produced our
report showing specific facts that dis-
mantle the Democrats’ claims on im-
peachment. This evidence shows:
Number one, President Trump has a
deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable
skepticism of Ukraine due to its his-
tory of pervasive corruption;
Number two, the evidence does not
establish that President Trump pres-
sured Ukraine to investigate Burisma
Holdings, Vice President Joe Biden,
Hunter Biden, or Ukrainian influence
in the 2016 election for the purpose of
benefiting him in the 2020 election; and
Number three, the evidence does not
support that President Trump covered
up the substance of his telephone con-
versation with President Zelensky by
restricting access to the call summary.
Speaker PELOSI previously said that
the conditions for impeachment must
be ‘‘overwhelming’’ and ‘‘bipartisan.’’
Currently, there is only bipartisan sup-
port in opposition to impeachment.
I guess the facts really don’t matter,
and Democrats moving forward show
that this is all about politics.
f
LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise, with my mnemonic
notes in hand.
Mr. Speaker, I rise because I love my
country, but I also rise today with
heartfelt regrets.
Mr. Speaker, it hurts my heart to see
the Judiciary Committee hearing ex-
perts on the topic of impeachment, one
of the seminal issues of this Congress,
hearing experts, Mr. Speaker, and not
one person of color among the experts.
What subliminal message are we
sending to the world when we have ex-
perts, but not one person of color? Are
we saying that there are no people of
color who are experts on this topic of
impeachment? What is the message
that we are sending?
Mr. Speaker, if I am wrong, I will
apologize; but if the committee is
wrong, if the Congress is wrong, what
will it do?
Mr. Speaker, people of color, for too
long, have been ignored by one party
and taken for granted by the other.
Too often this happens. Not always,
but too often it happens.
Mr. Speaker, I refuse to be ignored
and taken for granted. I came here to
represent the people who are ignored
and taken for granted. Not one person
of color among the constitutional
scholars.
It seems that there is a desire among
some to have the output of people of
color without input from the people of
color.
It seems to me that we have reached
a point wherein we have got to have
this debate about what these commit-
tees are going to do when we have our
various persons appear before us as
witnesses. We ought to have balance as
it relates to all aspects of society, and
that would include people of color.
So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today with
great regret. I rise today to say that
this is not about Democrats; it is not
about Republicans. It is about fairness.
It is about whether or not we have
matured to the point in this country
where we are going to treat all people
equally.
It is about whether we have meta-
morphosed to a point where we will not
allow committees to have persons ap-
pear without considering the diversity
and the richness of that diversity with-
in this country.
I support people of color. I do so not
because I am a person of color. I do so

RECOGNIZING MIKE CLARK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the well-earned
retirement of Northampton Township
Chief of Police Mike Clark. Chief Clark
has served the people of Northampton
Township for 47 years and as our chief
of police since 2013.
For the first 26 years of his service,
Chief Clark served on the patrol divi-
sion, on SWAT, and the detective de-
partment, giving him a wide range of
experiences within the police force.
Earlier this year, under the leader-
ship of Chief Clark, the department
earned an accreditation from the Penn-
sylvania Law Enforcement Accredita-
tion Commission, an achievement real-
ized by just 10 percent of the State’s
1,200 police departments.
Chief Clark works to make the de-
partment more active in the commu-
nity, to increase his office’s interaction
with the people they work to protect.
His Coffee with the Cops initiative cre-
ated personal connections between the
police officers and the public. And
under his leadership, the department
created a Facebook page to keep the
public informed.
Mr. Speaker, we want to thank Chief
Clark for his hard work and dedication
to the people of Northampton Town-
ship. Because of the actions of Chief
Clark and his officers, Northampton is
safer and happier for everybody who re-
sides there.
Chief Clark, we thank you for your
service, and we hope you enjoy your
well-earned retirement.
HONORING THOMAS HECKER
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life of Thomas
Hecker of Langhorne, Pennsylvania.
Mr. Hecker passed away surrounded by
his family at the age of 72.
Tom was born in Philadelphia and
raised in Langhorne. He graduated
from Bishop Egan High School and re-
ceived his undergraduate degree from
La Salle University, both my alma
maters. After receiving his law degree
from Villanova University, he joined
the law firm of Begley, Carlin &
Mandio, where he faithfully worked as
a partner until his passing.
Tom was a man of devout faith. Tom
volunteered at his church as a lector
and a Eucharistic minister visiting the
homebound.
Tom had a zest for life, which was
often expressed through the twinkle in
his eyes that we all saw every time we
saw him. Tom cherished his family and
friends, and he loved to socialize and
connect with them over a meal and a
good bottle of wine.
Tom was notorious for his Eagles
Sunday football parties and even cre-
ated bleachers in his house for game
days. Tom was also a golf enthusiast.
You could often find Tom in the sum-
mer at his beach house. He lived by the
motto, ‘‘Smile, you are in Sea Isle
City.’’
Mr. Speaker, our deepest condolences
go out to his entire family and friends.
Tom is now enjoying his eternal reward
for a life he spent serving others.
HONORING BOB GODSHALL
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life of former
Pennsylvania State Representative
Bob Godshall who passed away before
the Thanksgiving holiday. Bob rep-
resented the 53rd District honorably
for 36 years and retired in 2018.
Bob Godshall was born in Franconia,
Pennsylvania, on the family farm
where he lived until his passing. He
was a proud graduate of Souderton
High School and Juniata College in
Huntingdon. As an adult, he helped run
the family farm’s poultry operation,
served on the Souderton area school
board, and was a former Montgomery
County controller.
In the State House, Bob served as the
chairman of the Consumer Affairs
Committee, following his tenure as
chairman of the Tourism and Rec-
reational Development Committee. He
frequently worked across the aisle to
push legislation that protected con-
sumers, boosted tourism across the
State, and benefited the people of
Montgomery County.
Mr. Speaker, no matter the politics,
Bob put his community first. Bob
worked tirelessly to bring better jobs,
safety, and improved infrastructure to
our community. Bob was great man
and a dedicated public servant, and as
long as good, honest individuals like
him work to serve the people, we can
look forward to the future.

CONTRIBUTIONS OF HARD-
WORKING PORTUGUESE IMMI-
GRANTS ARE AN IMPORTANT
PART OF OUR COUNTRY’S HIS-
TORY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the passage of legislation
this week called the AMIGOS Act. It is
a bill that will spur Portuguese invest-
ment in our economy and help create
jobs here in America.
As a proud Portuguese American and
a co-chair of the Congressional Por-
tuguese Caucus and a member of the
Hispanic Caucus, I joined with
Congressmembers CICILLINE, NUNES,
and others, in being the original co-
sponsors of the AMIGOS Act. I want to
thank my colleagues this week for
their support in the passage on a bipar-
tisan basis.
Our friendship with Portugal and the
contributions of hardworking Por-
tuguese American immigrants are an
important part of our country’s history
and our heritage, as well as our econ-
omy.
The United States is Portugal’s larg-
est trading partner outside the Euro-
pean Union. In 2018 alone, trading be-
tween our two countries reached in ex-
cess of $5 billion. This will only in-
crease that economic activity, because
this bill will make it easier for Por-
tuguese investors, business people, to
increase their operations in the United
States, growing both our economies,
drawing our nations even closer to-
gether, and creating more jobs.
More than 100 Portuguese companies
today already have operations in the
United States. What do those oper-
ations do? They create jobs. They cre-
ate opportunities. And they build addi-
tional prosperity on both sides of the
Atlantic.
We have done our part. Now it is
time, we hope, that the United States
Senate will do their part so that we
can send this bill to the President that
has, again, strong bipartisan support.
It will obviously be good to get this
measure passed, hopefully, before the
end of the year.
Senators WHITEHOUSE and TOOMEY,
again bipartisan, have already intro-
duced their version of the legislation,
the AMIGOS Act, in the United States
Senate. We thank them for their strong
efforts and their partnership.
Sharing prosperity in this instance
can only benefit both the United States
and Portugal, and it is this kind of
commonsense trade policy that we
need to be advocating for, along with
continuing to build on our partnerships
both within the European Union as
well as within South America and with
Asia, and, of course, with our closest
neighbors, Canada and Mexico.
Trade obviously done properly can
create good-paying jobs in America and
benefit our relationships and our eco-
nomic activity with those countries
who we value the most.

MAKING COMMUNITIES RESILIENT
AGAINST SCAMMERS IS CRITICAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, in 2018 an
estimated 47 billion spam robocalls
were placed in the United States.
Americans lost $1.5 billion to fraud last
year. Weekly, sometimes daily, our
phones are flooded with spam calls. Not
only are these calls annoying, but
these criminals trick people into giv-
ing away personal information such as
their Social Security number or bank
information.
Robocalls affect everyone from
Janesville to Kenosha to Racine and
everywhere in between.
Last month I held an identity theft
fraud prevention workshop in south-
east Wisconsin. More than 200 residents
attended and received useful tips from
Federal and State agencies on how to
protect themselves from fraud. Making

communities resilient from scammers
is critical.
Robocalls are becoming more sophis-
ticated every day. It is becoming easier
for Americans to fall victim to
scamming. That is why Congress must
act.
Today the House is voting on a bill I
cosponsored, the Telephone Robocall
Abuse Criminal Enforcement and De-
terrence Act, or the TRACED Act.
The TRACED Act strengthens pen-
alties for criminals who conduct spam
robocalls. This bill also requires tele-
communications companies to develop
new ways to certify all calls are from
legitimate people. Working together
with phone companies, consumer
groups, and the Federal Government
will protect our community—and go
after the bad guys.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this commonsense, non-
partisan bill.
WE MUST RECOMMIT TO ENDING THE GLOBAL
HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, this week
we recommit ourselves to ending the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. We have made
progress to prevent infections and en-
hance treatment, but more work must
be done.
Supporting the Global Fund and fully
funding its programs is an important
piece of the puzzle. The Global Fund is
a partnership organization that works
with governments and private sectors
to end the AIDS, tuberculosis, and ma-
laria epidemics. By developing low-
cost, high-impact treatments and tech-
nologies, we can save lives.
Since the creation of the Global Fund
in 2002, deaths caused by these diseases
have been reduced by one-third each
year in countries where the Global
Fund invests. I was proud to cosponsor
the bill and see the House support the
Global Fund.
This is an important issue to many
across southeast Wisconsin. Earlier
this year, I met with Pastor Bob Grif-
fith and Pastor Lawrence Kirby to dis-
cuss the United States’ commitment to
battling these health epidemics, wheth-
er that be at home in southeast Wis-
consin or throughout the world.
Pastor Griffith’s and Pastor Kirby’s
work in the Racine and Kenosha com-
munities is admirable. They advocate
for those in poverty and for our global
community dealing with these dis-
eases.
We thank Pastor Griffith and Pastor
Kirby for their dedication to this
cause, for bringing awareness to the
fight.
We must continue working together
and ensure education, treatment, and
assistance is available to those who
need it.
f
CONGRATULATING THE ROCH-
ESTER ROCKETS FOOTBALL
TEAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, this is not the first time I
have risen on this House floor to con-
gratulate the Rochester Rockets foot-
ball team on a State championship
that they just won, just this past week,
at Huskie Stadium in DeKalb, Illinois.
Rochester played the Chicago St.
Rita Mustangs for the title, winning it
by a score of 42 to 28. The Rockets
came out strong with three touch-
downs early, giving them a 21 to noth-
ing lead at the end of the first quarter.
With four touchdown passes between
quarterback Clay Bruno and receiver
Hank Beatty, the Rockets proved that
they meant business. The dynamic duo
put on an offensive showcase with
Bruno completing 18 of his 25 passes for
313 yards, and Beatty hauling in 12
catches for 212 yards. Rochester’s of-
fense was as dominant as ever, making
it nearly impossible for St. Rita to cre-
ate any sort of momentum.
In addition to a powerhouse offense,
the Rockets’ defensive line showed up
to work. Senior, Logan Peters, had 11
tackles, and sophomore, Johnny Neal,
had 7. Neal was playing JV halfway
through the season and got a 14-yard
sack on the quarterback and a fumble
recovery.
This is the Rockets’ eighth State
championship in 10 years, and this is
the first one that they achieved in the
higher 5A classification. Leave it to
Coach Derek Leonard and the entire
Rochester Rockets team and the com-
munity to get bumped up, by maybe a
student or two, into a higher class and
just go ahead and win a State cham-
pionship there, too.
Congratulations to Coach Leonard.
Congratulations to all of Coach
Leonard’s assistant coaches and to the
entire Rockets community on another
well-deserved State championship.
CONGRATULATING COACH BRENT WEAKLY
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate
Coach Brent Weakly and the Central
A&M High School football team on
their Class 1A State runner-up title.
Last week they played a great game
with the Lena-Winslow Panthers, but
lost in the 1A State championship.
This year was the team’s first year
since 2001 that the Raiders have made
an appearance at the IHSA State
championship game, and while they
didn’t bring home a win, they held
their heads high following last Friday’s
game.
A&M’s quarterback, Connor Heaton,
threw for 192 yards and two touch-
downs. Connor has come a long way
since I used to drop my kids off with
him at the same babysitter in
Taylorville a few short years ago.
b 1030
Receiver Jacob Paradee had 11 recep-
tions, a tie for most all-time in a Class
1A championship game. His 157 receiv-
ing yards broke a 1A record that was
set back in 2006.
All said and done, A&M had its best
season in 18 years. Coach Weakly said
it best of his team: ‘‘Hats off to our
kids. They kept competing. . . . I’m
really happy and proud of them.’’
I am happy and proud of them, too.
We are proud of the coach, his entire
coaching staff, and the entire Central
A&M community.
Congrats on a great season.
MARKING ONE YEAR OF RECOVERY FOR
TAYLORVILLE, ILLINOIS
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, it has been 1 year since an
EF–3 tornado ripped through my home-
town of Taylorville, Illinois.
More than 700 structures were dam-
aged and 33 were destroyed that night,
but not a single life was lost.
I thank God for looking over
Taylorville that night, and I am thank-
ful for the critical decisions made by
our former fire chief, Mike Crews, and
our current mayor, Bruce Barry. Their
actions likely saved countless lives.
It is a night I will never forget, not
only because of the destruction I saw
when arriving back into my commu-
nity minutes after the tornado ravaged
it, but it is also the damage I saw the
next day in daylight.
I am also amazed by the generosity
that we saw from so many people out-
side our community. Hundreds of vol-
unteers came out to assist with the
cleanup, and donations poured in from
across the State and the Nation to help
those in need.
Mr. Speaker, I especially want to
thank Ed Legg and those others who
make up Missions for Taylorville for
coordinating getting these donations
out to those families in need.
We gathered this past weekend at the
Taylorville VFW Post as a community
to remember that night, to thank our
first responders and volunteers for
their work, and also to remind every-
body that many families are still in
need of help.
Mr. Speaker, 1 year after this dev-
astating tornado, I again thank all
those who continue to help my home-
town recover and to pray for the fami-
lies still in need.
We are all Taylorville Strong.

SUPPORT RED CROSS’ HOLIDAY
MAIL FOR HEROES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of
the American Red Cross’ annual Holi-
day Mail for Heroes program.
Each year in early December, the
Red Cross hosts this important event
that strives to provide our men and
women in uniform with the support
and encouragement that is particularly
important around the holiday season.
We all look forward to gathering
with family, friends, and loved ones
during this time of year. For our serv-
icemembers, this is a luxury.
These men and women spend many
months at a time away from their fam-
ilies. That is difficult no matter what

time of year it is, but around the holi-
days, their sacrifice is magnified.
Today, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the
Rayburn foyer, we can all play a small
role in brightening the spirits of those
in our military by signing a holiday
card.
Mr. Speaker, it is an initiative that I
look forward to participating in every
year, and I encourage my colleagues
and their staff to participate as well.
For more than a decade, the Holiday
Mail for Heroes program has worked
hard to remind our heroes just how
much we appreciate their service and
their sacrifice.
Last year around this time, I had the
privilege of sponsoring a congressional
delegation abroad where we met with
our troops and had the pleasure of
spending time with them during the
week of Thanksgiving. My colleagues
and I traveled to Kuwait to serve and
to share a meal with soldiers stationed
there. It was an honor to meet with so
many individuals who have committed
their lives to protecting our great Na-
tion.
We can all do our part to support our
dedicated servicemen and -women now
and throughout the year. A gesture as
small as sending a card can brighten
the holiday season for those who are
deployed.
This holiday season, I encourage each
and every one of us to take a moment
out of our days to let a soldier know
how much we appreciate them.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:
God of wisdom, we give You thanks
for giving us another day.
Prior to the great compromise, Ben-
jamin Franklin addressed the Constitu-
tional Convention: ‘‘We indeed seem to
feel our own want of political wisdom,
since we have been running about in
search of it. . . . In this situation of
this assembly, groping as it were in the
dark to find political truth, and scarce
able to distinguish it when presented
to us . . . have we now forgotten our
powerful friend?’’
Lord, You are the powerful friend re-
ferred to by Franklin, and we turn
again to You to ask that Your wisdom
might break through the political dis-
cussions of these days.
Bless the Members of the people’s
House and all of Congress with the in-
sight and foresight to construct a fu-
ture of security in our Nation’s poli-
tics, economy, and society. May they,
as You, be especially mindful of those
who are poor and without power.
May all that is done be for Your
greater honor and glory.
Amen.

U.S. AND BULGARIA FRIENDSHIP
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, last week, President Donald
Trump warmly welcomed Bulgarian
Prime Minister Boyko Borissov to the
White House and reaffirmed the strong
alliance between our two countries.
Based on this successful meeting, the
United States and Bulgaria announced
a new strategic partnership framework
to deepen our historic bilateral rela-
tionship which spans over 100 years.
According to a joint statement to
face a growing concern about the secu-
rity situation in the Black Sea, Bul-
garia offered to provide a maritime co-
ordination function at Varna in sup-
port of NATO’s Tailored Forward Pres-
ence Initiative. This is so important
and will be a welcome step in the for-
mation of an intelligence hub in the re-
gion to counter destructive activity.
The two also agreed to work more
closely on energy diversification to ad-
vance Bulgaria’s energy sector, reduce
prices for citizens, and allow for Bul-
garia to become a true gas hub and key
source of regional energy security.
These two measures underscore the
important role that Bulgaria continues
to play as an ally and a valuable NATO
member. I am grateful that President
Trump is prioritizing a relationship
with a beloved ally like Bulgaria.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

RECOGNIZING NAACP ATLANTIC
CITY BRANCH
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, today
I would like to express my gratitude
for the efforts of the NAACP Atlantic
City branch to make south Jersey a
place of inclusion, acceptance, and
equality.
In the past few years, this organiza-
tion has worked to improve access to
the polls for marginalized voters, to
protect maternal and infant health
with the Infant Mortality Task Force,
and to provide scholarships for the edu-
cation of our vulnerable youth.
The NAACP of Atlantic City has also
focused on tackling hatred in our com-
munity by organizing vigils to call out
hateful and unacceptable actions
against minorities and by addressing
the environmental injustice dispropor-
tionately suffered by these groups.
This group has worked tirelessly to
support minority groups in south Jer-
sey, and our region is safer, healthier,
more inclusive, and happier because of
it.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Atlantic
City NAACP for their commitment and
service to our community. South Jer-
sey and the State of New Jersey appre-
ciates all the work that they do.
f
DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO
TEAR THIS COUNTRY APART
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, after
weeks of secret depositions, selective
leaks, and public hearings, the Demo-
crats trying to tear down this country
with their impeachment sham have not
proven any of their assertions against
President Trump.
Unfortunately for those Americans
who expect Members of Congress to
work for their benefit, the majority in
this Chamber is instead obsessed with
overturning the will of the people ex-
pressed in the 2016 election. That obses-
sion caused substantive legislation to
come to a standstill.
While some Democrat Members of
this House have pointed to the number
of bills passed as evidence of success, I
would like to point out that just be-
cause people are busy, it does not mean
they are working. While bipartisan
bills to address issues like lowering
prescription drug prices, better trade
deals, and funding our national defense
are ready to be voted on, Speaker
PELOSI has instead chosen to focus on

zero chance of ever becoming law.
Speaker PELOSI’s partisan legislating

est of the American people.
f
12 DAYS OF SALT
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of the taxpayers of
New Jersey. There are 12 days left in
the legislative calendar, and I urge the
House to close 2019 by lifting the cap
on the State and local tax deduction
cap, or SALT.
I will be here on the floor every day
this holiday season highlighting the
impact of SALT on my constituents
and on Americans across the country
for the 12 days of SALT.
And on this first day of SALT my
constituents have said to me that
SALT is the number one concern they
have. I meet teachers, firefighters,
homeowners, and small business own-
ers who owed thousands more on their
taxes this year as a result of the $10,000
deduction cap.
Capping SALT deductions is an at-
tack on New Jersey residents, busi-
nesses, homeowners, and unfairly im-
poses a marriage penalty on couples
filing jointly. It is an attack on States
that invest in their communities—in-
vestments in roads, libraries, schools,
first responders, and teachers.
So I urge my colleagues to pass
SALT legislation immediately and to
stop double taxing hardworking Ameri-
cans.
f
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC IS A
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss
H.R. 5249, the Supporting Healthy Out-
comes for Mothers and Infants Act. I
am proud to cosponsor this bill along-
side my colleague, Congressman DAVID
TRONE.
The opioid epidemic is a public
health crisis. It does not discriminate.
Opioid abuse impacts all of our com-
munities, and sadly, expectant mothers
and children are particularly vulner-
able.
This bill will help address the crisis
by properly investing in opportunities
for both education and prevention.
Equally important, the bill works to
destigmatize addiction and rightfully
treat it as an illness.
Specifically, the Supporting Healthy
Outcomes for Mothers and Infants Act
instructs the Health and Human Serv-
ices Secretary and the Agriculture Sec-
retary to develop evidence-based nutri-
tion education material for WIC-eligi-
ble pregnant women and caregivers to
infants impacted by neonatal absti-
nence syndrome.
It ensures WIC conducts outreach to
those who may be eligible for the pro-
gram or impacted by substance abuse
disorder.
Lastly, the bill makes any nutrition
education and training materials de-
veloped available to State agencies
through an online clearinghouse.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to urge my
colleagues to cosponsor and support
H.R. 5249.
f
RURAL COMMUNITIES FACE DAN-
GERS FROM ILLICIT DRUG TRAF-
FICKING
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker,
‘‘Right under your nose: A Mexican
cartel turned this rural area into a hid-
den cocaine hub,’’ reads the headline
from over the weekend from our news-
paper in southern Virginia.
This article goes on to explain how a
drug cartel has smuggled super pure
meth, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, and
other drugs throughout the southern
Virginia countryside.
I have spoken on this floor about the
dangers our rural communities face
from illicit drug trafficking, and now
in my district, Mexican cartels, famous
for their extreme violence, are tearing
local communities to shreds.
I have taken action. I voted to pro-
vide funding that will help CBP agents
stop drugs at the border. Securing our
border cuts the head off the snake of
these violent cartels. I have aided local
law enforcement and pushed for drug
trafficking designations in my district,
and I have worked to fund treatment
programs that help those battling ad-
diction.
We need to fight back against drug
trafficking and take back the commu-
nities we call home.
f
RECOGNIZING MURRAY POOLE
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Mur-
ray Poole, who is retiring after 54 years
of covering local sports in the news in
towns across coastal Georgia.
The long-time sports editor of The
Brunswick News, Mr. Poole was known
throughout the Golden Isles as both
fair and supportive of all the local
players and the teams. Mr. Poole sim-
ply never wrote a bad word about any-
one.
Mr. Poole interviewed nearly every
major sports star who came through
the Golden Isles, including Mickey
Mantle, Davis Love III, and Adam
Wainwright, and made it a point to ask
them only feel-good questions.
But more importantly, Mr. Poole
gave his undivided attention to local
sporting events. Murray would high-
light everyone from the high school re-
gion championship golf team to the
second-string freshman football player.
Mr. Poole’s journalism in the Golden
Isles is simply irreplaceable.
Mr. Speaker, may Mr. Poole enjoy
his retirement. We thank him for his
service to our community.
f
HONORING DR. BARBARA JONES
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor Dr. Barbara Jones
on her retirement from South Arkan-
sas Community College.
Dr. Jones has served as the President
of South Arkansas Community College
for more than 10 years and has always
been dedicated to promoting higher
education.
Dr. Jones brought an impressive re-
sume to south Arkansas with a back-
ground in health science and edu-
cational leadership. She has served on
the American Association of Commu-
nity Colleges Board of Directors as well
as several other professional edu-
cational organizations.
Prior to Barbara entering the colle-
giate sphere, she worked as a labora-
tory scientist for 22 years in both hos-
pitals and medical facilities. Young
people in Arkansas are becoming lead-
ers in their schools and communities,
and Dr. Jones played a huge role in
many of their lives.
Working in higher education can
often be a thankless job, but Dr. Jones
was a tireless force for over a decade.
By encouraging students in both STEM
fields and others, Barbara dem-
onstrated commitment to learning
skills for a lifelong career.
Dr. Jones will be greatly missed by
the students and alumni of South Ar-
kansas Community College.
We wish her and her family all the
best as she retires. It is with great
pride that I honor Dr. Jones.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado?
There was no objection.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, the
Rules Committee met last night and
reported House Resolution 739, pro-
viding for consideration of H.R. 2534,
the Insider Trading Prohibition Act,
under a structured rule, which makes
in order two amendments.
The rule provides 1 hour of debate
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on Financial Services
and provides for one motion to recom-
mit. Lastly, the rule makes the motion
to discharge H. Con. Res. 77, if offered
by Representative GABBARD from Ha-
waii, in order on December 11 and that
the resolution be debatable for 20 min-
utes.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are
here today to provide for consideration
of H.R. 2534, the Insider Trading Prohi-
bition Act, which will establish a stat-
utory prohibition on insider trading.
For millions of hardworking Ameri-
cans, investing in the stock market is
an important tool to save for retire-
ment, send their kids to college, or
save for a downpayment on a home.
The foundation of an efficient market
is rooted in fairness and transparency,
that all investors have access to the
same information so they can make
reasonable and prudent investment de-
cisions.
Insider trading erodes the foundation
of fairness and transparency. When
company insiders, or market partici-
pants with insider knowledge, use non-
public information to trade stocks,
bonds, or other types of securities, not
only do they unfairly gain a financial
advantage over families saving for
their futures, but the insiders also
erode trust in our Nation’s financial
system. We cannot allow insiders to
take advantage of the folks who play
by the rules.
Current law on insider trading has
been largely developed by the courts
based on the antifraud statute in the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, yet
there is no specific law prohibiting in-
sider trading. This lack of clarity in
the law, combined with recent court
decisions limiting the ability of the
SEC to prosecute insider trading, has
opened the door for bad actors to profit
at the expense of average investors.
Insider trading is wrong and under-
mines our economy. It is time for Con-
gress to act and provide a clear legal
standard for insider trading.
This bill passed the Financial Serv-
ices Committee on a voice vote in May,
showcasing the importance of finally
codifying a prohibition on insider trad-
ing. Since the markup, the sponsor of
the legislation, Representative JIM
HIMES from Connecticut, has nego-
tiated with Ranking Member MCHENRY
to address any outstanding issues and
incorporate feedback from the SEC.
The text of the bill we are consid-
ering today incorporates many of the
suggestions from Mr. MCHENRY and
other Republicans. Discussions be-
tween Mr. HIMES and Mr. MCHENRY,
which concluded late yesterday, have
resulted in the McHenry amendment,
which enjoys the full support of Mr.
HIMES and Chairwoman MAXINE
WATERS.
I understand adoption of this amend-
ment, which makes further clarifying
changes, will bring the support of
Ranking Member MCHENRY and many
more of my Republican colleagues.
Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. HIMES
on his efforts over the years in coming
to this bipartisan compromise. This
bill will be a big step forward in rein-
stating trust in our financial system
and providing transparency for our
markets.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the rule and the un-
derlying bill, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume,
and I thank the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. PERLMUTTER), my friend, for
yielding me the customary 30 minutes.
We had to hustle over here today, Mr.
Speaker. You were already here, and I
appreciate your timely beginning of
the House, but this is a different kind
of day. Ordinarily, we have more 1 min-
utes, more folks celebrating high
school teachers, local newspaper folks,
and local philanthropic efforts, but as
you might imagine, there are other
things going on on the Hill today.
That is unfortunate because I come
down here today not with a heavy
heart that I often come with, from a
Rules Committee perspective. Mr.
Speaker, the Rules Committee is in
charge of deciding whether or not to
allow amendments, what to schedule
for the floor. As a member of the mi-
nority, there are four of us up there on
the Rules Committee with nine mem-
bers in the majority, so we lose a lot.
The time for bipartisan partnership
happens before a bill gets to the Rules
Committee.
Yesterday, what we saw transpire in
the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker, was
not at all unprecedented. It is just not
as common as I wish it were. That is
that the committees of jurisdiction
were working all the way up until the
eleventh hour to come together on a bi-
partisan solution so that we wouldn’t
have to jam something through the
Rules Committee.
I see my friend from Connecticut has
come down to the floor. Mr. HIMES, rep-
resenting the majority on the Finan-
cial Services Committee, and Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9232 December 4, 2019
HUIZENGA, representing the minority,
talked about the partnership that came
together, not to create the perfect bill,
not to create the bill that I would have
written, and, candidly, not to create
the bill that my friend from Colorado
would have written, but to have crafted
a bill with give-and-take so that in-
stead of spending time on this floor
making statements, we are going to
spend time on this floor making legis-
lation.
We are going to have an actual op-
portunity, Mr. Speaker. I don’t want to
upset anybody’s applecart here because
so often we do spend more time trying
to make a point than make a dif-
ference. This is a bill about making a
difference today.
Not at all common, there were no
Democratic amendments made in order
to this bill. The two Republican
amendments that were made in order
are the perfecting amendments to seal
that bipartisan compromise. I think we
are going to end up with a big bipar-
tisan vote on the board.
The only thing that gives me a heavy
heart today, Mr. Speaker, is that I of-
fered an amendment last night to add
suspension authority for the Speaker
of the House, Speaker PELOSI, to bring
up a bill dealing with the widows and
widowers of American servicemen and
-women killed in action and the bene-
fits that they are not receiving today.
This is also a bipartisan bill. I offered
an amendment to make that suspen-
sion authority in order. It was rejected
on a party-line vote, so I am going to
be opposing the rule today because I
would like to be able to include those
things.
But we did get a motion to recommit
that will be made in order today, so I
will have an opportunity, if we defeat
the previous question, to bring up the
NDAA bill, the National Defense Au-
thorization Act, which does contain
the widow’s tax repeal and gives us an
opportunity to do even more things to-
gether.
I see my friend from Georgia (Mr.
DAVID SCOTT) on the floor today. He
serves on the Financial Services Com-
mittee with my friend Mr. LOUDERMILK
from Georgia. We have two Georgians
who serve on the committee of juris-
diction for this bill.
I always enjoy the Financial Services
Committee because, historically, in my
9 years here, it has not been led by
shrinking violets on either side of the
aisle. There are those milquetoast
committees on Capitol Hill, Mr. Speak-
er, that never make the news. Nobody
ever gets a one-liner. Not so with the
committee that my friend from Colo-
rado and my friend from Georgia serve
on.
But I like watching the vote tally be-
cause so often my friend Mr. SCOTT
from Georgia and my friend Mr.
LOUDERMILK from Georgia end up on
the same side of the issue because,
sadly, the only Financial Services
Committee bills that make the head-
lines are those that highlight our stri-
dent differences here. But time and
time again, the Financial Services
Committee has had a record of pro-
ducing bills that can go to the Presi-
dent’s desk. They could go to President
Obama’s desk for his signature, and
they can go to President Trump’s desk
for his signature.
I hope this turns out to be one of
those exercises today, again, not an ex-
ercise in making a point but an exer-
cise in making a difference.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to share
with my friend from Colorado that his
expertise on the Financial Services
Committee is valued by all of us on the
minority side of the aisle.
It is a special kind of pain being in
the minority on the Rules Committee,
Mr. Speaker, because minority mem-
bers have wonderful ideas, and friends
on the other side of the aisle are con-
strained from how many of those ideas
they can support, but we always get a
word of encouragement from our friend
from Colorado.
I know if he were sitting on the mi-
nority side, I would be feeling his pain,
and he feels ours. He is always a voice
for encouragement on that committee.
We see that come back from the wit-
nesses who have a chance to serve with
the gentleman from Colorado, talking
about how much they enjoy that part-
nership.
That is why I am particularly pleased
I was assigned this rule today, because
it exemplifies the kind of work that we
want out of all of our committees, that
we have gotten out of the Financial
Services Committee this day and that
my friend from Colorado works each
and every day to bring forward, some-
times with more success than others,
but nonetheless, it is appreciated.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I always enjoy doing
these rules with my friend from Geor-
gia. He is very kind in his com-
pliments, and he makes points that are
well taken.
One, though, that I would take some
issue with that he raised was with re-
spect to the widow’s tax, the bill that
he brought up in committee last night.
I would just say that particular bill
was incorporated in the National De-
fense Authorization Act, which this
House passed months ago, which, like
so many other things, was caught up in
a logjam over in the Senate where at
least 275 bills, bipartisan bills, are sit-
ting on Senate Majority Leader MITCH
MCCONNELL’s desk and have not seen
any action being taken.
b 1230
But we are here today to talk about
the Insider Trading Prohibition Act,
which really has come a long way. Mr.
HIMES from Connecticut has been
working on this piece of legislation for
some time. And, as Mr. WOODALL said,
there has been a lot of collaboration
which has resulted, and, upon the pas-
sage of Mr. MCHENRY’s amendment,
will result in a pretty good bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.
HIMES) to speak on this rule and his
bill.
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from Colorado for yielding
me a little bit of time. I also thank the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
WOODALL) for acknowledging the bipar-
tisan quality of this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in the hope that
this body will support the rule. The
rule, in particular, obviously, made at
least one, possibly two, Republican
amendments in order.
I just want to reflect for one moment
on what my intention was in the under-
lying bill.
First of all, this is a fix to a problem
that we have had in American financial
services law for a very long time,
which is that there is no specific stat-
ute prohibiting insider trading.
Yes, we have prosecuted insider trad-
ing for a very long time using fraud
provisions and other provisions of the
securities law. As a result of there
being no explicit prohibition on insider
trading, much of the law that has
grown up around this is court-made
law.
I know I speak for everyone in this
Chamber when I say we are here to
make the laws of the land and, hope-
fully, guard that job jealously.
This is a good fix, but, to me, it was
important how it was done. The Senate
is controlled by the Republican Party.
The House is controlled by the Demo-
cratic Party.
It was very important to me to get
Republican support for this bill, num-
ber one, because I believe that that is
the way that we get good, resilient leg-
islation done and, number two, because
it afforded me the opportunity to work
very closely with people like Ranking
Member MCHENRY and my Republican
colleagues on the Financial Services
Committee in a larger effort to build
the trust and to build the relationships
that, hopefully, will open the aperture
for us doing more of these bipartisan
things.
We do two big things around here: We
stand by the values that our parties
represent, but, at the end of the day,
we try to come together to get some-
thing done. Honestly, in the years I
have been here, we have done way too
much of the former and not enough of
the latter.
I really am very pleased with the way
this bill has turned out. I think it has
a shot of becoming law if we can get
the Senate to move on it. I am de-
lighted by the bipartisan support it has
received.
Mr. Speaker, I would just close by
again thanking my Republican col-
leagues, Mr. PERLMUTTER from Colo-
rado, and hope that this body will sup-
port this rule.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9233
December 4, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I want to associate my-
self with my friend from Connecticut.
It has been true that we have spent too
much time making policy statements
and not enough time making policy.
That has been true under leadership of
both parties here. Though, the truth is,
Mr. Speaker—and because I take great
pride in this institution, I want to say
it—we do spend more time making pol-
icy than we get credit for.
You can’t see behind you, Mr. Speak-
er, but I am looking at the press gal-
lery today, all the folks who are cov-
ering us reclaiming our Article I re-
sponsibilities today. We are not going
to let the courts legislate in this area;
we are going to legislate in this area.
There is approximately one outlet
there covering this today; others are
elsewhere.
Again, we worked until the eleventh
hour to put something together, a bi-
partisan compromise between the
chairman and ranking member on the
Financial Services Committee. The
collective national presence to high-
light that partnership is, again, one.
I don’t know what we can do here to
try to let success beget success. So
often, these kinds of successes go right
underneath the radar screen, and, thus,
it makes it harder to accomplish these
things. If I could make it clear to
America that the tag team of WATERS
and MCHENRY can come together to get
good things done, that certainly sends
a message that there is hope for all of
us in this space.
I want to go back to what my friend
from Colorado said, though. He is abso-
lutely right about the widow’s tax. We
did incorporate that bill in the NDAA.
It has been sitting in the Senate doing
nothing.
I wish we would have passed it as a
stand-alone bill. That is a different
conversation for a different day.
But it is sitting in the Senate, and
there is nothing I can do, Mr. Speaker,
to move the Senate along any faster. I
can’t get their conferees to work any
harder.
But what I can do is I can get the
House to take up the Senate-passed
NDAA, and we can take back the au-
thority in this institution to move the
NDAA forward. It is important for the
widow’s tax, but, Mr. Speaker, it is im-
portant for so many other things abso-
lutely essential to the defense of this
country.
It has been one of those bills that we
have come together in a bipartisan way
to be successful on decade after decade
after decade, and it is a stain on the
success of the House and the Senate
this cycle that we have not been able
to move that forward in a bipartisan
way.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to
the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, in the
same way that I can’t speak to insider
trading in that legislation any better
than the gentleman from Connecticut
does as a member of jurisdiction, I also
cannot speak to the NDAA in any bet-
ter words than my friend from Wyo-
ming (Ms. CHENEY), a former member
of the Rules Committee, the Con-
ference chairman for the House Repub-
licans here, and an unabashed defender
of providing the very best for our men
and women in uniform.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHE-
NEY).
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my friend and colleague, Mr. WOODALL,
for yielding. I miss our time together
on the Rules Committee. I look for-
ward to a Rules Committee under ma-
jority leadership in the near future,
and we would like to have Mr.
WOODALL back. I thank him for all of
his great service to our Nation and to
this institution.
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, we will amend the rule
and begin immediate consideration of
the 2020 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. I urge the House to move for-
ward on this measure and give our men
and women in uniform the resources
they deserve and tools they need to de-
fend all of us.
As matters stand, Mr. Speaker, we
are facing a grave situation. Combining
the already delayed NDAA with the
most recent continuing resolution is
bad enough. But further delay on this
defense bill, combined with the poten-
tial of yet one more continuing resolu-
tion, that, Mr. Speaker, is a national
security nightmare.
Timely, stable, adequate funding is a
prerequisite for a strong military. It is
the first step toward ensuring the secu-
rity of each and every American. That
is why, Mr. Speaker, it is vital that we,
as a body, fulfill this, our most impor-
tant constitutional duty, which is to
provide for the common defense. If we
fail to do so, nothing else we do in this
body will matter.
If this Chamber fails to do so, Mr.
Speaker, make no mistake, the Demo-
crats will be held to account. The par-
tisan tactics and the baseless impeach-
ment exercises we have seen will be to
blame. Speaker PELOSI’s leadership has
cast a cloud over the defense authoriza-
tion and appropriations processes in
this body.
In July, Mr. Speaker, the House
voted on a hyperpartisan defense bill
on an unprecedented party-line basis.
This legislation was loaded with poison
pills, but it did not have to be this way.
The Senate passed its bill on a bipar-
tisan basis, carrying on a decades-long
tradition.
Then, as if this partisanship on the
defense bill wasn’t enough, Democrats
decided to begin a closed-door impeach-
ment inquiry, an inquiry which has
served only to distract and delay the
NDAA process further.
Not only that, Mr. Speaker, but the
Democrats have hijacked the Intel-
ligence Committee, one of the single
most important committees in this
body responsible for the security of
this Nation. They have hijacked it with
an impeachment process that we have
now seen as an absolute and clear
waste of valuable time, with huge costs
to the American people.
Think for a moment about the sac-
rifices our men and women in uniform
are making right now, as I speak. Our
troops are hunting down ISIS and al-
Qaida terrorists; they are deterring
rogue regimes; and they are working
with vital allies around the world.
They are securing the freedom of mil-
lions of Americans.
Ensuring their ability to do so is not
a matter for partisan tactics or delay.
Protecting our men and women on the
front lines should be Congress’ first
priority. Unfortunately, our men and
women in uniform are, once again,
being held hostage in order for the
Democrats to chase an impeachment
fantasy.
The fact is that our adversaries are
not pressing pause. China and Russia
are developing hypersonic strike weap-
ons, modernizing their nuclear forces,
advancing their air and missile de-
fenses, and increasingly making ad-
vances in emerging technologies such
as artificial intelligence.
These threats will not go away. In
fact, the longer our national security is
subject to partisan distractions, the
harder it will become for America to
match and overpower these threats.
When Democrats choose partisanship
over providing for our Nation’s secu-
rity, as they have since this Congress
was sworn in, they are helping the Chi-
nese, the Russians, rogue regimes, and
terrorist groups. The American people
will hold the Democrats accountable
for their gross neglect of our constitu-
tional obligations.
Mr. Speaker, we must act now to
pass a bipartisan NDAA to support our
troops and to strengthen our security.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I would remind the
body that we are here to talk about in-
sider trading prohibition and not spe-
cifically the National Defense Author-
ization Act. But let’s talk about some
of the differences between the House
and the Senate that my colleague from
Wyoming would, apparently, just give
up.
She doesn’t, apparently, care or is
recommending that we forget about
the widow’s tax, which the gentleman
from Georgia has really eloquently dis-
cussed the need for it. But, obviously,
that is something that is in the House-
passed bill and not in the Senate bill.
Secondly, in the House-passed bill,
there is parental leave for members of
our military. That certainly is not part
of the Senate bill.
There is a whole section on upgrad-
ing and improving military housing for

those who serve our Nation and protect
us; and I know there is a specific provi-
sion in there to assist nuclear weapons
workers who have become sick or ill
due to all the toxicity and radiation
that they suffered during, particularly,
the Cold War period and, since then, in
dealing with our nuclear weapons arse-
nal.
I would suggest to the gentlewoman
from Wyoming that she is just wrong
on wanting to give up, recede, and let
the Senate control all of this. Those
priorities are serious priorities for the
men and women of our military, for
our nuclear weapons workers, and for
widows. I appreciate her comments.
We certainly want to see the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act
passed as quickly as possible, but it,
like so many other things, has gotten
stuck in the Republican majority Sen-
ate: 275 bills, minimum, bipartisan in
nature, sitting on Senate Majority
MITCH MCCONNELL’s desk, no action
having been taken.
I would say that there is a lot of bi-
partisan legislation that certainly can
be passed today if the Senate majority
leader would actually take some action
instead of just sitting there doing
nothing.
But coming back to this particular
piece of legislation, this is a good bill;
it is done in collaboration between
Democrats and Republicans; and it
needs to be passed. I would urge that
we need to proceed with this process,
move forward, get this rule passed, so
we can get on with this particular
piece of legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I was walking down the
hall one day between the Capitol and
the Budget Committee room, and I was
walking with the now-chairman of the
Budget Committee, Mr. YARMUTH from
Kentucky. We were arguing because he
is a committed budgeteer and I am a
committed budgeteer. We were arguing
about process and how it was that we
were going to deliver the results that
our constituents are demanding and
that the Nation expects.
We were about halfway down that
tunnel, past all that brilliant artwork
that high schoolers send in, when we
realized that we were saying exactly
the same thing. I was just saying it in
Republican terms; he was saying it in
Democrat terms. We had been arguing
then for about 5 minutes on what
should have been bringing us together.
We end up in that space a lot here.
Because my friend from Colorado does
work so hard to reach out and be col-
laborative, I want to make sure that he
didn’t misunderstand my friend from
Wyoming.
b 1245
I could hear the frustration in her
voice. My friend did not have the pleas-
ure of serving with her on the Rules
Committee, but when national security
issues came up, she has been living this
commitment as a member of the com-
mittee. When we do a continuing reso-
lution, for my friend and me it is about
an extra 2 weeks to solve disagree-
ments. For her it is 2 weeks of lost
ability to plan for national security.
When we get things done by Decem-
ber 31 and a deadline, we think of this
as a great success. For her, it is an en-
tire quarter that we couldn’t plan for
new threats and new challenges that
are confronting the U.S. intelligence
and defense establishment.
It is not just personal, it is truly life
and death in a national security way.
If we defeat the previous question,
what the gentlewoman from Wyoming
was proposing is that we take up the
Senate bill and amend it with all of
those ideas that our conferees have al-
ready gotten together on.
Now, my friend is correct. The Sen-
ate has some challenges. I would argue
it is a challenge that nobody has 60
votes over there, and so whether Re-
publicans are leading the Senate or
Democrats are leading the Senate,
there is still no ability to move things
past the filibuster threshold. But we
can take up that bill, because I would
say it is Democrats in the Senate hold-
ing it up. My friend from Colorado
might say it is Republicans in the Sen-
ate holding it up. But we all agree that
it is critically important that we get it
done. So I don’t want to slow down the
insider trading bill, Mr. Speaker, and
that is not what I am suggesting.
What I am suggesting is: If we defeat
the previous question, we have already
got section 1 and section 2 of the rule
that covers the insider trading bill.
Let’s add a section 3 to the rule. In the
same way the insider trading bill re-
claims Article I responsibility from Ar-
ticle III courts, section 3 is going to re-
claim from the Senate the House pre-
rogative to move forward on legisla-
tion. We will bring up the Senate bill,
we will add in all of the amendments
that the Democratic chairman of the
Armed Services Committee and the Re-
publican ranking member want to in-
clude, and then we will move that bill
forward.
Mr. Speaker, the insider trading bill
is important, and we are going to get
that done together. National security
is even more important.
Again, while it is not the subject of
national news coverage, this is some-
thing we have gotten done in a bipar-
tisan collaborative way no matter who
runs the U.S. House, no matter who
runs the U.S. Senate, and no matter
who sits in the White House for almost
60 years. Every single year bills fail,
bills succeed, Presidents come, and
Presidents go. We have gotten this
done because it is important to 330 mil-
lion Americans.
Keep section 1 of the rule and keep
section 2 of the rule. Let’s move for-
ward on the bipartisan product of the
Financial Services Committee. Let’s
add section 3. Let’s defeat the previous
question, let’s reclaim from the Senate
the NDAA papers, let’s move forward
with a House amendment, and let’s
send the Senate a bill that they can
pass tomorrow.
Mr. Speaker, I don’t see any other
speakers, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
don’t have any other speakers as well,
so I will close. I assume that was my
friend’s closing.
Mr. WOODALL. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. PERLMUTTER. I yield to the
gentleman from Georgia.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I have
got my Mars 2033 bumper sticker here
if we are prepared to talk about other
collaborative things moving forward,
but I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, along with Mr.
WOODALL, I want to thank my col-
leagues for joining me here today to
speak on the rule and the Insider Trad-
ing Prohibition Act.
The Insider Trading Prohibition Act
has been a long time coming. Since
passage of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, the SEC has relied on its anti-
fraud statute and mounting case law
without an explicit statute prohibiting
insider trading. This legislation pro-
vides the clarity our regulators need in
order to do their job and ensure the
fundamental foundation of fairness and
transparency in our financial system.
We owe it to our constituents to ensure
that their savings in the stock market
are on an equal footing with all inves-
tors.
My friend from Georgia and I have
spent a lot of time talking about bipar-
tisanship today and how we can work
together across party lines to tackle
the tough issues facing our constitu-
ents. That is what the House has been
doing this year under the Democratic
majority. We have passed over 275 bi-
partisan bills that are sitting on the
Senate majority leader’s desk awaiting
action in the Senate. These 275 bills
represent progress that the Democratic
majority is delivering for the people to
strengthen the health, economic secu-
rity, and well-being of every family in
every community in America.
The House has passed bipartisan and
commonsense gun violence prevention
bills, we have strengthened background
checks, we have passed reauthorization
of the Violence Against Women Act,
and we have passed dozens of bipar-
tisan bills to care for our Nation’s vet-
erans. We want to see those particular
pieces of legislation move from the
Senate to the White House and be
passed into law for all Americans.
I hope the Insider Trading Prohibi-
tion Act doesn’t get caught up in this
graveyard over in the Senate and is in-
stead taken up quickly by the Senate
along with all these other important
bipartisan bills our colleagues have
worked together to pass this year.
I appreciate the bipartisan nature of
Mr. HIMES and Mr. MCHENRY in coming

vider is not making reasonable efforts to de-
velop the call authentication protocol de-
scribed in such subparagraph.
(E) ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES.—The
Commission shall identify, in consultation
with small providers of voice service and
those in rural areas, alternative effective
methodologies to protect customers from
unauthenticated calls during any delay of
compliance granted under subparagraph
(A)(ii).

ing party adversely affected by the informa-
tion provided by the call authentication
frameworks under subsection (b) to verify
the authenticity of the calling party’s calls;
and
(D) ensuring that calls originating from a
provider of voice service in an area where the
provider is subject to a delay of compliance

common carrier regulated under title II of
the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.
201 et seq.) for the specific purpose of car-
rying, routing, or transmitting a call that
constitutes such a violation would assist in
the successful prevention and prosecution of
such violations; and
(G) the extent to which, if any, Depart-
ment of Justice policies to pursue the pros-
ecution of violations causing economic
harm, physical danger, or erosion of an in-
habitant’s peace of mind and sense of secu-
rity inhibit the prevention or prosecution of
such violations.

thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid, the remainder of this Act, the
amendments made by this Act, and the ap-
plication of such provision to other persons
or circumstances shall not be affected there-
by.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 151.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey?
There was no objection.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Today the House will take strong, bi-
partisan action to protect consumers
from illegal robocalls. Talk to anyone,
Mr. Speaker, and you will hear just
how annoyed people are by those calls;
and no wonder—according to
Robokiller, a whopping 5.6 billion
robocalls were made to Americans in
November alone. According to
YouMail, more than 200 million calls
have been made to the 732 area code in
my congressional district this year.
That is pretty outrageous.
Today the House is giving Americans
back control of their phones.
This legislation is important because
unlawful robocalls are not only a nui-
sance, they are also undermining our
entire phone system and consumers’
safety as a result. Too often Americans
simply will not pick up their phones
out of fear that a robocall is on the
other end of the line.
These calls are not just annoying, in
a lot of instances they are scams tar-
geted at consumers. Unfortunately,
these scams are becoming more sophis-
ticated every day. At a hearing earlier
this year, we learned that the Moffitt
Cancer Center received 6,600 scam calls
in just 1 month, specifically designed
to appear as calls coming from within
the hospital. That is dangerous for pa-
tient safety and confidentiality.
Mr. Speaker, we have heard similar
stories of scammers disguised as the
IRS looking to collect a debt or
scammers disguised as local govern-
ments or police departments, and

scammers disguised as loved ones in
trouble looking for help. These are just
a few of the examples.
All of these scams are different, and
there won’t be a single silver bullet to
fix them all, but the Pallone-Thune
TRACED Act attacks the problem from
multiple angles.
First, we are targeting fraudsters and
scammers who are violating the law.
This will be done by using innovative
technologies to cut these calls off. Our
bill requires carriers to implement a
nationwide caller authentication sys-
tem and to make call blocking soft-
ware accessible to consumers for free.
This is critical.
A nationwide caller authentication
system that will help ensure consumers
can trust the caller-ID on their phone
again is obviously important. Call
blocking is another thing that we do in
the bill. Call blocking will stop the
phone from ringing when scammers are
dialing our phones. These are two crit-
ical steps—the authentication and
blocking—that will give consumers
control of their phones again.
When it comes to blocking, the
TRACED Act also ensures that there is
transparency and consistency so that
the calls people want are getting
through.
Second, Mr. Speaker, this bill will
ensure that law enforcement and the
Federal Communications Commission
have the tools, information, and incen-
tives to go after robocallers who break
the law. We need to make sure criminal
penalties are brought by the Depart-
ment of Justice to deter future
robocallers from getting into the busi-
ness.
Third, this will help us go after the
dodgy carriers who allow these unlaw-
ful calls to enter our networks in the
first place.
These are some of the main provi-
sions of this bipartisan bill, but there
are others that will be discussed by my
colleagues during our 20 minutes on my
side today.
Finally, I want to thank our ranking
member, Mr. WALDEN, Communications
and Technology Subcommittee Chair-
man DOYLE, and subcommittee Rank-
ing Member LATTA for their leadership
and for their determination in getting
this final bill to the House floor today.
I also want to thank our partners in
the Senate, Senators THUNE and MAR-
KEY, for their commitment to this
issue and for working with us on this
final bipartisan, bicameral product.
The TRACED Act takes critical steps
to give consumers control of their
phones again. I urge my colleagues to
support this bipartisan legislation
today, and I hope that it will be signed
into law before the end of the year.
I reserve the balance of my time, Mr.
Speaker.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of S. 151, the Pallone-Thune TRACED
Act. As you heard, it is a great step
forward this Congress will take to help
curb illegal robocalls.
I want to thank Chairman PALLONE,
Chairman DOYLE, and my colleague,
Mr. LATTA, for their great bipartisan
work on this; and, of course, our col-
leagues in the Senate again.
Last year RAY BAUM’S Act passed
unanimously out of this Chamber with
bipartisan support, and that included
provisions that targeted fraudulent
robocalls and spoofing from overseas.
Those provisions are in law and are
being used today.
Today the TRACED Act builds on
that bipartisan success by better ena-
bling consumers, carriers, law enforce-
ment, and the Federal Communications
Commission to target these scammers.
While this Chamber has not made a lot
of progress this year on legislating, I
am pleased to see bipartisan legislation
before us today that addresses a chal-
lenge that affects nearly every Amer-
ican, and that is illegal robocalls.
Last month alone, Mr. Speaker, in
my district in the area code of 541 we
got 14.1 million robocalls, just last
month; and that is just in one part of
Oregon. We know last year it was
something in the order of over 50 bil-
lion illegal robocalls that came into
America. I got one today already, and
I imagine speaking here I will get five
more. I will get targeted or something.
It is time to put consumers back in
charge of their phones, and that is ex-
actly what this legislation does.
b 1300
It allows carriers and consumers to
use new, innovative call-blocking and
call-authentication tools. We can
strike the right balance between allow-
ing important calls to get through
while making sure illegal robocalls are
blocked, all at no additional cost to the
consumer.
This means when you receive a call
from an unfamiliar number with a fa-
miliar area code, you should be con-
fident that there is a legitimate reason
for that call. That means your phar-
macist can still automatically call you
to say prescriptions are ready for pick-
up if you signed up for those notifica-
tions. That means vulnerable popu-
lations can be better protected from
scams trying to steal their hard-earned
savings. We have all read those stories.
When these illegal robocallers get
caught, we need to ensure they are
prosecuted. This legislation takes steps
to improve our traceback efforts and
provides the Department of Justice ad-
ditional tools they need to go after bad
actors.
We all get these calls. I got one about
a year or so ago, Mr. Speaker, and it
was out of Greece. I don’t know any-
body in Greece. It was a 02 something
or other area code. I let it go to
voicemail, and by golly, they left a
message. A day later, I listened to it. It
was the Vice President of the United
States aboard Air Force Two trying to
reach me. Sometimes you should an-
swer those calls.
With this legislation, hopefully, we
will know with certainty you can an-
swer a call like that, and it will be
somebody that is trying to reach you
for real.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE), the
chairman of our Subcommittee on
Communications and Technology, who
worked very hard on this legislation.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, today, the House
will vote on the Pallone-Thune
TRACED Act. This legislation resulted
from diligent bicameral negotiations
over many months, and I am glad that
we have come to this agreement.
This bill addresses a problem that we
all have firsthand experience with: per-
sistent, annoying, nonstop robocalls.
Americans received nearly 48 billion
robocalls last year, a 60 percent in-
crease from the year before. That num-
ber is expected to increase to 60 billion
this year.
My hometown of Pittsburgh has al-
ready received 387 million robocalls
this year. That is up from 189 million
in 2017. On average, everyone in Amer-
ica received 15 robocalls in the month
of November alone.
This legislation before the House is
bipartisan and bicameral, and I believe
it will help seriously reduce the on-
slaught of illegal robocalls Americans
face. The bill before the House today is
the result of bipartisan negotiations,
which included industry and public in-
terest stakeholders.
The original House bill was reported
unanimously out of the Subcommittee
on Communications and Technology,
which I chair, as well as out of our full
Committee on Energy and Commerce.
It was approved by the full House with
overwhelming support.
I am also pleased that the language
from the STOP Robocalls Act, which
Ranking Member LATTA and I intro-
duced, was included in this bill. These
provisions allow phone carriers to en-
able robocall blocking services by de-
fault on phone lines automatically.
While these technologies have been
available on an opt-in basis, too many
seniors and, frankly, too many people
in general just don’t know about these
services or how to sign up for them.
Allowing these services to be enabled
by default allows all consumers to ben-
efit from these technologies without
having to go through an onerous signup
process, especially seniors and those
most vulnerable to scam calls. These
provisions also include requirements
that new opt-out robocall blocking
services do not result in new consumer
fees.
Finally, this bill requires all carriers
to adopt call authentication tech-
nology that would enable people to be
certain that the number they see on
their caller ID is really the number
that it is coming from. All too often,
folks get calls that look like they are
coming from down the street when
they are really coming from scammers
half a world away.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9241
December 4, 2019
The legislation came about through
the hard work of the majority staff and
the minority staff of the Committee on
Energy and Commerce. In particular, I
thank Jerry Leverich, Phil Murphy,
Dan Miller, AJ Brown, Parul Desai,
and Alex Hoehn-Saric on the majority
staff, and Kate O’Connor, Evan Viau,
and Rachel Rathore on the minority
staff for their hard work and diligence
to get this bill to the floor.
I urge my colleagues to support this
bill. This is another example of the
House passing bipartisan legislation,
sending over 200 such bills this session
to the Senate. Hopefully, our col-
leagues in the Senate will act on this
bill and give the relief that our con-
stituents deserve from these unwanted
robocalls.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. LATTA), the top Republican on the
Communications and Technology Sub-
committee and a real leader in this ef-
fort.
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WAL-
DEN), the Republican leader of the
Committee on Energy and Commerce,
for yielding me time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of this bipartisan legislation to combat
illegal robocalls. With an estimated 48
billion robocalls each year, it is time
for Congress to take swift action
against illegal robocalls and give
Americans the security of knowing
their incoming calls are legitimate.
That is why we introduced the bipar-
tisan STOP Robocalls Act, which is in-
cluded in the legislation before us
today. Our bill would give phone com-
panies and the Federal Communica-
tions Commission the tools they need
to fight back against illegal robocalls.
Private companies will be able to block
fraudulent calls before they get to your
phones, all with consumer control and
no additional line-item charges.
Our provision also provides and im-
proves information-sharing to enhance
the FCC’s ability to track and stop ille-
gal robocall spoofing operations. As
technology continues to evolve, so do
the tactics that bad actors use to spoof
numbers illegally to make fraudulent
robocalls. We must allow these compa-
nies and the FCC to keep pace.
While we are all tired of annoying
and illegal robocall scams, there are
also legitimate users of autodialing
technologies that must be preserved.
The bill before us today rightly recog-
nizes those important proconsumer
messages. From school closures to
bank fraud alerts, there are voice and
text messages that consumers want,
and those should not be blocked.
This is strong bipartisan legislation,
and I am pleased to have worked with
Chairman PALLONE, Republican leader
WALDEN, and subcommittee Chairman
DOYLE on this bill to improve con-
sumer trust in our phone system.
I urge all of our colleagues to support
this measure.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD).
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Chairman PALLONE for his lead-
ership in preventing the continued
spread of illegal robocalls.
Mr. Speaker, these unlawful oper-
ations are deceiving and defrauding
unsuspecting citizens, with little re-
course. Congress must do its part to
bring these perpetrators to justice, and
the bill before us today does just that.
I am pleased that my bill, H.R. 3434,
is included in the bill we have today. I
thank Chairman PALLONE for fighting
to keep the language in my bill in the
underlying legislation during negotia-
tions.
My bill recognizes industry efforts to
address illegal calls by directing the
FCC to publish an annual report on
best practices in tracing back illegal
calls to their origins. It promotes pro-
vider accountability by allowing car-
riers to block calls from providers who
do not fully participate in private-led
efforts to trace suspected illegal call-
ers.
Every day, Mr. Speaker, consumers
fall victim to scams initiated by fraud-
ulent calls. I believe that the TRACED
Act is a practical and comprehensive
solution that will aid us in ending
these illegal calls for good.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. GUTHRIE), the top Repub-
lican on the Oversight and Investiga-
tions Subcommittee.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of S. 151, the Pallone-
Thune TRACED Act.
So far this year, Kentuckians have
received 500 million robocalls. That is
over 100 calls per person this year.
Robocalls are the number one issue I
hear about when I am home.
Scammers have found creative ways
to trick people into thinking their
calls are legitimate. These calls have
wreaked havoc for private citizens,
hospitals, small businesses, and every-
one in between.
One Kentucky woman told me she
gets three to four calls a day. She al-
ways answers for fear that there might
be a family emergency, only to be
greeted by a spam call, disrupting her
work at a factory.
I was proud to cosponsor the original
House bill, the Stopping Bad Robocalls
Act, and I am proud to support the Pal-
lone-Thune TRACED Act, which would
put an end to these frustrating calls. I
commend my fellow colleagues on the
House Committee on Energy and Com-
merce and in the Senate for developing
this bipartisan, bicameral solution to
stop bad robocalls.
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the oppor-
tunity to be here, and I recommend all
of my colleagues support this.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Vermont (Mr. WELCH).
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of the TRACED Act.
This is a long-overdue effort by Con-
gress to crack down on out-of-control
abuse of robocall marketers. These are
annoying and inconvenient calls, but
they also have real-life impacts.
Kathryn Ottinger is an 84-year-old
Vermonter from Shelburne. She and
her husband receive at least three or
four robocalls a day, at all hours of the
day. Kathryn’s husband is hard of hear-
ing, so he doesn’t hear the phone ring,
which requires her to race to answer
the calls constantly, even though it is
really difficult for her to get up. She
always answers the calls because they
could be important. It might be a son
or a daughter.
Unfortunately, it is usually a mar-
keter or a scam call. Kathryn sums it
up perfectly when she says: ‘‘I am very
upset about these calls. I want the
calls to stop.’’
She speaks for all of our constitu-
ents. She is not alone.
In 2018, there were 47 billion robocalls
made in the United States. Vermonters
receive nearly 4 million robocalls a
month. In 2016, scams involving
robocalls cost 22 million Americans a
total of $9.5 billion.
I am hopeful this bill today will stop
these harassing phone calls. The bill
will give the FCC the authority and
tools it needs. It will allow consumers
to revoke consent they had previously
given. It will require calls to have
verified caller ID information associ-
ated with the call before the call can be
put through.
These are important steps that will
reduce and, hopefully, stop these
robocallers, and I urge passage of this
bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. OLSON).
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN),
my friend.
Mr. Speaker, I want to paint a pic-
ture of why I support this bill. Last
Sunday night, many retired NFL foot-
ball fans were watching my Houston
Texans throttle the Patriots from New
England.
Let’s say the phone rings at halftime.
A fan walks up to answer his phone.
The caller ID says it is from the Social
Security agency, the Social Security
office, the Social Security Administra-
tion.
He picks up the phone, and there is a
slight pause. A voice comes on and
tells him that his benefits have been
canceled. To restore them, he has to
give these people he doesn’t know his
number. And, ‘‘Oh, by the way, we can
fix this right now with your credit
card.’’
For years, people in Texas and all
across the country have dealt with
criminal phone calls. I am pleased to
say that today is the day we pass a bill
to help these Texans and Americans
fight back.
It is great to see a bipartisan piece of
legislation that I worked on with Rep-
resentative MCEACHIN, the Locking Up

Illegal Robocallers Act, included in
this package. It empowers the Justice
Department to go after criminals who
prey upon senior citizens, veterans, and
all Americans.
I urge my colleagues to support this
bill. Let’s ring in a new era in the Con-
gress, dial back robocalls, hang up on
criminals, and give them one call a
week from jail.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from New
York (Ms. CLARKE), who is the vice
chair of our committee.
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today in support of the
Pallone-Thune TRACED Act and to ad-
dress the intrusive reality of robocalls.
The jig is up for con artists who have
time and time again deceived the
American people into answering fraud-
ulent calls that put our constituents on
the hook for outrageous charges on
their phone bills.
I am so proud to have my bill, H.R.
3264, the Ending One-Ring Scams Act
of 2019, included in the underlying bill
to ensure that the American people are
protected from this harmful scam cul-
ture.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman PAL-
LONE and Senator THUNE for their work
on the TRACED Act and for holding
these bad actors accountable for their
deceptive tactics.
b 1315
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. JOHNSON), who brings an incred-
ible amount of background and tech-
nology to the committee.
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker,
I rise in strong support of this legisla-
tion that will benefit all Americans by
addressing the nuisance of robocalls.
Unwanted and annoying robocalls are
increasing at an alarming rate. Some
estimate that U.S. consumers received
nearly 4 billion robocalls per month in
2018. This needs to end.
This legislation would require service
providers to adopt call authentication
technologies and would establish addi-
tional protections for consumers re-
ceiving unwarranted and sometimes
fraudulent robocalls. It would also re-
quire the FCC to work with other Fed-
eral agencies on improving deterrence
and criminal prosecution of robocall
scams.
I am also pleased that the legislation
includes legislation that I sponsored
with my colleague, Representative
BUTTERFIELD, which requires the FCC
to publish an annual report on the pri-
vate-led efforts to trace the origin of
unlawful robocalls, an important step
in stopping these bad actors from
reaching consumers.
It is time for Congress to act and pre-
vent these illegal and unwanted
robocalls, and I encourage my col-
leagues to support this legislation.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Arizona
(Mr. O’HALLERAN), a member of our
committee.
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I
want to thank Chairman PALLONE and
Ranking Member WALDEN for bringing
us together on this bipartisan bill.
I rise today to speak in support of
the TRACED Act. There is nothing
more frustrating than receiving
robocall after robocall to our landlines
and cell phones. I receive countless
robocalls every week, often from a
phone number that seems to be just
down the road.
Even worse, many of these calls are
scams designed to prey on our seniors
and vulnerable populations that may
be more susceptible to this kind of
fraud.
This year I have held 26 town halls
across Arizona’s First District. Time
and time again, I have heard from citi-
zens about scam and spoof calls they
have encountered, putting their private
information and their hard-earned dol-
lars at risk.
I cosponsored the TRACED Act to
crack down on scammers and bad
robocalls by creating real penalties for
violators and requiring voice service
providers to develop call authentica-
tion techniques.
This is an issue on which we can all
agree. I urge my colleagues to come to-
gether to pass this commonsense legis-
lation that will benefit so many.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. FLORES), another great Texan who
needs to speak on this matter.
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I am glad
to be here with the honorable Speaker
pro tempore from Texas as well.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
for S. 151, the TRACED Act. This legis-
lation is a culmination of strong bipar-
tisan work by the Energy and Com-
merce Committee in the House and our
Senate counterparts.
We all hear complaints from con-
stituents about the scourge of
robocalls, and I am glad we are answer-
ing the American people with decisive
action.
This bipartisan bill gives consumers
tools to prevent robocalls at no addi-
tional cost. It also provides law en-
forcement and the FCC with authority
to go after bad actors.
I am also pleased that S. 151 includes
language from an amendment that I of-
fered in committee that raises fines to
$10,000 per violation, which will further
deter illegal operators from entering
into this abusive behavior.
Alongside advances from last year’s
RAY BAUM’S Act and efforts at the
FCC, we are in a better position to re-
store confidence in our communication
services once again. This is the type of
work that the House of Representa-
tives ought to be engaged in for the
American people.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. CRIST), the former Governor.
Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, the Amer-
ican people are fed up with spam
robocalls.
Today, we are bringing to bear the
full weight of the Federal Government
to go after those calls. We have an obli-
gation to do what is right for the peo-
ple.
The TRACED Act utilizes all known
weapons in the arsenal, from coopera-
tion, to investigation, including en-
forcement.
I am especially proud that the
TRACED Act includes my bill, the
Spam Calls Tax Force Act, which will
bring together agencies, the private
sector, and consumer advocates to shut
down spam robocalls. All hands on
deck is necessary here.
I thank Chairman PALLONE and
Ranking Member WALDEN for their
leadership, and I also thank my part-
ners on the Spam Calls Task Force: the
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
GRAVES), the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT), and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO).
I am filled with optimism that the
work of the people goes on: Members of
both parties coming together, setting
differences aside to work on common-
sense solutions to real problems.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the TRACED Act.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. WALBERG).
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to speak in support of S. 151, the
TRACED Act.
In 2018 alone, phone numbers with 517
and 734 area codes in my district re-
ceived over 223 million robocalls. I
know. I received a bunch of them.
Not only are these calls bothersome
and unwelcome, but they often lead to
scams that prey on the most vulner-
able. One such scam is the one-ring
scam, which attempts to trick con-
sumers into paying huge fees for return
phone calls.
S. 151 includes important legislation
that I worked to have included which
will end the harmful practice of one-
ring scams.
Mr. Speaker, robocalls are not only a
nuisance; they pose a threat to individ-
uals’ privacy and security. S. 151, the
TRACED Act, will help put a stop to
these harmful practices by empowering
phone carriers to implement call au-
thentication technologies so consumers
can trust their caller ID with no addi-
tional cost.
It will also expand and streamline
the FCC’s enforcement authority to
take strong and quick action when it
tracks down robocallers and levy fines
against those bad actors.
In the end, Mr. Speaker, this legisla-
tion will put a stop to these predatory
actors behind harmful robocalls and
put consumers back in charge of their
phones.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. ROUDA).
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I ap-
preciate the opportunity to speak in
strong support of the TRACED Act.

BILIRAKIS, FOXX, and WALBERG to ad-
dress one-ring scams will make the fi-
nances of vulnerable Americans—espe-
cially seniors—more secure and the
lives of all people in Orange County
and across the country a little more
peaceful.
We can all agree that it is time to
provide Americans with a greater sense
of security when it comes to our
phones. We shouldn’t have to worry
about unsolicited robocalls, and the
vast array of tactics bad actors are
using to target our pocketbooks and
our privacy.
This bicameral and bipartisan bill is
a big step forward in combating
robocalls, and I am thankful for the bi-
partisan group of legislators who
reached across the aisle to protect
Americans’ bank accounts and their
sanity. I urge strong support of this
bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from the
great State of Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS), the top Republican on the Dig-
ital Commerce and Consumer Protec-
tion Subcommittee of the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, I appreciate our leader on the
Energy and Commerce Committee
yielding, and I stand in strong support
of the TRACED Act to crack down on
robocalls.
I have heard from hundreds of people
in eastern Washington about this. For
example, an office manager in Colfax
logged more than 318 robocalls at her
small business, and she told me, ‘‘That
is 318 times I have picked up the phone
to hear a robot talking to me. I
dropped what I was doing to run to the
phone for one of these obnoxious calls,
or I put a real client on hold to answer
an empty call. Anything Congress can
do to stop this shameful practice would
be a relief.’’
So, Mr. Speaker, I agree. People need
relief, and they have asked Congress to
take action. So I look forward to sup-
porting this bill and sending it to
President Trump’s desk with strong bi-
partisan support.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. KIM), my colleague, whose
legislation has been included in this
bill.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman for yielding.
I rise today in strong support of the
TRACED Act, a bipartisan effort to
crack down on the scourge of predatory
robocalls.
Over the past year, I have heard from
my neighbors in Burlington and Ocean
Counties about their frustrations from
constant robocalls. In fact, more than
400 neighbors from Beachwood to
Bordentown and Toms River to Taber-
nacle contacted our office to complain.
That is exactly why I dug into the
issue and teamed up with four Repub-
licans and two Democrats to offer H.R.
3325, the Locking Up Robocallers Act of
2019, which would strengthen enforce-
ment of current laws aimed at ending
the scourge of predatory robocalls.
I am glad our bill was incorporated
into this legislation, because these
calls aren’t just annoyances; they are
used by scam artists to target people in
our community.
According to the FCC, they receive
over 200,000 complaints a year from
residents receiving predatory
robocalls. An estimated 26.3 billion
robocalls were made to mobile phones,
and more than 47 billion were made in
total to phones in the U.S. in 2018.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage
my colleagues to join me in supporting
this bill and taking a real step to end
predatory robocalls.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Georgia
(Mr. CARTER), the only pharmacist in
the United States House of Representa-
tives.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the
gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of S. 151, the Pallone-Thune TRACED
Act. The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has prioritized combating the
scourge of robocalls for quite some
time now.
In May, the Senate passed their
robocalls legislation, and in July, the
House nearly unanimously passed the
Stopping Bad Robocalls Act.
Last year, Americans saw nearly 50
billion robocalls. Those robocalls come
morning, night, and noon, often inter-
rupting important life events. This
year, we are on track to see a high
number of robocalls again. Unfortu-
nately, nearly everyone in the United
States has been on the receiving end of
dozens and dozens of robocalls.
It is time we finally take action to
empower telecom providers to help put
a stop to this and to hold those respon-
sible accountable for these actions.
That is why this bill, which builds
upon the bipartisan work of the Energy
and Commerce Committee, is so impor-
tant.
I want to thank my colleagues in the
Energy and Commerce Committee for
working with our friends in the Senate
to get this completed.
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to sup-
port this bill.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW), another col-
league whose legislation is also in-
cluded in the TRACED Act.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Chairman PALLONE for yielding
time and for all of his work.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
for the TRACED Act, a good anti-
robocall bill that is badly needed given
the robocall epidemic facing our
United States of America.
Robocall scams are at an all-time
high, and they are getting worse. Data
shows that New Jersey residents re-
ported the most robocall complaints of
any State in the Nation last year.
Robocalls not only impede our qual-
ity of life as family dinners and impor-
tant work meetings get interrupted,
but they also effectuate scams, scams
that take advantage of vulnerable pop-
ulations such as our senior citizens,
who need to be protected.
This bipartisan legislation is a crit-
ical step toward ending the scourge of
robocalls. I am pleased to see portions
of my own robocall bill, the Stopping
Bad Robocalls Act, incorporated in the
TRACED Act. While there is more to
be done, without a doubt, I am proud to
be a part of this important effort to
help protect consumers, and I urge my
colleagues to support this bill.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire how much time remains on
both sides.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 41⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from
Oregon has 9 minutes remaining.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1

Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Oregon for

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of this bill. Robocalls are not only a
nuisance, they are a threat to honest,
hardworking Montanans. Illegal
robocalls seek to exploit them and
steal their personal, private informa-
tion and their money.
Montanans hate robocalls. It is time
to put an end to the stories I hear too
often from Montanans about illegal
robocalls.
Today, we are taking a huge step for-
ward, providing relief from robocalls
with the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act.
It gives consumers tools to block ille-
gal robocalls at no cost. It also holds
illegal robocallers accountable for
their scams, including higher fines and
more prison time. This bill includes
language from my bipartisan bill that
helps identify and prosecute illegal
robocall companies.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
passing this bill and providing the
American people with needed relief
from robocalls.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my

man PALLONE and Ranking Member
WALDEN for their hard work on this im-
portant bipartisan issue.
Robocall scams leave anyone with a
cell phone vulnerable to fraud. Today
it is time for Congress to act. The
TRACED Act expands the authority for
the Federal Government to punish
these folks and will help verify legiti-
mate calls.
I want to thank everyone who
worked to bring this bill to the floor

for a vote, and I urge all my colleagues
to show their support.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Georgia
(Mr. ALLEN).
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, for too
long, unwanted callers have cir-
cumvented the law in order to delib-
erately mislead Americans through
robocalls and spoofing. In fact, this is
the number one issue at every townhall
that I hold in my district.
Unfortunately, the number of
robocall scams are ever increasing.
Robocalls should not be a part of our
everyday lives, and we must take ac-
tion to stop it.
This malicious practice has led to
fraud and theft, exploiting vulnerable
consumers, including our Nation’s sen-
iors. That is why I was a proud cospon-
sor of H.R. 3375, the Stopping Bad
Robocalls Act, which passed the House
in July.
The House and Senate took parts of
this bill and were able to come to-
gether and agree on the TRACED Act.
This bill allows the Federal Commu-
nications Commission to seek financial
penalties against those making calls
with misleading caller identification
information. Most importantly, this
legislation allows robocalls to be
blocked transparently at no extra cost
to Americans.
We must stop this practice once and
for all by identifying and taking action
against these violators. I urge my col-
leagues to overwhelmingly support this
bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. KINZINGER).
Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of this
legislation, I rise in strong support and
encourage its swift passage.
By some estimates, nearly 48 billion
robocalls were made in the U.S. in 2018,
which is a 57 percent increase over 2017.
This antirobocall bill provides the
FCC new authorities to impose sub-
stantial fines on violators—up to
$20,000 per violation, and possibly high-
er in some cases. It requires phone
companies to verify callers and help
block robocalls at no extra charge.
Mr. Speaker, make no mistake: This
legislation is a big step forward. But
given the rapidly changing technology,
combined with the fact that many of
these calls come from overseas, we
can’t let up, and more will need to be
done.
Thankfully, this bill requires a num-
ber of reports to Congress over the
coming months that will allow us to
start to crack down on these perpetra-
tors even harder.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work
we have done, bicameral and bipar-
tisan. I thank those involved.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Again, I want to thank my colleagues
on both sides of the aisle for working
together to get this done. Our constitu-
ents deserve this. We deserve this.
Over 50 billion illegal robocalls—we
are not talking about the kinds you
sign up for to give you notices when
your prescriptions are ready for some-
thing else; we are talking about illegal
scammers, often state-backed enter-
prises overseas, coming into our wal-
lets, coming into our bank accounts,
coming into our homes, coming into
our offices, and coming into our cell
phones.
Now, let’s be clear: While this legisla-
tion will make a difference, the
scammers are going to try and do an
end around whatever technology the
carriers use to try and block these
calls, authenticate these calls, stop
these calls; so we have, in this legisla-
tion, additional requirements for re-
porting back to Congress on other
steps that need to be taken, especially
when it comes to our healthcare sys-
tem and our hospitals. That will be
something the committee needs to con-
tinue to look at.
But I think building a better bridge
between the Department of Justice and
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion so they can go after the bad actors
and really nail them is a good thing in
this bill, and extending out to 4 years
the statute of limitations is a good
thing so bad actors don’t get to run the
clock and get away with their crimes.
This is good legislation; it will make
a difference; and we will continue to
fight this fight.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I, too, want
to thank our terrific staff, some of
whom, by the way, have worked on this
long enough they have gone on to other
pursuits, including Robin Colwell and
Tim Kurth, who is still with us but in
a different role than when he started
on this, Kristine Hackman, Kate
O’Connor, Evan Viau, Rachel Rathore.
And on the majority side, Alex and
Jerry and AJ and Dan and Parul and
Phil, a thank-you for their great work
on this, as well. We really appreciate
it.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage our col-
leagues to vote for this bill. Let’s get it
to President Trump’s desk. He will sign
it, and we are going to help our con-
sumers.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume to
close.
Mr. Speaker, Americans are receiv-
ing more unwanted and illegal
robocalls than ever before. The rising
tide of illegal robocalls has quickly
turned from a nuisance to a real threat
on the way we all view and use our
telephones.
Consumers need more control and
transparency over who is calling them.
The laws that prohibit unwanted calls
and the Do Not Call Registry no longer
effectively protect consumers from un-
wanted or illegal calls because it is
easier than ever to become a
robocaller. These calls all undermine
the public’s trust in our phone system.
If we don’t fix this problem, it will
only get worse. The TRACED Act is the
best way Congress can address the del-
uge of spam and spam robocalls.
Consumer groups and industry widely
support the legislation, including Con-
sumer Reports, AARP, the National
Consumer Law Center, US Telecom,
and more.
Basically, what we have in this bill
are commonsense, meaningful solu-
tions that will put consumers back in

restore trust in our phone system.
Now, in closing, I just want to thank
all of the Members and staff who were
able to work together to produce this
great legislation, and there are a lot:
obviously, our ranking member, Mr.
WALDEN, the subcommittee ranking
member, Mr. LATTA, as well as Mr.

But I also want to thank our staff
and other Members who contributed

So, Members such as Mr. MCEACHIN,

Act, which was added to the bill in sec-

fered their amendment to increase the
financial penalties for illegal
robocallers, which was added to section

And, of course, Mr. DOYLE and Mr.
LATTA introduced their STOP
Robocalls Act in section 10.
Finally, I would like to thank all the
staff on both sides of the aisle who
worked on this bill, in particular, Jerry
Leverich over here, Alex Hoehn-Saric
behind me, Dan Miller behind me, AJ
Brown, and Parul Desai on the major-
ity staff; Tim Kurth, Kate O’Connor,
Evan Viau, Robin Colwell on the mi-

and Rachel Rathore on Subcommittee
Ranking Member LATTA’s staff.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues
to support this measure, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support
of S. 151, the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act.

my colleagues do as well. Just last month
Americans received a near record of 5.5 billion
robocalls. I’m subjected to this harassment
and so are my colleagues.
These calls are highly annoying, but they
are also used to scam and swindle people.
Last year, an estimated 43 million Americans
were scammed out of $10.5 billion.
The American people are demanding that
Congress take action to combat this national
nuisance and today the House will deliver a
victory for them. I’m proud that this bipartisan,
bicameral agreement will put a real dent in our
robocall problem.
We know that no one bill can completely
solve such a complex problem, and it’s why
the FCC and Congress must remain vigilant to
ensure statutory and regulatory protections are
sufficient to protect consumers.
This legislation will bring relief to millions of
Americans, so let’s pass it and get it signed
into law pronto.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
PALLONE) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, S. 151, as
amended.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that
I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

HONORING DEACON JAMES
ANDREW WYNN, SR.
(Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the life and legacy of
a dear family friend, Deacon James An-
drew Wynn, Sr. Born on August 6, 1922,
James Wynn lived a long, loving, and
productive life. This past Saturday, he
transitioned from labor to reward.
Deacon Wynn, a lifelong resident of
Gold Point, North Carolina, loved his
family, loved his community, and loved
his God. In 1943, he met the love of his
life, Naomi Lynch, commencing a mar-
riage that lasted for 59 long years.
James was a skilled farmer and car-
penter and was well-known throughout
the community.
James and Naomi were parents to
eight wonderful children. They took
great pride in their children’s edu-
cation and accomplishments, and they
have accomplished much.
The children are: Angela; Joan;
Judge James Wynn, who is a long-serv-
ing judge on the Fourth Circuit Court
of Appeals; Reginald Wynn; Dr. Anita
Wynn; and Dr. Arnie Wynn. From that
lineage are 17 grandchildren, 17 great-
grandchildren, and 2 great-great-grand-
children.
May Deacon James Andrew Wynn,
Sr. rest in peace.

YAKIMA ROTARY 100TH
ANNIVERSARY
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker,
‘‘Service Above Self,’’ that is the
motto of the more than 33,000 Rotary
clubs and 1.2 million Rotarians world-
wide who provide service to others,
promote integrity, and advance world
understanding, goodwill, and peace.
Madam Speaker, today I rise to
honor 100 years of the Yakima Rotary
Club. From the early days in 1919, when
the Yakima Rotary Club helped to in-
stall street signs within the city limits
of Yakima to help guide the way for
residents and visitors alike, to the $22
million YMCA and Yakima Rotary
Aquatic Center that just opened last
month, Yakima Rotarians ‘‘always say
yes.’’
Be it from supporting children’s
health, literacy, and hunger to pro-
moting our parks and public spaces and
awarding thousands of dollars of aca-
demic scholarships every year, their
volunteerism, fellowship, and deep love
for our community has made a deep
and lasting impact on the greater Yak-
ima Valley.
Congratulations on 100 years of
‘‘Service Above Self,’’ Yakima Rotar-
ians, and enjoy what I have no doubt
will be the greatest party ever.
f
VOTING RIGHTS
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to support the passage of the
Voting Rights Advancement Act, H.R.
4.
This crucial legislation would give
more power to the historic Voting
Rights Act of 1965. That law protected
the right to vote for all Americans,
particularly Americans of color. It
gave a strong voice to the voiceless.
And when those Americans spoke, they
created a more diverse Congress. Clear-
ly, we are all better for it.
But, slowly, certain State govern-
ments have tried to hinder the voting
rights of minorities. They call it some-
thing else, but that is what they want
to do. That is why we need this bill to
become law.
We need the government to provide
oversight if States are guilty of too
many voting rights violations. We need
to protect the right to vote for all
Americans because, for too many of us,
the power of the vote is the only power
we have.

MISUSE OF POSITIONS OF TRUST
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to highlight H.R. 3816, the No
Pensions for Pedophiles Act, which I
introduced in July.
This bill would require the forfeiture
of Federal pensions for individuals con-
victed of Federal crimes related to the
sexual abuse of children.
I was deeply disturbed to read news
reports earlier this year surrounding
the conviction of Stanley Patrick
Weber, a doctor at Indian Health Serv-
ice hospitals, who misused his position
of trust and responsibility to prey on
vulnerable children. Inexplicably, he is
set to continue receiving his Federal
pension during his 18-year prison sen-
tence, which could be as high as $1.8
million. He is also awaiting trial in a
second similar case.
I do not believe that taxpayers
should be forced to fund the pensions of
Federal employees who have been con-
victed of crimes related to the sexual
abuse of innocent children, and the No
Pensions for Pedophiles Act would en-
sure that this practice ends.
f
PAYING TRIBUTE TO REVEREND
CLAY EVANS
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay
tribute to the Reverend Dr. Clay Evans
who passed a few days ago and is
known worldwide as a religious leader
and gospel singer.
There is nobody in the Chicagoland
area who has not experienced Reverend
Clay Evans. He was actively involved
in the political and social life of the
city. He was noted for many things,
and one of those that he is noted for is
having been the person who ordained
the Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson.
Madam Speaker, he will be sorely
missed, and we express condolences to
his family.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9248 December 4, 2019
CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC
CAUCUS
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs.
TRAHAN). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the
gentleman from New York (Mr.
ESPAILLAT) is recognized for 60 minutes
as the designee of the majority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and include
extraneous material on the subject of
my Special Order in the RECORD.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, as
the whip of the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus, I am pleased to lead this
monthly Special Order hour. This
afternoon’s topic comes at a critical
time for our Nation and for the com-
munities we represent who are all con-
cerned with the state of healthcare and
harmful actions of the Trump adminis-
tration.
There is no more personal an issue
than one’s health, and as such, this
should be top on the minds of Members
of Congress.
It was the late Martin Luther King,
Jr. who said in 1966 that of all the
forms of inequality, injustice in
healthcare is perhaps the most shock-
ing and inhumane.
Healthcare is a priority of the Con-
gressional Hispanic Caucus, and we
want to use today’s opportunity to dis-
cuss the state of Latino health in the
United States of America. The Afford-
able Care Act was landmark legislation
that extended healthcare coverage to
more than 20 million Americans either
through Medicaid expansion or tax
credits to purchase quality and com-
prehensive healthcare insurance prod-
ucts.
In the Latino community, at least 4
million Latino adults and 600,000
Latino children have gained health in-
surance coverage thanks to the ACA.
And we cannot forget that the ACA ex-
tended health insurance coverage for
children through age 26. Especially for
children and young adolescents, the
uninsured rate for Latino children has
decreased considerably, from 11.5 per-
cent to around 7.5 percent.
The gains in health insurance cov-
erage for these children and preventive
healthcare and reduction in the sever-
ity of chronic conditions is a testament
to the good and constructive health
policy that Democrats are committed
to. However, the Trump administration
has sought to undermine the ACA and
the benefits it brings to the Latino
community.
Earlier this year in a bipartisan vote,
the U.S. House of Representatives felt
compelled to rebuke the Trump admin-
istration for its promotion of the skin-
ny junk plans that offer no guarantee
of essential health benefits. That is no
guarantee for mental health treat-
ment; no guarantee for preventive
healthcare, which lowers the overall
cost of healthcare; and no guarantee
for prescription drug coverage.
According to the data collected from
the Kaiser Family Foundation, from
2013 to 2017, people of color had higher
uninsured rates than non-Hispanic
Whites prior to 2014. And it was only
after the Affordable Care Act came
into effect that Latinos had larger
gains in health insurance coverage
from 2013 to 2016 than non-Hispanic
Whites. But our work is not done. It is
truly not done.
Every day we are working to curb the
destructive actions of this administra-
tion to harm the gains that we have
made in the healthcare arena and well-
being of the Latino community overall,
and we continue working to close the
health equity gaps that the ACA did
not address.
According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Latino Ameri-
cans are twice as likely to have type 2
diabetes than White Americans. In the
United States, adults over their life-
time have a 40 percent chance of devel-
oping type 2 diabetes, but the Latino
adult has a rate of 50 percent higher.
Given that, coverage of and the overall
cost of insulin—a necessary treatment
for managing diabetes—is a priority for
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
Since the start of this 116th Congress,
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has
invited the CEOs of insulin manufac-
turers and pharmacy benefit managers
to meet with us and explain how and
why insulin remains unaffordable for
so many Americans. We met with the
largest pharmacy benefit managers in
this country who collectively comprise
78 percent of the market and cover 180
million individuals with health insur-
ance: CVS Health, Express Scripts, and
OptumRx of UnitedHealth Group. In
our discussions we were, quite frankly,
met with much resistance by all par-
ties in the prescription drug supply
chain and pharmacy benefits business.
It is infuriating for patients at the
local pharmacy counter; and trust me,
it is infuriating to me and my col-
leagues in the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus.
In addition to benefits managers, the
CHC met with the CEOs of the top
three insulin manufacturers who
produce 90 percent of the global insulin
supply and 100 percent of the supply for
diabetic patients in the United States
of America. They are Sanofi, Novo
Nordisk, and Eli Lilly and Company.
It may seem impossible, but Dr.
Frederick Banting who discovered and
cultivated insulin as a treatment for
diabetes, sold the patent for his re-
markable drug for only $1 to the Uni-
versity of Toronto.
Madam Speaker, he sold this impor-
tant patent that has saved the lives of
millions of people just for $1 to the
University of Toronto, yet the price of
insulin both with insurance and with-
out it has risen astronomically to the
point where diabetic patients must
make the decision between purchasing
lifesaving insulin versus paying their
rent, finding childcare for their fami-
lies, or getting an education.
We asked them why this is, and, in
short, they simply did not have a good
answer.
So we are concerned, Madam Speak-
er, that the patent for insulin which
was sold by Dr. Frederick Banting to
the University of Toronto for $1 has
now been placed in a position that is
inaccessible to patients across America
who will subsequently die without hav-
ing that treatment.
But we are committed to shedding a
light on this obscured process and
making sure that patients receive the
therapies they need at the price they
can afford. This is our promise. This is
our commitment.
We, as the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus and greater Democratic Cau-
cus, are committed to fighting for
healthcare that lies in stark contrast
to this White House administration.
That is why we have passed legislation
to strengthen the ACA, not to weaken
it, not to obliterate it, but to strength-
en it, and it is why we will consider
landmark legislation later this month
to help lower the cost of prescription
drugs.
Now, before I conclude, Madam
Speaker, I want to lay out some impor-
tant events taking place as we speak,
because they will have an unimagi-
nably detrimental impact on the state
of health in the Latino community.
The Trump Department of Justice
and Attorney General William Barr
abandoned their obligation to defend
our current healthcare system and the
Affordable Care Act. The State of
Texas is seeking to invalidate the ACA
and unravel the law that has benefited
constituents across America rep-
resented in this, the House of Rep-
resentatives of the U.S. Congress, and
this Department of Justice is willing to
let this happen undeterred.
This administration told the Texas
district court that it was opting to not
defend existing regulations such as pro-
tections for preexisting conditions.
Imagine that, Madam Speaker, not pro-
tecting preexisting conditions, mean-
ing that those who suffer from diabetes
and those who suffer from hypertension
and cardiovascular problems who have
preexisting conditions will not be pro-
tected and will be out in the cold.
This administration is turning its
back on over 130 million Americans, in-
cluding 17 million children and adoles-
cents with preexisting conditions. With
no plan or idea of what to do going for-
ward, they are willing to harm the
lives of millions of Americans. This is
purely irresponsible, and it is reprehen-
sible.
Neither the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus nor Democrats will allow this
to happen unchecked. We will continue
to work hard to make sure healthcare
continues to be made more affordable
and more equally accessible for all

December 4, 2019
Americans, especially people whom we
represent.
Madam Speaker, I am so grateful for
this opportunity. I will now conclude,
Madam Speaker. I would like to thank
my colleagues who could not be here
today or are here today.
And I would like to reiterate that we
will defend the Affordable Care Act and
make sure that Latinos across America
are not further harmed by this admin-
istration or partisan politics.
We are committed to lowering the
cost of prescription drugs and making
sure that insulin remains available and
affordable to all communities across
America and particularly communities
of color that are disproportionately af-
fected by diabetes. And we will raise
hell every time that we find another
instance of capricious price inflation or
market consolidation or an obvious at-
tempt to shift the blame.
With that, Madam Speaker, the Con-
gressional Hispanic Caucus will not
cease in our advocacy for the
healthcare and the well-being of our
communities that we represent here in
the Congress and across our country.
This is a crucial time in America
where the Affordable Care Act, as pre-
sented by the past administration, not
only provided access to healthcare for
people with preexisting conditions and
not only did it allow our children up to
the age of 26 to be part of our health
plan, but it also provided funding for
Medicaid and Medicare. It also pro-
vided funding for mental health serv-
ices, an arena that has, for far too
long, been left aside with not having
the appropriate funding that it needs,
and for people suffering from opioid ad-
diction.
b 1445
These are the services that were pro-
vided by the ACA. This administration
has moved forward to dismantle it and
to put people’s lives in jeopardy.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO FRED
HAMPTON AND MARK CLARK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K.
DAVIS) for 30 minutes.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join
with Representative BOBBY RUSH, who
reserved the time to talk about an
event that occurred 50 years ago when
I guess BOBBY was pretty much still a
teenager and I was a young adult.
The event took place in our city, the
city of the big shoulders, the city of
Chicago, the city that sits on a lake
founded by an African American, Jean
Baptiste Point du Sable. An event took
place where the Chicago police, led by
an assistant State’s attorney, invaded
the province of a group of young lead-
ers known to be members of the Black
Panther Party. They raided the group
while they were inside asleep. They
shot up the building and killed two of
the leaders.
One was a young gentleman, 21 years
old, Fred Hampton, articulate, grad-
uated from high school with honors,
head of the youth NAACP, but a mem-
ber of the Black Panther Party. An-
other young fellow was an outstanding
American, the son of ministers and
churchgoing people. The apartment
was raided, and these two individuals
were killed, assassinated.
It is my understanding that one of
the reasons that Congressman BOBBY
RUSH is alive today—he was supposed
to have been there but had gone home
to his apartment rather than spending
the night where the Panthers were. As
a result, he was spared.
Obviously, there was a hue and cry,
and there were years of activity and
litigation.
Madam Speaker, it is good to see
that BOBBY has arrived. I just said that
fate is such that he is here today, as
opposed to being where Fred Hampton
and Mark Clark are, wherever that is,
because as fate would have it, he went
someplace else.
Of course, as fate would also have it,
I can’t help but note that I spoke with
one of Father George Clements’ sons
the other day, who I understand helped
to kind of conceal and hide him out
while the police were looking for him.
Fortunately, fate intervened.
The activity caused a big hue and cry
from the community. As a result of
that, people began to look differently
at what was known as law enforcement
misconduct, police brutality. Some-
times law enforcement individuals
take matters into their own hands, not
worrying about what judges might do
or judges might say, or courts of law,
but would sometimes become execu-
tioners.
As a result of that, the African
American community, of Chicago espe-
cially, changed its approach to politics.
While there was a big Democratic vot-
ing bloc, they decided—we decided, be-
cause I was voting age. BOBBY may not
have been, but I was voting age. We
elected a Republican, Bernard Carey,
to be the State’s attorney for Cook
County.
That also led to, ultimately, the
changes that elected Harold Wash-
ington, the first Black mayor of Chi-
cago, which evolved, ultimately, into
the election of Barack Obama as Presi-
dent of the United States of America,
because that is where his beginning
was. That was the base.
I just happen to have represented the
Hampton family in the congressional
district that I represent. Until re-
cently, not a year went by that I didn’t
spend some time with the Hampton
family, that is, with Fred’s mother, his
father, and his brother, Bill, who car-
ried on the work. As a result of that,
that work is still going on.
I know that, on Sunday, in the com-
munity where I live, there is going to
be a demonstration or an acknowledg-
ment. I wouldn’t call it a demonstra-
tion. A group of people is going to go to
the location where Fred and Mark were
killed, and they are simply going to
pay tribute.
I pay tribute now, and I pay tribute
to my colleague U.S. Representative
BOBBY RUSH because it was BOBBY who
initiated this Special Order. Madam
Speaker, because of the Congressman, I
am here.
It has been a pleasure to know that
our paths have been crossing one way
or another for more than 50 years be-
cause I sat in the funeral home that
night after Fred and Mark had been as-
sassinated. My brother happened to be
a friend of Trey Rayner, and we sat
kind of keeping vigil.
My other good friend Frank
Lipscomb and I, we were both young
schoolteachers. We went over to the
house that afternoon after we left
school and peered and peeked and
walked through. We were, quite frank-
ly, afraid but wanted to see with our
own eyes, and so we did see.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. RUSH) and
thank him for initiating this Special
Order.
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, it goes
without saying that the love and re-
spect that I have for my colleague from
the Seventh Congressional District of
Illinois, my good friend Congressman
DANNY K. DAVIS, a man who is such an
inspiration to us all, a man who is
steadfast in all that is good as it re-
lates to what an elected official and
public servant should look like, should
be like, should walk like, and, hope-
fully, if they are giving it, should talk
like, speak like. If we all could have
the voice of Congressman DAVIS, we
would be much better off. But if we
can’t have his voice, maybe we can as-
pire to the heart that Congressman
DAVIS possesses.
Madam Speaker, I am here this after-
noon, as I have been many years now,
speaking from the well of this Congress
in this institution that is the envy of
all governments throughout the world.
I am here for one purpose today and
one purpose only, and that is to com-
memorate the life of a young man who
was killed on this very day, December
4, in 1969. His murder was not an acci-
dent. His murder was planned by the
highest levels of law enforcement in
our Nation.
Madam Speaker, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation collaborated on, con-
spired on, and coordinated the assas-
sination of Frank Hampton and Mark
Clark. Fred’s and Mark’s assassina-
tions, if not the only, were two of a few
instances of proven political assassina-
tion by police forces or law enforce-
ment agencies of this country.
I say that because toxicologists’ re-
ports concluded after the autopsy on
the body of Fred Hampton that he had
the barbiturate Seconal in his body. He
had been drugged with Seconal. They
said he had enough Seconal in his body
to immobilize an elephant.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9250 December 4, 2019
They came into that apartment,
Madam Speaker, on a cold December
morning at 4:30 a.m. Nobody was mov-
ing on the streets. They came into the
West Side community camouflaged in
Commonwealth Edison trucks.
b 1500
They came into that community
with machine guns, with a definite pur-
pose of killing Fred Hampton and any-
body else who was in that apartment.
They came using public utility
trucks, not marked police cars, but
trucks that would not look out of place
at that hour in the morning.
They knocked on the door when they
got to that apartment. Half the police
officers went to the front door. Half
went to the rear door.
They knocked on the door, and Mark
Clark, who was in the apartment,
asked, ‘‘Who is it?’’ at 4:30 in the morn-
ing. He got a response from one of the
police officers, who answered by say-
ing, ‘‘Tommy.’’ When he said,
‘‘Tommy,’’ he came in shooting.
When they heard the first round of
gunfire at the front door, the other half
of the raiding team, the assassination
team, came in through the rear door,
shooting also.
There were 12 people in that apart-
ment, including the pregnant wife of
Fred Hampton, who was asleep in the
bed with him. He had been drugged.
She didn’t know that he was drugged.
He came home late that evening, had
a meal. Fred loved Kool-Aid. His Kool-
Aid was laced with the aforementioned
Seconal.
They came in shooting from the front
of that apartment and the back, the
rear of that apartment.
Someone, a Panther on the inside by
the name of Louis Truelock, shouted
out: Stop shooting. Stop shooting.
There is a pregnant woman in here.
The shooting stopped. A patrolman
by the name of Daniel Groth went into
that apartment where Fred had been
shot, blood all over the mattress. They
heard two other shots of gunfire from a
handgun. Groth came out and said: ‘‘He
is good and dead now.’’
This was a political hit by the FBI,
by the Chicago Police Department, by
the Cook County State’s attorney.
Why did they kill Fred? Why was this
21-year-old young man such a threat
that the law enforcement agencies of
this entire Nation would conspire to
murder him and drug him? Because
Fred Hampton was a young man who
had remarkable, extraordinary gifts.
He was a charismatic individual. He
could speak and was considered a great
orator for his time and for his age. He
could move masses through his cha-
risma and through the strength of his
conviction and ideas and through his
courage.
Fred Hampton, at age 21, was a lead-
er of men and women. Adults followed
him. But more than anything else,
Fred Hampton was a man who every-
body knew said what he meant and
meant what he said.
There was a conspiracy, an assassina-
tion, a political assassination because
the FBI, Edward Hanrahan, the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office, and
the Chicago Police Department knew
that Fred had been convicted of armed
robbery. They said he had held up a
Good Humor ice cream truck and took
$71 of ice cream on a hot August day
and had given the ice cream sand-
wiches, ice cream bars, and
Dreamsicles away to the children in
the community because it was so hot.
That is what he was convicted of. He
was sentenced to 5 years in prison for
stealing, according to them, $71 worth
of ice cream.
He had been out on appeal, and his
appeal had been denied. The FBI,
State’s attorneys, Edward Hanrahan,
and the Chicago Police Department
knew that on December 13, some 9 days
later, Fred was going to report back to
the Illinois Department of Corrections
to finish off his sentence. They knew
that Fred would not be on the streets.
Why did they kill him? Because of his
courage, his charisma, his commit-
ment. Fred was committed, not just to
Black people, and he was committed to
Black people, but to all poor people.
Fred used to say that you cannot kill
racism with racism. You kill racism
with racial solidarity.
Madam Speaker, on this day, the 50th
anniversary of the murder of Fred
Hampton and Mark Clark, I remember
so well so many things that Fred said,
and one thing that he said really
stands out to me on this very day. He
used to say: ‘‘You can kill a revolu-
tionary, but you can’t kill a revolu-
tion.’’
Madam Speaker, that ought to mean
something to this body because no
matter where we are today, this body,
this United States of America, was
founded on the premise of a revolution.
Fred was right. Revolution continues
even to this day. Fred’s blood still is
producing fruit. Congressman DAVIS
mentioned it. Look at the people who
were inspired by Fred and his ultimate
sacrifice:
Harold Washington, elected the first
African American mayor of the city of
Chicago, in direct response to the mur-
der of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark
and the wounding of seven other Pan-
thers;
Carol Moseley Braun, the first female
African American U.S. Senator in the
history of this Nation;
And the mayors from Baltimore to
Seattle to New York and other places
inspired by Harold Washington’s elec-
tion, which was inspired and which was
founded on the blood of Fred Hampton.
All these things would not have ex-
isted had Fred not given his life for the
cause of freedom, justice, and equality.
Yes, Madam Speaker, even the 44th
President of the United States, Barack
Obama, Fred Hampton’s life was given
so that Barack Obama could come from
Chicago, from the State of Illinois, and
become a U.S. Senator and then the
President of the United States.
Even now, young protest groups,
Black Lives Matter and others, were
founded on the premise of and came
into existence because of the blood of
Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.
Madam Speaker, I am here today be-
cause he was my friend. He was my col-
league. I remember December the 4th,
1969. I couldn’t sleep last night because
my mind kept going back to 1969, the
calls that I got, waiting in the base-
ment of an apartment, listening to
news radio, trying to figure out what
really was going on, what was hap-
pening.
I identified Fred’s body in the
morgue that very morning, later that
morning. I remember going to the
morgue and identifying Fred’s body. I
identified his body.
They came to my apartment the very
next morning. I was supposed to have
been in the same apartment with Fred
on December 4. The very next morning,
at 5 a.m., they came to my apartment
looking for me. I had gone under-
ground.
If I hadn’t been in that apartment
with my wife and my children, if we
hadn’t been in that apartment, I
wouldn’t be here today, speaking in the
well of this Congress.
‘‘You can kill a revolutionary, but
you can’t kill a revolution.’’
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive RUSH so much.
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to
how much time I have left.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker,
first, I would like to thank Congressman BOBBY
RUSH for leading this effort in the memory of
the late beloved Fred Hampton.
Madam Speaker, fifty years ago, the people
of Illinois and the world lost a devoted public
servant with the untimely brutal murder of
Fred Hampton. A man whose reputation fol-
lowed him. I knew of Fred Hampton during my
time as a community worker with the Black
Panther Party in Oakland, California. Fred’s
fight for freedom and justice were known
throughout the country including in my district.
Fred took the Black Panther’s Party motto to
heart—he fought to end widespread poverty,
increase economic and educational opportuni-
ties, and ensure peace and justice for all.
Promoting the idea of ‘‘All Power to the
People’’, and unwilling to wait for the political
leaders of the time to address the needs of
the African American community, the Pan-
thers—and Fred—took action themselves to
force change and bring about liberation from
all forms of human exploitation and oppres-
sion.
Above all, Fred was deeply dedicated to the
Black Panther Party’s Free Breakfast Pro-
gram, which gave thousands of children the
necessary nutrition to focus and excel before
their school day. He understood the impor-
tance of meeting the needs in the community
while fighting for a fair chance to overcome
structural and oppressive barriers.
Years ago, I was lucky enough to also work
on the Party’s Free Breakfast Program in Oak-
land, California. And as many of my col-
leagues know, it was the success of the pro-
gram that pressed the Federal government to

Madam Speaker, above all—Fred was a
leader and worked to form a, a more peaceful
world. His unparalleled leadership as former
Chair of the Illinois Black Panther Party and
as a warrior for peace and justice will always
be his legacy.
The legacy of Fred Hampton shall never
die, and may he continue to rest in peace.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND
LEGACY OF FRED HAMPTON
(Ms. OMAR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I want
to first thank Congressmen RUSH and
DAVIS for allowing us to be here to
honor the legacy of Fred Hampton.
Fifty years ago today, a 21-year-old
American revolutionary was murdered
in his own home by 14 Chicago police
officers who were found to be colluding
with the FBI as part of the
COINTELPRO initiative.
Scholars now widely believe that the
Hampton death was under the FBI’s
initiative. This initiative was a series
of covert and often illegal projects
aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, and
disrupting civil rights organizations,
feminist organizations, peace activists,
the environmentalist movement, and
native groups.
Common tactics used by
COINTELPRO were perjury, witness in-
timidation, and withholding evidence
to falsely imprison and assassinate
leaders of the Panther Party. Among
those on the list was the young Fred
Hampton.
Fred actively fought against the cor-
ruption and injustice Black and Brown
people were being subjected to on a
daily basis. He sought to build a multi-
cultural movement, the Rainbow Coali-
tion, seeking to end the violence
among street gangs.
Let us teach our children and the
new generation of his legacy and fight
against racial inequalities, police vio-
lence, and mass incarceration.
Yes, the same problems Black and
Brown men and women face today still
continue as they did back then. Today,
our criminal justice system and the
failed war on drugs continue to dis-
proportionately impact communities of
color, and it is time we join together to
fight continuously for a more just soci-
ety.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members have 5 legisla-
tive days to revise and extend their re-
marks on the subject of my Special
Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
CHINA’S 100-YEAR PLAN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) for
30 minutes.
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate this opportunity to address the
House on a very important topic. I am
doing part three in a series of Special
Orders on China. This includes the Chi-
nese Communist Party complex, which
is comprised of Xi Jinping, their em-
peror or ruler; the PLA, the People’s
Liberation Army; and the Chinese
Communist Party and members of its
politburo, their ruling class.
China has an amazing history that
spans thousands of years. Its culture
has stayed, for the most part, intact
until the 19th century. There have been
multiple rulers and emperors recorded
in the history books, and, at one point,
China and most of Eurasia were under
the control of Genghis Khan and the
Mongolian Empire.
China went from a major economic
power in the 18th century to a nation
addicted to opium and entered their
century of shame.
China is entering another century of
shame, and it is too sad because China
should be applauded for the success
they have had, to go from where they
were in the 1960s to where they are
today; yet it was done at the expense of
coercion, corruption, a squashing of
human rights, and just not being nice
neighbors in the world.
The purpose of this Special Order is
to bring awareness to Members of Con-
gress and the American people and
other Western-style democracies
around the world to the true intent of
China and what China is doing.
Today, China has become the second
largest economy in the world, and they
will soon eclipse the United States of
America. In order to understand where
China is going, one needs to know
where modern-day China started.
Mao Zedong, in 1949, was a Com-
munist Army fighter, and he became
the chairman of the Chinese Com-
munist Party and set out a 100-year
plan. He had a vision for China. Unfor-
tunately, their vision was to be the
ruler of the modern world.
That 100 years is 2049. They are 70
years into that plan, and they have
worked it very astutely; and, like I
said, they should be applauded. Yet it
was done at the expense of other coun-
tries.
As we know today, in the 21st cen-
tury, with an over $300 billion trade
deficit with the United States of Amer-
ica, that China has gained a lot of their
gains in technology, in science, and in
economics by the theft of intellectual
property.
Just the other day, my son was try-
ing to download a movie. It was a
brand-new movie. It had all Chinese
captions in it, and it was a pirated
movie that is brand new. And China
has already—people from China have
already black-marketed it.
What they have done is they have be-
come so astute at the black market
and stealing intellectual property that
it has cost this country, alone, over
$600 billion, annually.
We have had workshops up here,
through the Department of Homeland
Security, where they show bearings
from different companies that are
American companies that have gone to
China, where China has copied the
product identically. It is not the same
quality, but it looks identical. They
copied the product name, the logo, the
packaging, and they are selling it
cheaper than the manufacturers can
produce it here.
So what they are doing is they are
ruining an American manufacturer.
They are selling their cheap products
here that break down, and it ruins the
reputation of that company, and they
eventually go out.
I can’t tell you how many times I
have had people come into our office,
and I had the privilege of being the
chairman of the Asia, the Pacific, and
Nonproliferation Subcommittee last
Congress. We had businesses come from
all over the world. A lot of them have
gone to China, and they tell us: Our
game plan in China is to go there and
to plan on making our profits in 5
years and get out because, by then, the
Chinese businesspeople and the Chinese
Government have copied our products
and we are competing against our own
product.
This is something that we have cre-
ated an initiative in our office, and we
hope it becomes a foreign policy, and it
is Manufacture the ABC model. That
is, Manufacture Anywhere But China.
Because, again, China—when you hear
what I have to say here, China is tak-
ing that money to take over the world
as far as militarily and economically.
We are going through a major
tectonic shift in world power we
haven’t seen since World War II. This is
something that we have heard from our
generals, we have heard from our busi-
ness people, and it is happening right
in front of us.
And yet every time we buy some-
thing from China, it is benefiting the
Chinese Communist Government.
There is a real clear distinction that
I want to make, or definition: There is
not a separation between a Chinese
business and the Communist Party; it
is all one and the same. Members of the
Chinese Communist Party have to be—
by mandate, have to be—on their board
of directors.
When we have an American company
that goes over there, they have to have
members of the Chinese Communist
Party embedded on their board. When
we have an American company that
goes over there, we have to give up—
our companies give up about 51 percent
of our companies so that the Chinese
Government has the controlling inter-
est.
In addition, they have to give up in-
tellectual property to have the right. It
boggles my mind that an American

company will give up intellectual prop-
erty.
I ask them: Why are you willing to
do this?
They say: Well, they have got such a
huge market. They have got 1.3 billion
people.
I just want to shake them by the
shoulders and say: Don’t you under-
stand that they are taking your infor-
mation, they are taking your intellec-
tual property, and they are competing
with it and using it against you? But,
more importantly, don’t focus on the
1.3 billion people in China. Look at the
rest of the world, because there are 6.4
billion people outside of China. That is
where your market is, and that is
where I would encourage you to manu-
facture, anywhere but China, so that
we are not empowering that nation.
They have a philosophy that states
there cannot be two suns in the sky at
the same time, implying one must be
removed. This has been repeated over
and over again in the last 100 years.
They are 70 years into their 100-year
plan.
Xi Jinping, their leader, has an ini-
tiative called Made in China 2025,
where all things produced and con-
sumed around the globe come from
China, and they have done a great job.
I wish we could applaud their suc-
cess, but not when it comes at the ex-
pense of us or other countries around
the world.
To kind of lay out, again, where
China is going, Xi Jinping stated in
2017 that the era of China has arrived.
No longer will China be made to swal-
low its interests around the world. It is
time for China to take the world’s cen-
ter stage.
Again, it is a reference that there
cannot be two major competing powers
in the world at the same time. One has
to be removed. And Xi Jinping says
this very succinctly in 2017.
So let’s look at the facts. Let’s look
at what China has done to Tibet.
You know, Tibet was a very peaceful
culture. It still is for the people who
are still around. But the Chinese Gov-
ernment, under Deng Xiaoping, infil-
trated the Tibetan region with Han
Chinese, which are the predominant
Chinese sect or personality or sector of
China, and they have overruled the Ti-
betan area and driven the Tibetans out.
Not only that, they have addicted a
lot of the Tibetan monks to heroin, and
so they are repeating what happened in
the heroin wars of China.
In the South China Sea, China has
encroached on sovereign nations
around the area. They have got these
fictitious nine-dash lines that they ad-
here to that are their historical sailing
routes from ancient times. They claim
all that area; since they sailed it in the
past, it is theirs.
It is a ridiculous notion. In fact, the
Philippines sued them at the Court of
Arbitration in The Hague. China lost
the lawsuit, but they ignored the rul-
ing, and so they took over islands.
They have made islands. They have
damaged the coral reefs in that area
where they have made islands—or land
masses, because I refuse to call them
islands since that gives credibility—
and then they have militarized them.
When Xi Jinping was here in 2015
with President Obama, he lied to our
President and the people around the
world and said that he had no intention
of militarizing those land masses that
they dredged from the bottom of the
ocean. Yet, today, they are militarized,
and they have done this over and over
again.
Again, they are making deepwater
ports in areas that are encroaching and
getting closer to the United States
mainland. And they are doing this,
again, to reinforce their goal of being
the sole superpower in the world. Why
else would they be investing all this
money in the five brand-new aircraft
carriers that are going to be the state
of the art?
This is something we see over and
over again.
And they have encroached on the
sovereignty of nations, of the ASEAN
nations—the Philippines is part of
that, Vietnam, Brunei—to the point
where they are encroaching on their
exclusive economic zones and forcing
these countries to yield up their nat-
ural resources so that China can ben-
efit from them.
China has developed what we call the
Belt Road Initiative, or the One Belt,
One Road we hear a lot about. I have
heard it referred to as the One Belt,
One Road, and it goes one way; and it
goes to enhance China, not the coun-
tries where they do economic develop-
ment.
We have seen so many examples
around the world where China has
taken development money to build in-
frastructure projects, where they give
out bad loans.
It kind of reminds me of the robber
barons of the 1800s in this country,
where they go in and give out these
high-interest loans with bad terms.
The country can’t pay it back. They
are a poorer country. And then China
winds up taking over strategic land
masses.
Probably the best poster child exam-
ple of that is what happened in Sri
Lanka, where they went in there. They
lent them money. Sri Lanka couldn’t
pay it back. China foreclosed on that
loan, took over their deepwater sea-
ports.
And again, this is their strategy, to
take over deepwater seaports so that
they can control the shipping lanes.
And then they took over 15,000 acres
of land in addition to that for 99 years,
to the point where the Sri Lankans
have got to go back and renegotiate
this deal.
b 1530
We are seeing them do this in South
America. We are seeing them do this in
Africa, in Central America, and it is
going all over the world. And, again,
you have to go back to what the origi-
nal intent is: To be the sole superpower
in the world.
China has pushed very strategically
to corner the markets on rare Earth
metals. Virtually today, the United
States of America and other coun-
tries—I know for the United States of
America, we get 90 percent of our rare
Earth metals directly from China. The
other 10 percent come from countries
that get it from China.
And we have seen China use the rare
Earth metals market demand that they
have to coerce nations like Japan to
allow them to go into Japanese terri-
torial waters to fish, and Japan had no
other choice. They have threatened to
do that to the United States of Amer-
ica. This is something that is not ac-
ceptable for our national security.
I sit on the agricultural committee,
too, and what I found out is that China
controls 100 percent of the vitamins
and minerals that go into our livestock
feed. This, again, is a national security
interest.
China today controls 85 to 90 percent
of what we call the APIs, that is the
active pharmaceutical ingredients that
go into all of our medicines around the
world. And the bad thing about that is
that they have the controlling interest
of the pharmaceutical ingredients, the
active portion of that, which is bad
enough, but what they do is they have
changed the formulation of the original
drugmaker and manufacturer by using
different reagents and solvents, so it
changes the active ingredients.
So what we have found out is that
the product is tainted, it is not as ef-
fective. And we found cases where
there is a high risk of cancer from
using these products. And, unfortu-
nately, some of these products are
anti-cancer drugs that are, in turn,
causing cancer to the rate of one in
6,000.
Again, this is something that we
need to understand: Every time we buy
a product and it comes from China, we
are reinforcing this, and we are grow-
ing their economy stronger and their
military stronger.
We can look at their other economic
threats that they have done. Back in
2013 and 2014 South Korea was changing
presidents. South Korea was being
taunted by North Korea, and they con-
tinually have been, about being at-
tacked. And so they took one of our
THAAD systems, which is a terminal
high altitude area defense mechanism,
and China retaliated, not against
North Korea that was making all the
threatening gestures, but they retali-
ated against South Korea. And the rea-
son they do this is because South
Korea is a western-style democracy,
which would threaten China.
So the way they retaliated against
South Korea is they went after their
largest department chain called Lotte
Department Stores. They virtually
shut them down in mainland China.
They went after Hyundai. Hyundai
sales dropped precipitously. They re-
voked tourism visas going to South
Korea. So, instead of going after North
Korea for these provocative gestures,

they go after South Korea for their
own defense. And then the agreement
we had after the Korean conflict was
that we would provide them defensive
mechanisms.
And so, we see the same thing going
on in Hong Kong today. The thing I
have learned, and the thing that is
very evident is, China cannot exist
around a western-style democracy
where freedom of speech, freedom of re-
ligion, freedom of thought is expressed,
because in China the highest power in
the Chinese Communist Party is the
party. And it is their doctrine. So you
can’t have people that are free think-
ing, and it is very self-evident when
you see what is going on in Hong Kong
today.
We are approaching 7 months of pro-
tests in Hong Kong, where you have
over 25 percent of the population pro-
testing because what China did is
through their chief executive officer,
Carrie Lam—who is a puppet of Bei-
jing—she introduced an extradition
bill.
And when Hong Kong was turned
over from Great Britain back to China
in 1997, there was a 50-year period of
time where Hong Kong was supposed to
be a self-ruled autonomous region with
an independent judiciary system.
Twenty-two years into it, Xi Jinping,
the emperor of China, has said that as
far as he is concerned that deal is null
and void. And so they went ahead and
put in this extradition bill, which
breaks their judicial system, and it
caused the protests.
And we have seen this over and over
again, the way China did this with the
Tibetans. They did it in Tiananmen
Square, where they had a mass mas-
sacre of people that were standing up
for democracy and freedom back in the
1980s. And here we are, we are seeing it
happen again, and China is not backing
off on the suppression of human rights.
We got visited by the students of
Hong Kong that were in the protests.
They came to our office. These are true
freedom fighters in the modern 21st
century. These students were standing
up, and these were the ones that were
burning the Chinese flag, and they
were the ones waving the American
flag because of what that represents
around the world.
And our American flag is bigger than
a Presidency, it is bigger than a Repub-
lican party or a Democratic party. It is
an ideal that people around the world
look at as a model of what they want
to accomplish. And it is great to know
that this body passed the Hong Kong
Democracy Act this week, and it is a
strong signal to put sanctions on the
people of China who have said to the
people of Hong Kong that no form of
punishment can be too strict or strong
for the protestors, that they must be
brought into line.
And then we can look at the Xinjiang
province where it is mostly a Chinese
Muslim province. There is approxi-
mately 10 million Uighurs that live in
that area. The Uighurs are Chinese
Muslims. They come from different
areas, Kyrgyzstan and all that region
of western China. And they practice
their Muslim faith. But China, again,
can’t be threatened by anything that is
outside the Chinese Communist Party
doctrine.
And so what they have done is they
have built modern day concentration
camps where over a million, the esti-
mates are one to two million, Uighurs
are placed into these reeducation
camps. And I have met with the stu-
dents and the children of people that
have been interned in these camps, and
they were CPAs, their parents, they
were doctors, they were pharmacists,
they were lawyers, and they were pro-
fessional people. But the Chinese Gov-
ernment says these people needed to be
retrained so that they could have ade-
quate jobs to provide for their families.
I remember the words of Dwight Ei-
senhower when he went into Nazi Ger-
many and he saw the concentration
camps, and he said, ‘‘Never again.’’ And
if we, as a civil society of free-thinking
people around the world, are allowing
this to happen, shame on us. And we
are allowing this to happen, again,
every time we buy a product that is
made in China. The Uighurs that go to
these reeducation camps, they are
using them as slave labor. It is well
documented.
The other thing I found interesting
in our Foreign Affairs Committee is we
had a hearing on this, and they were
telling us about the crematoriums they
have. Now, crematoriums are obviously
there to cremate people after they are
dead.
But my question is: Why is it in their
advertisement, they are asking for
armed people that are well at fighting
to guard these crematoriums? If you
are going to cremate dead people, why
do you need armed guards at the
crematoriums? Unless they are not
dead?
And, again, we have seen this happen
in history. And this is going on today.
And it is something that the American
people need to wake up to. I know
Members of this body are waking up to
it. But it is people around the world
that need to wake up to this and shun
China until China changes their behav-
ior. We can’t make them do it, but we
can change our habits and buy else-
where and have people produce prod-
ucts everywhere else.
We were proud to pass in the last
Congress the BUILD Act, which devel-
ops the United States International
Development Finance Corporation.
This is something that we can offer to
countries as a way to do development
finance in other countries. We can
partner up with countries that have a
development finance corporation like
Japan, the U.K., Australia, Great Brit-
ain, and we can do major infrastruc-
ture projects.
The difference between us doing that
and China is we are going to do it for
the development and the betterment of
that country, understanding that if we
help them build an economic base
through infrastructure, they will de-
velop an economy, and through that
economy we will develop more trade
and so then that country benefits, not
China.
We have seen China go into Cam-
bodia, bring in Chinese workers, Chi-
nese material, build casinos. They
build Chinese restaurants, Chinese ho-
tels that are run, controlled, and
worked by Chinese nationals, not the
people of Cambodia. So there again, it
is an example of how China comes in
and does these projects for the benefit
of China, not for the benefit of the
local economy.
I was down in South America, and I
was talking to one of the Members of
Congress down there whose brother
happened to be a mayor of one of the
small towns. The Chinese embassy had
given that mayor two fire trucks. Now,
the Congressman was going to have a
meeting with the country of Taiwan,
and the Chinese embassy found out
about it. And they didn’t call the Con-
gressman in Chile, they called the
mayor, his brother, and said, If your
brother takes that meeting with Tai-
wan, you will not get any more favors
from us. And this is just one of their
ways of underhandedness and coercion
that they do to force people to do what
they want.
In China today they have the largest
collection of CCT cameras, which are
the closed-circuit television cameras
that monitor their citizens. So today
in China they have what they call the
good citizen score. They monitor peo-
ple, and if you don’t do something
properly, like you jaywalk or you went
through a red light or you threw some-
thing on the ground, it is scored. You
don’t know what your score is, but you
will find out if you want to go to a res-
taurant, they may prevent you from
going in there. If you want to travel,
they will prevent you from traveling.
But you won’t find out until you show
up. And this is a way to control their
people because, again, the thing they
fear most is free thought.
In China what we do know is Xi
Jinping came from a family that was
an elite family. His father was one of
the leaders of the Communist Party.
But he wanted Xi Jinping to under-
stand the rural life, so in his teenage
years they sent him out to a rural area
where he had to live in a cage and
dwell in a cage in a village. He did
that, so today he can relate to people
that are out in the rural areas.
When he became powerful and moved
up in the political process, and this is
around 2012, 2013, what he did is he
started to eliminate anybody that was
a potential threat to him. So they ei-
ther did forced retirement, and in the
five biggest cities in China today the
people that were ruling, those mayors
either had forced retirement or they
disappeared, or they are in prison. He
has replaced them with pretty much
henchmen of his that will follow his or-
ders. They are doing this in their own

is to be the dominant power in the
world and to make us secondary or
worse.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized.
HONG KONG
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
Sunday, as we Americans savored the
holiday weekend and gave thanks for
our liberty, the people of Hong Kong
took to the streets to demand their
own. Many waved American flags.
Hongkongers are continuing to speak
up for the freedoms and the autonomy
that Beijing has slowly tried to erode.
As long as Beijing does not relent, it
looks like the people of Hong Kong are
not going to relent either. In local elec-
tions last week that were largely sym-
bolic, pro-democracy candidates lit-
erally blew away the candidates the
Chinese Communist Party would have
preferred in a literal landslide. Not
even Beijing’s propagandists can
credibly blame this massive display of
popular revulsion at their
authoritarianism on the ‘‘black hand’’
of the West. In spite of China’s propa-
ganda, the West should not stay silent
as Beijing sneaks to snuff out dissent
in Hong Kong.
Just a few days prior, the Congress
and President Trump had sent our
clearest signal yet that, yes, the
United States of America stands with
Hong Kong. The Senate unanimously
passed the Hong Kong Human Rights
and Democracy Act, and the President
signed it into law. It delivered impor-
tant updates to the original U.S.-Hong
Kong Policy Act, which I authored
back in 1992. Preserving freedom and
promoting democracy has required con-
stant vigilance with Hongkongers since
Communist China assumed control of
the region.
I have been proud to stand with that
effort. With my original legislation, we
paved the way for cooperation between
Hong Kong and the United States, codi-
fying and strengthening economic ties
and facilitating the robust exchange of
ideas and support of greater democracy
in the autonomous region. We have laid
the foundation for a U.S.-Hong Kong
relationship that has strengthened
both their society and ours and created
leverage to hold Beijing accountable.
Back in 1992, I observed that democ-
racy was ‘‘finally gaining a tenuous
foothold in Hong Kong.’’ Recent
months certainly have reminded us
just how tenuous that foothold can be
when an authoritarian country flexes
its muscles. They reminded us just how
intent Beijing remains on exporting its
oppressive surveillance state not just
within mainland China but also into
Hong Kong and, frankly, all around the
world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6830 December 4, 2019
The unanimous Senate vote for ex-
panded oversight and firm responses to
Beijing was welcomed news on the
streets of Hong Kong, not because the
U.S. Senate or international nonprofits
or anybody else is ginning up these
protests, as Beijing wants people to be-
lieve, but because those speaking out
for freedom recognize a friend of free-
dom when they see one.
It has been funny to see how invested
Beijing is in these conspiracy theories
that this organic protest movement is
actually the work of shadowy puppet-
eers. Just a few days ago, the Chinese
Communist Party’s Foreign Ministry
took the panicked and laughable step
of ‘‘sanctioning’’ several American
nonprofits and NGOs, such as the Inter-
national Republican Institute, the Na-
tional Democratic Institute, and the
National Endowment for Democracy.
Like I said, it is laughable. I admire
the heck out of these organizations,
but they aren’t exactly in the business
of commanding millions of people from
Hong Kong to Beirut, to Baghdad, to
Tehran to take to the streets. They are
not that good.
Here is the business they are in:
speaking up for the timeless and uni-
versal principles of basic human free-
dom. They help keep the torch lit. It is
the brave souls around the world who
want better lives for themselves and
their children who pick up the ball and
run with it for themselves.
The junior varsity tantrum that Bei-
jing is throwing against these U.S.-
based organizations is literally com-
ical. It puts the Communist Party’s
hypersensitivity on full display. It is
the same flailing that we see from
other regimes from Moscow to Tehran,
driven by the same aggressive, authori-
tarian instincts that push social media
propaganda, street corner surveillance,
police violence, and the modern-day
gulags where China is imprisoning and
brutalizing the Uighur people. These
are the forces history never judges
kindly. I am proud of the people of
Hong Kong. I am proud of the Senate’s
latest action to support them, and I am
proud to continue standing alongside
them in their journey to true self-de-
termination.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, nearly every day I
have come to the floor to talk about
the key pieces of legislation that we
will only be able to complete with bi-
partisan cooperation—essential things
like funding for the entirety of our
Federal Government, something we
have to do, including funding for our
men and women in uniform; the money
for the tools and the training and the
weapons that our volunteer service-
members need to complete their mis-
sions; things like the National Defense
Authorization Act, which Congress has
passed every single year, always on a
bipartisan basis, for the last 58 years.
This is literally the bill that reauthor-
izes the U.S. military. It could not be
more basic or fundamental.
So it is dismaying that my Demo-
cratic colleagues have seen fit to hold
these basic duties hostage for the sake
of picking fights with the White House,
for advancing a partisan domestic
agenda. It is disappointing that Speak-
er PELOSI and the Democratic leader
have abandoned their own written
promises that they would not make our
bipartisan appropriations processes
conditioned on poison pills, policy rid-
ers, or changes to Presidential transfer
authorities. All those commitments
were made in the summer. Even though
they put that in writing, they have
chosen to shoehorn partisan demands
right back into the process. So we are
stalled. We are stalled because the
agreement we all reached in the sum-
mer has not been honored by the other
side.
Today I want to keep this really sim-
ple. The Senate’s dispensation on that
Hong Kong legislation proves that we
can still work together when our core
principles and our national interest are
at stake. Of course, those things are
exactly what is at stake with defense
funding and the NDAA. So it is way
past time—we are in December—to get
serious.
Chairman SHELBY and Chairwoman
LOWEY have agreed on subcommittee
allocations. Chairman INHOFE and Sen-
ator REED have made strides on our bi-
partisan NDAA. I would implore my
Democratic friends: Please stop gam-
bling our national security on the rou-
lette wheel of domestic politics. Please
stop that. Stop putting political the-
ater ahead of our troops.
We all know this is a heated political
moment, but domestic politics do not
excuse our men and women in uniform
from doing their duties. So they cannot
excuse our Democratic colleagues from
doing theirs. Our servicemembers need
Congress to have their backs. We can
only fund the government if it is bipar-
tisan. We can only pass an NDAA if it
is bipartisan.
The roadmaps are in hand. We have
the same traditions that have yielded
58 bipartisan NDAAs in a row, and we
have the bipartisan agreement that ev-
eryone signed just a few months ago
when Speaker PELOSI and the Demo-
cratic leader promised in writing they
wouldn’t throw partisan wrenches into
appropriations.
Our country can’t afford for the
Democrats to obsess over impeachment
and obstruct everything else. Look,
let’s use these roadmaps. Let’s get
these things accomplished for the
American people.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
5G TECHNOLOGY
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, 4G tech-
nology is pretty amazing. When I talk
about 4G technology, that stands for
fourth generation. On your
smartphone, it might say LTE, but it
is the fourth generation of technology
that we have available to us on our
wireless devices. We can FaceTime
with family members across the coun-
try, order dinner or groceries without
leaving our couches, watch a football
game on the go with our phones, adjust
the heat in our houses before we actu-
ally get home, carry around an entire
library on a tablet the size of one small
book, deposit a check without actually
visiting the bank, and the list goes on.
As amazing as 4G technology is, it
can’t hold a candle to 5G, or fifth gen-
eration technology. 5G mobile
broadband technology will deliver
speeds that will be up to 100 times fast-
er than what today’s technology can
deliver. Think about that—downloads
that will be 100 times faster than what
we have today. It will be vastly more
responsive than 4G technology. It will
be able to connect 100 times the num-
ber of devices that can be connected
with 4G. That is pretty hard to imag-
ine, really. Our phones and computers
today seem pretty fast and responsive,
but 5G will be much, much faster.
While that will make it even easier
to do the things we do today, like
check our email or stream our favorite
shows, the biggest benefits of 5G will
lie in the other technologies it will en-
able. For example, 5G will have the po-
tential to pave the way for the wide-
spread adoption of precision agri-
culture, which uses tools like robotics
and remote monitoring to help farmers
manage their fields and boost their
crop yields. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates that precision
agriculture will reduce farmers’ oper-
ational costs by up to $25 per acre and
increase farmers’ yields by up to 70 per-
cent by the year 2050.
5G will pave the way for automated
vehicles, which will have the potential
to dramatically reduce traffic injuries
and fatalities. There are 37,000 people
lost every year on America’s highways
due to traffic accidents. Over 90 per-
cent of those are as a result of human
error—driving while under the influ-
ence, driving while distracted. 5G tech-

The technology for 5G is already
here. Several cities around the United
States, including my hometown of
Sioux Falls, have already unveiled lim-
ited 5G networks, but there is more
work to do before we all can start to
see the benefits of 5G on our phones.
The widespread deployment of 5G
will require two things: adequate spec-
trum and adequate infrastructure.
While 4G relies on traditional cell
phone towers, 5G technology will also
require small antennas called small

cells that can often be attached to ex-
isting infrastructure like utility poles
or buildings.
Earlier this year, I introduced legis-
lation called the STREAMLINE Act to
make it easier for companies to deploy
these small cells so that we can get the
infrastructure in place for 5G tech-
nology. I have also spent a lot of time
focusing on securing adequate spec-
trum for 5G.
Last year, the President signed into
law my bipartisan bill called the MO-
BILE NOW Act. It was legislation that
I introduced to help secure adequate
spectrum and to facilitate next-genera-
tion infrastructure. Tomorrow, in my
role as chairman of the Commerce Sub-
committee on Communications, Tech-
nology, Innovation and the Internet, I
will be chairing a hearing looking at
the progress that has been made in im-
plementing the MOBILE NOW Act. We
have a great slate of witnesses testi-
fying tomorrow, including Sioux Falls
Mayor Paul TenHaken, who has driven
the implementation of advanced mo-
bile broadband technology in Sioux
Falls, SD.
The MOBILE NOW Act has helped us
make progress toward the deployment
of 5G, particularly in identifying li-
censed spectrum that can be used to
support 5G deployment in more rural
areas of the country.
MOBILE NOW also recognized the
critical role that unlicensed spectrum
plays in the development of 5G and in
the larger communications landscape.
Wi-fi operating on unlicensed spectrum
will have an increasing role as we con-
tinue to connect more devices in the 5G
era.
There is more work to be done,
though. While we have made good
progress on securing low- and high-
band spectrum, China and South Korea
are ahead of us in opening up mid-band
spectrum for 5G. We don’t want to lose
out to China and South Korea on 5G, so
we need to substantially increase the
amount of mid-band spectrum avail-
able to U.S. companies.
Senator WICKER and I recently intro-
duced legislation to facilitate the rapid
acquisition of mid-band spectrum. Our
5G Spectrum Act would bring a sub-
stantial amount of mid-band spectrum
to market for U.S. companies ready to
deploy robust 5G networks.
In addition to fostering tremendous
technological breakthroughs in every-
thing from agriculture to energy, 5G
has the potential to add $500 billion to
the economy and to create literally
millions of new jobs. But in order to
achieve those economic benefits, we
need to stay at the head of the 5G revo-
lution.
The United States lagged behind
other countries in deploying 2G and 3G
technology, which had real economic
consequences. Europe, for example,
took the lead in 2G and cornered most
of the market in sales of networking
equipment and telecom hardware.
As 4G emerged, however, the U.S.
wireless industry stepped forward, in-
vesting billions in 4G deployment. The
government also took steps to support
the wireless industry, freeing up spec-
trum and making it easier to deploy
the necessary infrastructure. That is
what we have to do again today. If we
want to stay at the head of the race to
5G, the government needs to make sure
that wireless companies have access to
the necessary spectrum and the ability
to efficiently deploy small cell infra-
structure.
We are right on the edge of the 5G
revolution, and I am confident that the
United States can lead the world in 5G,
just like we did with 4G. We just need
to take the last few steps to enable
widespread 5G deployment.
I look forward to talking with indi-
viduals on the frontlines of 5G deploy-
ment at the hearing tomorrow. I will
continue to work with my colleagues
to ensure that both the spectrum and
the infrastructure are in place for 5G
technology.
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized.
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday afternoon, the majority on the
House Intelligence Committee released
a report on the evidence it has exam-
ined thus far in the impeachment in-
quiry into President Trump. The report
asserted that the inquiry has ‘‘uncov-
ered a months-long effort by President
Trump to use the powers of his office
to solicit foreign interference on his
behalf in the 2020 election,’’ going on to
say that the ‘‘President placed his own
personal and political interests above
the national interests of the United
States.’’
Those are extremely serious charges,
and the conduct they describe is un-
doubtedly worthy of congressional in-
vestigation, which is precisely what
the House impeachment inquiry is de-
signed to do.
Whatever your party affiliation, it is
up to us in Congress—and particularly
in the Senate—to examine the evi-
dence, remain impartial, and treat this
matter with the seriousness it de-
serves. But at the moment, too many
Members of the President’s party are
stretching the bounds of truth in an at-
tempt to defend the President’s behav-
ior. Certain Members on the other side
have parroted the fiction invented by
Vladimir Putin’s intelligence services
that Ukraine, not just Putin, inter-
fered in the 2016 elections. One Member
repeated this falsehood, recanted on
live television, and then went back to
making similar comments a few days
later.
Yesterday, Leader MCCONNELL, when
asked to set the record straight, said
that it was a matter for the intel-
ligence committees to look into.
Well, Leader MCCONNELL, the intel-
ligence committees have looked at it.
In fact, according to reports, the Re-
publican-led Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee investigated the allegations
that Ukraine interfered in the 2016
election and found no evidence to sup-
port the claims. The Republican-led In-
telligence Committee found no evi-
dence, and Leader MCCONNELL and so
many of our Republican friends, in feb-
rile obeisance to Donald Trump and his
falsehoods and lies, have refused to
even rebut that.
It is a dark day for America when a
foreign leader who is our enemy can
spread a false truth and is either de-
fended or there is a lack of rebuttal
from our Republican colleagues. What
the heck is going on here in this Amer-
ica?
David Hale, the No. 3 official at
President Trump’s State Department,
was asked by Senator MENENDEZ yes-
terday whether he was aware of any
evidence of Ukrainian interference in
2016. He said: I am not. He was not
aware. Fiona Hill, another Trump ap-
pointee and a former NSC official, tes-
tified under oath that it was ‘‘a fic-
tional narrative.’’
There is no doubt that the idea of
Ukrainian interference in 2016 is a hoax
perpetrated by Putin’s intelligence
services, echoed by FOX News and aco-
lytes of President Trump’s, who simi-
larly have shown no regard for truth—
none.
The fact that Republican Senators
are repeating and amplifying this fic-
tion or playing coy about it, as Leader
MCCONNELL is, is just wrong for Amer-
ica, wrong for the future of our coun-
try—a turning point, a dark point, in
our history. And in my view, it shows
the extreme depths—the febrile
depths—to which certain Members on
the other side will stoop to provide
cover to a President accused of serious
wrongdoing—a President who almost
no American believes is credible any
longer.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, on another matter
where we could use some bipartisan-
ship, in 16 days, funding for the govern-
ment will expire. We have several im-
portant pieces in place to avoid a shut-
down, including the recent agreement
on allocations known as 302(b)s. Sev-
eral sticking points remain, but over-
all, this is good news because I believe,
left to our own devices, Congress could
work through the final issues and
make sure the government stays open.
However, a report came out yester-
day suggesting President Trump may
refuse to sign any funding agreement
without securing funding for his border
wall first. If all of this seems a little
familiar, it is because it is. Nearly a

year ago exactly, the President
torpedoed bipartisan negotiations by
demanding the very same thing—fund-
ing for his border wall—and the result
was the longest government shutdown
in history.
Funding for a border wall was a non-
starter for Democrats then, and it re-
mains a nonstarter for Democrats now.
The votes did not exist even within the
President’s own party then, and they
have not materialized now.
We had hoped the President had
learned his lesson, but it appears that
exactly a year after losing this same
battle, the President is considering a
repeat of history and another Trump
shutdown.
I hope cooler heads will prevail—I be-
lieve they will—but I would warn
President Trump and my Republican
colleagues, the last Trump shutdown
was terrible for the American people
and terrible for Republicans. It is in all
of our interests to keep the President
away from the appropriations process
and avoid another Trump shutdown be-
fore Christmas.
SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE
PROGRAM
Mr. President, finally, on SNAP,
today the Trump administration an-
nounced it had completed a new rule
that would potentially throw hundreds
of thousands of needy Americans off
food assistance.
Let me repeat. Hundreds of thou-
sands of people who need food and have
struggled to find employment would be
kicked off Federal food assistance
under a new Trump administration
rule.
Right now, there are about 37 million
Americans who receive benefits under
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program. The vast majority of them
work, but they don’t earn enough to
feed their families, and those who don’t
qualify for assistance for 3 months out
of every 3 years.
Under the new rule, the Trump ad-
ministration would trample on States’
abilities to request waivers to these
strict time limits in areas of great un-
employment. Nearly every State in the
Union has requested a waiver at one
point or another.
The Trump administration is driving
the vulnerable into hunger just as the
Christmas season approaches. It is
heartless, it is cruel, and it exposes a
deep and shameful cruelness and hy-
pocrisy in this administration.
One of the Trump administration’s
justifications for these cuts is that
they will save the government money.
Well, 2 years ago this very month, the
Trump administration blew a more
than trillion-dollar hole in our deficit
with a gargantuan tax cut for corpora-
tions and the ultra-rich. The Trump
administration argued it was money
well spent. Now, the same administra-
tion says we have to pinch pennies
when it comes to helping the hungry,
particularly around Christmastime?
This makes the Grinch look charitable.
The same Trump administration that
has steered millions of dollars to
wealthy agribusinesses and foreign-
owned entities is now saying they need
to save money by cutting off food aid
to poor families who need it. This is
jarring hypocrisy, and it shows clear as
day where this administration’s prior-
ities clearly lie—with the rich and pow-
erful, not the most vulnerable members
of our society.
I yield the floor.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Oklahoma.
NATIONAL DEBT
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we
have a debt issue in America. For some
reason, we are losing track of that. The
economy is so good right now. Unem-
ployment is at historic numbers. The
inflation numbers have stayed down.
More Americans are bringing home
more take-home pay, which means
they can buy more stuff. More job op-
portunities are out there. In fact, we
literally have 1.5 million more job
openings in America than we have peo-
ple looking for work in America.
With the economy going so well right
now, everyone is losing track of the
debt and deficit, which are not going
well right now. Last year, the Federal
Treasury received more tax revenues
than it has ever received in the history
of the United States, which is sur-
prising to some folks I have talked to
who said that there was a big tax cut in
2017, so that would mean tax revenue
would go down. It didn’t. It went up.
When that tax cut occurred, more
people were able to bring home more
money and to spend more, which cre-
ated more jobs. There was more invest-
ment, and the economy charged up. So
we actually have more revenue coming
in now than we used to have, but we
still have a trillion-dollar deficit. That
is the amount of overspending in a sin-
gle year. We have the highest amount
of revenue we have ever had. Yet we
have epic levels of deficit spending,
adding to $23 trillion in total debt as a
nation—$23 trillion. It is a number
none of us can even fathom.
We are approaching a time when it
would take the income of every single
American for the entire year to be col-
lected as taxes to pay off our debt. We
are at 95 percent total debt to GDP.
These kinds of numbers can’t be sus-
tained, and everyone quietly knows it
in the back of their mind, but dealing
with debt and deficit seem to be some-
thing we will deal with in the future—
someday, someday, someday.
I am here to encourage this body to
say that we should be taking on the
issues of debt and deficit now. The two
things that have to occur in order to
get on top of our debt and deficit are to
get a growing economy with growing
revenues—we have that now—and then
we have to deal with Federal spending.
What would it take to manage Fed-
eral spending? We are so far out of bal-
ance. A trillion dollars—literally we
could shut down the entire Department
of Defense, the Department of Edu-
cation, the State Department—we
could close down every single one of
those, and we still wouldn’t balance in
a year. And no one would propose doing
that. There is no 1-year fix to trying to
get on top of our deficit; this will be a
multiyear process.
Just to state how bad it has become,
if we chipped away at our deficit for
the next 10 years—for 10 years, chipped
away at our deficit to get us back to
just balance—and then we had a $100
billion surplus the next year, which
would be an enormous surplus, with a
$100 billion surplus—it would take us
230 years in a row of having a $100 bil-
lion surplus in our Treasury just to
deal with our debt. It would take 230
years in a row of $100 billion surpluses.
Again, we are not just out of balance;
we are way out of balance. There is no
one secret thing we can do to get us
back on track, but we do need to get
started. That is why our team puts out
something we call ‘‘Federal Fumbles.’’
The ‘‘Federal Fumbles’’ guide is some-
thing we put out every single year. It
is just a group of ideas. It is no magic
bullet. It is just something our office
puts out that looks at areas of ineffi-
ciency across the Federal Government
and ask: Why is this happening the way
it is happening, and what would happen
if we continue doing the same things
we are doing? Are there areas where we
can save money and that we would be
OK with as a group?
We are not trying to put out partisan
ideas; we are just putting out ideas.
Quite frankly, the ‘‘Federal Fumbles’’
guide is not a confrontation for this
body; it is the opening salvo in a con-
versation. We are bringing our ideas.
You may have different ideas. Great.
Bring yours. Let’s try to figure out
how to solve this together because this
last year, we paid $371 billion just in
interest payments on our debt. This
fiscal year, we paid $423 billion just in
interest. That is $423 billion that is not
going to healthcare, transportation,
the basic structure of our government,
or the national defense. It is $423 bil-
lion spent on interest payments, and it
just goes away.
We are asking questions as we put
out this Federal Fumbles guide. How
do we solve this? What are some ideas?
We have simple questions such as,
why did the Social Security office pay
$11.6 million to deceased beneficiaries
in Puerto Rico?
We ask questions such as, why did
the government pay almost half a bil-
lion dollars last year on temporary
tents—not buying them, renting tem-
porary tents—along our southern bor-
der? Was there a better way that could
have been done other than half a bil-
lion dollars in cost?
We have some questions about the 21
government shutdowns that have oc-
curred in the last 40 years, including
the one earlier this year. That shut-
down cost the Federal taxpayer over $4
billion.
We ask straightforward questions
about things like tax credits. If you
like the Tesla that you pull up next to

at a stoplight and you gaze at its beau-
ty and think that is a beautiful car,
well, great, I am glad you like it be-
cause you helped pay for it. All of
those Teslas that are on the road—
$7,500 of the cost of that Tesla was paid
by you, the Federal taxpayer. So what
you should do at a stoplight is roll
down your window and say to the per-
son driving the Tesla: It is my turn. I
helped pay for the car. Why don’t you
let me drive it for the rest of the day?
We ask questions about grants for
such things as sea lions in Russia be-
cause the U.S. taxpayer gave almost $2
million to study sea lions in Russia
last year. We spent $600,000 doing a doc-
umentary on Joseph Stalin. We spent a
big chunk of money actually studying
the Russian flu in 1889. Why did we do
that?
Some of these things are small, and
some of them are large.
We laid out a proposal dealing with
prescription drugs because the way the
tiering is done on prescription drugs
now costs the Federal taxpayer $22 bil-
lion. That is because generic drugs
were placed on a higher cost branded
tier, so the Federal taxpayer and the
consumer end up paying not the ge-
neric price but the more expensive
branded price when they could have
paid the lower price. That is a cost of
$22 billion for just that one piece.
We laid out a whole set of ideas and
said: Let’s just look at them together.
This Congress passed $380 million
that was sent out to the States to help
with election security. After the Rus-
sians were clearly trying to interfere
with our elections in 2016, we decided
to do something about it to help our
States. So $380 million was sent out to
the States to do the work that was
needed to be done to upgrade election
security equipment and to be prepared
for 2020.
As of this last July, of the $380 mil-
lion sent to the States, the States have
only spent a little over $100 million.
They have literally banked the other
$250 million and just saved it and said:
We will use it sometime. The 2020 elec-
tions are coming. The money was allo-
cated, but it has not actually been
spent and used for election security.
We want to highlight issues and find
ways to solve them. We didn’t try to
bring partisan ideas; we just brought
ideas.
This is our fifth volume. We have had
other editions that dealt with other
issues that need to be resolved. In the
back of the book, we actually put out
what we call the ‘‘Touchdowns’’ and
the forward progress. These are some of
the things we listed in previous
versions that we actually looked at and
can say we have made some progress on
these things in trying to actually solve
them. That is because at times we com-
plain about what is happening in gov-
ernment, but we don’t identify the
good things, and there are a lot of good
things that are actually happening.
This Senate passed the GREAT Act.
The GREAT Act dramatically in-
creases the way we handle data on
grants. About $600 billion a year in the
Federal Government is spent just on
grants. We think there needs to be
greater oversight on that, and this
Senate has agreed. This Senate has
sent the GREAT Act over to the House
and has said: Let’s try to resolve how
we can be more effective in how we do
grants and be more transparent in the
process and streamline the data itself
to make it easier on those requesting a
grant, as well as allowing for more
transparency in where the Federal dol-
lars are going. We don’t want to just
complain about the way grants are
done; we want to try to actually fix it.
We highlight multiple other areas
where we have made real progress in
the past year tackling some of the
things we have listed in previous
versions of ‘‘Federal Fumbles.’’
But I do want to remind this body
that while we talk about some of these
hard issues, we often break into Repub-
lican-Democratic fights over hard
issues. America is more than an econ-
omy, and while the economy is ex-
tremely important, we are Americans.
We are Americans together. While we
struggle to deal with hard issues, such
as debt and deficit and what is going to
be done to resolve this, we just can’t
conveniently go into our corners and
make speeches and say that we have
tried; we have to sit down and do hard
things and do hard things together.
That is why we are opening this con-
versation. That is why we keep this
conversation going, because I do be-
lieve that while the economy is impor-
tant, who we are and how we value
each other is just as important because
we have the responsibility to solve
this. Again, other offices may have
other ideas on how to resolve it. Great.
Let’s bring all those ideas together.
Let’s get 100 books like this, and every-
one bring their ideas. Then let’s actu-
ally do the work to solve this in the fu-
ture.
We are Americans. We do hard
things. This one is going to be hard,
and it is going to take a long time, but
it doesn’t get easier if we don’t start,
and it doesn’t get done until we begin.
So I am challenging us today to begin.
Let’s deal with the ways we have fum-
bled the ball in the past, and let’s solve
our debt and deficit together over the
years into the future.
With that, I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE
AGREEMENT
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am
on the floor today to urge the U.S.
Congress to do the right thing, and
that is to allow a vote on this new
agreement between Mexico and Canada
and the United States.
Unbelievably, this agreement was ne-
gotiated a year ago—they signed it at
the end of November last year—and yet
for a year now, Congress has refused to
take it up. It has got to go to the
House of Representatives first, and
Speaker PELOSI and the House Demo-
crats who control that body have not
been willing to at least take it to the
floor for a vote.
The agreement is such a big improve-
ment over the status quo. The status
quo is the NAFTA agreement, which is
25 years old. The new agreement, which
was negotiated a year ago, gives some-
thing that Canada wants, Mexico
wants, and the United States wants.
We want it because it is really impor-
tant to us.
It is particularly important to my
home State of Ohio. I will tell you our
No. 1 trading partner by far is Canada.
We send about 40 percent of our exports
to one country: Canada. So to have a
better agreement with our biggest
trading partner—and our second big-
gest trading partner, which is Mexico—
is really important. Alongside Mexico,
our trade with Canada accounts for
about $28 billion a year.
I am hearing a lot about it. I am
hearing from Ohio farmers. They have
had a tough time. A combination of
bad weather, a combination of shrink-
ing markets for them in China, and a
combination of low commodity prices
going in to the bad weather period last
year has made it really tough for farm-
ers. A lot of them are having a very dif-
ficult time making ends meet this
year.
They see the USMCA for what it is,
an expansion of their market. They can
sell more stuff to Canada and to Mex-
ico, and that will help them improve
their prices and help them to be able to
get through this tough period, so for
them, it is a light at the end of the
tunnel. If we can get this new trade
agreement passed, it means expanded
markets for dairy products, for pork,
for corn and soybeans, and other com-
modities. Get those prices up, and give
our farmers a chance to compete on a
level playing field. This is a good thing.
That is why they are all for it.
Businesses really want the USMCA
passed. By the way, I hear mostly from
small businesses about this because
they increasingly have looked to mar-
kets overseas—particularly Canada and
Mexico in the State of Ohio—and they
are concerned that if we do not put this
agreement forward, we are going to
have a lot of uncertainty out there,
and they are going to sell less stuff,
rather than more stuff, to these coun-
tries.
So a lot of small manufacturers in
particular sell a lot from Ohio to Can-
ada and to Mexico, and they tell me
they want this agreement passed—and
passed now—because it will really help
them. My colleagues here in the Senate

have to be hearing the same thing.
When they go home, they have to be
hearing from these same people be-
cause all around the country, when
people look at this agreement, they
say: Of course, this is better than the
status quo for my business. Workers,
farmers, service providers will all ben-
efit.
Taken together, our neighbors in
Canada and Mexico now make up the
biggest foreign market for U.S. goods
anywhere, so these two countries to-
gether combined are the biggest mar-
ket anywhere in the world. One-third
of all American exports in 2019 have
gone to Canada or Mexico, way ahead
of all foreign markets. It is about 12
million jobs, so 12 million jobs nation-
ally depend on trade with Canada and
Mexico.
I am a former trade lawyer myself—
a recovering trade lawyer—and I do not
practice it today, but I did at one time.
I am also a former member of the trade
committee in the House of Representa-
tives, called the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, and today, I am a member of
the Senate Finance Committee, which
is the trade committee over here. In
the interim, I was U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative for President George W.
Bush. I will tell you, from all the expe-
riences that I have had in trade, I have
learned one lesson, which is, yes, it is
complicated, trade has a lot of nu-
ances, it is politically difficult, but it
is really important to our economy.
Why? Because we have got about 5
percent of the world’s population and
about 25 percent of the economy here,
so it is in our interest to access that
other 95 percent of consumers outside
of America in order to keep America as
a prosperous country.
That is what these trade agreements
tend to do. The problem with the
NAFTA agreement, the current one, is
that it is 25 years old, and it needs to
be updated. You know, it is one of the
oldest trade agreements we have, and
it is one that is fraught with problems
right now, some of which are fixed in
this USMCA.
The USMCA, the successor to it, is a
lot better. It creates a more balanced
and more healthy trade relationship
with Mexico and Canada for us. Again,
for the workers and farmers and serv-
ice providers that I represent and other
people that this body represents, the
level playing field is important be-
cause, while trade works if it is done
properly and fairly, it does not work
well when you have big trade deficits,
when other countries cheat, when they
do not play by the rules. Everything in
this agreement helps to level that play-
ing field.
As an example, right now, our trade
agreement with Canada and Mexico
does not have a lot of things you would
expect in a modern agreement, like
provisions relating to the digital econ-
omy. So much of our economy now op-
erates on the Internet, yet there is
nothing in the NAFTA agreement that
protects data from tariffs, for example.
Another one would be labor and envi-
ronmental standards which are weak
and unenforceable under the current
NAFTA. All of our new trade agree-
ments have labor and environmental
agreements, and they are enforceable.
Well, guess what, USMCA does too. It
includes a lot of the modern provisions
that we have in our more recent trade
agreements. I have got a handy chart
here to talk about some of the specific
changes between USMCA and NAFTA.
First, the USMCA means more jobs.
The independent International Trade
Commission said it will add 176,000 new
jobs. New jobs? USMCA, yes; NAFTA,
no.
By the way, from my home State of
Ohio, which is a big auto State, thou-
sands of those jobs are going to be cre-
ated in the auto industry, which is a
great opportunity for us in America to
help to bolster our manufacturing—
176,000 new jobs is significant, 20,000 in
the auto industry.
In fact, it is going to grow our econ-
omy by double the gross domestic prod-
uct of that which was projected in the
Trans-Pacific Partnership. That was
the agreement that was done with
countries in the Pacific region, Asia,
and Latin America. It is an agreement
that many Democrats have praised and
a few years back criticized the admin-
istration for not going into the Trans-
Pacific Partnership. But as much as
they thought that the Trans-Pacific
Partnership was going to be good for
our economy, this is even better for
our economy. Again, it more than dou-
bles the GDP growth, the economic
growth, as compared to the Trans-Pa-
cific Partnership.
Second, the agreement does level the
playing field we were talking about. It
has enforceable labor and environ-
mental standards—USMCA, yes;
NAFTA, no—so another big difference.
By the way, these standards are one
reason why we have lost so many jobs
to Mexico over the years.
Third, the USMCA, like I said, it has
new rules for the Internet economy.
Those new rules of the road are really
important, particularly to small busi-
nesses in Ohio and around the country
that rely on Internet sales for their
businesses.
Unlike all our modern trade agree-
ments, right now, there is no chapter
in NAFTA—none at all—as it relates to
the digital economy. Fortunately for
Ohio online businesses, the USMCA has
these protections. As an example,
small businesses that rely on access to
Canada and Mexico are going to have
an easing of their customs burden for
small values of their products, so both
countries have agreed to raise their
cap. I frankly wish they had agreed to
raise it even more. But this is impor-
tant both for small businesses that are
in the Internet economy to save some
money from customs and tariffs, but
also it simplifies their business, which
is fair because the United States has a
higher cap.
The USMCA also prohibits require-
ments that data be localized in Mexico
and Canada. This is a big concern
around the world. The country says:
Okay, you can do it, but you have to
localize your data here. In other words,
you have to have your servers and your
data here in our country. That is not
required now. Under USMCA, that can
be huge for our small businesses, and
USMCA helps.
If I may, it does prohibit tariffs on
data, which NAFTA does not do. So
these are key provisions to keep the
modern economy moving. And voting
against USMCA—or not allowing it to
come up, which is what is happening
right now—really means that you be-
lieve these burdens and uncertainties
should continue for our small busi-
nesses.
Fourth, USMCA goes further than
any agreement we have toward leveling
the playing field on steel. Steel produc-
tion in this country is an incredibly
important manufacturing sector. In
Ohio, we are big steel producers. We
are proud of that. It is one of the core
industries we need to keep in this
country. USMCA requires that 70 per-
cent of the steel in vehicles that are
produced under NAFTA in North Amer-
ica has to be steel from North Amer-
ica—so USMCA, 70 percent require-
ment; NAFTA, nothing, nothing.
Fifth, there is also an unprecedented
requirement in the USMCA that is not
in any other agreement in the world
and that helps to level the playing field
considerably by saying that between 40
and 45 percent of vehicles have to be
made in NAFTA countries by workers
earning at least $16 an hour. We have
heard a lot about, well, it is not fair in
our dealings with Mexico in particular
because they have lower wage rates.
Well, this is being addressed very di-
rectly in a way that it has never been
addressed in any previous agreement.
Democrats have been talking about
this for years. They should hail this as
a great breakthrough and allow the
NAFTA agreement to end and the
USMCA to take its place because this
is better.
Voting for USMCA will also help to
level the playing field on labor costs
between the United States and Mexico
because this new agreement requires
that USMCA-compliant autos and auto
parts have a higher percentage of U.S.
and American content.
Under the NAFTA agreement, that
requirement for content is 62.5 percent.
So if you want a car within the NAFTA
agreement that gets the advantages of
NAFTA and that gets to come into the
United States at a lower tariff from
Canada or Mexico, 62.5 percent of it has
to be from NAFTA countries. Under
USMCA, we raised that 62.5 percent up
to 75 percent. This means more autos
and more auto parts are going to be
made here in the United States and
you have fewer imports and fewer jobs
in other countries, like China or Japan
or Germany. So this is good for us.
By the way, that 75 percent is the
highest content requirement of any
trade agreement we have. That is in
USMCA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6835
December 4, 2019
All of these things are going to en-
sure that we have more manufacturing
jobs in Ohio and across the country.
Frankly, the Trump administration,
and particularly U.S. Trade Represent-
ative Bob Lighthizer, has listened to
Democrats’ concerns—listened very
carefully—and then incorporated these
concerns into this agreement.
Some of the concerns have also been
raised by Republicans over the years,
but, frankly, when I was U.S. Trade
Representative, it was Democrats who
mostly raised these concerns about the
labor standards being enforceable and
ensuring that you had something like
the minimum wage that is now in this
agreement.
These are provisions that Democrats
have demanded for years. Yet now we
can’t get a vote. They will not even let
it be voted on. How does that make
sense? How do you explain it? I don’t
believe any Democrat thinks the status
quo, NAFTA, is better than the
USMCA. If they do, I would challenge
them to explain to the American peo-
ple why they think the status quo,
NAFTA, is better than USMCA.
Blocking this trade agreement hurts
so many sectors of our economy, as I
have talked about. It hurts our auto in-
dustry and the hard-working men and
women who are on the assembly lines.
It hurts our farmers. They aren’t going
to be able to gain new access to mar-
kets in Canada and Mexico. That is
why nearly 1,000 farm groups from our
country have now come out strongly to
support USMCA. Blocking USMCA
means blocking our farmers out of
these markets.
With all of these new requirements
and all of these new improvements, it
should be clear to everyone that this is
not an effort to rebrand NAFTA. This
is new. It is different. It is not your fa-
ther’s Oldsmobile. They are big and
meaningful changes that will benefit
all of us.
In short, USMCA is good for jobs. It
is good for small businesses. It is good
for our farmers. It is good for workers,
and it is good for the economy.
This is a rare opportunity, my col-
leagues, to do something that is good
for America and to do it in a bipartisan
way. It can have such a positive impact
at a time when our country needs to
have us come together and do some-
thing that is good for everybody.
To Speaker PELOSI and the House
Democrats: The ball is in your court.
We realize that. Under the rules up
here in Congress as to how you deal
with trade agreements, this has to
start in the House of Representatives.
If it were to come to the floor here in
the Senate, I believe it would pass and
pass with a good bipartisan margin be-
cause it just makes so much sense. But
it has to go through the House first.
If that agreement did come to the
House floor, I believe logic would pre-
vail, and it would pass there, as well,
because I believe Members would say:
Here is my choice, and it is a binary
choice: Do I go with the status quo,
NAFTA, that I have been complaining
about for years, or do I go with the new
and improved USMCA? I think that is
a pretty easy vote for a lot of Members
who look at this objectively and with
the interests of their constituents in
mind.
A vote for USMCA, quite simply, is a
vote for improved market access, more
U.S. manufacturing, and a more level
playing field for American workers,
farmers, and service providers.
A vote against USMCA and blocking
it from coming to the floor is a vote to
keep NAFTA. It is as simple as that. A
vote against USMCA is a vote for the
status quo, which is NAFTA.
Supporting NAFTA today means sup-
porting unenforceable labor and envi-
ronmental standards, nonexistent dig-
ital economy provisions, and outdated
rules of origin provisions that allow
more automobiles and auto parts to be
manufactured overseas rather than in
America. We have a chance to fix all of
this by passing USMCA.
I am confident that this new agree-
ment will pass if we can get it up for a
vote because the American people will
demand it. There is plenty of time for
politics between now and the 2020 elec-
tion. Right now, let’s focus on what is
best for the American people. Let’s
work together and put them first, and,
by doing so, let’s pass USMCA.
I yield back my time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SASSE). The Senator from Utah.
NOMINATION OF DAVID B. BARLOW
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I come to
the floor today to discuss my friend,
my former colleague, and soon-to-be
confirmed Federal District Judge
David Barlow.
Last night, the Senate voted to in-
voke cloture as to Mr. Barlow’s nomi-
nation. We will be voting later today to
confirm him. Based on the support we
have, I expect the vote to be over-
whelming, and with really good reason.
David Barlow is someone I have
known for a long time. He is someone
I have known, in fact, for more than 30
years.
David Barlow and I first met when we
were both in high school. Oddly
enough, we met in Washington, DC,
while we were both participating in an
event known as American Legion Boys
Nation. We had both attended Boys
State in our respective States—I in
Utah and he in Idaho—and we were
both selected to go to Boys Nation to
represent our respective Boys States.
Shortly after we convened as Boys
Nation senators, David Barlow was
elected to be the President pro temp of
the Boys Nation senate. As a result,
when we visited the White House a few
days later, it was David Barlow who
got to stand right next to Ronald
Reagan as he greeted us in the Rose
Garden and addressed Boys Nation.
David Barlow was someone who
seemed to have been born for public
service, and he was born for public
service for all of the right reasons, in
all of the right ways. He had a certain
enthusiasm about the workings of gov-
ernment—not in a partisan way, not in
a self-interested way but in a way that
was infectious and made all around
him want to build a better country,
want to find common ground, and want
to come to know more about our coun-
try’s rich histories and tradition.
Mr. Barlow and I became re-
acquainted about a year after we first
met, when we first enrolled as fresh-
men students at Brigham Young Uni-
versity in the fall of 1989. David Barlow
was there on a full academic scholar-
ship and did not disappoint with his
academic performance. As I recall, he
graduated with a 4.0 grade point aver-
age from Brigham Young University
with highest honors. Here again, David
was smart but in a way that didn’t
make other people feel less smart. He
made other people feel smart and eager
to learn more, eager to be more enthu-
siastic about the academic process. He
isn’t someone who would have ever
talked to other people about his out-
standing grades or about his wonderful
accomplishments.
A few years later, we both graduated
from BYU. He graduated in 1995 from
Brigham Young University and en-
rolled at Yale Law School, where he re-
ceived his jurist doctorate degree in
1998.
After he graduated, David Barlow
started his legal career as an associate
at the law firm then known as Lord,
Bissell & Brook in the firm’s Chicago
office. Just a couple of years later,
David joined Sidley and Austin LLP as
an associate in the firm’s Chicago of-
fice. He later became a partner start-
ing, I believe, in 2006, and he remained
a partner at Sidley up until 2010.
During much of that time, I was an
associate at Sidley and Austin in the
firm’s Washington, DC, office. I got to
know David again through this process,
this time as a lawyer, as a professional.
Although we worked in different of-
fices, as part of the same firm, we knew
the same people.
The network of lawyers with whom I
worked quickly identified David Bar-
low as one of the lawyers in the firm
who could be trusted with everything,
one of the lawyers in the firm who,
even as a young associate, could be
given any task, and any lawyer giving
him that responsibility could do so
with the full assurance that the client
would be well served, that no ball
would be dropped, and that every stone
would be turned over in an effort to
properly handle the case.
Mr. Barlow worked on a wide variety
of litigation matters, including com-
plex civil litigation, class actions, and
products liability cases. He also han-
dled a number of domestic violence
cases on a pro bono basis.
Among many of his clients, David
Barlow became known as Dr. Barlow. It
was a name assigned to him by some of
his clients when he was working on
some liability cases involving the med-
ical field. He became so immersed in
the subject matter of the litigation

that over time he acquired more
knowledge in some cases than some of
the doctors who were consulting with
the client on that same matter. To this
day, I occasionally refer to him as Dr.
Barlow just for fun.
In 2011, shortly after I had been elect-
ed to the U.S. Senate, David Barlow
joined my team as my chief counsel
and chief staffer on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. He is someone who had never
worked in the U.S. Senate prior to that
time but, literally, within a matter of
weeks, had learned the ropes of this
body to a degree sufficient that no one
would have been able to discern the dif-
ference between Mr. Barlow and some-
body who had worked in the Senate for
many, many years.
He quickly became a favorite within
my office. David Barlow was someone
who we could always turn to in a mo-
ment if someone had a question. In a
moment of crisis, he would figure out
how to solve it. In a moment where we
needed an answer to a legal question,
he either knew the answer or, if he
didn’t know the answer, he could find
it in a short period of time, and we
could proceed with the correct under-
standing that, when he gave us an an-
swer, it was right and we could rely on
it.
The fact that he was so beloved with-
in my office extended far beyond his
legal acumen or his professional abili-
ties. He is also just a delight to be
around. He is really funny, and he is
equally conversive in a wide variety of
material, from Shakespeare to Chau-
cer, from the Old Testament to old epi-
sodes of ‘‘30 Rock’’ and Saturday Night
Live.’’ He had a sophisticated sense of
humor that managed to be out-
rageously funny, while never inappro-
priate. That is a skill that we in Utah
particularly strive to attain and very
few are able to achieve.
Later in 2011, President Obama chose
David Barlow to serve as the U.S. at-
torney for the District of Utah. This
was a bittersweet moment for me and
my staff, having learned to rely on his
skill, but we were very happy for David
and especially happy for the people of
Utah, who were the beneficiaries of his
outstanding service as the U.S. attor-
ney. Having previously worked in that
U.S. Attorney’s Office myself as an as-
sistant U.S. attorney, I stayed in con-
tact with many of my former col-
leagues, all of whom came to abso-
lutely love this outstanding public
servant.
David served as U.S. attorney
through 2014, at which point he re-
turned to his partnership at Sidley
Austin and worked in the firm’s Wash-
ington, DC, office. In 2017, he joined
Walmart as vice president over compli-
ance for the company’s health and
wellness business. I still remember the
moment when someone reviewing him
for that position, prior to the time he
had been offered the job, called to ask
me what I thought about his qualifica-
tions for that job. I explained at the
outset to this reviewer that my com-
ments regarding David Barlow would
be so overwhelmingly positive that she
would think I was joking. I was, in
fact, not.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to deliver my remarks to an ex-
tent not to exceed 4 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, needless to
say, he got the job. He flourished there
as he has everywhere else.
Then, in 2018, David Barlow, to the
great happiness of many of us in Utah
who know and love him, decided to re-
turn to Utah, and he joined Dorsey &
Whitney, LLP, as a partner in the
firm’s Salt Lake City office. For the
past several years, David Barlow has
had a practice that has focused on han-
dling government enforcement actions
and internal investigations, which have
typically been large multijuris-
dictional matters. He is someone who
knows how to handle complex litiga-
tion.
I would also like to note that since I
first met David Barlow, I have also got-
ten to know David Barlow’s family.
They are extraordinary people—David’s
wife Crystal and their children. David’s
parents, Bruce and Emily Barlow, in
fact, used to live just a couple of doors
down from me in Utah. They are as
kind and decent a people as you could
ever hope to meet. While one’s parents
certainly can’t independently qualify
one for service in a lifetime article III
judicial appointment, if ever one could
qualify through that route, that would
probably qualify him here simply be-
cause Bruce and Emily Barlow are per-
haps the most kind and decent people I
have ever met and the warmest and
loveliest neighbors anyone could ever
hope to have.
For all these reasons, and based on
Mr. Barlow’s mastery of the law, his
professionalism, his kindness, his de-
meanor, his collegiality, which I have
never heard questioned or in any way
called into question, David Barlow is
qualified to be a U.S. district judge,
and I am grateful that he will be serv-
ing once he is confirmed as judge on
the U.S. District Court for the District
of Utah.
I urge my colleagues to support his
confirmation and look forward to vot-
ing for him later today.

SUPPORT FOR VETERANS IN EF-
FECTIVE APPRENTICESHIPS ACT
OF 2019
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, when I
travel across Michigan, one issue
comes up regularly in my conversa-
tions with business owners, workers,
and families, and that issue is the need
to close the skills gap.
There are good-paying jobs available
all across my State but not enough
workers who have the specific skills
needed to fill them. That is why one of
my top priorities in the Senate is to
expand access to quality skills training
programs, like registered apprentice-
ships, that are connected to today’s in-
demand jobs.
Effective apprenticeships are good
for business. They are good for workers
in both urban and rural areas in Michi-
gan, as well as all across our country.
I have also heard from veterans, like
Rick Donovan in Oakland County,
about how there is a lack of appren-
ticeships available for veterans who
qualify for them to use their GI bene-
fits.
The GI bill offers veterans an ap-
proved apprenticeship, additional fi-
nancial support for housing, and other
training materials as they progress
through the program. Unfortunately,
only a small portion of apprenticeship
programs registered by the Department
of Labor are also approved by the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs.
In Michigan, for example, there are
over 1,000 registered apprenticeship
programs but only a couple hundred in
which veterans can use their VA edu-
cational assistance in connection with
that program. This is simply unaccept-
able. Veterans should have access to as

many opportunities as there are avail-
able.
That is why Senator CAPITO and I in-
troduced a bipartisan bill to ensure
veterans’ interests are not falling
through the cracks between Federal
agencies as they pursue apprentice-
ships to launch their career. Our Sup-
port for Veterans in Effective Appren-
ticeships Act takes three commonsense
steps to expand opportunities for vet-
erans to use their financial assistance
for quality training programs that lead
to good-paying jobs.
First, the bill will ensure that every
program applying to become a reg-
istered apprenticeship is proactively
thinking about ways to support vet-
erans. Programs would need to provide
written assurance to the Department
of Labor that they are aware of GI bill
assistance and are committed to tak-
ing the steps necessary to enable bene-
fits to use these benefits as appren-
tices.
Second, the bill will clarify that
skills and training that veterans gain
during their military service would be
a factor into how they are placed in the
program. Many veterans may qualify
for advanced placement with higher ap-
prenticeship wages due to their unique
experiences while bravely serving our
country, and our bill will recognize
those skill sets.
Third, the bill will improve coordina-
tion between Federal agencies. It
would direct the Department of Labor
to notify the VA of newly registered
apprenticeship programs. It is a simple,
straightforward action to actively up-
date new apprenticeship opportunities.
Our Nation’s returning heroes de-
serve every opportunity to pursue their
professional dreams after their service.
By expanding qualified apprentice-
ships, this bill will make a real dif-
ference in the lives of our veterans.
Rick, a veteran advocate from Michi-
gan, said he would never have known
that he could use his GI bill benefits
for on-the-job training had he not
crossed paths with a more senior vet-
eran who told him about it. It was a
conversation that literally changed his
life. With the support of the GI bill,
Rick was now able to pursue an appren-
ticeship following his military service.
He then used that training toward a
college degree and has built a success-
ful career as a union sheet metal work-
er in Michigan.
We need to listen to and partner with
veterans like Rick who are tirelessly
advocating to open doors to help fellow
veterans, Michiganders, and Americans
so they can achieve economic success
in the 21st century.
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 760 and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the bill by title.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A bill (S. 760) to enable registered appren-
ticeship programs to better serve veterans,
and for other purposes.
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged and the Senate
proceeded to consider the bill.
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the Peters
amendment at the desk be agreed to
and that the bill, as amended, be con-
sidered read a third time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE
AGREEMENT
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, there is
something we can do in Congress
today, right now, right this very
minute, that would lift a burden and
provide peace of mind for millions of
people across this great country.
As we all busy ourselves making holi-
day plans, Iowa’s farmers and manufac-
turers are struggling to confidently
look to the future. Many of the tools
they need to feel confident and secure
in the months ahead are laid out in the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment. The USMCA trade agreement
was signed by President Trump 369
days ago—369 days ago. That is over 1
year ago.
Speaker PELOSI and her House col-
leagues have had more than enough
time to pass this important agreement.
Yet they have failed to do so. Instead,
House Democrats are fixated on im-
peaching the President. Let’s not for-
get, though, when the House Demo-
crats decided to go down this impeach-
ment path, the American people were
guaranteed that the House Democrats
would be able to walk and chew gum at
the same time. They promised that
they could process this impeachment
inquiry while continuing to do the
work of the people. Well, folks, there is
not much walking and chewing gum
going on. Instead, that gum seems to
be stuck under some park bench some-
where. That is where we are today,
while millions of Americans whose
livelihoods are tied to trade wait for
the Democrats to get serious.
It is really unthinkable that USMCA
is not already ratified by the United
States. Folks, the USMCA is written.
It is signed. It is agreed to by our part-
ners. All we have to do is vote to pass
it. It really is that simple. As I men-
tioned, it has been over 1 year since the
trade agreement was signed. That
means Iowa farmers have now gone
through an entire cycle of planting,
harvesting, and selling their crops
without a finalized trade agreement
with our two biggest trade partners.
Yes, they are our two biggest trade
partners—Mexico and Canada.
I spent all year crisscrossing Iowa to
visit all of my 99 counties. I do that
every year, just as Senator GRASSLEY
does, and not once did I hear someone
say: Hey, Senator ERNST, let’s wait on
the USMCA.
It was quite the opposite. Whether I
was at one of my 35 townhalls that I
held just last year or during a farmer
roundtable or a visit to a small manu-
facturer, I heard consistently and
across the board that Iowans want
USMCA right now. They want it now.
These hard-working folks know the im-
pact the USMCA will have on our Iowa
economy and the U.S. economy as a
whole. There is no reason Iowans
should have to wait any longer. There
is no reason the American workers
shouldn’t have the certainty that they
need.
My House colleagues have not been
able to offer any reasonable expla-
nation for their inaction. I beg to say,
though, folks, that it is because of who
sits in the White House, and it would
be a sad reality that, once again,
Democrats would choose to put their
own politics ahead of what is best for
the American people. The USMCA is
not partisan. It is not about President
Trump. It is about what is best for
hard-working Iowans. It is what is best
for the American people.
The work has been done for Congress.
The trade agreement has been written.
All we have to do is say yes for the
American people. That is it. It is so
simple. Let’s get serious. Let’s do the
simple task that folks back home are
asking us to do, and that is to pass the
USMCA.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska.
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise
today alongside my Republican col-
leagues to once again voice my strong
support for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Trade Agreement. This agreement has
been on the minds of Nebraskans for
well over a year now.
Nebraska and rural America as a
whole were dealt a tough hand in 2019.
However, every time that I meet with
Nebraska’s farm families, ranchers, ag
producers, and manufacturers, they re-
assure me that they can endure these
challenges. They will sacrifice short-
term anxiety for long-term certainty
and predictability, but they need to
know that there is going to be a light
at the end of this tunnel. One impor-
tant thing Congress can do to meet
their needs is simple—pass the USMCA.
This agreement is a victory for Ne-
braska and for America.
I will give you a glimpse into what
this means for my State. Currently,
Canada and Mexico receive 44 percent
of Nebraska’s total exports. In 2017
alone, our State sent nearly $900 mil-
lion of ag products to Mexico and near-
ly $450 million of ag products to Can-
ada. These exports include our world-
class corn, soybeans, ethanol, and beef.
As I have said before, America’s heart
beats in the same rhythm as agri-
culture. When our ag producers suc-
ceed, entire communities reap the ben-
efits.
The Nebraska Department of Agri-
culture reports that our State’s $6.4
billion in agricultural exports in 2017
led to nearly $8.2 billion in additional
economic activity in our State. That is
why it is so important that Nebraska’s
top two markets, Mexico and Canada,
are protected. We all know that the
USMCA is the product of bipartisan
good-faith work. Both sides agree that
this deal not only updates but
strengthens our environmental respon-
sibilities, and it places enforceable
labor obligations at the core of the
agreement.
All former Secretaries of Agriculture
since the Reagan administration, both
Republicans and Democrats, have
voiced their strong support. Even the
Washington Post editorial board con-
ceded that the deal is ‘‘a real improve-
ment over the status quo.’’
Last July, a group of 14 House Demo-
crats sent a letter to Speaker PELOSI
urging her to move forward with
USMCA immediately. The President of
Mexico made his own plea to the
Speaker in a letter last week. Canada
is still waiting for us to act. The senior
Senator from Iowa noted that a deal
between House Democrats and the
Trump administration must be struck
this week if ratification of the USMCA
is to take effect this year. Time is run-
ning out. Meanwhile, House Democrats
are distracted by impeachment pro-
ceedings when they should be focused
on passing this very meaningful agree-
ment.
In the final weeks of 2019, we will see
if the needs of hard-working men and
women in the heartland take priority
over political theater. I urge my col-
leagues to follow through on our Na-
tion’s priorities and end the months of
needless stalling. We must act now.
The passage of USMCA would be an in-
credible win for Nebraska, and it would
be an undeniable victory for America.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina.
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I come to
the Chamber today to rise with my col-
leagues to talk about the USMCA, or
the United States-Mexico-Canada
Trade Agreement.
But before I talk about the vote that
I hope is in this Chamber on fairly
short order, I would like to go back to
December of 1993. In December of 1993,
President Clinton signed NAFTA. A
month later, it was ratified, and, to be
honest with you, it started a period of
time in North Carolina where we suf-
fered. We had a challenge to actually
determine how we were going to react
to a very different North Carolina,
where there are textiles and a number
of other industries that suffered ini-
tially under the NAFTA implementa-
tion. But today, North Carolina is one
of the greatest benefactors of NAFTA.
As a matter of fact, we are one of the
top States in the country for job cre-
ation and commerce, and Canada and
Mexico are our two most important ex-
port markets.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6840 December 4, 2019
The problem is, NAFTA was imple-
mented in 1994. I think that was back
when the Backstreet Boys were topping
the charts and MC Hammer was pop-
ular. It was a long, long time ago. It is
time to modernize it. It was before the
internet was even invented.
We have so many opportunities to
modernize our trade relationship with
our two most important trade part-
ners, and the USMCA is the oppor-
tunity to do that. While it only took
about a month to ratify the NAFTA
agreement—knowing that there was a
lot of work to be done before we com-
pletely benefited from it—we waited a
year to ratify an agreement that will
be immediately beneficial to the Amer-
ican economy. It will create more than
170,000 new jobs and $70 billion a year
in additional economic activity, put-
ting us on a level playing field.
Our automotive industry, which has
grown over the last 20 years, with sev-
eral automotive manufacturing facili-
ties in the South, and many businesses
in my State support it.
It will open up the markets for our
farmers. North Carolina is the ninth
largest agriculture economy in the
United States, with nearly $90 billion a
year in agriculture products. We want
those markets open in Canada and
Mexico so that we can grow our farm
economy in North Carolina.
We also want to recognize that the
USMCA agreement is a very, very im-
portant step in getting China to come
to terms with fair trade with the
United States. When we settle an
agreement with two of our most impor-
tant trade partners, then, China will
take notice and they will follow the
President’s lead and understand that
we no longer are going to allow them
to compete unfairly.
There are provisions in the USMCA
that I hear Speaker PELOSI talking
about that, frankly, give me some con-
cern. The House is entitled to make
changes to the baseline agreement that
both the Mexican Government and the
Canadian Government have ratified, as
proposed and as signed by the Presi-
dent. They give me concern, and we
hope that Speaker PELOSI will keep to
the baseline agreement.
But now we have to get to work to
get this agreement ratified so these
kinds of things continue to be positive
stories that come out of North Caro-
lina and positive stories that come out
of Nebraska and Iowa and across this
Nation. There is no downside to this
agreement. As a matter of fact, one of
the reasons I know there is no down-
side is that there are dozens of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle in
the House who are prepared to vote for
it in the form in which the President
will sign.
This is a very, very important agree-
ment. I do have to agree with my col-
leagues in that the only reason I can
imagine we didn’t have this agreement
ratified last year was due to the focus
on all things impeachment. This is a
good deal. I have no doubt that if
President Clinton had signed this
agreement in 1993, it would have been
ratified a month later. Yet we have
waited a year for this agreement to get
any airtime in the House Chamber.
We need the USMCA signed today.
We need the USMCA put into place so
that we can realize the immediate eco-
nomic advantage for hard-working
farmers, for small businesses, and for
the 170,000 new jobs that will be created
so that we continue this economic re-
covery that started with tax reform
and regulatory reform.
This is another step in the right di-
rection, and no reasonable Member of
Congress should be holding off on what
is a great decision on the President’s
part. It is a great decision, and it is a
great policy for the American people.
It is going to help my farmers in North
Carolina, and it is going to help my
small businesses. It is going to con-
tinue to make the U.S. economy the
envy of the world.
I ask Speaker PELOSI and my col-
leagues in the House to get to work.
You can walk and chew gum. Go ahead
and focus on impeachment if you want
to, but from time to time, why don’t
you take some Chamber time and some
of your resources to do right by the
American people. That is what the
USMCA does, and that is what we need
the House to do. I guarantee you, when
it comes to the Senate, we will quickly
send it to the President’s desk.
I thank the Presiding Officer.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota.
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, once
again, I rise to voice support for the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment.
The time to pass the USMCA is now.
This agreement will increase exports,
expand consumer choice, raise wages,
and boost innovation throughout North
America and especially here in the
United States.
It is clear that the USMCA is good
for the country and good for our econ-
omy. The U.S. International Trade
Commission estimates that the
USMCA will raise the GDP by nearly
$63 billion and create more than 175,000
jobs in the United States.
No one knows agriculture better than
American farmers and ranchers, and
technology has made them more effi-
cient than ever. They have maintained
an ag trade surplus for the last 50 years
by exporting the best products around
the world. American agriculture needs
access to foreign markets to reach its
full potential.
The same is true for my State of
North Dakota, which is a powerhouse
in terms of ag product. We shipped $4.5
billion worth of ag products around the
globe in 2017, which made us the coun-
try’s ninth largest exporter of ag
goods. Our farmers and ranchers de-
pend on free and fair trade in order to
sell the highest quality, lowest cost
food supply to the world.
We lead the Nation in the production
of a variety of crops, including that of
hard red spring wheat. Every summer,
about 7.5 million acres—one-fifth of
North Dakota’s farmable acres—are
carpeted with rows of wheat.
Currently, Canada automatically
downgrades imports of U.S. wheat to
the lowest designation—for animals
only—regardless of the quality of the
wheat. We grow the highest quality
wheat in the world, and this unfair
trade practice puts growers at a dis-
advantage when sending wheat to Can-
ada.
Having access to Canadian markets
is a big win for growers, for a quarter
of our State’s wheat is grown within 50
miles of a Canadian grain handling fa-
cility. By eliminating the automatic
downgrade of U.S. wheat, growers have
access to an additional market where
they will receive a premium price for
their high-quality products. The
USMCA ensures that North Dakota
wheat growers will be compensated
fairly when selling their products in
Canada.
These are the types of provisions
that are provided for in the agree-
ment—making it very clear that we
need to get it passed.
In addition to wheat, U.S. dairy prod-
ucts will see increased access in the Ca-
nadian market, which is estimated to
be worth more than a quarter of a bil-
lion dollars. The agreement also pro-
vides for increased access to the Cana-
dian market for other ag products, like
poultry exports—chicken, eggs, and
turkey—as well as others.
These examples are just some of the
many benefits for American agri-
culture in the USMCA. By maintaining
all zero-tariff provisions on ag prod-
ucts, the USMCA will secure critical
market access for U.S. farmers and
ranchers. Canada and Mexico are crit-
ical markets for U.S. agriculture, and
passing the USMCA will give our pro-
ducers certainty that these markets
will remain open for business.
Our farmers and ranchers are facing
real challenges right now. Severe
weather has destroyed crops or has
made it impossible to harvest, and un-
justified retaliatory tariffs have dis-
rupted markets and driven prices
lower. That is why Congress needs to
approve the USMCA.
Now more than ever, farmers and
ranchers depend on stability in our
trading relationships with Canada and
Mexico—our Nation’s two largest trad-
ing partners. The failure to ratify this
agreement would be detrimental to ag-
riculture producers across the country,
including in the Presiding Officer’s
home State.
I believe the USMCA has strong, bi-
partisan support in the Senate, but the
implementing legislation must origi-
nate in the House. That is why I urge
my colleagues in the House to do what
is best for the American people: take
up and pass the USMCA as soon as pos-
sible. That means agreeing to the pro-
visions in the USMCA and putting it on
the floor for a vote in the House to get
this process started. We need the lead-
ership in the House to agree to take

the implementing legislation and put
it to a vote on the floor of the House.
I think it would pass with a large bi-
partisan majority. Then and only then
can we take up that legislation here in
the Senate, which, I believe, would pass
with a large bipartisan majority. We
are ready to go.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska.
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, farmers
and ranchers are in a tough spot. There
are a lot of families who are on the
edge of bankruptcy in my State and in
ag country more broadly. As we get
closer to Christmas and to the new
year without having a trade deal with
Canada and Mexico, the situation is
getting bleaker.
Let’s be blunt about this. By need-
lessly stonewalling the USMCA trade
agreement, Speaker NANCY PELOSI and
the House Democrats are taking Ne-
braska’s agriculture hostage. This is
petty, stupid politics at its worst.
The USMCA trade deal is a free-trade
win for our farmers and ranchers, and
they desperately need this win right
now. With hard work and grit, Nebras-
kans have cultivated one of the most
powerful agricultural economies in the
history of the world. We literally feed
the world, and we do it with free trade
because we grow so much more food
than we could ever consume. We need
export markets, and lots of people
around the world want to be consuming
our ag products.
It is pretty simple: Trade with Can-
ada and Mexico is a win-win-win. In
2018, Mexico and Canada bought more
than $40 billion worth of American ag-
ricultural products. The U.S. Inter-
national Trade Commission expects the
USMCA to increase that trade by more
than $33 billion. The USMCA trade deal
is designed to reinforce those partner-
ships in ways that make sense for an
economy that has changed a lot since
NAFTA was passed in the 1990s.
In the 1990s, ‘‘Seinfeld’’ was still on
TV; we still watched movies on VHS
tape; and we took our pictures with
these things of which the pages prob-
ably don’t know—cameras that had
film. I will be honest. At my house, we
still watch ‘‘Seinfeld,’’ but we have
happily moved on from VHS tapes. My
teenage daughters set us up on Hulu
streaming, but I can’t make the remote
work.
Over the last 20 years, we have seen a
massive digital revolutionary change
in nearly every sector of our economy.
Farmers are using new tech to increase
our productivity and to get more out of
the most fertile land on God’s green
Earth than people have ever assumed
possible. The USMCA trade deal makes
that kind of basic improvement in our
trading relationships with our neigh-
bors, and we need that in this rapidly
changing, evolving, and developing
economy. For example, it scraps the
old rules about importing cars that
still have cassette tape players. CHUCK
GRASSLEY, apparently, still has a car
that has a cassette tape player, but he
is proud of it, so we won’t make fun of
him here.
Passing the USMCA would secure
long-term stability in our trade agree-
ments with our partners across North
America, and it would also send a sig-
nal to other potential partners around
the world that the United States is
open for business. We need to bring
Japan, the European Union, and others
to the negotiating table, and passing
the USMCA would strengthen our posi-
tion significantly in setting up those
trade agreements. Time is running out.
If we don’t pass the USMCA this
year, we are going to send a very dif-
ferent signal to our potential partners.
If Speaker PELOSI and the House Demo-
crats can’t get their act together on
the USMCA, they will be telling the
whole world that we may or may not be
open for business—it all depends on
short-term political posturing. That is
the message they are sending now, and
that is the message that might be ce-
mented if this calendar year ends with-
out our passing the USMCA. Try run-
ning a convenience store like that, and
you will be out of business in a month.
A lot of folks in San Francisco and
New York City may not think much
about beans and corn prices, but every
farmer and rancher in Nebraska is be-
yond baffled that this no-brainer trade
deal hasn’t been passed yet. It is sim-
ply in the best long-term interests of
everyone involved in this conversation.
This is not something that should be
slipping beyond this year; this is some-
thing that should pass now. We should
call the vote on Christmas morning if
that is what it takes. The Congress
should not be leaving DC without pass-
ing the USMCA.
Time is running out, and we don’t
want to let our farmers and ranchers
face 2020 with the uncertainty and the
confusion they now feel. These Nebras-
kans want to do business; they want to
trade; and we want to win.
Congress is the place where Ameri-
cans deliberate about the long-term
challenges we need to face for the fu-
ture of our country, but instead of de-
liberation, right now what they see
when they turn on their TVs or pick up
their newspapers is just vicious par-
tisanship and short-term posturing.
The American people deserve better
than this.
The clown show in the House of Rep-
resentatives shouldn’t bring everything
to a grinding halt. It shouldn’t stop us
from doing right for farmers and ranch-
ers. The USMCA trade agreement
would pass by large majorities if intro-
duced on the House floor, and I specu-
late that it would get between 85 and 90
votes on this floor. Obviously, we can’t
take it up until the House votes. The
House would pass it with a big major-
ity. That means only NANCY PELOSI
stands in the way of USMCA’s cer-
tainty for the world’s greatest pro-
ducers. Everyone knows this, and
Speaker PELOSI should be scheduling
the vote.
We have only 28 days left in 2019, but
that is plenty of time to vote on the
USMCA. That is plenty of time to get
a win for our farmers and ranchers.
Speaker PELOSI, please schedule the
vote.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the next nomination.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read the nomination of Sarah E.
Pitlyk, of Missouri, to be United States
District Judge for the Eastern District
of Missouri.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I oppose
the nomination of Sarah Pitlyk to be a
Federal district court judge in the
Eastern District of Missouri.
I believe that people who are nomi-
nated to serve as Federal trial judges
ought to know their way around a
courtroom. There are basic levels of ex-
perience and qualifications that a per-
son needs in order to be an effective
trial judge. I have no doubt that there
are plenty of experienced, qualified Re-
publican attorneys and State court
judges in the Eastern District of Mis-
souri, but Ms. Pitlyk is not one of
them.
She has never tried a case. She has
never taken a deposition. She has
never argued a motion in court. She
has never picked a jury. She has never
participated at any stage in a criminal
matter. The American Bar Associa-
tion’s peer review process rated her
‘‘unanimously not qualified.’’ The ABA
said that ‘‘Ms. Pitlyk’s experience to
date has a very substantial gap, name-
ly the absence of any trial or even real
litigation experience.’’
The Senate is not doing our justice
system any favors by confirming trial
judges who lack courtroom experience.
My Republican colleagues should stop
rubber-stamping judicial nominees who
lack basic qualifications and experi-
ence.
Ms. Pitlyk also has made many
statements in her career that indicate
that she has prejudged certain issues.
For example, she wrote an article de-
scribing the Supreme Court’s decision
to uphold the Affordable Care Act as
‘‘an unprincipled decision.’’ She also
gave a speech earlier this year in which
she described the Supreme Court’s ju-
risprudence on abortion as ‘‘thoroughly
activist,’’ and ‘‘politically biased,’’ and
as containing ‘‘gross defects.’’
She has spent much of her legal ca-
reer advocating against reproductive
rights, including a 2017 article in which
she wrote that ‘‘surrogacy is harmful
to mothers and children, so it’s a prac-
tice society should not be enforcing.’’
She also said in a 2017 press release
that ‘‘surrogacy diminishes respect for
motherhood and the unique mother-
child bond, encourages exploitation of
women, and it commodifies pregnancy
and children. Surrogacy also weakens
society’s natural abhorrence of eugenic
abortion.’’
My colleague Senator TAMMY
DUCKWORTH wrote a powerful letter in
response to Ms. Pitlyk’s attacks on
surrogacy. Senator DUCKWORTH’s letter
talked about her two beautiful daugh-
ters and her use of assisted reproduc-
tive technology to start a family. She
wrote: ‘‘No American should be deni-
grated and insulted for starting a fam-
ily with the help of assisted reproduc-
tive technology or opting to use
surrogacy, which is often a last re-
sort.’’ She went on to write: ‘‘As a
mother who struggled with infertility
for years and required IVF to start my
family, I would be one of the many
Americans who could never enter Ms.
Pitlyk’s courtroom with any reason-
able expectation that my case would be
adjudicated in a fair and impartial
manner. . . . Not after Ms. Pitlyk ac-
cused families who opt for surrogacy of
contributing to ‘grave effects on soci-
ety’ including disrespecting mother-
hood.’’
I want to commend Senator
DUCKWORTH for this powerful and per-
sonal letter. I hope my colleagues pay
attention to it.
I appreciate that at least one Repub-
lican Senator, Ms. COLLINS of Maine,
has said she will vote no on the Pitlyk
nomination because of Ms. Pitlyk’s
lack of qualifications and extreme
views. I hope more Republicans will
join her.
I will vote no on the Pitlyk nomina-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to do
the same.
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the remaining
votes in this series be 10 minutes in
length.

objection, it is so ordered.

S6844 December 4, 2019
father-in-law, Bob Brown from
Thermopolis, WY, was a member of
this group when he served in Korea.
It was such a privilege to introduce
the President to some of my home
State’s Wyoming National Guard mem-
bers. He actually had two of them up
on the stage with him. They are doing
a tremendous job on behalf of Wyo-
ming’s largest deployment overseas
right now in about a decade. We told
all of our servicemembers how grateful
the Nation is for their service and their
sacrifice and their dedication.
Meanwhile, here in Washington, the
Democrats continue to block the bills
that we need to have passed to keep
our Nation secure. Incredibly, they are
blocking both the Defense authoriza-
tion and the Defense funding bills. The
whole funding of our national defense
expires in 2 weeks, but still the Demo-
crats continue to waste time—precious
legislative time—on their partisan, ob-
sessive approach to impeachment.
Their holiday season impeachment is
hurting the American people, and espe-
cially, it is hurting our military. The
defense funding measure includes a
well-earned and well-deserved pay raise
for the troops. The President told the
troops about that on Thanksgiving
evening after serving dinner and after
eating with them. It makes you wonder
why on Earth Democrats would block
the pay raise right before Christmas. It
is amazing. They seem to be blocking
all of the things that need to be done
for our country to move ahead. The
truth is, they are so focused on
giftwrapping an impeachment process
for the far left that they have left the
rest of us in this country out in the
cold.
Besides that, they are slow-walking
so many of the pro-worker and pro-
farmer USMCA trade deals that are so
critical for our Nation. It certainly
means a lot for the breadbasket of
America. It means so much for us in
the Rocky Mountain West. They are
preventing us from lowering drug
costs.
Above all, people expect us to sup-
port our troops. One thing after an-
other after another, the Democrats
continue to obstruct. The Republicans
are fighting to fully fund the military.
Democrats are in the process of wag-
ing war against the Commander in
Chief. Remember, both parties came to
the table, and they completed a bipar-
tisan budget deal this past summer.
The Democrats went back on their
word. In doing so, they broke faith
with the troops and with all Ameri-
cans. Democrats—they filibuster, they
impeach, and they neglect the troops.
Really, they are hurting the Amer-
ican people, not the President. The
President is busy doing his job. This
week, he attended NATO’s 70th anni-
versary summit and is also meeting
with the U.N. Security Council mem-
bers. U.S. forces, meanwhile, are facing
heightened threats with last year’s
funding levels.
While necessary, the stopgap spend-
ing resolution we have right now is
taking a toll on the military, and here
is why. The short-term funding means
that a $22 billion cut has occurred from
the summer’s bipartisan budget deal. It
is harming military readiness. It is
harming the training of our troops. It
has delayed and suspended weapons
systems and programs. Now, that
hasn’t stopped the House Democrats
and the Senate Democrats from block-
ing the full-year defense measures.
They continue to obstruct.
Republicans need Democratic support
to pass these bills. These need to be bi-
partisan bills. The National Defense
Authorization Act has a long history of
strong bipartisan support. Yet House
Democrats continue to delay final pas-
sage.
Let’s not forget, our troops in harm’s
way are far away from home this holi-
day season. They are on the frontlines.
They are defending our freedoms. They
sacrifice 365 days a year. They do it to
protect our Nation. U.S. servicemem-
bers never complain and never quit,
and Republicans won’t quit supporting
them.
Democrats remain too obsessed with
impeachment to finish important busi-
ness. The question is, Why are Demo-
crats fast-tracking impeachment and
filibustering defense legislation? Their
partisan impeachment production is
choreographed down to the final cur-
tain call. It is simply a costly, chaotic
waste of time. I believe most Ameri-
cans know it. That is certainly what I
hear in Wyoming.
Democrats turn out to be the party
of no—no positive ideas, no positive vi-
sion, no positive agenda for America.
All they want to do is focus on im-
peachment. Some ran on it, and others
didn’t. Whether or not they ran on it,
that is what they are doing, and they
are neglecting the American people
and the wishes and desires of American
families for jobs; for a strong and
healthy economy, a growing economy;
for infrastructure, roads and bridges;
for all of the things that are impor-
tant; for lowering the cost of medical
care and lowering the cost of drugs.
They are ignoring it all, and certainly
they are ignoring national security.
It is time for the Democrats to stop
stonewalling. It is time to pass the De-
fense bills. It is time to give our troops
the raise they have earned and deserve.
Let’s send the right message to our
troops as well as to our adversaries. It
is time to pass these Defense bills now.
f
U.N. CLIMATE CONFERENCE
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
also come to the floor today to talk
about another issue, and that is that
there is a climate conference meeting
right now in Europe, the United Na-
tions climate conference. Earlier this
week, House Speaker PELOSI and 14
other Democrats traveled to Europe for
the conference. To me, they went there
to undermine the President and to
push their radical Green New Deal.
They told the international group
that the United States is committed to
the Paris climate deal. That is just not
true. Secretary of State Pompeo said
that the Paris climate deal imposed an
unfair economic burden on American
workers, on American businesses, and
on American taxpayers. President
Trump began formally withdrawing
from the Paris climate deal last
month.
It may appeal to Democrats’ liberal
elite to talk about climate in Europe.
Republicans, however, are going to
stay focused on the work ahead of us at
home. We have a packed year-end agen-
da here in Congress. Americans expect
us to continue the progress we have
made on jobs and on the economy—in-
credible success. This means passing
better trade deals, funding the govern-
ment, improving our roads—the things
we were elected to do. The Speaker is
nowhere to be found—certainly not on
this continent. Rather than pass Amer-
ican priorities, the Speaker is sidelined
in Spain.
Republican pro-growth policies have
led to a worker boom. Wages are up,
and unemployment is down. Wages are
up to a 50-year high. Unemployment is
down to a 50-year low. I mean, think
about that. As a result of Republican
tax cuts and regulatory relief and
unleashing the American energy, right
now, today, we have the lowest Afri-
can-American unemployment in his-
tory. People have more take-home pay,
more money in their pockets, and costs
are lower because of the regulatory re-
lief. And we have seen this with shop-
ping over the Thanksgiving weekend in
terms of people feeling that confidence
in the economy and in their futures.
Democrats’ message is more regula-
tion and higher costs, which lead to
fewer jobs. It is not going to work at
home, and it is certainly not going to
work in Wyoming. Maybe they think it
will work in Europe.
But just to clear up any confusion,
President Trump has gotten us out of
the Paris Agreement. Republicans’ pro-
growth agenda has us producing and
exporting more energy at home, and we
are seeing millions of new jobs.
Republicans are going to stay clear-
eyed and focused on the economy. We
are going to continue to deliver real re-
sults, tangible results, results that peo-
ple can understand and see and hold on
to. We need to do that for the people
who elected us, and we will continue to
do it.
I yield the floor.

CHINA
Mr. KING. Madam President, there is
a wonderful guy who lives in Maine
named David Mallett. He has a keen
ear and an eye for the rural parts of
our country, and one of his most fa-
mous songs starts out like this: ‘‘Inch
by inch, row by row, gonna make this
garden grow. All it takes is a rake and
a hoe and a piece of fertile ground.’’
The problem is, what we have now is
rakes, hoes, a piece of fertile ground,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6845
December 4, 2019
and we have seeds and crops, but we
have an administration that ties the
hands of our farmers at every turn,
particularly the blueberry farmers in
Maine.
Blueberries have been exported from
Maine since the 1840s, and the people
who are in this farming business are
tough and resilient. They don’t want
bailouts; they want to be able to sell
their product on the market.
It is a wonderful product, by the way.
If you ever have an opportunity to
choose between blueberries and wild
blueberries, choose wild blueberries.
They are better for you, and they taste
better.
In recent years, the market for blue-
berries has been very difficult because
of imports from Canada and additional
cultivated blueberries from around the
country, so our farmers, being entre-
preneurial and doing what we have
been telling them to do for years, have
gone big time into the export market.
Where is a great place to export to?
China.
I used to say as Governor that if we
could get the Chinese hooked on blue-
berry muffins—just one a day—all of
our problems would be over, and the
Maine wild blueberries were getting to
that point. Two years ago, $2.5 million
a year of blueberries were going to
China and half of the budget of the
Wild Blueberry Export Commission was
going to develop the Chinese market.
Hours and hours, days, dollars—a lot of
effort went to develop this Chinese
market. Then all of a sudden came the
Trump administration tariffs.
Not surprisingly—it seems surprising
to the administration—but not sur-
prising to anybody who has paid atten-
tion to 500 years of trade, the imme-
diate response to those tariffs was re-
taliatory tariffs by the Chinese, and
one of the first ones was an 80-percent
tariff on wild blueberries. We were
doing pretty well. From 2014 to 2017,
exports to China quadrupled to $2.5
million. This year they are $61,000. We
have the trade war. It is well known
that we have tariffs that are applying
to all kinds of agricultural products.
The response from the administra-
tion was a massive bailout—a bailout
which has now reached something like
three times the dollar value of the bail-
out of the automobile industry back at
the beginning of the Obama adminis-
tration when we almost lost that en-
tire industry. We are now heading to-
ward three times that amount. A lot of
the bailout to the automobile industry
was paid back. This is not a bailout
that is going to be paid back. It has
continued to just be paid out to various
farmers across the country.
I am sure the farmers in the Midwest,
just as the farmers in Maine, don’t
want bailouts. They want sales. They
want to sell their product in the mar-
ket, which they have been doing, but
what has happened is we have this bail-
out, and I call it the farm bailout lot-
tery. I don’t have a spinner on here,
but it is a lottery because we don’t
know and we don’t understand and no-
body can tell us why certain crops are
in and certain crops are out. Round and
round she goes; where she stops, no-
body knows—and that is the problem.
What is in? Well, let’s see. Cranberries
are in. Blueberries are out—zip, zero,
nothing. Soybeans are in. Wheat is in.
Apples are out. Here is what else is in,
and tell me if this makes any sense:
dairy, hogs, almonds, cranberries, gin-
seng, grapes, cherries. All these are in.
These are getting the bailout money.
Some farms are getting over $500,000:
hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans,
pistachios, and walnuts but not blue-
berries and, for some reason, not ap-
ples.
We have a double whammy here on
this proud industry from Maine. First,
there is the Chinese tariff war, of
which we are collateral damage. By the
way, the same problem is going on with
lobsters. They were one of the first
products to be retaliated against by
the Chinese. We lost that export mar-
ket, and now the same thing is hap-
pening in these agricultural products.
It is a double whammy. No. 1, we got
hit by the retaliatory tariffs, and No. 2,
we are not in on the bailout. We are
not in on the funds that are being dis-
tributed. Nobody can tell us what the
formula is, what the rationale is. Is it
who has the biggest, most powerful
lobby in Washington? Is it if you are
from a State that voted for the Presi-
dent in 2016? What is the rationale? We
can’t tell what that is.
The President just said yesterday
this trade war with China may go on
for another year. That means another
crop. We have third- and fourth-genera-
tion blueberry farmers in Maine leav-
ing the land. It is heartbreaking. These
aren’t big enterprises. These aren’t big
operations. These are people with 100-
acre farms.
The administration knows about this
because I and my colleagues from
Maine wrote them in July and asked
this question. Wild blueberry should be
included in what is called the Market
Facilitation Program. It didn’t happen.
We still don’t really know what the cri-
teria is. Just to put a fine point on it,
if you are a wild blueberry harvester
with a 100-acre farm, you get zip, zero,
nada, zilch. If you are a cranberry
farmer with a 100-acre bog, you get
$61,000. How is that fair? How is the dis-
tinction made? That is the question we
are asking.
I have written again today to the De-
partment of Agriculture asking them,
A, why we aren’t in and, B, how these
distinctions are made. I don’t think
that is an unreasonable question when
you are talking about people’s liveli-
hoods going back generations. These
are tough people. These are resilient
people. These are hard-working people.
These are people who have given their
lives to the land, and they deserve to
be supported by their government—not
undermined, not challenged, not under-
cut by their government.
‘‘Inch by inch, row by row, gonna
make this garden grow. All it takes is
a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile
ground’’ and a government that sup-
ports your right to make a living at
your chosen profession.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I
appreciate the Senator from Maine
speaking about the virtues of wild
Maine blueberries. They happen to be
one of my favorite foods—obviously,
the lobsters as well.
I agree with him that there appears
to be an arbitrary distinction with
these support payments that are sup-
posed to compensate farmers for the
trade war with China, which I think,
unfortunately, is necessary to get
China to conform to a rules-based sys-
tem when it comes to international
trade.
Certainly, in the interest of pre-
serving the wild Maine blueberry, I am
happy to offer any services I might be
able to provide to support our col-
leagues from Maine.
f
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA
TRADE AGREEMENT
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, over
the weekend, we marked 1 year since
the leaders of the United States, Mex-
ico, and Canada signed the U.S.-Mex-
ico-Canada Trade Agreement. This
modern trade agreement will replace
the North American Free Trade Agree-
ment, or NAFTA, which has been the
guiding force for North American trade
for the past quarter of a century.
When NAFTA was created, its goal
was to remove barriers that impede
free and fair trade and provide eco-
nomic benefits to all three countries.
By any measure, NAFTA has been an
overwhelming success, but a lot has
changed in 25 years since NAFTA went
into effect, and it is time to bring
North American trade into the 21st
century. That is precisely what the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement,
USMCA, will do. It preserves the hall-
mark provisions of NAFTA, like duty-
free access to Mexican and Canadian
markets, and adds measures to mod-
ernize the agreement. The USMCA pro-
vides strong protections for intellec-
tual property, which is critical to pro-
tecting the incredible innovation that
Americans do right here at home. It
also cuts redtape that is preventing
countless small businesses from tap-
ping into foreign markets, and it ac-
counts for e-commerce and digital
products, something unheard of 25
years ago, at a time when governments
around the world are proposing all
kinds of new taxes on e-commerce.
It is actually the first free-trade
agreement with a digital trade chapter.
That is why a lot of folks call this
NAFTA 2.0. It is better. It is stronger.
It modernizes the original NAFTA.
We have been told by the experts
that the USMCA will lead to increased
wealth and jobs here in the United
States—about 176,000 new jobs. That is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

on top of the 13 million jobs currently
supported by trade between Canada,
the United States, and Mexico.
It is expected to have a positive im-
pact on every industry sector of the
U.S. economy and a more than $33 bil-
lion increase in our exports—things we
grow, like wild Maine blueberries, and
sell overseas, things we make and man-
ufacture.
This isn’t just a win for our farmers,
manufacturers, and consumers; it is a
win for our entire country. Coinciden-
tally, it is also a big win for Texas. Our
State has the 10th largest economy in
the world, and it is the engine behind
much of our country’s trade. In 2018, we
exported more than $137 billion in
goods and services to Canada and Mex-
ico. With the passage of the USMCA,
that number will go up.
I think the only question left is,
When will we get a chance to vote on
it? Mexico approved the deal in June.
Canada is moving toward ratification
soon, so the only remaining hurdle is
the green light from Speaker PELOSI
and the House of Representatives. We
heard early on that House Democrats
had some concerns with the agreement,
but we were told by the administra-
tion—Ambassador Lighthizer, for ex-
ample—that he thought the negotia-
tions with the House were going well
and were being done in good faith. Mex-
ico has made commitments related to
some of the labor provisions that were
a concern to our Democratic col-
leagues. President Lopez Obrador even
wrote a letter to the Speaker last week
affirming that they will fulfill the
promises they made. Speaker PELOSI
has said repeatedly over the last year
that progress was being made and that
we are close to a deal and that she
hopes we will vote soon. We have heard
that over and over and over but still no
vote.
Here we are. More than 365 days have
gone by since this agreement was
signed, and the House still hasn’t had a
vote. Rather than working to iron out
the final details so we can get the
USMCA moving before Christmas, the
Speaker kicked off the week in Spain
talking about the Paris accord and cli-
mate change. Unfortunately, our
Democratic colleagues seem to want to
talk about anything and everything
other than the priorities we should
have in the Congress. Whether they
want to be absorbed by impeachment
mania or they want to talk about cli-
mate change in London, in Paris, they
want to talk about anything other
than the work that is right here in
front of us that we need to get done:
things like the USMCA, things like
lowering drug prices for consumers,
things like an infrastructure bill and
improving our highways and bridges,
reducing traffic—which we all hate on
a bipartisan basis—addressing some of
the root causes of the mass violence in-
cidents, including mental health chal-
lenges that many people face who are a
danger to themselves and others, and
things like how can we get people who
should be conducting background
checks on firearm purchases—making
sure that the laws on the books are
being enforced. Those are all things we
can and should be doing.
Apparently, that is not the priority
for the Speaker. For an entire year
now, House Democrats have kept
American farmers, businesses, workers,
and consumers waiting. With each day
that goes by, while the USMCA waits
in purgatory, the American people are
missing out. We know that the longer
this goes on, the closer this gets into
the active election season of 2020, the
less likely it is that we are actually
going to have the bandwidth to get it
done. I don’t understand why our
Democratic colleagues are putting new
American jobs on hold. Are they saying
we don’t need this increased wealth
that this trade agreement will bring? Is
that really their argument? Are they
telling the American businesses that
they really don’t care about leveling
the playing field? Is that the message
we are supposed to get from this lack
of activity, this inaction?
With House Democrats working over-
time in the futile effort to remove the
President from office and undo an elec-
tion, they are squandering what may
be our biggest opportunity this Con-
gress. Unfortunately, partisanship has
broken out and obstructed bipartisan
desire to get our work done, including
the USMCA.
I mentioned some of the other things
we could and should be doing. A few
weeks ago, the minority leader, the
Democratic leader, singlehandedly
blocked a bipartisan bill that the Sen-
ator from Connecticut, Senator
BLUMENTHAL, and I introduced that
would bring down prescription drug
prices. This bill passed—sailed
through—the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee on a bipartisan, unanimous
vote. Yet, when we brought it to the
floor, our Democratic colleague the mi-
nority leader, who called this a good
bill and well-intentioned, objected to
its passage.
Then there is the appropriations
process that had been thrown into
chaos. In August, we had an agreement
on spending caps for the next 2 years.
We thought we had overcome the big-
gest hurdle to getting our work done in
order to make sure our military was
funded and to make sure that we were
meeting the other financial obligations
that the Federal Government has to
meet, but our Democratic colleagues
walked back on the commitment they
had made in August over a 0.3-percent
disagreement on Federal spending.
That is right—0.3-percent of what the
Federal Government spends. That is
what caused them to backtrack on
their agreement. They have now kept
our military waiting for the funding
and the stability it needs to keep our
Nation safe.
They have also defeated, at least
temporarily, a bipartisan—nearly
unanimous—prescription drug bill that
would bring down prescription drug
costs, and it is hard for me to under-
stand why.
I would like to be able to head home
for the Christmas holidays with some
good news—good news for the Texans
who are eager to see the USMCA rati-
fied. Generally speaking, I am a ‘‘glass
half full’’ kind of guy, not a ‘‘glass half
empty,’’ but I am losing confidence
that we will see progress on the
USMCA before Christmas. The longer
this goes on, the less likely we will ac-
tually find the opportunity to get it
done.
It seems to me that impeachment
mania has consumed this Congress and
rendered our colleagues on the other
side incapable of focusing on anything
other than removing President Trump
from office. Time is running out, and I
hope the USMCA doesn’t become the
latest casualty to land in Senator
SCHUMER’s legislative graveyard.
At some point, we have to put poli-
tics aside and do what we were sent
here to do, which is to make progress
that will benefit the American people.
Let’s hope we can do that during this
holiday season before it is over.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I
have just come on the floor and have to
chuckle about my friend from Texas in
his deciding that it is the minority in
the Senate that is holding up legisla-
tion that needs to be brought up when
we have been coming to the floor every
day after Senator MCCONNELL has indi-
cated he is probably the Grim Reaper
and after we have indicated very clear-
ly that he has turned this into a legis-
lative graveyard. So I have to smile
when I hear the words from my friend.
Let me set the record straight before
I talk about what I came to the floor to
talk about.
Amazingly, the House of Representa-
tives, even with the challenge that it
has in front of it—that it didn’t ask
for, that it didn’t welcome, that was
brought to it by the continued abuse of
power and other actions of the Presi-
dent of the United States—is fulfilling
its constitutional responsibilities. It
has passed over 300 different pieces of
legislation and has sent them over to
the U.S. Senate. It is my under-
standing that 250 of those bills are bi-
partisan bills; yet we can’t get any of
them to be taken up on the floor of the
Senate.
We come to the floor every week. I
am involved in efforts every week to
say: Let’s pass the bill that will pro-
tect people’s pensions. People who have
worked their whole lives and are close
to retirement or are already retired in
my State who have put money in pen-
sions are getting 50, 60, 70 percent cuts
in their pensions because they got
caught in the financial crisis. When
Wall Street collapsed, the big banks
were bailed out, but when it came time
to bail out the pensions that were in-
vested in those big banks—or the IRAs
or 401(k)s—somehow, we couldn’t get
the Republican support to do that. I

would love to see that brought up. It
could be brought up any day. It could
be brought up today, and—bingo—we
would pass it.
The other thing that we could be
doing is passing legislation the House
sent us months ago. There is legisla-
tion on preexisting conditions. Every-
body says we don’t want people to lose
their preexisting conditions coverage
on their healthcare. Great. Let’s pass
the legislation that came over from the
House in order to protect that. Let’s
make sure that it happens.
There is the Violence Against Women
Act, which has been waiting for over
200 days, and there are the efforts on
gun safety—things we all agree to.
There are issues on gun safety and
background checks, and well over 90
percent of the American public agrees
with it. This legislation came over
from the House months ago, but we
can’t get any action on the Senate
floor. There is legislation that deals
with carbon pollution and the climate
crisis. It goes on and on and on.
There are over 300 different pieces of
legislation that have been passed by
the House while it is also having to ad-
dress what is clearly a constitutional
challenge that is very serious for our
country. We have not had that in front
of us, so we could have easily been
bringing bills forward every week that
would make a difference in people’s
lives. We could have been lowering
their healthcare costs, lowering their
prescription drug costs, making sure
people’s pensions are protected, focus-
ing on jobs and education and safety
for their children while they are in
school.
We welcome it. Let’s do it today and
tomorrow. Let’s go. We have over 300
bills that the House has sent to the
Senate on which there has been no ac-
tion.
f
HEALTHCARE
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President,
let me speak more specifically about
healthcare.
I come to the floor every week and
say the same thing, which is that
healthcare is personal, not political,
for each one of us. That is really true
in our own families. We want whatever
it takes to make sure our children have
what they need, that our moms and
dads and grandpas and grandmas have
what they need, and that we have what
we need with healthcare. It is pretty
basic. It is a common, human need that
we all share. Unfortunately, this has
become a political issue here in DC.
Nowhere else is it a political issue. It is
personal for people in Michigan and
around the country.
If a senior can’t afford the medica-
tion she needs for a chronic condition,
that is personal. If parents don’t have
trusted doctors to call when their chil-
dren wake up with coughs and high fe-
vers and they don’t know what is hap-
pening, that is personal. If a woman is
charged more for healthcare coverage
than she needs to be just because she is
a woman and has detected cancer or if
she wants to have it detected early but
doesn’t have the healthcare with which
to do that, that is very personal.
Healthcare for each one of us is
something very personal. Unfortu-
nately, the law that helps seniors af-
ford their medications, that provides
families health insurance, that covers
lifesaving preventive care, and that
protects people with preexisting condi-
tions is under political attack over and
over.
From the very beginning, the Trump
administration has been undermining
the healthcare of millions and millions
of Americans. It is now open enroll-
ment season, and, unfortunately, the
administration is at it again—what it
couldn’t do here in this body when we
voted no. We would not repeal the Af-
fordable Care Act. We would not rip
apart the healthcare system. This is
what happened right here. It couldn’t
achieve this through Congress—the leg-
islative body, the people’s body—so it
is now, through the backdoor, trying to
find ways to unravel and rip apart the
healthcare system and have costs go up
so it can say: See? Look, costs are
going up—because of what they are
doing behind the scenes to unravel ev-
erything.
So here we are. It is open enrollment
to sign up for an Affordable Care Act
plan, and the administration is at it
again. The Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services is using taxpayer
funding to promote third-party insur-
ance brokers. I would encourage people
to go to the website healthcare.gov.
You have until December 15 to do it.
There used to be a longer signup time.
One of the things the administration
has done is to cut back the signup
time, but you have until December 15.
When you go there now, though, it is
a little tricky, a little confusing. You
have healthcare.gov, and then, depend-
ing on what button you click, it takes
you outside of healthcare.gov, the gov-
ernment system, to private insurance
brokers. The insurance brokers are al-
lowed to enroll people in quality, com-
prehensive plans, which are what the
Affordable Care Act provides, and you
know what essential services are cov-
ered. If they do that, they get paid, but
if they sign you up through an insur-
ance company for what we call a junk
plan, which doesn’t cover anything,
then they get paid up to four times
more. So they get paid more if you get
less coverage.
The problem is it is going to look
good because it will probably cost less
for many folks, and you will not know
what it covers until you get sick. I
don’t know how many times it was be-
fore the Affordable Care Act was passed
that someone would call me and say: I
have paid into my insurance plan all
my life, and I have never been sick. I
got sick. What do you mean it only
covers 1 day in the hospital? What do
you mean it doesn’t cover the ambu-
lance? What do you mean I only get
two treatments?
That is what we mean by a junk
plan—a plan that does not cover what
you would expect it to cover in terms
of your care. So it is very important
that you go to healthcare.gov if this is
something that you are interested in, if
you need insurance, or if you want to
change your plan. It is important that
you go into the system, in fact, in
which you are going to be given quotes
on comprehensive care and in which
there is accountability for the cov-
erage.
Late last month, I released a report
that outlined the many ways the
Trump administration has been under-
mining healthcare. It has nearly elimi-
nated the funding for what is called
healthcare navigators, who are people
who can help you sign up for health in-
surance coverage. It doesn’t matter
what it is or if you have a lot of ques-
tions, as it is complicated; having
somebody who can get on the phone to
answer your questions and walk you
through it is important. Yet the fund-
ing for the folks to do that—to help
you, to answer your questions—has ba-
sically been eliminated.
The administration has slashed the
budget for advertising so that people
don’t know it is open enrollment now.
They don’t know where they can go to
sign up or how many days they have in
which to do that and how to do it on-
line.
As I mentioned before, the adminis-
tration has cut the time in half that
you have to sign up.
The worst thing is, any day now, the
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is
backed by the Trump administration,
could announce a ruling that overturns
the entire Affordable Care Act. This
would take away what we call Healthy
Michigan, which is our Medicaid expan-
sion. It would take away the ability for
your children to stay on your insur-
ance until they reach the age of 26. It
would take away protections for people
with preexisting conditions. It would
put back into place or allow insurance
companies to put back into place caps
on the number of treatments you can
receive. It would also put back into
place all of the other restrictions that
insurance companies had on care but
that had been eliminated with the Af-
fordable Care Act.
I have to say, recently, when we
looked at how this would impact people
with the possibility of eliminating the
Affordable Care Act in this court deci-
sion, we also realized that not only
would it take away healthcare for mil-
lions of Americans, but it would have
the perverted result of actually pro-
viding a tax cut to the wealthiest indi-
viduals and to prescription drug com-
panies and insurance companies that
each chip in to help pay for the tax
cuts that average citizens have used in
order to get lower cost care.
It seems as though it doesn’t matter
what it is that our Republican col-
leagues or this President supports, for
it always ends up as another tax cut for
the wealthy. Unfortunately, with the

repeal of health insurance and all it
would do to average families in taking
away their capacity to get care and the
confidence that they can get care for
their families, it, too, would provide
another tax giveaway to the wealthy.
The court case and all it would do in
repealing the Affordable Care Act
would have life-changing consequences
for millions of people in Michigan, in-
cluding someone I would like to tell
you about.
Henry is an outgoing 9-year-old who
lives in Grosse Pointe, MI. Henry loves
people. He greets everyone he meets
with a big hug. He also loves per-
forming. His favorite activity is dance
class, and he enjoys singing karaoke at
home.
Henry, we have something in com-
mon. I like to sing too.
Henry is also living with a number of
preexisting conditions, including Down
syndrome, autism, and severe reflux.
Henry’s mom explains why com-
prehensive health insurance is so im-
portant for her family. Henry was hos-
pitalized at 8 months for an infection
that nearly took his life. Saving his
life cost over $1 million. She added
this: If we didn’t have access to afford-
able healthcare coverage, we would
have been bankrupt before Henry was 1
year old.
No family should go bankrupt be-
cause a child was born with a genetic
condition or hospitalized with a serious
illness. I want to remind my colleagues
that this could happen to any of us at
any time.
Almost 4 years ago, my nephew and
his wonderful wife, Mac and Allie, had
their firstborn girl, and she was born
with only half a heart and spent most
of the first year of her life in the chil-
dren’s hospital at the University of
Michigan. She had incredible care. She
is now almost 4 years old. Little Leigh-
ton is our miracle baby, but she came
out with a whole laundry list of pre-
existing conditions, ongoing chal-
lenges, and a huge healthcare bill that
I know, if we hadn’t had healthcare
coverage, if they weren’t able to get
coverage, they would have done any-
thing—anything—including losing
their home, in order to keep Leighton
alive and thriving. That is what we do
for our kids. That is what we do for our
families. Too many people have been
put in that position.
That is one of the reasons the Afford-
able Care Act was put in place, to give
some options so that you wouldn’t
have to focus on losing everything in
order to protect your child’s life. So
that is what is at stake right now.
Unfortunately, this administration is
trying to turn the clock back to a time
when filing for bankruptcy or not being
able to get your child the lifesaving
medical care they need was all too
common. All people with preexisting
conditions deserve to know that their
health insurance will be there when
they need it, just like Henry’s was.
Half of the people in Michigan have
preexisting conditions, and they want
to know that they are going to be OK,
that their healthcare coverage is not
going to be ripped away. I want that
for them too. I want that for all of us.
Healthcare isn’t political; it is per-
sonal. It is time to stop playing poli-
tics with people’s health and work to
protect Henry and his family and all of
our families.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
f
HONG KONG
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President,
over the past few months we have all
watched as the pro-democracy pro-
testers in Hong Kong turned the tables
on Beijing, and, indeed, we have passed
legislation in this Chamber and the
President has signed that, addressing
the issue.
Hong Kong’s recent elections really
were a stunning rebuke to Beijing.
Seven in 10 eligible voters risked per-
secution to speak out at the ballot box,
and the government’s allies’ political
control over Hong Kong collapsed.
Hong Kong wants their freedom. We
are proud of those freedom fighters. We
continue to support them. But we also
must recognize that Beijing’s crimes
spread far beyond the world of
cellphone cameras and fearless jour-
nalism.
In the far west Xinjiang region, Chi-
nese officials are perpetrating a dif-
ferent and even more horrific human
rights violation. Xinjiang is home to 11
million Uighurs, an indigenous Turkic
Muslim ethnic minority that the Chi-
nese Government has tormented for
decades. Although the Uighurs built
their lives and a booming economy in
China, they feel more culturally and
ethnically close to their neighbors liv-
ing in Central Asian nations.
Much like Tibet, Xinjiang is an au-
tonomous region that, after the Com-
munists subjugated the area in 1949,
the central government increased its
control over the lives of Uighurs by op-
pressing commercial, religious, and
cultural activity deemed inconsistent
with state doctrine. Think about that;
the Chinese Communists said these ac-
tivities are inconsistent with state doc-
trine.
In the wake of 9/11, China seized on
the actions of Uighur separatists to
create a propaganda campaign com-
paring the separatists to Al Qaeda.
They use these accusations to blame
the Uighur population at large for un-
rest and crack down mercilessly on
even peaceful protest. In 2016, the gov-
ernment further ramped up persecution
of Uighurs under the guise of repress-
ing antigovernment activity.
Their current playbook really looks
familiar: arbitrary detention of over a
million Uighurs and other ethnic mi-
norities in concentration camps that
they have labeled ‘‘political re-edu-
cation centers;’’ torture for those who
fail to tell the Communist Party what
the Communist Party wants to hear;
compulsory digital and physical sur-
veillance and the merciless eradication
of free expression, freedom of religion,
and basic expectations of privacy.
The camps have garnered widespread
international attention, in spite of Chi-
nese officials’ uncompromising repres-
sion of foreign journalists, but the gov-
ernment’s pervasive digital surveil-
lance programs are putting the Com-
munist Party in a position to racially
profile and persecute those who threat-
en China’s plans for dominance.
Yesterday’s New York Times fea-
tured a story detailing how Chinese
Government officials are forcibly col-
lecting blood samples from the Uighurs
with the ultimate goal of using DNA to
improve facial recognition capabilities.
Although the government claims that
these capabilities will place a new tool
in law enforcement’s tool box, human
rights watchdogs rightfully fear that
Beijing will use it to justify even more
intense racial profiling and persecu-
tion.
These violations are all committed
by a member of the United Nations
Human Rights Council. These are going
almost completely ignored by the
international community. The EU and
the European academic institutions
have supported China’s research and
development of facial recognition tech-
nology, often without verifying that
the necessary DNA samples were not
forcibly obtained.
Unfortunately, American technology
companies have supported and profited
from China’s increasingly sophisti-
cated surveillance capabilities. Tour-
ists and corporate partners will once
again flock to Beijing for the 2022
Olympic Games, even though they are
fully aware—fully aware—that the Chi-
nese Government will track them,
record them, surveil them, and analyze
their every move.
The Trump administration’s crack-
down on tech exports to Huawei and
other Chinese entities, that sent a
strong message to Beijing. Just last
month, I joined my colleagues in a let-
ter to Secretaries Pompeo, Mnuchin,
and Ross urging them to sanction indi-
vidual Chinese officials responsible for
ordering and coordinating mass intern-
ment and forced labor in Xinjiang.
But most leaders and executives even
in the West fail to realize that China’s
bad behavior is an indication of their
global ambitions. China thinks power
and the almighty dollar—not freedom—
rule the day. Everything China does,
from their military activity in the
South China Sea and the Horn of Afri-
ca, to the flood of Chinese-made prod-
ucts into the global market, is done
with the goal of exporting their de-
structive, repressive ideology.

December 4, 2019
What they are doing to the Uighurs,
to the Hong Kong people, and even to
their own supposedly loyal comrades,
they intend to do to you. The Chinese
surveillance state is an essential means
to their end game of absolute control
of the thought, movement, and rela-
tionships with other global powers.
How far must China go before we re-
ject the notion that their influence will
stop at our border? I ask my colleagues
on both sides of the aisle to consider
their answer carefully, as questions
will inevitably rise about the relevance
of free speech and the Constitution or
the importance of a strong national de-
fense.
We are in the midst of great power
competition, and we do not have a Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. It
would be the first time in 58 years. I
encourage my colleagues to work with
us. Let’s get this complete because the
threats are real, and the more we com-
promise our own values, the easier it
will become for foreign influence to
take hold in our society.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

f
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President,
atmospheric carbon dioxide just hit
new records in our atmosphere, the
highest in the history of humankind,
and I rise for the 260th time to call this
Chamber to wake up.
As we venture further into uncharted
dangerous climate change, the Na-
tional Council for Science and the En-
vironment issued this report, ‘‘Climate
Science Research in the United States
and U.S. Territories.’’ This report sur-
veys climate research papers from pub-
lic universities across all of our 50
States—every single one of them—to
highlight the breadth and the depth of
climate science coming out of our
State universities and to showcase the
climate science centers and institutes
that they host.
Some colleagues pay no attention to
the threat of climate change, but their
home State universities sure do. Ten
thousand peer-reviewed research papers
published out of 80 universities from
2014 through 2018, that is, on average,
185 peer-reviewed articles published on
climate change in each State.
The report says this: ‘‘In every State,
public universities invest in scholar-
ship and education to advance fields
such as climate modeling, climate im-
pacts, adaptation, and more. Increas-
ingly, they go on, climate science has
been integrated into course work on
sustainability, energy, engineering, ar-
chitecture, business, and even political
science.’’ One wonders what is the hold
the fossil fuel industry has over the Re-
publican Party that causes colleagues
to ignore the research from their own
home state universities?
The report continues: ‘‘Climate sci-
entists are studying a wide diversity of
topics. They measure carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gas emissions.
They are studying carbon and the im-
pacts of a changing carbon cycle. They
are studying impacts of climate change
on the Nation’s food security, crop
yields, heat-stress, health impacts, soil
erosion; on water resources, including
water quality, balance, river basins,
drought, precipitation, mountain
snowpack; on impacts to critical infra-
structure, such as sea level rise on
coasts and on subtropical islands, to
the impact of permafrost thaw on sub-
Arctic rivers.’’
‘‘Finally, researchers are also study-
ing the social science of climate
change, including changing attitudes,
polarization, opinions, beliefs, and
their impacts on framing in the media
and on decision-making.’’
Region by region in every State, the
report shows our State universities
tracking climate change’s con-
sequences in fine detail. Quoting from
the report, in the Midwest, ‘‘Agri-
culture is a major focal area for cli-
mate-related research . . . [with] more
occurrences of the word ‘agriculture’ in
climate-related papers from the Mid-
west between the 2014 and 2018 than in
any other region.’’
In the Southwest, ‘‘A key focus of
scientific research in the Southwest re-
gion is on the impact to people and
ecosystems from heat, drought,
wildfires, and flooding.’’
In the Southeast, ‘‘The impacts of
climate change in the Southeast are
becoming most visible through the in-
crease of flooding, temporal and geo-
graphic shifts that affect human
health, and growing risks of wildfires.’’
In the Southern Great Plains States,
‘‘Scientists in the Southern Great
Plains are studying climate impact on
food systems, sea level rise, as well as
impacts to unique ecosystems in this
region, such as a tall grass prairie in
Oklahoma.’’
Across all of these regions, red and
purple State universities are churning
out climate research. In fact, conserv-
ative States’ universities are home to
some of the most prolific climate
science departments and institutions. I
wish they were listened to by our Mem-
bers here.
Texas A&M University, the alma
mater of climate-change-denying
former Energy Secretary Rick Perry,
produced 256 papers—256 papers—cov-
ering topics like shifting summer mon-
soons in the Lone Star State, local sur-
face temperature increases, atmos-
pheric changes, and climate adaptation
strategies.
North Carolina State University pro-
duced 223 climate papers examining cli-
mate change and atmospheric chem-
istry, surface ozone, regional water re-
search and precipitation, and it is
home to the Southeast Climate Adap-
tation Science Center, which helps
coastal North Carolina grapple with
rising sea levels, erosion, and flooding.
Go to Idaho. Researchers from Boise
State and the University of Idaho
issued 164 climate science papers cov-
ering threats like wildfires, bark bee-
tles, shifting precipitation, rising tem-
peratures, and disruption to eco-
systems in National Parks like Yellow-
stone. Idaho also has two academic
centers focused on climate change, the
Hazard and Climate Resiliency Consor-
tium and the Center for Resilient Com-
munities. For the staff at these two
centers, it is all climate, all the time.
For the Idaho delegation, it is never
climate, ever.
Let’s look at what is happening in
the home State universities of Repub-
lican Senators on our Environment and
Public Works Committee. Here is what
they will find in their university back-
yards. The University of Wyoming pro-
duced 124 climate change papers on
wildfires, endangered species, Yellow-
stone National Park, and other climate
topics—124. The university is home to
both the State climatology office and
an atmospheric science department,
which does modeling and empirical cli-
mate research. Its faculty are working
on subjects like—quoting here the re-
port here—‘‘the role of climate and
variability on vegetation and fire.
Using moderate climate analogs to un-
derstand past environmental disturb-
ances. Developing Web-based animated
maps of climate, and development of
3D climate visualization tools to en-
hance learning approaches in the class-
room.’’ I wonder if our Wyoming dele-
gation has visualized that.
The University of Oklahoma and
Oklahoma State University published
183 climate change papers on things
like Southern Plains grasslands, rising
temperatures, soil respiration, and
much more. OU is home to the Okla-
homa University Climate Science Cen-
ter and the Department of the Inte-
rior’s South Central Adaptation
Science Center.
Here is what the dean of the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma College of Atmos-
pheric and Geographic Sciences said:
‘‘On the increasing strength of Earth
sciences we can now state that global
warming is ‘unequivocal.’’’ He said:
‘‘The fact that the planet’s warming,
and the fact that CO2’s a greenhouse
gas, and the fact that it’s increasing in
the atmosphere, and that it increases
in the atmosphere due to humans—
about those things, there’s no debate.’’
I am not sure the Oklahoma delega-
tion here has taken that in yet.
West Virginia and Marshall Univer-
sities have turned out dozens of cli-
mate change papers on precipitation,
drought, tree growth, and much more.
The West Virginia Mountaineers have a
Mountain Hydrology Laboratory,
which reports on climate change’s ‘‘im-
portant implications for management
of fresh water resources,’’ which in-
clude that ‘‘the highlands region in the
central Appalachian Mountains is ex-
pected to wet up’’ as warmer air car-
rying more moisture leads to what
they call ‘‘intensification of the water
cycle’’—what you and I would call
worse flooding. The laboratory warns
that ‘‘the implications of this inten-
sification are immense.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6850 December 4, 2019
The University of Arkansas contrib-
uted 51 papers and hosts the University
of Arkansas Resiliency Center. Arkan-
sas researchers warned of the need to
reduce greenhouse gases, particularly
including carbon dioxide and methane
because these gases’ ‘‘absorption of
solar radiation is responsible for the
greenhouse effect.’’ The university de-
scribes the greenhouse effect thus:
‘‘These gases are trapped and held in
the Earth’s atmosphere, gradually in-
creasing the temperature of the
Earth’s surface and air in the lower at-
mosphere.’’
A University of Arkansas scientist
predicts ‘‘that the spread of plant spe-
cies in nearly half of the world’s land
areas could be affected by global warm-
ing by the end of the century.’’ Yet
what do we hear from Arkansas about
climate change?
Alaska actually gets its own regional
chapter in this report. In Alaska, ‘‘Re-
searchers at public institutions . . . are
studying changes in the marine envi-
ronment and the impacts to the valu-
able marine resources Alaskan commu-
nities depend on.’’
There are papers on thawing perma-
frost and its effects on water quality,
infrastructure, and habitat for fish and
wildlife. There is research on what
rapid ocean acidification, rising sea
levels, and shifting fish stocks mean
for Alaska’s coastal communities. And
there is research into challenges facing
Alaska’s indigenous people fighting to
protect their ancient way of life in a
rapidly changing landscape.
Alaska is home to not one, not two,
but three climate institutes: the Alas-
ka Climate Research Center, the Alas-
ka Climate Adaptation/Resource Cen-
ter, and the Ocean Acidification Re-
search Center. Alaskan researchers
have written papers titled ‘‘Permafrost
is warming at a global scale’’ and ‘‘Cli-
mate Change and Future Wildfire in
the Western United States.’’ The Alas-
ka researchers don’t mince words. I
quote: ‘‘Projections of warming suggest
that considerable change will occur to
key snow parameters, possibly contrib-
uting to extensive infrastructure dam-
age from thawing permafrost, an in-
creased frequency of rain-on-snow
events and reduced soil recharge in the
spring due to shallow end-of-winter
snowpack.’’ It is not hard to under-
stand, but where is the action?
In the Dakotas, North Dakota State
and the University of North Dakota are
studying the effects of climate change
on the Great Plains, the Mississippi
River, land use and adaptation, and
public policy. They are also home to
North Dakota Agricultural Experiment
Center, the Global Institute of Food
Security and International Agri-
culture, and the Center for Regional
Climate Studies. South Dakota State
has issued dozens of studies on climate
change, including what it will mean for
the State’s groundwater supply, maize
and wheat crops, and precipitation lev-
els.
Heading south, the University of Mis-
sissippi and Mississippi State are
studying what climate change will
mean for sediment flows, droughts, wa-
tersheds, and water quality. They are
looking at what climate change will
mean for Mississippi’s vitally impor-
tant rice crop—a crop that supports
hundreds of rice farms in the State.
And they do good coastal climate work
with the Sea Grant Program.
Auburn, the University of Alabama-
Tuscaloosa, and the University of Ala-
bama-Huntsville produced 140 climate
papers that are in the council’s study
here. You would never know that from
the Alabama delegation. Auburn has an
International Center for Climate and
Global Change Research, and the Uni-
versity of Alabama does climate
change research at its Earth System
Science Center.
All by itself, Iowa State is respon-
sible for 117 papers on climate change:
on agriculture—corn, grazing lands,
yields; on weather—precipitation,
droughts, temperature; and even on be-
liefs and behavior related to climate
change.
Last but certainly not least among
EPW Republican States is Indiana,
home to two world-class universities
that are doing extremely impressive
work on climate change. Indiana Uni-
versity and Purdue combine for 289 pa-
pers. They are also home to the Center
for the Study of Global Change at Indi-
ana University and Purdue’s Climate
Change Research Center.
I hope it goes without saying that
universities that study climate change
and publish scientific papers on cli-
mate change also teach climate change
in their coursework. Maybe we should
spend a week here in the Senate get-
ting a refresher on the home State cli-
mate change science. It might do us
some good. But we don’t. We waste
week after week here as the danger
looms, the warnings pile up, and the re-
search keeps coming about climate
change in our home States. We will be
the most clearly warned body in his-
tory of disaster ahead. Yet we still sit
here doing nothing. Never has a polit-
ical body been more clearly warned of
a more present looming disaster than
this one—yet still nothing.
The council’s report on State univer-
sity climate research has these web
diagrams, which show how climate
change research focuses more on cli-
mate effects as they begin to manifest
themselves in the States and not just
predictions and science any longer.
Now it is measurement of actual
events. But the diagrams also show the
various areas of research about which
these research papers are being pub-
lished.
Here is the web diagram for the top-
ics that are addressed in climate
science research in the southwestern
universities. The 12 universities in Ari-
zona, California, Colorado, Nevada,
New Mexico, and Utah in the study
show real-time effects of climate
change, like drought and wildfire, and
point to direct links between tree mor-
tality, drought, and climate. We in this
country depend on the Southwest for
more than half of our specialty crops—
vegetables, fruits, and nuts—so we
have to pay attention when drought
threatens all of those.
Here is another topic web for the
Southeast highlighting what the uni-
versities’ research has been on sea level
rise, ocean acidification, adaptation,
and management.
Here is a slightly different web. This
web is not a web of science and inquiry.
No, this is the web of front groups and
dark money organizations that the fos-
sil fuel industry has supported, cre-
ated, and used for decades to sow false
doubt about all of this science—all of
this science from all of our 50 States.
Their job is to lie about this science,
and they have done it well. They have
used this same web to deploy political
muscle and propaganda to block action
here in Congress. That is why, with all
of this research being done in all of
these States, nothing is happening on
this floor. Nothing has happened since
Citizens United gave the fossil fuel in-
dustry the equivalent of howitzers,
whereas before then, they just had
muskets.
I say to the Presiding Officer, I re-
member how bipartisan it was here.
You weren’t here then. Between 2007,
when I was sworn in—all of 2007, 2008,
and 2009, we had five different bipar-
tisan climate bills popping up around
on the Senate floor. There were five of
them, all strong, serious bills—not lit-
tle nibbly things to make people feel
better; real bills.
In January 2010 comes Citizens
United, and the fossil fuel industry
gets its brandnew hardware, its polit-
ical howitzers, and they go straight to
the other side of the aisle and say:
Anybody who crosses us is dead. Bipar-
tisanship died that year on climate
change, and it is only beginning—only
beginning—to resurge now. But the
decade we lost will cost us a lot, and it
makes the urgency of what we have to
do now all the more important. This
web of denial, paid for by the fossil fuel
industry, has stymied Congress for a
decade.
I hope I don’t need to remind anyone
here that the fossil fuel industry has a
conflict of interest as to this question.
Indeed, the International Monetary
Fund has quantified it as a $650 billion-
a-year conflict of interest. For $650 bil-
lion in conflict of interest, you can pay
for a lot of nonsense organizations that
are phony front groups to put out your
poison and your political propaganda
and your political pressure.
It is time, at last, for Senators to pay
attention to the trusted science actu-
ally happening in their own home
State universities and not to this cor-
rupt web of denial that has been
propped up by the conflicted fossil fuel
industry. This web of denial has done
nothing but lied over and over again.
They are provably wrong over and over
again. The things they say are false
over and over again. Yet the industry
behind them still controls the U.S.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6851
December 4, 2019
Senate, and we can’t budge, despite the
rest of the world moving on dealing
with this issue.
Let me close with an anniversary
that we marked this week. Ten years
ago this Friday, a full-page ad ran in
the New York Times—a full-page ad
pointing out that the science of cli-
mate change was already by then—10
years ago—to use the words in the ad-
vertisement, ‘‘irrefutable,’’ ‘‘scientif-
ically irrefutable.’’ The science is sci-
entifically irrefutable. And it goes on
to say that the consequences of climate
change would be ‘‘catastrophic and ir-
reversible.’’ Wow. The science is irref-
utable; the consequences, catastrophic
and irreversible? Who could have
signed this ad? I will tell you who
signed this ad. Donald J. Trump and
his children, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric
Trump, Ivanka Trump—oh, and the
Trump Organization, right there. This
is what the Trumps had to say about
this 10 years ago, Friday.
I conclude by saying to my col-
leagues, the science is there for you to
see. You don’t have to go far. Just go
to your home State university. It is
right there waiting for you. For the
truth of climate change, just turn to
the researchers teaching your students
in your State’s own universities. They
can tell you, just as Donald Trump and
his family did 10 years ago, that what
we face is irrefutable and that its con-
sequences will be catastrophic and irre-
versible if we keep monkeying around
and failing to act.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
f
REMEMBERING HARRISON
DILLARD
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor a Cleveland native, a
Buffalo soldier, and an Olympic leg-
end—Harrison Dillard. Mr. Dillard died
last month at the age of 96. His life in-
cluded service to our country in World
War II, four Olympic gold medals, and
world records.
He grew up racing up and down the
streets of our shared hometown of
Cleveland with friends. When Mr. Dil-
lard was 13, he saw his hometown hero,
a gentleman named Jesse Owens, in a
parade. He ran home and told his moth-
er: ‘‘I just saw Jesse Owens, [Mom], and
I’m going to be just like him.’’
She humored her son. Think about
how many people say that to mothers
in Cleveland and other places. She
humored her son like all mothers do,
but Harrison Dillard was serious. He
and his friends would take old cars
seats and put them in the street and
jump over them for practice.
When he enrolled at Jesse Owens’
alma mater, Cleveland’s East Tech-
nical High School on the east side of
our city, Owens himself gave Harrison
a new pair of running shoes. Jesse
Owens was one of the most famous ath-
letes in the country. He won world
records, one gold medal, and stood up
to Adolph Hitler. Jessie Owens gave
Harrison Dillard a new pair of running
shoes.
Mr. Dillard joined the Army after
high school. He served in a segregated
unit. Just for younger people who don’t
know this history, we segregated our
Armed Forces in this country, even in
World War II. Just to add a little more
to that history with those soldiers who
came back from serving their country,
they came back to a segregated coun-
try. They had fought for human rights.
They came back, and they didn’t have
those human rights. Think about that.
After the war, General Patton saw
Harrison Dillard in an Army track
meet, and Patton said—pardon my lan-
guage on the Senate floor: ‘‘[That man]
is the best Goddamn athlete I’ve ever
seen.’’
Harrison Dillard proved him right.
He represented our country at the
Olympics in London. He brought home
two gold medals in the 100-meter race.
He achieved his childhood dream. He
matched Jesse Owens’ Olympic record
time of 10.3 seconds. That was in 1948.
He would later write in his autobiog-
raphy: ‘‘I could finally say that I was
just like [Jesse Owens].’’
Plenty of people tried to hold Har-
rison Dillard back because of the color
of his skin. He recalled how, after his
military discharge, he was refused food
at a restaurant. Again, he served his
country, he came back to his country,
and he was refused food in a restaurant
because of the color of his skin. It is
shameful how we treated veterans and
fellow citizens in this country. It is a
testament to Mr. Dillard’s tenacity and
talent that he achieved so much in the
face of a society that was so often set
up to hold him back. He ended his ca-
reer by serving the city that raised
him. He worked for the Cleveland pub-
lic school system.
Now, I met Harrison Dillard once.
Actually, I met him later as an adult.
I saw him not that many years ago. I
met him when I was in Boy Scouts at
Camp Avery Hand in Mansfield, OH.
Harrison Dillard came out and spoke to
our Scout troop and other troops who
were sitting there congregated to lis-
ten to this world class famous athlete
talk to us about service. I remember I
didn’t know a lot about him because I
was not even born when he won the
Olympics, but I knew he was an Olym-
pian. He was introduced as that. We
got to listen to him, and he inspired us.
His legacy lives on in Northeast
Ohio. He lives on around the country
not only in our record books but also
through the young people he inspired. I
ask all my colleagues to join me in
honoring Harrison Dillard—Olympic
gold medal winner, U.S. Army veteran,
and citizen of the great city of Cleve-
land.
I yield the floor.

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to
submit to the Senate the budget
scorekeeping report for December 2019.
This is my second scorekeeping report
since I filed the deemed budget resolu-
tion for fiscal year 2020 on September 9,
2019, as required by the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2019, BBA19. The report
compares current-law levels of spend-
ing and revenues with the amounts
agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this
information is used to determine
whether budgetary points of order lie
against pending legislation. The Re-
publican staff of the Budget Committee
and the Congressional Budget Office,
CBO, prepared this report pursuant to
section 308(b) of the Congressional
Budget Act, CBA. The information in-
cluded in this report is current through
November 25, 2019.
Since I filed the last scorekeeping re-
port on October 16, 2019, two measures
with significant enforceable budgetary
effects have been enacted. The first,
the Further Continuing Appropriations
Act, 2020, and Further Health Extend-
ers Act of 2019 (P.L. 116–69), provided
continuing appropriations and ex-
tended several authorizing provisions.
Specifically, division A of that law ex-
tended discretionary appropriations
through December 20, 2019, and division
B extended a number of health pro-
grams, the Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families program, and certain
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
provisions. Division B also extended
and increased benefits under the U.S.
Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism
Fund and repealed a rescission of high-
way funding that had been included in
the 2015 highway bill. CBO estimated
that division B would increase outlays
by $1.1 billion over 10 years.
The second measure with significant
budgetary effects to be enacted was the
Women’s Suffrage Centennial Com-
memorative Coin Act (P.L. 116–71).
This law directed the Department of
the Treasury to mint and issue silver
coins to commemorate the women who
played a vital role in rallying support
for the 19th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. CBO estimated that P.L.
116–71 would save $2 million in 2020 and
be budget neutral over the 5- and 10-
year windows.
Budget Committee Republican staff
prepared tables A–D.
Table A gives the amount by which
each Senate authorizing committee ex-
ceeds or is below its allocation for
budget authority and outlays under the
fiscal year 2020 deemed budget resolu-
tion. This information is used for en-
forcing committee allocations pursu-
ant to section 302 of the CBA.
The two enacted pieces of legislation
that I mentioned earlier led to the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee, EPW, exceeding its allocation
(P.L. 116–69) and the Banking, Housing,
and Urban Affairs Committee gener-
ating $2 million in savings in 2020 (P.L
116–71). The House of Representatives’
construction of division B of the P.L.
116–69, which combined numerous au-
thorizing matters into one division,
contributed to EPW’s breach of its al-
location. As EPW’s highway rescission
repeal provided the largest single budg-
etary effect, the entire division’s ef-
fects were assigned to EPW consistent
with longstanding congressional en-
forcement practices. It is important to
note that EPW’s highway repeal alone
was scored by CBO as not producing an
outlay or deficit effect. A detailed dis-
cussion of CBO’s scoring of a similar
provision is included in CBO’s formal
August 2019 estimate of S. 1992, a bill to
amend the FAST Act to repeal a rescis-
sion of funds, which was reported ear-
lier this year from EPW.
Table B provides the amount by
which the Senate Committee on Appro-
priations is below or exceeds the statu-
tory spending limits. This information
is used to determine points of order re-
lated to the spending caps found in sec-
tions 312 and 314 of the CBA. The table
shows that the Appropriations Com-
mittee is compliant with spending lim-
its for current the fiscal year. Those
limits for regular discretionary spend-
ing are $666.5 billion for accounts in the
defense category and $621.5 billion for
accounts in the nondefense category of
spending. As no full-year appropria-
tions measures have been enacted for
fiscal year 2020, the amounts shown on
the table reflect the budgetary author-
ity effects of advanced or permanent
appropriations made available in prior
law.
The 2018 budget resolution contained
points of order limiting the use of
changes in mandatory programs,
CHIMPs, in appropriations bills. Table
C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15
billion for 2020, shows the Appropria-
tions Committee has not yet enacted
full-year CHIMPs for this fiscal year.
Table D provides the amount of budg-
et authority enacted for 2020 that has
been designated as either for an emer-
gency or for overseas contingency oper-
ations pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency
Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
Funding that receives either of these
designations results in cap adjustments
to enforceable discretionary spending
limits. There is no limit on either
emergency or overseas contingency op-
erations spending; however, any sen-
ator may challenge the designation
with a point of order to strike the des-
ignation on the floor.
In addition to the tables provided by
Budget Committee Republican staff, I
am submitting CBO tables, which I will
use to enforce budget totals approved
by Congress.
CBO provided a spending and revenue
report for 2020, Table 1, which helps en-
force aggregate spending levels in
budget resolutions under CBA section
311. In its report, CBO annualizes the
temporary effects of the latest con-
tinuing resolution, which provides
funding through December 20, 2019. For
the enforcement of budgetary aggre-
gates, the Budget Committee excludes
this temporary funding. As such, the
committee views current-law levels as
being $1,173.2 billion and $668.4 billion
below budget resolution levels for
budget authority and outlays, respec-
tively. Details on 2020 levels can be
found in CBO’s second table.
Current-law revenues are consistent
with the levels assumed by the budget
resolution.
Social Security levels are consistent
with the budget resolution’s figures for
all enforceable periods.
CBO’s report also provides informa-
tion needed to enforce the Senate pay-
as-you-go, PAYGO, rule, table 3. This
rule was established under section 4106
of the 2018 budget resolution. The Sen-
ate PAYGO scorecard shows that there
is currently $2 million in room in 2020
due to the enactment of the Women’s
Suffrage Centennial Commemorative
Coin Act. Please note that the deficit
effects of division B of the Further
Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020,
and Further Health Extenders Act of
2019 are excluded from the Senate’s
PAYGO scorecard pursuant to Title
VIII of division B of that law.
This submission also includes a table
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on September 9, 2019.
No budgetary points of order have been
raised since that filing.
All years in the accompanying tables
are fiscal years.
I ask unanimous consent that this
statement and the accompanying ta-
bles be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purpose of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $562 million in budget authority and $854 million in estimated outlays.
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenue for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in
this current level report do not include those items.
c Section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 requires the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget to publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2020; those aggregate levels were first published in the
Congressional Record on September 9, 2019. The Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget has the authority to revise the budgetary aggregates for the budgetary effects of certain revenue and spending measures pursuant to the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, as updated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019:

TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY ISAKSON
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President,
today I rise to honor and pay tribute to
my good friend Senator JOHNNY ISAK-
SON on his retirement from the U.S.
Senate.
Throughout the years, I have gotten
to know JOHNNY as a colleague but
more importantly as a friend.
Together, we cochaired the National
Prayer Breakfast and attended the
weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast. I al-
ways came away from those breakfasts
thankful for colleagues like JOHNNY,
who reminded me that we all share a
common purpose and a common hu-
manity and that, with faith and for-
giveness, we can start anew.
As chairman of the Senate Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, JOHNNY
was always a tireless champion for our
Nation’s veterans—leading on issues
that face all of our brave men and
women who have stepped up and served
our country. Without JOHNNY, impor-
tant legislation like the Harry W.
Colmery Veterans Educational Assist-
ance Act—also known as the Forever
GI Bill—to increase the number of vet-
erans who can access benefits under
the post-9–11 GI bill, would not have
been signed into law in 2017. And

whether it was his work on the Fi-
nance, Foreign Relations, or Health,
Education, Labor, and Pension Com-
mittees, JOHNNY exemplified a fighting
spirit and an enduring commitment to
service.
Not long after I was elected to the
Senate, JOHNNY and I began working
together on legislation that was later
signed into law to advance research on
muscular dystrophy and help strength-
en a program that provides informa-
tion and education for people battling
this disease. I will always appreciate
his willingness to put partisanship
aside in an effort to work toward a bi-
partisan proposal that would protect
Dreamers last year.
Beyond just our legislative work to-
gether, I will always think fondly of
JOHNNY as someone who is decent, car-
ing, and kind. He even hosts a
prerecess barbeque that has everything
from pulled pork to brisket to mac and
cheese and sweet tea and pecan pie.
One year, you could smell the hickory-
smoked meats in the halls of the Sen-
ate for days—and I loved it.
As we take this opportunity to honor
JOHNNY, I also want to thank his wife
Dianne and their three children and
eight grandchildren for sharing so
much of their beloved husband, father,
and grandfather with the U.S. Senate.
As much as I will miss JOHNNY’s com-
pany in the Senate next year, I know
that this isn’t his final chapter. He will
continue to do good work for the peo-
ple of Georgia, and I am lucky to count
him as a friend.
Thank you JOHNNY.

REMEMBERING MISTER ROGERS
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
wanted to take a moment to recognize
Mr. Rogers, who is being celebrated
with the release of a new movie star-
ring Tom Hanks and a new album re-
corded largely in Nashville that fea-
tures new renditions of the songs we
loved hearing Mr. Rogers sing.
Fred Rogers learned to play piano
when he was very young. He studied
music composition in college, and he
actually wrote the wonderful songs we
came to know so well, including
‘‘Won’t You Be My Neighbor,’’ ‘‘It’s
Such a Good Feeling,’’ and ‘‘Many
Ways to Say I Love You.’’
Rogers taught us about kindness and
love, but his lessons were never trite
and they were not in isolation from the
world or reality.
He talked to our children about as-
sassination with a hand puppet after
Robert Kennedy was killed. He talked
about racism and about divorce. When
teaching children how to deal with
scary news on TV, he told the story
that as a young boy his ‘‘mother would
say to me, ‘Look for the helpers. You
will always find people who are help-
ing.’ ’’ Inevitably with today’s media
and internet, after any disaster or
emergency you will see people comfort
one another with that quote from Mr.
Rogers and thanking our brave police,
firefighters, and first responders. And
that belief in the importance of ‘‘help-
ers’’ has inspired countless people to
take on the role of being a helper,
learning the skills and taking on the
important role of saving lives, pro-
tecting our community, and rushing in
when others are rushing out.
Mr. Rogers also shared with all of us
a love for learning, the joy of making
new friends and trying new experi-
ences. He taught us the power of imagi-
nation, the awe of a new book, and the
soothing help that a song can provide.
I often talk about what happens in
Washington as a split-screen tele-
vision—all the anger and the tweets
and the upset on one side of the screen
and all the quiet successes and getting
along and bills passing and helpful
meetings happening on the other side
of the screen. As a society, in the
media and online, we generally choose
to amplify the one side of the screen—
the angry and the noisy side. But this
month is a good time to amplify the
other.
My late friend Alex Haley, the author
of Roots, used to say ‘‘Find the Good
and Praise It.’’ That is the best way to
celebrate the memory of Fred Rogers—
to find the good in one another, just as
he did, and to help children find the
good in themselves.

BER 20, 2019, GENERAL ELEC-
TIONS AND SUPPORTING THE
CONVENING OF NEW ELECTIONS
IN BOLIVIA AT THE EARLIEST
POSSIBLE DATE
Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. MENEN-
DEZ, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. COONS,
and Mr. KAINE) submitted the following
resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 447
Whereas Evo Morales was elected as the
first indigenous president of Bolivia in 2005;
Whereas, in 2009, Bolivians approved by a
vote of more than 60 percent in a nationwide
referendum a new constitution that estab-
lished a limit of two 5-year presidential
terms;
Whereas, in 2009 and 2014, President Mo-
rales won re-election to a second and third
term in office with more than 60 percent of
the vote;
Whereas, in 2016, 51.3 percent of Bolivian
voters rejected a national referendum on the
proposal by the Administration of President
Morales to lift presidential term limits;
Whereas, in 2017, despite the results of the
2016 national referendum, President Morales’
political allies in the Bolivian Constitu-
tional Tribunal removed presidential term
limits;
Whereas, on October 20, 2019, amid existing
concerns over the politicization of Bolivia’s
electoral commission, Bolivian voters went
to the polls for general elections to choose a
new president, members of the Senate, and
members of the Chamber of Deputies;
Whereas, at the invitation of Morales Ad-
ministration, the Organization of American
States (OAS) General Secretariat sent an
Electoral Observation Mission to Bolivia
that was comprised of 92 experts and observ-
ers from 24 different nationalities deployed
in the country’s nine departments and in
three countries in which Bolivian expatri-
ates could cast their votes abroad;
Whereas, on October 20, 2019, Bolivian elec-
toral authorities stopped reporting the pre-
liminary vote count for a period of 20 hours,
subsequently announced preliminary results
that negated the need for a second-round
election, and Evo Morales proclaimed him-
self the winner of the presidential election;
Whereas, on October 21, 2019, the OAS Elec-
toral Observation Mission in Bolivia ex-
pressed ‘‘deep concern and surprise at the
drastic and hard-to-explain change in the
trend of the preliminary results revealed
after the closing of the polls’’;
Whereas, in the aftermath of the October
20, 2019, general elections, violent protests
occurred throughout Bolivia in response to
electoral irregularities and the findings of
the OAS Electoral Observation Mission;
Whereas, on October 30, 2019, the Morales
Administration and the OAS General Secre-
tariat signed an agreement to have the OAS
conduct an audit of the integrity of the Oc-
tober 20, 2019, general elections;
Whereas, on November 10, 2019, an OAS
technical mission issued a report on its audit
of the integrity of the October 20, 2019, gen-
eral elections, which included findings that—
(1) the preliminary and final election re-
sults were transmitted via a flawed com-
puter transmission system that was accessed
by unauthorized outside computer servers;
(2) there was a deficient chain of custody
for and significant irregularities in the elec-
toral tally sheets and other electoral
records; and
(3) the audit team could not validate the
results of the election and therefore rec-
ommended a new electoral process;
Whereas, on November 10, 2019, President
Morales acknowledged the results of the OAS
technical mission, announced that he would
call new elections, and stated that, ‘‘new na-
tional elections will allow the Bolivian peo-
ple to democratically choose new authorities
with their vote’’;
Whereas, in the face of widespread public
protests and a deteriorating security envi-
ronment, President Morales departed Bolivia
on November 12, 2019, and was granted asy-
lum by the Government of Mexico;
Whereas, on November 12, 2019, the Boliv-
ian Constitutional Tribunal recognized an
interim president of Bolivia;
Whereas the transitional government in
Bolivia has committed to hold new elections
by January 22, 2020; and
Whereas the Inter-American Commission
on Human Rights stated that protests occur-
ring in Bolivia since the October 20, 2019,
general election have left 23 people dead and
more than 700 people injured: Now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) expresses concern about the numerous
irregularities that occurred during the Octo-
ber 20, 2019, general elections in Bolivia;
(2) commends the efforts of the OAS Elec-
toral Observation Mission in Bolivia and sup-
ports the findings of the OAS electoral audit
mission, which documented numerous irreg-
ularities during the October 2019 general
elections in Bolivia;
(3) deplores the acts of violence that have
occurred in Bolivia in the aftermath of the
October 20, 2019, general elections and urges
all Bolivians to repudiate violence and to
peacefully exercise their rights of freedom of
expression and assembly;
(4) urges Bolivia’s transitional government
to work expeditiously to establish the condi-
tions for an inclusive, credible, transparent,
and democratic elections as soon as possible
in accordance with their laws and constitu-
tion;
(5) encourages the Department of State
and the U.S. Mission to the Organization of
American States to provide all appropriate
support to facilitate the convening of free,
fair, and transparent democratic elections in
Bolivia as soon as possible in accordance
with their laws and constitution;
(6) encourages the Organization of Amer-
ican States to take all necessary steps, in ac-
cordance with the principles of the Inter-
American Democratic Charter, to ensure re-
spect for the will of Bolivian voters and the
integrity of the new democratic elections in
Bolivia as soon as possible in accordance
with their laws and constitution; and
(7) supports the call by the Permanent
Council of the Organization of American
States for Bolivian authorities to ensure full
respect and protection of human rights and
accountability for any violation thereof.

HON. VAN TAYLOR

Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Gerald Brence, the Athletic Director for
Plano ISD, for thirty-nine years of dedicated
service to student athletes in Plano, Texas.
Before earning the title of Athletic Director in
2007, Gerald Brence served as the Head
Coach of the Plano Senior High School Foot-
ball team from 1992 to 2007. During his ten-
ure, the Plano Senior Wildcats secured a state
championship title in 1994 and made five trips
to the state quarterfinals. One of the most-win-
ning coaches in Plano Senior High’s history,
Coach Brence has earned the respect and ad-
miration of those around him.
Under his steadfast leadership as Athletic
Director, Plano ISD earned state champion-
ships in seven different sports including: golf,
tennis, baseball, boys basketball, boys soccer,
girls soccer, and girls basketball.
Our community is proud of Director Brence’s
leadership within Plano ISD, and we are grate-
ful for the countless lives he has inspired
throughout his career.
Now upon his retirement, I ask my col-
leagues in the House of Representatives to
join me thanking Director Gerald Brence for

Ryan has been very active with his troop,

ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Ryan
has contributed to his community through his
Eagle Scout project.

HONORING THE ONE HUNDRETH
SEASON OF ST. BONAVENTURE
UNIVERSITY MEN’S BASKETBALL
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
recognize the one hundredth season of St.
Bonaventure University Men’s Basketball.
St. Bonaventure University’s basketball pro-
gram is celebrating their one hundredth sea-
son this year, marking the beginning of this
legendary legacy that started so long ago. The
first game took place on December 11, 1919
in Butler Gym.
The once simple team rose to national
prominence in the 1950s and 1960s, thanks to
All-Americans Tom Stith, Sam Stith and Fred
Crawford.
The centennial celebration also marks the
fiftieth anniversary of the 1969–70 Final Four
Squad. This legendary team finished with a
25–3 record which they are still remembered
for today. In 1970, Bob ‘‘Big Cat’’ Lanier led
St. Bonaventure to the Final Four of the NCAA
Tournament. Lanier scored 2,067 points dur-
ing his basketball career. The entire 1970s
team will be recognized on December 7 for
their accomplishments.
The Bonnies, throughout their tenure, have
brought joy to many fans, gave many students
a variety of opportunities on the team and
have brought the community together over the
fascinating game of basketball. This anniver-
sary is one to be remembered—a great mile-
stone in the history of both the team and the
university.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
recognize St. Bonaventure University on their
one hundredth season of basketball. Go Bon-
nies.

CELEBRATING GEORGE HYAK’S
100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to wish Mr. George Hyak, of Victoria, Texas,
a heartfelt happy 100th birthday and thank him
for his service to our country.
George is an example of a life well-lived. He
and his precious bride Sarah met at church as
young teens. They kept in touch with hand-
written notes while he was deployed a few
short years later. Their love has lasted for
decades—February marked 71 years of mar-
riage and brought them two children, six
grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren, and
one great-great-grandson. George also co-
founded Dicks Food Stores in 1938, which his
family still operates to this day in my home-
town of Victoria. His family recalls that from a
young age as one of six children, he worked
to help provide for his family. Throughout his
life, George has worked with diligence and in-
tegrity and in service to others.
George was drafted in 1942 into the Army
VIII Corps under General Troy Middleton. Two
years into his service, June 6, 1944, became
a day that not only shaped George’s life but
the course of our entire nation and indeed the
world. George joined more than 160,000
troops on D-Day as the Allies launched the
largest seaborne invasion in history. In the
words of Winston Churchill, the operation was
‘‘undoubtedly the most complicated and dif-
ficult that has ever occurred.’’ Starting as an
infantryman, George landed on the beaches of
Normandy with the second wave of troops and
took on enemy fire. Mr. Hyak risked his life to
help turn the tide of the war in Europe, which
ultimately led to its liberation.
What’s more, he also bravely fought at the
Battle of the Bulge and was one of the first in
the group to invade Ohrdruf, a German con-
centration camp. As the war in Europe was
coming to a close, George was in Frankfurt,
Germany, awaiting orders to deploy for the in-
vasion of Japan. I can imagine the emotions
they must have felt when they heard the war
was finally over—and instead they’d be head-
ed home.
When George returned home, he continued
to operate Dick’s Food Stores. The longevity
of the establishment earned it the Texas His-
torical Commission’s Texas Treasure Business
Award. It’s an honor bestowed on businesses
for providing employment opportunities and
boosting the state’s economy for at least 50
years.
George continues to bless the lives of those
who’ve come to know him, whether a fellow
soldier or friend. As we look to celebrate
Thanksgiving, we as a nation have a lot to be
thankful for. George is one of them. May Mr.
Hyak’s life serve as a reminder of the price
that he and others like him paid for our free-
dom.
God has always had a plan for Mr. Hyak,
and for us today George Hyak’s life paints a
picture of sacrifice and duty that we can all
learn from. I join his friends and family in cele-
brating 100 years and thanking him for his
service to our nation. Happy 100th Birthday,
George.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR KYLE
STACK’S LIFE AND LEGACY
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Mayor Kyle Stack for her
lifetime of service. Mayor Stack passed away
on November 29, 2019 which greatly sad-
dened our community. Her work as Mayor of
the City of Trenton is worthy of commenda-
tion.
Mayor Stack served for 26 years as the city
clerk, before being elected as mayor in 2011.
During this time, she was the only Master Mu-
nicipal Clerk in Wayne County for several
years. As mayor, she was instrumental in ad-
dressing the very real issue of trains blocking
crossings for too long, bringing together the
Michigan Department of Transportation, Com-
munity and State Leaders to resolve this prob-
lem. Mayor Stack also worked diligently on the
redevelopment of the McLouth Steel plant.
She served on the Trenton Rotary Scholarship
Committee, Trenton High School Hockey
Team’s John McKay Scholarship Selection
Committee, and was the first woman president
of the Trenton Rotary Club.
Mayor Stack’s life stands as a role model of
selfless service and demonstrates a tremen-
dous love for her community. Beloved for her
generosity and tenacity, Mayor Stack’s reputa-
tion is a testament to the significant impact
she had on Trenton and its residents. Her
dedicated work has been critical in building
and expanding the thriving community of Tren-
ton. Mayor Stack was a champion for the resi-
dents of Trenton, a mentor to her colleagues,
and her visionary leadership continues to in-
spire the community.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Mayor Kyle Stack for a lifetime
of service to her community. We are grateful
for her dedicated work and her compassion
and leadership will be greatly missed.

IN SUPPORT OF HISTORICALLY
BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVER-
SITIES
SPEECH OF
HON. MARCIA L. FUDGE
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, December 3, 2019
Ms. FUDGE. Madam Speaker, more than
one quarter of all undergraduate students in
the United States attend Historically Black Col-
leges and Universities and other Minority
Serving Institutions. These schools play a crit-
ical role in unlocking higher education opportu-
nities for millions of degree-seekers, including
students of color and low-income students, of
which many are the first in their family to at-
tend college.
To protect these essential institutions from
the threat of closure and financial despair, we
must continue to provide them with the re-
sources they need to prepare students for the
modern economy.
Title III, Part F of the Higher Education Act
authorizes important, mandatory funding for
Historically Black Colleges and Universities,
Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority
Serving Institutions to educate and prepare
students for professions in the Science, Tech-
nology, Engineering, and Math, or STEM,
fields.
Unfortunately, this critical source of funding
expired on September 30, 2019. This lapse
jeopardizes the viability of these institutions,
as well as the STEM readiness of the students
they serve.
At a time when diverse representation is low
in the STEM economy, Congress must imme-
diately restore mandatory funding to prevent
permanent and irreversible damage to STEM
programs at these historic institutions that give
students from underserved communities an
opportunity to rise above their circumstances.
On September 17, 2019, the House passed
the FUTURE Act, an extension of the $255
million in essential mandatory funding for
HBCUs and MSls. Despite receiving unani-
mous support in the House, the bill has yet to
be considered by the Senate and was not in-
cluded in the continuing resolution that passed
in November.
As Congress considers spending bills for
next year, we must restore this vital source of
funding that expands opportunities for under-
represented students. It is past time to uphold
our promise to support these historic institu-
tions and the students they serve.

STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S PRO-
POSAL TO INCREASE HUNGER
AND FOOD INSECURITY
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I am alarmed and outraged by the
Trump Administration’s decision to increase
hunger and food insecurity for millions of
Americans. Governments should strengthen
their people, assist the vulnerable, and im-
prove well-being. Instead, the Trump Adminis-
tration has advanced a rule change to cut mil-
lions of low-income children, families, vet-
erans, people with disabilities, and seniors off
their food stamp benefits, or Supplemental Nu-
trition Assistance Program (SNAP). The
Trump Administration estimates that at least
3.1 million families would lose their SNAP
benefits, including stopping free and reduced
school meals for nearly one million children.
In 2017, almost 40 million people, including
more than 12.5 million children, experienced
food insecurity. In my home state of Illinois,
more than 63 percent of SNAP participants
are in families with children and almost 30
percent are in families with members who are
elderly or disabled. This rule targets the most
vulnerable people in my state and across the
nation. Even the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture admits that this Trump policy would ex-
acerbate food insecurity for millions of Ameri-
cans.
This is unacceptable. Millions of low-income
Americans rely on SNAP as the first line of
defense against hunger and food insecurity.
By imposing this harmful rule, the Trump Ad-
ministration actually increases hunger and
hardship by erecting additional barriers for
families and individuals who are trying to meet
one of the most basic needs for survival.
I stand in strong opposition to this unneces-
sary and spiteful rule. The Trump Administra-
tion is attempting to impose a policy that Con-
gress has rejected twice in the last two
versions of the Farm Bill via bipartisan votes.
The policies of this Administration have advan-
taged the most secure and left working fami-
lies and our most vulnerable populations be-
hind. As the Trump Administration prioritizes
giving trillions of dollars to the most privileged
corporations and billionaires, it literally takes
food from hungry children. I reject this dis-
graceful rule and will continue to fight for the
people of Chicago and the nation to ensure
they receive the food they need. I urge my
colleagues to join me in opposing this pro-
posed rule and demanding that the Trump Ad-
ministration rescind the rule immediately.

MASTER SERGEANT JAMES
CHAMBERLAIN TRIBUTE
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Master Sgt. James Chamberlain
of La Veta, Colorado who is retiring from the
U.S. Air Force after nearly 30 years of service.
Master Sgt. Chamberlain began his active
duty service in 1992 shortly after graduating
from Northeast Community College in Norfolk,
Nebraska with an Associate’s Degree in Crimi-
nal Justice with an emphasis in Law Enforce-
ment. Upon completion of his initial training,
he went on to serve in numerous duty posi-
tions spanning from news broadcasting to mili-
tary police security. The Air Force sent him to
cities around the world such as Los Angeles,
California, Azores, Portugal, and Keflavik, Ice-
land. His courage and service were exempli-
fied during multiple voluntary deployments to
the Middle East. During these deployments
Master Sgt. Chamberlain earned dozens of
awards and recognitions including the Iraq
Campaign Medal with a Bronze Star, the Air
Force Commendation Medal, and the Global
War on Terrorism Service Medal.
Master Sgt. Chamberlain’s military career
was simultaneously complemented by his time
as a police officer. He left active duty service
in September 1996 and returned to his family
ranch near Walsenburg, Colorado. It was
there that he put his GI bill to use and grad-
uated near the top of his class at the Southern
Colorado Law Enforcement Training Academy
in Trinidad, Colorado. He was hired as a po-
lice officer for the city of La Junta, Colorado in
August 1997. He continued his service in the
Air Force Reserve as part of the 310th Secu-
rity Forces Squadron at the newly renamed
Schriever Air Force Base outside of Colorado
Springs, Colorado, an opportunity he was
eager to pursue.
In Walsenburg, the community he has most
recently been serving, Master Sgt. Chamber-
lain was named Distinguished Officer of the
Year for the Colorado Police Protective Asso-
ciation and received the Distinguished Service
Award by the city. Additionally, he earned the
Police Medal of Honor and the Rescuer Award
for Valor by Southern Colorado Regional EMS
and Trauma Advisory Council. This past year,
he was even recognized by La Veta Schools
on Veterans Day for his service as an Air
Force veteran, a testament to what his sac-
rifices mean to his fellow community mem-
bers.
Madam Speaker, Master Sgt. Chamberlain’s
service to his country and enduring work-ethic
will continue to have a positive impact on the
community for years to come. It is my privilege
to recognize him today, and express heartfelt
gratitude for the important work he has done
throughout his life. I wish him a happy retire-
ment from military service and sincerely hope
that he knows how proud his community, the
state of Colorado, and the entire country is of
his sacrifice and service both as an Airman
and a police officer.

IN MEMORY OF GARY MAZZONE
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
observe and mourn the passing of retired Po-
lice Captain Gary Mazzone of East Windsor,
Connecticut. Sadly, Gary’s death was the re-
sult of a tragic plane accident that occurred on
October 2, 2019 at Bradley International Air-
port in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.
Gary’s full and productive life touched thou-
sands of his fellow citizens. First, as a police
officer in the town of Vernon, Connecticut
where I reside, later as an inspector in the of-
fice of Chief State’s Attorney, the highest of-
fice in the Connecticut criminal justice system,
and eventually as the lead Inspector in the of-
fice of the Litchfield State’s Attorney. Alto-
gether his service in the police and court sys-
tems of Connecticut totaled 42 years of dili-
gent, competent, ethical professionalism. As a
lawyer in practice in Vernon before entering
Congress, I personally witnessed Gary’s re-
lentless work ethic, as well as his commitment
to upholding the laws and Constitution of the
state of Connecticut and the United States.
His exemplary service and friendliness made
him a natural role model to young officers who
served under him as he rose to the rank of
Captain. Despite his high rank and the exten-
sive powers that go with it, Gary never ‘‘put on
airs’’ and always kept a very grounded per-
spective on life. He had a great sense of
humor and was always willing to listen to an
opposing view point with respect and consid-
eration. He was the quintessential American
police officer—tough but fair, fearless but
human.
As the many accolades and reminiscences
poured forth in statewide media and in North
Central Connecticut in response to the heart-
breaking news, stories abounded not only of
his work in public safety, but also of his vol-
unteerism in the town of East Windsor, his
support of the special Olympics, and his devo-
tion to honoring our country’s veterans.
Madam Speaker, perhaps most powerfully,
his family shared with the people of Con-
necticut stories of his abiding love for his wife
Joan, their children Daniel, Brian, Maureen,
Kim, and Stacey, and his father Pasquale. He
took an active and enthusiastic interest in all
their pursuits and successes. In particular, the
Hartford Courant sports page published a
wonderful story describing his passionate love
of high school football, particularly the Staf-
ford/Somers/East Windsor Bulldog high school
team that his son Brian coaches. He attended
all their games and was always there to posi-
tively help his son and the players succeed.
Three days after the crash, Brian summoned
his father’s memory to find the strength to
coach the Bulldogs to an emotional victory
against rival Valley Regional/Old Lyme.
Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD, the
Courant’s story by Mr. Shawn McFarland
dated October 6, 2019 which captures so well
the essence of Gary’s lively spirit, family devo-
tion, and deep impact he made on all who
knew him.
Madam Speaker, I ask that the House join
me in expressing our profound admiration for
Gary Mazzone’s lifetime of public service and
deepest condolences to his family for their
loss.
[From the Hartford Courant, Oct. 6, 2019]
THREE DAYS AFTER HIS FATHER DIED IN THE
B–17 CRASH AT BRADLEY AIRPORT, BRIAN
MAZZONE IS BACK ON THE SIDELINE COACH-
ING
After each Stafford/Somers/East Windsor
football game, Gary Mazzone would be the
first to greet his son, Brian, the team’s head
coach, with a hug. Those close to the team
say that Gary never missed a game.
Gary Mazzone, 66, a retired police inspec-
tor in the Litchfield State’s Attorney’s of-
fice, was one of seven killed in Wednesday’s
B–17 crash at Bradley International Airport.
Boarding the World War II era bomber was
described as a ‘‘bucket list’’ type event for
Gary Mazzone, who had a passion for history.
Saturday was Brian Mazzone’s first game
coaching without his father; the first game
in which he wouldn’t receive the traditional
hug and ‘‘post game report,’’ as Stafford as-
sistant Bob Grant described.
As the final seconds ticked off in the Bull-
dogs’ 21–7 win over Valley Regional/Old
Lyme, one by one, Stafford players sur-
rounded Brian Mazzone until the entire team
had formed one giant hug around their
coach. The final whistle blew, and Mazzone—
who had remained composed for the entire
game—broke into tears.
‘‘I never used to cry, ever,’’ Mazzone said.
‘‘My mom died 10 years ago. Once my mom
died, you say ‘hi’ to me and I start crying
now. When someone grabs you and hugs you
. . . there’s a lot of emotion in that.’’
Mazzone was a walking tribute to his fa-
ther during the game. He wore Gary’s Staf-
ford football hoodie, which Brian picked up
early Saturday morning at his father’s home
in Vernon. He wore a camouflage Bulldog
hat, an homage to his father’s love for hunt-
ing. Mazzone said he had gotten the hat for
his father as a Christmas gift years back,
and ironically enough, Gary Mazzone had re-
quested a normal Bulldog cap instead. Brian
Mazzone then went and got a camouflage hat
for himself.
‘‘He went to every game,’’ Grant said. ‘‘Big
Gar was something special. We’d go down
and sit in the coach’s room, and he’d sit with
us. He was one of a kind.’’
Prior to kickoff, a ‘‘moment of celebra-
tion’’ was held in lieu of a standard moment
of silence. All in attendance applauded Gary
Mazzone’s life, as Brian broke down in tears
and was consoled by Grant. Brian Mazzone
said his dad would have loved it.
‘‘We’ve been crying a lot, and we’ve been
watching the news,’’ Mazzone said. ‘‘[Gary
Mazzone] would be patting his chest, going,
‘See me on the news? I was on CBS nightly
news. You see that? I’m on the front page of
the paper.’ Every time, even back when he
was working, he’d be, ‘I’m in the news today.
I’m in the news today.’ He would eat up the
attention. I’m very similar to him.’’
Mazzone described his dad as ‘‘funny as
hell’’ and as a man who was full of life and
loved having fun. He was known for his fa-
mous prank calls, where he would call a busi-
ness and apply for an internship, and then
never show up. In the days since Gary’s pass-
ing, Brian has had many reach out to pass
along their condolences. Almost all of them
have had a new Gary Mazzone prank story to
share, too.
Like Gary, Brian is lively. When his team
forced a fumble early in the first quarter,
Mazzone sprinted onto the field, pumping a
fist and pounding his chest. When senior
Tyler Ouellete connected with junior Trent
Kology on an 84-yard touchdown pass in the
second quarter, Mazzone sprinted the length
of the field celebrating, nearly stride-for-
stride with Kology.
‘‘They always make fun of me when we
watch the film and I’m jumping around and
running,’’ Mazzone said with a laugh. ‘‘If you
notice, I run like an idiot. I’ve got my chest
out like this. I don’t know who taught me to
run.’’
There was never a doubt for Mazzone that
he would coach Saturday’s game, though he
said it had less to do with his father and
more so to do with the fact that he didn’t
want to rearrange the schedule. The Con-
necticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference
granted the team permission to move Satur-
day’s game to a later date, though Mazzone
didn’t want to force his players to sit
through back-to-back bye weeks.
That was to be expected of Mazzone, as his
assistants, current and former players will
tell you. In the face of an unbearable trag-
edy, his motives were for his team.

December 4, 2019
‘‘We knew that we had to pick him up, be-
cause he’s supported us all this time,’’ said
Ouellette, who threw two touchdown passes
in the win. ‘‘We knew that we had to come
through and support him. It was great to see
him here. We all came together, and we all
played hard for him.’’
Each Bulldog helmet had a ‘‘GM’’ decal in
memory of Gary Mazzone. Valley Regional/
Old Lyme also wore the decals on their hel-
mets.
Tim King, head coach of the Warriors who
opposed the Bulldogs on Saturday, is a long-
time friend of Brian Mazzone, and under-
stands what he was going through Saturday.
In 2015, King coached two days after his fa-
ther, George Sr., passed away at age 92.
‘‘It’s a football family,’’ King said. ‘‘For 48
minutes, you battle on the field. But reality
is this type of stuff. When I heard about it,
it’s the first thing I told our kids. You can
worry about grades, you can worry about
whatever, but when something happens as
horrible as what happened to Brian’s dad,
that’s reality. The game of football means
absolutely nothing. All respect in the world,
I know exactly what he was going through.’’
A handful of former Stafford players were
in attendance, standing behind the Bulldogs’
sideline, many wearing team gear. Mazzone
greeted each with a hug following the end of
the first quarter.

HONORING AUSTIN MCCOY
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize Austin McCoy.
Austin is a very special young man who has
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship
and leadership by taking an active part in the
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 393, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout.
Austin has been very active with his troop,
participating in many scout activities. Over the
many years Austin has been involved with
scouting, he has not only earned numerous
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Aus-
tin has earned the rank of Warrior in the Tribe
of Mic-O–Say and become a Brotherhood
member in the Order of the Arrow. Austin has
also contributed to his community through his
Eagle Scout project. Austin worked with the
Platte Land Trust to build a sign for their new
Charlotte Sawyers Nature Area located in
Parkville, Missouri.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in commending Austin McCoy for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

HONORING LEGAL SERVICES FOR
SENIORS
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask that my colleagues in the House join
me in congratulating Legal Services for Sen-
iors on the occasion of their 35th Anniversary.
Beginning in 1985, Legal Services for Seniors
has been dedicated to facilitating attorneys
and legal advocates for senior residents of the
20th Congressional District of California. More
specifically, Legal Services for Seniors has a
history of providing no-cost legal representa-
tion to elderly low-income individuals residing
in Monterey County who would otherwise not
have access to the resources necessary for
protecting their legal rights.
Legal Services for Seniors has made it their
goal to address and correct legal harm done
to Monterey County seniors. They have offices
and outreach locations in Seaside, Carmel,
Carmel Valley, Pacific Grove, King City,
Greenfield, Soledad, Gonzales, Castroville and
Monterey. Legal Services for Seniors’ attor-
neys and advocates provide free legal advice
and complete legal representation to local
seniors in order to address legal problems in-
cluding physical, financial, and emotional
abuse. More than 90,000 seniors have bene-
fitted from no-cost legal support over the past
35 years. Many of the issues are very dra-
matic or life-threatening, and include abuse,
Medicare, landlord-tenant conflicts, medical
and private insurance issues, Social Security
problems, consumer fraud, scams, identity
theft, probate guardianships, wills and ad-
vance health care directives. Thankfully, ap-
proximately 3,000 citizens are assisted with
these issues each year by Legal Services for
Seniors. In 2018 alone, Legal Services for
Seniors restored one million dollars in property
fraudulently appropriated by the individuals
which prey upon our seniors on the central
coast of California.
In addition to direct client representation,
Legal Services for Seniors provides commu-
nity-wide presentations to approximately 2,000
seniors and their family members annually.
These presentations provide information re-
garding issues which are vital to seniors’
wellbeing, including recognizing and pre-
venting elder abuse, scams, and consumer
fraud as well as providing resources for afford-
able housing and end of life healthcare and
decision-making. These services are crucial to
informing citizens of their rights and resources.
Additionally, the agency presents information
on challenges faced by local seniors through
public service announcements, newspaper ar-
ticles, resource fairs, workshops, and other
public venues.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize
the dedication and commitment to compassion
and justice that Legal Services for Seniors
provides to the 20th Congressional District.
We are fortunate to have this non-profit estab-
lishment call the Central Coast home as the
only nonprofit agency in Monterey County pro-
viding no-cost legal services to our elderly
residents. I ask my colleagues to join me in
celebrating the 35th Anniversary of Legal
Services for Seniors.

HONORING MR. CEDRIC FLOUNORY
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN

Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
tribute to Mr. Cedric Flounory for his many
years of federal service to the Internal Rev-
enue Service, on the occasion of his retire-
ment.
During his forty years of public service, Mr.

Force Major. Throughout his military service,
Mr. Flounory garnered awards for his stead-
fast dedication, earning the Air Force Good
Conduct Award, the Marksmanship Award,
and the Meritorious Service Medal with an
Oak Leaf Cluster. After eight years in the Air
Force, Mr. Flounory continued serving the
public with a career that has stretched more
than thirty years at the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice. A caring professional, Mr. Flounory has
been praised for his work at the IRS, receiving
awards like Employee of the Month and a Per-
formance Award. His service both on the
ground through military service and in the of-
fice through the Internal Revenue Service,
portrays his dedication to the nation.
In short, Mr. Cedric Flounory has honorably
served our country and the people of the 13th
Congressional District. Please join me in hon-
oring him for his forty years of federal service
as we wish him well on his retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BALLET WEST’S THE
NUTCRACKER
HON. BEN McADAMS
OF UTAH
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, this De-
cember, Utahns and visitors to my state are
breathlessly waiting for the curtain to go up on
the 75th anniversary of a beloved holiday tra-
dition—Ballet West’s performance of ‘‘The
Nutcracker’’. This season’s $3 million produc-
tion restores the original choreography by Bal-
let West’s founder Willam Christensen—or Mr.
C—as he was fondly known to dancers and
audience members alike. He passed away in
2001 at the age of 99.
Willam Christensen was known as a cham-
pion of American ballet, who headed important
companies in Portland, San Francisco and
Salt Lake City. He was born in 1902, in
Brigham City, Utah. In San Francisco, in 1944,
Christensen staged the first complete Amer-
ican production of ‘‘The Nutcracker.’’ In 1951,
Mr. C. moved with his ailing wife to Salt Lake,
seeking a better climate for her health. He
began teaching ballet at the University of Utah
and founded what would become Ballet West
in 1968. His production of ‘‘The Nutcracker’’
soon became a Utah holiday sensation. Many
an aspiring young Utah male or female dancer
traces the start of a career from being on
stage in ‘‘The Nutcracker’’ party scene, where
the story unfolds of young Clara’s dream jour-
ney into the magical land of the Sugar Plum
Fairy. Thousands of Utah children and their
parents and grandparents have been trans-
ported from their seats in a darkened theatre
to a place with waltzing snowflakes and a
marvelous dancing bear.
When Ballet West performed ‘‘The Nut-
cracker’’ at the Kennedy Center in December
of 2018, the Washington Post’s dance critic
wrote: ‘‘This is not only a beautifully danced
and gorgeously designed production. It’s also
historic. The result is a fine balance of textural
spectacle and elegant dancing.’’

HONORING THE LIFE OF GEORGE
VANECEK
HON. RO KHANNA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, today I
honor the life of George Vanecek, a key lead-
er in the development of the internet and Sil-
icon Valley. He passed away this September
at the age of 61.
Born in Prague, Czech Republic, George
escaped his home country as a boy with his
family during the Prague Spring of 1968 after
refusing to join the Czech Communist Party.
They settled in the Oregon mountains. He was
proud of his adoptive home and believed
deeply in its promise of opportunity.
It was this appreciation that drove George’s
career, but it was his brilliant mind that
steered it. George was not only an award-win-
ning programmer at a young age; he was also
a talented painter. He applied this artistry to
the field of computing. After completing his
PhD in computer science, George helped pio-
neer the first http servers at the National Insti-
tute of Science and Technology (NIST) before
bringing the world wide web to Purdue Univer-
sity, where he was a professor of computer
science and won the Excellence in Teaching
Award early in his academic tenure. Then, at
AT&T Labs Internet Platforms Division in San
Jose, he oversaw the development of a vast
platform for internet commerce. George co-
founded several companies, working in areas
like telecommunications and the early internet
of things (IoT). George did this work with pride
in the opportunity he had been given when he
came to America. He cared deeply about giv-
ing back by developing systems in which com-
puters enhanced human capacity. With an eye
to the future, George’s creativity and vision al-
lowed him to become a leader in his field.
In his final position as Vice President and
Chief Architect of Technical Architecture at
FICO, he worked on solutions to today’s big
problems, like fraud detection and algorithmic
bias, designing and overseeing the construc-
tion of a data streaming platform that could
derive intelligent decisions from large amounts
of data in real time. Perhaps more strikingly,
George was known among his peers for show-
ing up in the office wearing full leather, having
just parked the Aprilia Tuono motorcycle he
rode between lanes of traffic into the Santa
Clara office each morning, not far from my dis-
trict office.
George was not only a scientist but was
also a friend and mentor to many throughout
his career and life. He volunteered his time
helping small business owners get started in
his community. He was a scuba diver, a glider
pilot, and a world traveler. He and his family
foraged for mushrooms along California’s
many hiking trails and explored its wineries
and local breweries. Madam Speaker, George
was a Bay Area man through and through,
and I’m proud to recognize him today for his
contributions to our community.

HONORING THE HOLLISTER
SCHOOL DISTRICT’S ACCELER-
ATED ACHIEVEMENT ACADEMY
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to acknowledge the work of the students,
teachers, and staff at the Accelerated
Achievement Academy (AAA) in the Hollister
School District. AAA has been recognized in
2019 as a National Blue Ribbon School for
fostering an innovative, multi-dimensional
learning environment for students across the
central coast of California.
The Accelerated Achievement Academy is
one of the highest achieving schools in Cali-
fornia, using evidence-based professional de-
velopment and instructional practices in the
classroom to engage students in trans-
formative, real-world learning. AAA works with
a Project-Based Learning (PBL) model that
pushes students to develop deep content
knowledge along with critical thinking, cre-
ativity, and communication skills. Through the
PBL model, students interact with businesses,
organizations, and their community. These
interactions instill in them a sense of agency
and purpose and a complex understanding of
the world around them and their place in it.
The teachers and staff at Accelerated
Achievement Academy are deeply committed
to developing bright and high-achieving stu-
dents into kind and compassionate individuals.
Each classroom creates a social contract, an
agreement of behavior that builds peer-instruc-
tor relational skills to raise the social and emo-
tional capacity of each individual student.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join
me in recognizing the achievement and hard
work of AAA.

GUILETTE BECOMING THE CER-
TIFIED CROP ADVISER CON-
SERVATIONIST OF THE YEAR
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Nick Guilette of Casco,
Wisconsin for receiving the Certified Crop Ad-
viser Conservationist of the Year award from
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
His leadership in agriculture conservation
practices contributes greatly to Wisconsin’s
agricultural industry and set an excellent ex-
ample of stewardship to the community and
the environment.
Nick has a lifelong commitment to agri-
culture, growing up on his family’s farm where
they tended over 300 acres of land. He has
dedicated his professional career to conserva-
tion efforts, excelling in positions such as Ad-
vanced Nutrient Management and GPS Tech-
nician, Certified Crop Adviser and Agronomist,
and Demonstration Farm Project Manager.
Utilizing his background in resource manage-
ment and soil health, Nick provides guidance
to local farms as well as the Natural Re-
sources Conservation Service (NRCS) within
the USDA.
Nick partners with NRCS through his role as
Demonstration Farm Project Manager. He
works with producers through the Door-
Kewaunee Watershed Demonstration Farm
Network striving to protect the Great Lakes
from excess nutrients and sediment leaving
the rural landscape. Nick participates as an
educator at field days, farm tours, workshops,
and demonstration events on crop and nutrient
management practices that build soil health
and reduce erosion.
In addition to his partnership with the USDA,
Nick is vital in furthering soil and water con-
servation efforts throughout Wisconsin’s
Eighth Congressional district. He actively par-
ticipates in my Save the Bay initiative by lend-
ing his expertise at Door/Kewaunee Water-
shed workgroup meetings. He also played a
key role in planning and leading a Save the
Bay Field Day, showcasing new techniques in
conservation farming to more than 125 pro-
ducers and members of the agricultural com-
munity.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in thanking Nick for his com-
mitment to land conservation and dedication to
Wisconsin’s agricultural industry. Northeast
Wisconsin is fortunate to have citizens like
Nick engaged in promoting sustainable agri-
cultural practices.

Housing Finance Commission, on his retire-
ment.
Kim Herman has served as Executive Direc-
tor of the Commission since its beginning in
1984, guiding the organization through chang-
ing economic conditions and championing af-
fordable housing in Washington State and
across the country. Under Mr. Herman’s lead-
ership, the Commission has helped over
73,000 families become homeowners and as-
sisted the development of 128,000 affordable
multifamily housing units statewide. The Com-
mission utilizes the Low-Income Housing Tax
Credit program, the private market, and com-
munity partnerships to help families build a
solid foundation with accessible and affordable
housing. Last year, Mr. Herman was inducted
into the national Affordable Housing Hall of
Fame, a well-deserved recognition of his dec-
ades of work helping Washington State’s most
disadvantaged citizens, including seniors,
farmworkers, and people experiencing home-
lessness, as well as moderate-income fami-
lies.
Mr. Herman has built and supported the ca-
pacity of housing organizations throughout
Washington. He helped to create the Wash-
ington Low Income Housing Alliance and has
served on the boards of countless organiza-
tions and policy groups, including the Gov-
ernor’s Affordable Housing Advisory Board
and Impact Capital.
Mr. Herman’s work in housing has ex-
panded not only the Commission’s expertise,
but the capacity of housing organizations
throughout the state and the country by dedi-
cating his time to multiple leadership positions
at the National Council of State Housing
Agencies and the National Rural Housing Co-
alition.
Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure
that I recognize Kim Herman’s dedication to

pionship title under coach Darren Sunkett.
After the tragic and untimely loss of two

the inspiration to carry on and honor the mem-
ory of their fallen teammates. Despite incred-
ibly difficult circumstances, the Flyers excelled
on the field, outscoring their opponents by an
average of over 36 points per game. These
young men put their hearts into every game,
and their hard work paid off with an accom-
plishment that they can be proud of for the
rest of their lives.
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-

ties and repurpose vacant land. Residents
working hand in hand have been able to re-
duce blight, prevent tax foreclosure, enhance
public green spaces, and so much more.
Please join me in salute to the countless
Detroit residents who have made the Lower
Eastside Action Plan a successful community
venture for the past ten years.

CONGRATULATING JUSTIN LOPEZ-
CARDOZE
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in congratulating Justin Lopez-Cardoze, a
seventh-grade life science teacher at Capital
City Public Charter School, for being named
the 2020 District of Columbia Teacher of the
Year.
The DC Teacher of the Year award is grant-
ed each year to a public or public charter
school teacher who is dedicated to student
growth, and creating connections with families
and communities, and who provides high-qual-
ity instruction.
Lopez-Cardoze, whose father was born in El
Salvador, is the first Latino recipient of the DC
Teacher of the Year award. He follows in the
footsteps of the 2019 DC Teacher of the Year,
Kelly Harper, who was the first DC teacher to
become a finalist in the national competition
for teacher of the year since 2005.
Lopez-Cardoze is a devoted teacher. He
views his work as a way to pay back the
scholarship he won as a student, which made
it possible for him to attend the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill and become a
teacher. The award comes with $7,500 and
makes Lopez-Cardoze eligible for the National
Teacher of the Year award. Lopez-Cardoze is
still paying off his student loans but he has
pledged to use $5,000 of his award, and to
double that amount through fundraising, to
create a scholarship fund to allow a student at
Capital City Public Charter school to go to col-
lege.
His concern for his students is unfailing.
When a student with sickle cell anemia ap-
proached him about proposed cuts to the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, he led his students
in developing an organization to educate the
public about diseases often found among peo-
ple of color.
In his three years at Capital City Public
Charter School, in Northwest DC, Lopez-
Cardoze has made himself an integral part of
the community. He serves as the school’s
Science Department chair, seventh-grade
team lead and middle school representative
on the school’s Equity Core Committee. As a
member of the Equity Core Committee, he co-
creates diversity, equity and inclusion sessions
for staff and works to create a more culturally
competent learning environment for his stu-
dents.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the
House of Representatives to join me in con-
gratulating Justin Lopez-Cardoze for being
named the 2020 District of Columbia Teacher
of the Year and for his commitment and dedi-
cation to DC students.

HONORING SISTER PAULETTE
LOMONACO
HON. NYDIA M. VELÁZQUEZ

Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Sister Paulette LoMonaco, a cherished
public servant and respected New York lead-
er. Sister Paulette has dedicated her life to
helping the vulnerable children, youth and
families of New York City, most recently as
the executive director of Good Shepherd Serv-
ices. As she retires this year, I wanted to pay
homage to the work she has accomplished on
behalf of so many New Yorkers.
Sister Paulette was Good Shepherd Serv-
ices’ longest serving executive director, hold-
ing the position for 37 years and serving the
agency for a total of 50 years. Under
Paulette’s leadership, Good Shepherd Serv-
ices transformed from a small provider of out-
of-home care for vulnerable girls into one of
the largest youth social services agencies in
New York City. Today, the agency works with
30,000 children, youth and families annually
as well as informs policy debates and innova-
tive models concerning youth outcomes within
New York City and beyond.
Notably, Sister Paulette’s unwavering com-
mitment to the welfare of children and families
has led to prominence and respect with city
and state leadership. In fact, Sister Paulette
fearlessly engaged with mayors and the arch-
diocese, fighting for accountability on social
issues and, ultimately, modernizing New York
City’s conception of a nun in the 21st century.

E1538 December 4, 2019
For her efforts to expand opportunities for
nontraditional education and support discon-
nected families, Sister Paulette has been hon-
ored by countless organizations. Not only was
she selected by City & State as one of New
York’s 50 Over 50 and Power 100, but also as
a recipient for the Lewis Hine Award and
Robin Hood Hero Award. During her tenure at
Good Shepherd Services, the agency received
The New York Times’ Company Excellence
Award in 2007 and Crain’s Best Place to Work
in 2014 Award. Sister Paulette also pioneered
the city’s first ever transfer school in partner-
ship with the New York City Department of
Education and helped reshape the city’s foster
care system.
Madam Speaker, the people of New York
owe a debt of gratitude to Sister Paulette for
her years of service. I ask my colleagues to
join me in saluting her as she moves on to her
next phase of life. I wish her and her family all
the best and thank her for all she has done for
New York’s youth.

HONORING MR. FELIPE ‘TRES’
BARRERA
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor Mr. Felipe ‘Tres’ Barrera,
a member of the Washington Nationals 2019
World Series Champions and a Rio Grande
Valley Native.
Tres Barrera is an incredibly talented pro-
fessional baseball catcher for the Washington
Nationals. He was born in Eagle Pass, Texas,
and moved to the Rio Grande Valley when he
was 10 years old. Tres played on the baseball
team for Hidalgo High School his freshman
year, winning the District 32–3A Most Valuable
Player award, before transferring to Sharyland
High School. At Sharyland High School, Tres
played football and baseball, and quickly be-
came a standout athlete and student. He was
selected to two all-state teams, and won the
30–5A Most Valuable Player and the All-Valley
Player of the Year as a senior. His batting av-
erage was an astonishing .452, hitting 22
home runs during his time at Sharyland High
School.
Tres’ incredible work ethic, determination,
and sheer talent earned him a spot on the re-
nowned baseball team for the University of
Texas at Austin. As a freshman, Tres was the
team’s starting catcher, won the 2014 College
Home Run Derby, and led Texas to the Col-
lege World Series. His achievements contin-
ued on.
During his sophomore year, Tres was a vital
part of the University of Texas’ Big 12 cham-
pionship team, while adding his name to the
All-Big 12 second team. In his junior year
campaign, Tres earned the 2016 Academic
All-Big 12 baseball honors and was named an
All-Big 12 honorable mention. He left Texas
after his junior year to join the minor leagues,
but only after walking away with 20 home runs
and 106 runs batted in (RBIs) for the Univer-
sity of Texas at Austin.
Tres Barrera’s hard work and dedication
continued for the next three years as he
played for a number of minor league teams
before being called up to the Major League
Baseball, MLB, on September 8, 2019, for the
Washington Nationals. Being a member of the
Nationals, Tres participated in one of the most
unlikely runs in the history of professional
baseball.
The Nationals’ record through 50 games
was a poor 19 wins and 31 losses before they
won 74 of their next 122 games. This secured
the Nationals a wild-card spot in the
postseason, The Nationals continued their un-
likely playoff run until the very end, where they
beat the Houston Astros in seven games, win-
ning the World Series on October 10, 2019.
On that day, Tres earned himself the coveted
World Series ring.
Madam Speaker, Mr. Tres Barrera worked
tirelessly to prove that with determination, will
power, and commitment, we can accomplish
anything we set ourselves to do in life. Tres
made history, gave young people across our
country the hope to achieve anything they set
their mind to and for that I stand here today
to recognize him. He is a proud son of South
Texas and the Rio Grande Valley, and we ap-
preciate him for his work and dedication to the
Washington Nationals.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND CON-
TRIBUTIONS OF VICTORIA J.
POLLYEA
HON. KATHY CASTOR
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to celebrate the life and contribu-
tions of a tireless leader of the Tampa com-
munity, Victoria ‘‘Vicki’’ J. Pollyea.
Vicki was born and raised in Tampa, Flor-
ida. At an early age, Vicki learned how to take
on challenges after being diagnosed with
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). Vicki
used her hard earned ability to ‘‘fight through’’
for herself and others her entire life. For ex-
ample, having to undergo strenuous physical
therapy in her youth, inspired her to pursue
Occupational Therapy so she could be a
source of strength and healing for others.
After graduating Summa Cum Laude from
the University of Florida, Vicki worked as a pe-
diatric occupational therapist until CMT forced
her to retire. Again, even though she retired
early from formal work, she kept her skills
honed and never ceased using them to help
others. And, being unable to continue prac-
ticing as an occupational therapist, she used
her strength and energy to plunge into advo-
cacy for CMT. She served as the web page
moderator for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Associa-
tion (CMTA); realized the impact that CMT
had on her neighbors in Tampa and helped
found the CMTA Tampa branch. Vicki then be-
came a branch leader and a Support Group
Leader for CMTA. She was always there for
the newly diagnosed as a shining real-life ex-
ample of perseverance.
Vicki’s involvement and commitment to the
Tampa community grew when she co-founded
the Bayshore Gardens Neighborhood Associa-
tion. She served as president for more than
two decades. In addition to her position, she
hosted annual holiday gatherings for neigh-
bors, including many who didn’t have any-
where else to go. Vicki also served on the
Mayor’s Neighborhood Task Force and helped
draft the City of Tampa’s tree-protection code
and her efforts to improve Bayshore Boulevard
are evident every day.
Vicki used her voice to advocate for her
South Tampa neighborhood and indeed the
entire city. She helped manage the urban for-
est and ensured all neighborhoods had their
voices heard. Shortly before her death, the
Tampa City Council honored her with a com-
mendation for her community service and a
CMT walk-n-roll event has been named in her
honor.
Vicki is survived by her husband, Archie
Giannella; sister and brother in-law, Lisa and
Gordon; niece, Claire; stepson, Brock Heinz;
godson, John Helmiere, Randi, John, and
many beloved cousins. She also leaves be-
hind a community of children, from babies to
adults with babies of their own, who cherish
her as a beloved ‘‘aunt’’.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful and
saddened Tampa community, I am proud to
honor Victoria J. Pollyea’s life. Vicki was ad-
mired by her neighbors for her advocacy and
her will to never let any challenge dim her
passion to help others. Her devotion to her
neighbors and Tampa inspires us still and will
live on always in our hearts.

COMMUNITY
HON. TROY BALDERSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Mayor Eugene Parkison,
for the forty years he has dedicated to Lex-
ington, Ohio and the surrounding area.
Mayor Parkison’s career, now spanning
more than four decades, exemplifies a selfless
commitment to public service. After being ap-
pointed to a Lexington City Council seat in
1978, Gene was sworn in as Mayor in 1983.
Today, with more than 35 years in this role, he
is now the longest-tenured mayor in Richland
County history.
As a holder of public office, Mayor Parkison
has continually gone above and beyond his
call of duty. His dedication has manifested

itself in countless ways over the years, includ-
ing in his recent effort to collect and donate
several boxes of clothing, shoes, and blankets
to victims of Hurricane Harvey in 2017. For his
remarkable service, Gene has been honored
with several awards, including the proclama-
tion of Eugene R. Parkison Day—which has
been celebrated in Lexington on July 1st of
every year since 2013.
Admired and respected by all, many current
and former Lexington City councilman have
cited Gene as an important mentor in their
lives—both professionally and personally.
However, beyond his work in local govern-
ment, Gene has served the Lexington commu-
nity in a number of other capacities as well, in-
cluding as a member of the Catholic Charities
Board.
As family, friends, and Lexington gather to
recognize Gene’s outstanding career, I salute
him for his ongoing commitment to service
above self. Mayor Parkison can take great
pride in all he has accomplished and in the
positive impact that his work has—and will
continue to—have.
I thank Gene for his devotion to bettering
Lexington, Ohio and in turn, I honor him for
his incredible record of achievement.

IN SUPPORT OF HISTORICALLY
BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVER-
SITIES
SPEECH OF
HON. KAREN BASS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, December 3, 2019
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, the Congres-
sional Black Caucus is leading a Special
Order Hour discussing support for Historically
Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority-
Serving Institutions. Congress must provide
mandatory funding for these institutions.
Fighting for historically black colleges and
universities (HBCUs) is one of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus’s highest priorities be-
cause HBCUs are critical contributors to the
strength of the Black community and our
country.
Many Members in our caucus have at-
tended great HBCUs such as American Bap-
tist College, Central State University, Clark At-
lanta University, Fisk University, Florida A&M,
Howard University, Jackson State University,
Morehouse College, North Carolina A&T State
University, North Carolina Central University,
Prairie View A&M University, South Carolina
State University, Texas Southern University,
Tougaloo College, Tuskegee University, Vir-
ginia State University, Virginia Union Univer-
sity, and Wiley College among others.
In the 115th Congress, the CBC launched a
tour of HBCUs called #CBCOnTheYard. The
goal of the tour was to listen, involve, and mo-
bilize students to effect change in their com-
munities and to get their thoughts on the di-
rection of the country and issues that affect
their lives. The CBC hosted events at More-
house College, Xavier University, Bowie State
University, and Howard University.
According to the Thurgood Marshall College
Fund, HBCUs account for 22 percent of cur-
rent bachelor’s degrees granted to African
Americans. Moreover, among African Ameri-
cans, 13 percent of CEOs, 40 percent of engi-
neers, 40 percent of health care professionals,
50 percent of teachers, 50 percent of non-
HBCU professors, 50 percent of lawyers, 80
percent of judges, and 90 percent with bach-
elor’s degrees in STEM subjects graduated
from an HBCU.
The economic impact of HBCUs is equally
impressive. A report by the UNCF called
HBCUs Make America Strong: The Positive
Economic Impact of Historically Black Col-
leges and Universities shows that HBCUs
generate $14.8 billion in economic impact an-
nually.
HBCUs are vital to the students who attend
them and the entire country, which makes use
of the valuable skills these graduates bring to
the private and public sectors.
Our nation must continue to invest in
HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions.
