Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 7, 2019 No. 41
House of Representatives
The House met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. TAKANO).
f
DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,
March 7, 2019.
I hereby appoint the Honorable MARK
TAKANO to act as Speaker pro tempore on
this day.
NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
f
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by
the majority and minority leaders for
morning-hour debate.
The Chair will alternate recognition
between the parties. All time shall be
equally allocated between the parties,
and in no event shall debate continue
beyond 11:50 a.m. Each Member, other
than the majority and minority leaders
and the minority whip, shall be limited
to 5 minutes.

REASONS TO OPPOSE H.R. 1
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, later today,
we are going to be voting on H.R. 1, and
I would like to make a few points for
the RECORD.
To my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle, before you vote this after-
noon, I would like you to remember
one thing. This bill is nearly 600 pages,
and it has been referred to 10 different
committees, yet it has been subject to
only one markup.
I want the supporters of this bill to
think about how that really looks. You
are bringing up the bill that is in-
tended to expand the ability of Ameri-
cans to participate in the political
process by using a process that re-
stricted the participation of their
elected officials.
The second thing I want to point out
is the section of this bill that creates a
voucher program to allow people to use
public funds for campaign donations.
Mr. Speaker, instead of using taxpayer
dollars for critical needs like border se-
curity or fixing our roads, we would be
sending these dollars to political cam-
paigns. That would be a complete dis-
aster.
One last thing that I am going to
point out about this bill is the fact
that it would weaponize the FEC to
favor the ruling political party.
Under current law, the Federal Elec-
tion Commission is made up of six
members, consisting of three Repub-
licans and three Democrats. Four votes
are needed to move forward with any
kind of prosecution. The bill says that
the new commission must consist of
two Republicans, two Democrats, and
one independent. By this logic, BERNIE
SANDERS is technically an independent
and would count, even though we all
know he is a socialist and caucuses,
though, with the Democrats.
I would say much more about this
bill, Mr. Speaker, and in the coming
weeks I plan to. But for now, I want my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
know that we have a real chance to put
politics aside and pass some serious re-
form that would make our system
work even better, but the more time
we focus on partisan games like this,
the less time we actually focus on
draining the swamp.
MOTHERS RUNNING FOR ELECTED
OFFICE FACE CHILDCARE OB-
STACLES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes.
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I am a
single mom. When I ran for Congress
last year, I spent thousands and thou-
sands of dollars on childcare.
Running for Federal office requires
60- to 90-hour workweeks, and I worked
every single day, including every single
weekend. I also worked challenging
hours, normally starting my day at 6:45
a.m. and ending with campaign events
stretching late into the evenings.
I juggled dozens and dozens of
childcare providers for nearly 2 years,
without whom I would never have
made it to Congress.
I have three children, Betsy, who is 7;
Paul, who is 10; and Luke, who is 13.
Leaving them alone while I was on the
campaign trail was not an option.
Bringing them along on the campaign
trail was often impossible or inappro-
priate and sometimes could even have
been dangerous for them.
For the past two centuries, Congress
has written many, many laws about
what women may and may not do. But
until this year, women’s representation
in Congress was less than 20 percent.
With the election of my historic class,
we hit 23.4 percent—102 women.
But, Mr. Speaker, that number is
still very low. There are even fewer
moms in Congress and even fewer sin-
gle moms, as in nobody but me. A
major barrier to women running for
elected office is their inability to af-
ford the amount or type of childcare
needed in a campaign.
That is why I worked to include lan-
guage in H.R. 1, the For the People
Act, and introduced an identical stand-
alone bill, the Help America Run Act.
It explicitly allows candidates for Fed-
eral office to use campaign contribu-
tions to pay for childcare.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2508 March 7, 2019
Right now, candidates can use cam-
paign funds for a whole range of ex-
penses, from pizza for exhausted staff
to cybersecurity for digital devices, but
the law does not make it clear that
childcare is among those allowed ex-
penses.
Like so many laws, there is an as-
sumption of a female caregiver behind
every male elected official. In part be-
cause of that, moms who continue to
shoulder the majority of childcare re-
sponsibilities also struggle to run for
Congress.
Until women are fully and equally
present in Congress, women’s perspec-
tives will continue to be underrep-
resented. The result is a weaker democ-
racy for the people.
Mr. Speaker, I very much look for-
ward to the enactment of H.R. 1 and
the Help America Run Act.
f
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
March as Women’s History Month.
Throughout history, countless
women have contributed to the char-
acter and success of the United States
of America. During Women’s History
Month, we celebrate the scores of
women who have worked to improve
our society and who have fought in-
equality and discrimination in every
form.
These women have created a legacy
that lives on and continues to inspire
generations of Americans, from Harriet
Tubman to Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
and Susan B. Anthony to Helen Keller.
Women’s History Month is a time to
honor the lives and legacy of all
women, living and dead. Through shar-
ing their stories, we are able to ac-
knowledge how their contributions
have enriched our lives.
In the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania, legendary journalist Ida Tarbell
was born at the onset of the oil boom.
She is best known for her 1904 book,
‘‘The History of the Standard Oil Com-
pany.’’ Ida Tarbell was known for her
ability to take complex subjects and
break them down into articles that
could be easily consumed by the gen-
eral public.
She had a successful career as an in-
vestigative journalist, and the Oil Re-
gion Alliance in northwestern Pennsyl-
vania recently completed a full res-
toration of Ms. Tarbell’s childhood
home in Titusville so that it would be
preserved for generations to come.
Mr. Speaker, by honoring women and
their achievements, we can honor the
past, inform the present, and inspire
the future.
Many women have served as part of
our Armed Forces throughout history
and proudly continue to today, women
like Mary Ludwig Hays McCauley, who
fought in battles during the Revolu-
tionary War and was among the first
women to receive a military pension,
and modern-day women like Lisa
Jaster, a major in the United States
Army Reserve who completed Army
Ranger School, which is one of the
toughest courses in the military.
Major Jaster was in the first Ranger
class that allowed women, and she is
the first female Army Reserve officer
to become a Ranger School graduate.
Mr. Speaker, many women have left
their imprint on the pages of history,
and there are numerous leaders who
will continue to guide this Nation into
the future. May we celebrate and honor
them, not only during Women’s His-
tory Month, but all year long, and
thank them for their incredible con-
tributions.
f
HEALTH AND NUTRITIONAL CHAL-
LENGES FACING AFRICAN AMER-
ICAN POPULATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the Academy of Nu-
trition and Dietetics, which prepared
this statement for me in acknowledge-
ment of Black History Month.
Minority populations, especially the
African American population, continue
to remain in relatively poor health
when compared to the majority popu-
lation and also continue to be under-
served by the healthcare delivery sys-
tem.
One of the biggest health challenges
facing our country today is obesity,
and the African American community
is especially at risk. In a 2015–2016
study by the CDC, the report found
non-Hispanic Black adults, at 46.8 per-
cent, had a higher prevalence of obe-
sity than non-Hispanic White adults,
which was 37.9 percent.
Compared to other States, Illinois’
obesity rate is a significant area of
concern, with 31 percent of adults hav-
ing obesity. This statistic is higher
than the U.S. median.
Illinois has the 27th highest adult
obesity rate in the Nation and the 7th
highest obesity rate for youth ages 10
to 17. Chicago’s African American com-
munity is the demographic with the
highest obesity rate at 39.8 percent.
With such a high percentage of the
African American community falling
in the obese category, this demo-
graphic runs a higher risk for obesity-
related conditions, including heart dis-
ease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cer-
tain types of cancer that are some of
the leading causes of preventable, pre-
mature death.
Compared to the general population,
African Americans are disproportion-
ately affected by diabetes. African
Americans constitute more than 35 per-
cent of all patients receiving dialysis
treatment for kidney failure but only
represent 13.2 percent of the overall
U.S. population.
High blood pressure is the second
leading cause of kidney failure among
African Americans and remains the
leading cause of death due to its link
with heart attacks and strokes.
With these troubling statistics,
where do we go from here? Awareness,
education, and access are the keys to
changing our Nation’s health, and food
and nutrition practitioners play a very
important role in leading the health
revolution.
Obesity is partially attributed to
poor nutritional intake and has been
implicated as a contributor to cancer,
heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.
Food and nutrition practitioners
have an opportunity and an ethical ob-
ligation to positively influence the
healthcare experience of individuals.
These experts have the power to influ-
ence factors affecting health dispari-
ties at the individual and the popu-
lation levels, including programs such
as SNAP, WIC, adult care food pro-
grams, and other nutrition programs.
By connecting with individuals who
are most at risk, food and nutrition
practitioners can make a huge change
when it comes to the health of African
Americans, as well as the health of all
Americans.
I thank the Academy of Nutrition
and Dietetics for preparing this infor-
mation for me.
f
STATE OF AMERICAN WORKFORCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to talk about our economy and
the state of the American workforce.
With reforms enacted by the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as needed
regulatory relief, nearly every eco-
nomic indicator is pointing up. The lat-
est U.S. jobs report shows our economy
is at its strongest rate in 13 years. Un-
employment is at a record low across
the board. Wages are growing at the
fastest level in over a decade. Business
investment is strong. Best of all, Amer-
ican families are keeping more money
in their pockets. But new success
brings a new set of challenges.
The number of job openings in the
U.S. hit a record high last month of 7.3
million. We have gone from, ‘‘Where
are the jobs?’’ to, ‘‘Where are the work-
ers?’’ While it may seem positive that
there are more jobs open than workers
to fill them, I fear that, without ad-
dressing the needs of our workforce, we
will stifle our incredible economic
growth.
According to a study conducted by
the National Federation of Independent
Business, 22 percent of business owners
cite the difficulty in finding workers as
their single most important business
problem. I hear this from every em-
ployer I meet with in my district. The
number of job openings is staggering
and must be addressed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2509
March 7, 2019
b 1015
In fact, every few months I meet with
a group of staffing companies. These
individuals operate companies that fill
positions ranging from temporary to
permanent work in various industries.
Between these staffing companies, they
would be able to fill thousands of jobs
today if they could find the necessary
workers. Every day, these positions go
unfilled and opportunities are lost.
To help alleviate this situation, I
plan on introducing legislation to help
build a workforce pipeline.
One bill, the USA Workforce Tax
Credit Act, which I will be introducing
next week, encourages charitable dona-
tions for community-based apprentice-
ship initiatives, career and technical
education, workforce development, and
K–12 educational preparedness.
Enacting this proposed legislation
will help meet the urgent need to en-
sure the preparation of current and fu-
ture workers for the changing needs of
the U.S. economy. Job creation and job
preparation must go hand in hand.
Another area we must evaluate to
help fill out workforce shortages is our
Nation’s visa system. Our current sys-
tem spans the spectrum of foreign
work visas, but does not address a
main driver of illegal immigration.
My bill, the Workforce for an Ex-
panding Economy Act, would help ad-
dress the gap in the spectrum. This leg-
islation will create a market-driven
immigration visa program targeted to
workers in occupations that do not re-
quire a college degree, otherwise de-
fined as ‘‘less skilled’’ to do year-
round, non-farm work, creating a new
‘‘H–2D visa.’’ This H–2D visa would
only go into effect if the unemploy-
ment rate is 5 percent or lower in the
metropolitan area where an employer
is seeking employees.
Moreover, this bill would implement
a two-track system in which employers
and potential immigrant laborers are
both required to receive a permit to
work in the U.S.
Much like our other visa programs,
employers will have to prove they are
unable to hire a U.S. worker after un-
dergoing the required market tests.
Employees are only allowed to work
for an approved employer, at the ap-
proved location, in the specific job that
was approved, and all employers will be
required to use E-Verify.
While just a start, Mr. Speaker, I be-
lieve these bills will help strengthen
our workforce and help meet the needs
of employers to continue supporting
our economic growth. I urge my col-
leagues to support them and to help
continue our country’s track record of
success and keep us on the right eco-
nomic path.
f
GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE,
FOR THE PEOPLE, AND OF THE
PEOPLE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. STANTON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to address perhaps the most im-
portant reform legislation to protect
and strengthen our democracy in a
generation: H.R. 1, the For the People
Act.
We have a responsibility, an obliga-
tion, to make sure that our govern-
ment always remains one of the people,
by the people, and for the people. But
the truth is Congress has not done
enough to protect the voices of every-
day Americans and to make sure that
our government institutions are work-
ing for them.
The American people know it, and,
Mr. Speaker, I believe that is exactly
why they voted for new leadership in
our people’s House. They know what is
happening to our political system. The
dark money, the attack ads from se-
cret, fly-by-night groups, the incred-
ible influence special interests seem to
have over too many political leaders.
They see it every day when the system
that used to work so well for the mid-
dle class is now rigged against them.
So much of it is the result of the Su-
preme Court’s Citizens United decision.
Consider the facts: From 2008 to 2016,
the amount of outside spending to in-
fluence our elections has increased ten-
fold, reaching an astonishing $1.4 bil-
lion during our last presidential elec-
tion.
These billions being spent to influ-
ence elections and politicians, they
aren’t coming from everyday Ameri-
cans, but are more likely coming from
Wall Street, Big Pharma, and other
high-powered interests working against
the rest of us. We can do better and,
with H.R. 1, we will do better.
This transformative set of reforms
will shine a light on dark money and
return power to the people. It puts dis-
closure front and center by requiring
political groups to disclose their large
donors, bringing dark money out of the
shadows for good.
H.R. 1 recognizes a simple principle:
The American people ought to know
who is writing big checks to their
elected officials and candidates for of-
fice.
By curbing the influence of special
interests, we can lift the voices of ev-
eryday Americans and we can better
focus on the issues that matter most,
like quality jobs, affordable
healthcare, clean air and water, and
strong infrastructure.
Mr. Speaker, history has its eyes on
us today. Let us, once again, resolve to
make sure that our government re-
mains one of the people, by the people
and, of course, for the people.
f
UNNECESSARY TINKERING WITH
THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I rise as leader of the Repub-
licans on the Education and Labor
Committee, which had a referral on
H.R. 1 that did not even have a hearing,
much less a markup on the provisions
that fall within our jurisdiction.
Mr. Speaker, as you know, a referral
means a bill should be debated by a
committee of jurisdiction, but that did
not happen.
It appears that every corner of Amer-
ican life would be touched by this over-
reaching, politically-motivated bill.
Even colleges and universities did not
manage to escape its reach.
We fully recognize the opportunity
colleges and universities can provide
for traditional 18- to 24-year-old stu-
dents to register to vote. That is why
we have always been supportive of
voter registration efforts on campuses.
But mandating voter registration ef-
forts on campus doesn’t show good in-
tentions for student engagement.
Instead, it reveals the true motive
behind this unnecessary tinkering with
the Higher Education Act. Colleges and
universities have not, do not, and must
not ever exist to serve the Federal Gov-
ernment.
The provisions in H.R. 1 take institu-
tions of higher learning and put them
in the same category as your local
DMV. It is bad enough that colleges
and universities barely resemble the
free marketplace of ideas they once
were. This bill turns them into full-
fledged government offices, with all of
the customer service and freedom of
thought for which government offices
are known.
The reasons to oppose H.R. 1 are
many, but we could not allow the pro-
visions that impact educational insti-
tutions to go unnoticed as House
Democrats clearly hoped.
H.R. 1 is one of the most cynical po-
litical stunts we have seen and, for
that reason, Mr. Speaker, we should
oppose it and oppose it with all our
might.
f
CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND
LEGACY OF SUZANNE KLING POST
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kentucky (Mr. YARMUTH) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in memory and in celebration of
the life and legacy of my friend, Su-
zanne Kling Post, a tremendous force
for good in the Commonwealth of Ken-
tucky.
Suzy passed on January 2, after hav-
ing spent her entire life in service to
others, fighting for school desegrega-
tion, civil liberties, fair housing, wom-
en’s rights, equality for all, and more.
There was no challenge too daunting
and no issue too controversial for Suzy
to take on.
As reliable as the sun rising and set-
ting each day, if there was injustice,
prejudice, or discrimination, Suzy was
right there, organizing and empow-
ering. She helped lift the voices of
those wronged, and demanded more
from our city and our Commonwealth
on behalf of those in need.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2510 March 7, 2019
Born into a white, middle-class, Jew-
ish family in the Highlands of Louis-
ville in 1933, Suzy was quick to put oth-
ers first. She joined the NAACP as a
student at Indiana University. She re-
turned home and helped organize sit-
ins and demonstrations of civil disobe-
dience in protest of housing discrimi-
nation; and she helped lead efforts for
civil rights and against the Vietnam
War.
She led the ACLU of Kentucky,
founded by her uncle, Arthur Kling,
and eventually became the founding di-
rector of the Metropolitan Housing
Commission. After decades of service,
she was inducted into the Kentucky
Human Rights Commission Hall of
Fame in 2007.
Though small in stature, she was
larger than life. She had a fire in her
belly and a passion for her work that
was contagious. Her low voice had the
power to move you, and she never
missed an opportunity to use it and
move us forward as a city.
In the Louisville Courier-Journal’s
thoughtful obituary recounting her
life, they noted that, once asked why
she became an activist, Suzy replied: I
guess I just don’t like injustice. It
ticks me off; it really does. Although
she didn’t use the word ‘‘ticks.’’
She was as uncomplicated as she was
powerful; straightforward, straight to
the heart and an invaluable source of
strength for me, our city, and our Com-
monwealth. To say we are better off be-
cause of her decades of service is an un-
derstatement. She expected more, gave
more, and got more from all of us be-
cause she demanded it of her commu-
nity and of herself.
I will always value her friendship,
her leadership, and for never shying
away from a fight.
To her children and grandchildren, I
hope you can take some solace in
knowing that your mother and grand-
mother was the conscience of the city
that loved her dearly, and we will all
work to carry her legacy forward.
May her memory be a blessing.
f
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS
CONGRESS AND LAST CONGRESS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, let me
point out an important difference be-
tween the last Congress and this one.
Last Congress, under Republican
leadership, our number one priority
was tax reform and jobs, putting more
money into the pockets of the Amer-
ican people who have earned it. That is
why our bill, H.R. 1, the Tax Cut and
Jobs Act, was that first priority.
Even back in 1995, the first bill under
Republican leadership was the Congres-
sional Accountability Act, to make
sure Congress and its staff had to abide
by the same rules as the rest of Ameri-
cans.
This Congress, under Democrat lead-
ership, it appears their priorities are
much different. Their H.R. 1, sup-
posedly, their most-prized bill, hence,
they give it the number 1 bill, is not a
generational policy reform to benefit
Americans, but, rather, politics and
rigging elections; that is the Democrat
priority; sweeping Federal mandates
that institute a 6-to-1 government
match for small donor political con-
tributions.
That means 6 to 1 of your tax dollars
going to match contributions made for
campaigns; $200 would yield $1,200 from
the Federal Government into a cam-
paign.
In what world is it defensible for the
Federal Government to be forced to use
your taxpayer funds, you to be forced
for your taxpayer dollars to support a
candidate for office, regardless of
whether you support that candidate.
The bad news is it doesn’t end there.
Democrats want to take some of the
corrupt policies already implemented
in my own State of California and in-
stitute them nationwide.
For example: Ballot harvesting.
Since its implementation in California,
this practice has opened up our State
to endless potential for election fraud.
Just a couple of months ago, this exact
practice sent one North Carolina elec-
tion into chaos, with every Democrat
in the State demanding a re-election.
In the North Carolina one they were
using similar practices.
Ironically, this bill is completely si-
lent on ballot harvesting. In fact,
Democrats blocked an amendment I
worked on that would make ballot har-
vesting illegal in all States, not just
where it is convenient for their elec-
tions.
In Orange County, California, 250,000
provisional ballots were counted after
election night, with people delivering
hundreds of them at a time.
Now, I am a staunch supporter of en-
suring every voter has access to the
polls, but this bill isn’t about that.
This legislation only undermines the
security of our election system and
limits the already-lacking safeguards
that are in place to ensure the integ-
rity of our electoral process.
How are the voters, the people, the
citizens of America supposed to have
confidence in their election system
when they see these games being
played?
To make matters worse, this bill will
actually weaken voter ID laws. It auto-
matically registers everyone in the
DMV database, no questions asked,
alive or dead.
When this issue has come up in Cali-
fornia, we have seen numerous prob-
lems in the DMV process. California
voter rolls have little integrity. We
have tens of thousands of so-called vot-
ers that are registered that may not
even be eligible, may not even be citi-
zens.
b 1030
This has also, in that process, made
the REAL ID process in California
questionable as well, where the people
are going to have to go get their ID
redone in order to be able to use the
airports.
While some of my other colleagues on
the other side of the aisle like to peg
voter ID laws as prohibitive, the Na-
tional Bureau of Economic Research
published a study proving that is not
the case.
We all support easy and fair voter
registration, but it has to come with
sensible voter protections and fraud
prevention safeguards. As we saw in
California this past election cycle,
thousands of ballots continued to be
harvested even after election day. That
is a huge problem.
If this bill needed another nail in the
coffin, even the ACLU has condemned
the legislation as unconstitutional.
That is because it hurts free speech and
attempts to silence those who would
dare disagree with, in this case, Demo-
crat priorities.
Just a few years ago, a California
theater director was forced to resign
over harassment due to a political do-
nation, just for advocating for his own
beliefs.
Democrats boldly dubbed this legisla-
tion the For the People Act, but a
more appropriate title would be ‘‘Dem-
ocrat Politicians Protection Act.’’
Once again, H.R. 1 under Republican
leadership was the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act and, years ago, an accountability
act. H.R. 1 under Democrat leadership
is an unconstitutional bill to force
Americans to help reelect more Demo-
crats. That should paint a substan-
tially contrasting picture for the
American people what the priorities
are of the two parties.
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this

HONORING CONSTITUENT OF THE
MONTH SHELBY JACOBS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. LEVIN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, as the Congress Member for Califor-
nia’s 49th District, it is my distinct
honor to represent over 700,000 Califor-
nians from North County San Diego
and south Orange County.
I have met countless constituents
across the district who do incredible
work to make our community strong-
er, and I am proud to serve them in
Congress.
With so many outstanding constitu-
ents, I thought it would be appropriate
to start a new Constituent of the
Month program to recognize individ-
uals who have gone above and beyond
to help their neighbors, give back to
their community, and make our coun-
try stronger.
For our first constituent of the
month, I am thrilled to recognize Mr.
Shelby Jacobs of Oceanside, a retired
aerospace engineer who worked for 40
years on NASA’s Apollo and Space
Shuttle programs.
Mr. Jacobs served in a number of
roles, including project manager of the

Apollo-Soyuz orbiter and designed a
breakthrough camera used to capture
iconic images of a rocket separation on
Apollo 6 in 1968.
As an African American in an indus-
try with few people of color at the
time, Mr. Jacobs faced significant dif-
ficulties, including unequal pay and,
often, unfair treatment.
Now Mr. Jacobs serves as the role
model he never had for himself, show-
ing young people of color what they
can achieve in the face of racism, dis-
crimination, and inequality of oppor-
tunity, and calling for action to ad-
dress injustices that still exist today.
He told the San Diego Union Tribune:
‘‘It’s important to be a pioneer, but I
want people to understand that while
we appreciate the progress, things need
to be done to address the inequality.
That’s something that was there when
I started and it’s still happening today
right up to the very top level of our
government.’’
Mr. Jacobs’ story has helped high-
light other ‘‘Hidden Figures’’ who have
gone without recognition, particularly
people of color and women, for their ex-
traordinary contributions to our coun-
try.
I have no doubt that Mr. Jacobs’ ef-
forts to touch the lives of young people
and address inequality has had a pro-
found impact on our community and
will continue to do so.
Shelby Jacobs is an inspiration to me
and so many others, and I am proud to
call him our first Constituent of the
Month.

WORKING FOR THOSE WITHOUT A
LOBBYIST OR PAC
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. TRONE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to urge my colleagues to support
H.R. 1, the For the People Act.
I ran for Congress to be a voice for
those without a powerful PAC or a spe-
cial interest group to represent them.
The wealthy and connected, they will
be fine.
For the people is who we are here to
fight for: for the people who are suf-
fering from the addiction epidemic, for
the people who are living with diseases
with no cure, and for the people who
are targeted by a broken criminal jus-
tice system that is anything but just.
These people don’t have a PAC. These
people, they don’t have a lobbyist.
We won’t be able to help those people
until we end the corruption and fix our
democracy. That is why I am sup-
porting the For the People Act.
Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to
send this bill to the President’s desk so
we can get to work on behalf of those
without a lobbyist, without a PAC.
f
2018: A BAD YEAR FOR CHILDREN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, when
Speaker PELOSI took the gavel on Jan-
uary 3, she was surrounded by children,
and as she brought down the gavel to
commence the 116th Congress, these
were her words: ‘‘I now call the House
to order on behalf of all of America’s
children.’’
The importance of Speaker PELOSI’s
words cannot be overstated. Last year
was horrendous for children in our
country.
If we look at gun violence or immi-
gration or healthcare or poverty relief,
children suffered last year under the
Trump administration and a Repub-
lican Congress.
On February 14, 2018, a gunman
walked into Marjory Stoneman Doug-
las High School in Parkland, Florida,
to commit mass murder; 17 people were
killed, another 17 were injured, and
most of them were children.
The Parkland shooting wasn’t the
first school shooting in our Nation’s
history, and it wasn’t the last. But the
Parkland students, standing on the
shoulders of student leaders before
them, stood up and marched. They
bound together in an intersectional,
nationwide movement to demand that
Congress and the President do some-
thing to make our country safer.
Unfortunately, their pleas fell on
deaf ears. The President and his admin-
istration were too inept or too cow-
ardly to confront the NRA. And be-
cause my colleagues across the aisle
were too inept or too cowardly to con-
front the NRA, we witnessed prevent-
able shooting after preventable shoot-
ing.
Then, when the Trump administra-
tion finally did release its School Safe-
ty Comission report, it completely ig-
nored evidence-based violence and pre-
vention strategies. Instead, the report
suggested rolling back civil rights pro-
tections for students and making guns
more easily accessible in schools.
Look, there is a commonality among
the mass shootings in America’s
schools: easy access to firearms. But
rather than address the root cause of
school shootings, the Trump adminis-
tration suggested that we put guns in
classrooms, as if teachers are security
guards and schools are prisons. Nobody
thinks that is a good idea except for
the NRA.
Meanwhile, educators across the
country are clamoring for funding to
install new locks on classroom doors,
harden school entryways, and secure
school facilities.
The 116th Congress was called into
order on behalf of all children because
Democrats will listen to teachers and
students—not the NRA. That is why we
passed two bills in February to insti-
tute universal background checks and
close the Charleston loophole. That is
why I introduced the Safer Neighbor-
hoods Gun Buyback Act: to save chil-
dren’s lives.
We were called into order on behalf of
all children, including those who are at
our borders.
Under the Trump administration and
Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, both of
whom were empowered by my col-
leagues across the aisle, the United
States of America ripped children away
from their parents and put them in
cages.
Ripping children away from their
parents and lying about it to the Amer-
ican people was evil, plain and simple,
and it should have ended Secretary
Nielsen’s career. I feel Secretary
Nielsen is incompetent, inept, and is
not up to the task of securing the
homeland’s safety. Anyone who would
put children in cages, fenced cages,
taken from their parents can just not
be trusted.
President Trump’s deplorable, inhu-
man attempt to change our immigra-
tion system has killed people.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
DEMOCRATS ARE LIVING UP TO
OUR COMMITMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New Mexico (Mr. LUJÁN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud
to stand before you today in strong
support of H.R. 1.
Mr. Speaker, I want to start by
thanking Congressman SARBANES,
Speaker PELOSI, Chairwoman ZOE LOF-
GREN, and my colleagues for their work
on this issue.
H.R. 1 is historic legislation. It will
restore transparency in our govern-
ment and put the power back in the
hands of the people.
It will reduce the role of dark money
in politics and make it easier to vote.
Perhaps most importantly, it will re-
affirm that this is the people’s House
and our work here is for them. There
could be nothing more fundamentally
important than that.
Too many have lost faith in the proc-
ess; too many have lost faith in their
government. They look around and
wonder who is on their side, who is
fighting for them. They see rules
rigged against them, and every day it
gets harder and harder for their neigh-
bor to buy insulin or for their daughter
to shake off the incredible burdens of
student loan debt.
This legislation, H.R. 1, is an impor-
tant step in how we stand up for our
communities and for the people. It is a
tool that allows us to act on the many
issues impacting working men and
women, the family that I was raised in.
It will also give Americans a greater
voice in their government. This legisla-
tion will allow automatic voter reg-
istration and create a national holiday
for election day.
I am also proud to submit an amend-
ment to H.R. 1 that will expand elec-
tion infrastructure grants to promote
voter participation, secure our elec-
tions, and increase funding for these ef-
forts to engage all parts of our society
in our democracy.

Looking ahead to next week, I am
looking forward to reintroducing with

Voting Rights Act. This legislation
will make sure that communities are

f
ANTI-SEMITISM IS THE CANARY IN
THE COAL MINE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. DEUTCH) for 5 minutes.
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, today
should not be about politics. I didn’t
rise to be political. This is personal.
A few years ago, I was invited to
speak at the U.N. General Assembly
special session on anti-Semitism. I told
the representatives from the assembled
countries that anti-Semitism is the ca-
nary in the coal mine, that if there is
anti-Semitism in your country, there
is hatred that will ultimately permeate
throughout society if it is not checked.
I never thought I would need to explain
that to my colleagues.
This is not political. No one should
make it political.
b 1045
The use of anti-Semitic language and
images can never be tolerated. When a
Presidential campaign runs a commer-
cial alleging a Jewish global con-
spiracy in an ad featuring George
Soros, Janet Yellen, and Lloyd
Blankfein, it is invoking classic anti-
Semitic tropes and it must be con-
demned. When the same campaign
tweets an image of their opponent fea-
turing a Jewish star and piles of
money, it does the same thing and it
must be condemned. When one of our
colleagues accuses Soros, Steyer, and
Bloomberg of buying the election, it
also invokes classic anti-Semitism
that must be condemned. And when
one of our colleagues invokes the clas-
sic anti-Semitic tropes that Jews con-
trol the world, that Jews care only
about money, and that Jews cannot be
loyal Americans if they also support
Israel, this, too, must be condemned.
We have the opportunity to condemn
all of that, by all of them, intolerable
as it all is, by passing a strong con-
demnation of anti-Semitism. Mr.
Speaker, because of anti-Semitism
over millennia, millions of Jews have
been hated, targeted, and expelled from
their countries, violently attacked,
killed, and exterminated. Words lead to
action and to death.
There is too much hatred, too many
other people who are targeted, and we
need to support all of them. But we are
having this debate because of the lan-
guage of one of our colleagues, lan-
guage that suggests that Jews like me,
who serve in the United States in Con-
gress and whose father earned a Purple
Heart fighting the Nazis in the Battle
of the Bulge, that we are not loyal
Americans.
Why are we unable to singularly con-
demn anti-Semitism? Why can’t we
call out anti-Semitism and show that
we have learned the lessons of history?
It feels like we are only able to call
the use of anti-Semitic language by a
colleague of ours—any colleague of
ours—if we are addressing all forms of
hatred. And it feels like we can’t say it
is anti-Semitism unless everyone
agrees that it is anti-Semitism.
Who gets to define what counts as
stereotypes or discrimination? Isn’t it
the people who experience the bias?
The people who have experienced that
hatred for thousands of years?
If Jews whose families were per-
secuted or attacked or killed are talk-
ing about how anti-Semitic words can
lead at their most hateful and violent
extremes, then it is anti-Semitism.
And take my word for it. If you don’t
do that, then please understand that an
anti-Semite will hear those words as a
dog whistle.
What has been so difficult for so
many people in my community is that
people who are fearful when anti-Se-
mitic tropes are used are being told
that they are wrong. Jewish elected of-
ficials are saying that this history that
we know well is invoked by referencing
dual loyalty, and some of my col-
leagues are saying that it doesn’t mat-
ter what that history means to me. It
is intensely personal because it is on-
going: in Europe, in Asia, in the Middle
East, in South America, and in the
United States.
Eleven people were killed less than 6
months ago in a synagogue because
they were Jews. What is happening in
our country should alarm us all. The
attacks on our colleagues because they
are Muslim or African American or
Hispanic or members of the LGBT com-
munity, any attack must be con-
demned when it is based on hatred.
But when a colleague invokes classic
anti-Semitic lies three times, then this
body must condemn that anti-Semi-
tism. Anti-Semitism is worthy of being
taken seriously on its own. It is worthy
of being singularly called out.
Jews control the world? Jews care
only about money? Jews have dual loy-
alty and can’t be patriotic members of
the country in which they live?
Words matter. For generations, they
have had dangerous consequences for
me, for my family, and for my people.
This shouldn’t be so hard.

COMMENDING ARKANSAS STATE
UNIVERSITY FOR HOSTING 25TH
ANNUAL COLLEGE OF AGRI-
CULTURE AGRIBUSINESS CON-
FERENCE
(Mr. CRAWFORD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to commend my alma mater,
Arkansas State University, for hosting
the 25th Annual College of Agriculture
Agribusiness Conference. This con-
ference focuses on farm management,
commodity and credit markets, and
the economics and politics of trade and
farm policy.
During this conference, Chancellor
Damphousse announced a $1 million
gift for the College of Agriculture from
the Judd Hill Foundation.
Farmers and those involved in the
agriculture industry throughout Ar-
kansas attend this meeting each year
to learn about important deadlines and
challenges that producers will encoun-
ter this growing season from a diverse
group of speakers. This year, speakers
included Tyne Morgan, host of U.S.
Farm Report, as well as two of my past
interns, Hunter Biram and Grant Wil-
son.
Instrumental to this conference’s
continued success has been Dr.
Greenwalt, conference director and co-
founder. Dr. Greenwalt, professor of ag-
ricultural economics at Arkansas
State, also serves as a director of the
Arkansas Agricultural Council. I had
the pleasure of being one of Dr.
Greenwalt’s students while pursuing
my degree in agricultural business at
Arkansas State University.
Many others come to support this an-
nual event. As the event grows, so does
the attendance.
I would like to extend my congratu-
lations and gratitude to Dr. Greenwalt,
Dean Burcham, and everyone who con-
tributed to the success of the ASU Ag-
ribusiness Conference for the last 25
years.
RECOGNIZING RUTH WEAKLEY ON
HER 100TH BIRTHDAY
(Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given

Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker,
this Women’s History Month, I rise to
recognize Ruth Weakley of Arroyo
Grande on her 100th birthday today.
During World War II, with many of
America’s young men serving overseas,
U.S. jobs traditionally held by men
began to open their doors to women.
While Ruth’s husband, Harry, was
away serving in the Army Air Force,
Ruth stepped up to serve, and became
one of a handful of women driving rural
postal routes. She drove a route in Los
Angeles County for nearly 2 years dur-
ing the war, resigning when her hus-
band returned from his military service
in December 1945.
Contributions like hers were both
critical to our Nation’s war effort and
to reshaping the role of women in our
workforce and society.
Today, over 70 years after Ruth’s
time with the Postal Service and on
her 100th birthday, I recognize and
thank her for her service to our Nation
and to women everywhere.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHIEF
ROBERT RICHARDSON
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-

Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the memory of former
Panama City Fire Chief and United
States Navy veteran Robert Richard-
son. Chief Richardson passed away at
the age of 79 on January 5.
Chief Richardson proudly served our
Nation as a submariner in the Navy,
and he went on to serve his community
in Bay County for 33 years—first as a
firefighter and then as the Panama
City Fire Chief.
He was honored by the State of Flor-
ida for his work, earning the distinc-
tion of Florida’s Firefighter of the
Year and Florida’s Fire Chief of the
Year.
Chief Richardson was appointed by
Governor Bob Graham to serve on the
Florida State Fire Board and used that
position to fight for stricter building
codes. He dedicated his entire life to
protecting others.
Madam Speaker, I can attest that
Panama City is a better place because
of the lifelong service of Chief Richard-
son. Please join me in honoring the life
of Chief Richardson.

COMMEMORATING THE SOCIETY
FOR NEUROSCIENCE DURING
BRAIN AWARENESS WEEK
(Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was
given permission to address the House

Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker,
the Society for Neuroscience, SFN, is
the world’s largest organization of sci-
entists and clinicians focused on study-
ing the brain and the nervous system.
This week, we welcomed them to Cap-
itol Hill to give us an update on their
progress and their impact.
Federal funding from agencies like
the National Institutes of Health and
the National Science Foundation is ab-
solutely critical to their work. Sus-
tained, reliable funding is critical to
continuing advancements in neuro-
science and to scientific advancement
in general.
This week is Brain Awareness Week,
and I want to commend the BRAIN Ini-
tiative partners. The 2018 total for the
BRAIN Initiative program at NIH is
more than $400 million.
I have long supported research in-
vestments in neuroscience research. It
is opening up a vast understanding of
our brains, and it is vitally important
to the over 100 million Americans im-
pacted by neurodevelopmental,
neurodegenerative, and
neuropsychiatric brain disorders.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
supporting robust funding for the Na-
tional Institutes of Health so that the
BRAIN Initiative can continue its out-
standing achievements.

ENDING SAUDI INCITEMENT IN
SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, Saudi Arabia has a
vital role in the global war on ter-
rorism. Riyadh is a crucial counterter-
rorism partner. But, sadly, textbooks
of Saudi Arabia have been teaching its
students to hate others for too long.
One current textbook is inflam-
matory against Christianity, Judaism,
and even other Muslims who do not
subscribe to the Saudi interpretation
of Islam, which they describe as ‘‘evil.’’
Saudi Arabia has committed to re-
forming curriculum for over a decade.
That is why Congressman BILL
KEATING and I have introduced H.R.
554, the Saudi Educational and Trans-
parency and Reform Act. It will hold
the Saudis accountable by requiring an
annual report on any intolerant con-
tent of their textbooks. It will also
send a clear, bipartisan message to end
the incitement now.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

the For the People Act. This bill takes
on one of the biggest issues facing our
democracy: campaign finance reform.
The Supreme Court’s decision, in
Citizens United, was one of the most
disastrous decisions of our time. It
opened the floodgates to the unlimited
amount of unregulated dark money
that is now corrupting our democracy.
And Congress not only has the au-
thority to regulate the way our polit-
ical campaigns are financed, but, I be-
lieve, we have the moral responsibility
to step up.
This bill would shed light on the bil-
lionaires and special interest groups
who are really behind some of the can-
didates running for office, and it would
level the playing field by giving the
power back to the traditional grass
roots donors.
This, without a doubt, is one of the
most important issues that we as a
Congress will take on this year, and
that is why I urge all of my colleagues
to get in this fight to get unlimited
dark money out of the political system
once and for all.

FOR THE POLITICIANS ACT
(Mr. GREEN of Tennessee asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1,
ironically titled the For the People
Act. A more accurate name would be
the ‘‘For the Politicians Act.’’
This bill would, essentially, ban the
interstate crosscheck system which 27
States, including Tennessee, use to pre-
vent voter fraud by ensuring voters are
not registered in multiple States.
Is that for the people or for the poli-
ticians?
Another provision would mandate
that States use unaccountable,
unelected commissions to draw their
districts, further isolating Americans
from their elected officials.
Is that for the people or for the poli-
ticians?
Still, another section would create a
6-to-1 taxpayer-funded match for polit-
ical donations, giving politicians a
massive boost for their campaign cof-
fers from taxpayer dollars.
Is that for the people or for the poli-
ticians?
H.R. 1 is not for the people; it is for
the politicians. I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘no.’’

RECOGNIZING MARCH AS
NATIONAL NUTRITION MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize March as National Nutrition
Month.
In 1973, the American Dietetic Asso-
ciation, now called the Academy of Nu-
trition and Dietetics, started National
Nutrition Week as a way to deliver nu-
trition education messages to the pub-
lic.
Fast-forward 7 years, and the week
became a month-long celebration
thanks to the growing public interest
in nutrition.
Madam Speaker, during the last Con-
gress, I had the honor of being chair-
man of the Agriculture Subcommittee
on Nutrition. From women and chil-
dren who use the WIC program to
adults and families who utilize the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program, or what we refer to as SNAP,
formerly called food stamps, I know
that good nutrition is important at
every stage of life.
National Nutrition Month focuses on
the importance of making informed
food choices and developing sound eat-
ing and physical activity habits.
Next Wednesday is Registered Dieti-
tian Nutritionist Day, and this occa-
sion increases awareness of registered
dietitian nutritionists as the indispen-
sable providers of food and nutrition
services, while recognizing their com-
mitment to helping people enjoy
healthy lives.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND
SERVICE OF JAMES PATTERSON
(Mr. DESJARLAIS asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize an outstanding
patriot and advocate for Tennessee vet-
erans, James Patterson of Columbia,
Tennessee, who recently passed away.
James was a Vietnam veteran who
earned medals for his service. He had a
35-year career at Union Carbide, but
locals know him best for his many vol-
unteer affiliations in life. He was the
true embodiment of what makes Amer-
ica great.
James was an American Legion com-
mander and Legionnaire of the Year,
also a member of the Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans and Veterans of Foreign
Wars.
He was Maury County’s veterans
services director, and every week, as
sergeant at arms, he led the Pledge of
Allegiance at Columbia’s Rotary Club.
James loved his country and loved,
most of all, the men and women who
fight for it. My staff and I have worked
with him often to help Tennessee vet-
erans receive the benefits and honors
they deserve.
We were saddened to learn of his
passing. The entire community lost a
friend.
My condolences to the Patterson
family. Here in the Capitol and in my
home State of Tennessee, I will do my
best to carry on James’ work on behalf
of the brave men and women who risk
their lives to defend the United States
of America. He set an example for all of
us.
Thank you for your service, James.

HONORING JOAN ESPENSHADE
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker,
March is Women’s History Month, and
I am proud to honor some remarkable
women in my district.
Today, I would like to recognize Ms.
Joan Espenshade, a woman from Lan-
caster, Pennsylvania, who gave back to
our community by creating an extraor-
dinary program to feed those in need.
In 2005, Joan learned that some local
children were food insecure on week-
ends when the school’s free lunch pro-
gram was not available to them, so she
decided to step in and help parents
make better use of their limited food
dollars.
She founded the Power Packs Project
to provide food and nutritional infor-
mation to low-income families. Not
only did she help those families, but
Power Packs now extends to 45 schools
in 13 districts with 350 volunteers.
Joan stepped down as president of
Power Packs after 9 years in 2014, but
her vision and impact can still be seen
as the program continues today.
We are thankful for people like Joan
who remind us of the importance of
caring for those in need. It is an honor
to recognize her today.

HONORING SHERIFF MIKE BROWN
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the career of retiring
Bedford County, Virginia, Sheriff Mike
Brown. The county’s top law enforce-
ment officer since 1996, Sheriff Brown
has devoted nearly 50 years to pro-
tecting the citizens of his home county
and the Commonwealth of Virginia.
In his time as sheriff, Mike has led
efforts to modernize the department
and expand cooperation with sur-
rounding departments. These efforts
led to the 1998 creation of the Southern
Virginia Internet Crimes Against Chil-
dren Task Force, an organization
whose purpose is locating and pros-
ecuting individuals who prey on our
children.
In the most recent reporting year,
the task force arrested 227 individuals
accused of crimes against children and
identified 127 child victims. Over 20
years, an untold number of children
have been protected and hundreds of
predators have been put behind bars be-
cause of Sheriff Brown’s efforts to es-
tablish the task force.
In 2017, Sheriff Brown was appro-
priately named National Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation Sheriff of the Year.
Madam Speaker, I thank Sheriff
Brown for his service to the citizens of

HONORING BOB HUDZIK
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize Bob Hudzik, a constituent in my
district who has made a profound dif-
ference in his community.
Bob, a world champion dart player
and custodian at Mt. Olive High
School, began Darts for Kids, a non-
profit organization that hosts an an-
nual dart tournament. The proceeds go
to families of children with life-threat-
ening illnesses, usually to contribute
to the cost of unforeseen medical ex-
penses.
Their first tournament in 2013 raised
about $10,000. To date, Darts for Kids
has raised almost $175,000 and helped
over 90 families with medical costs for
children.
I recently cosponsored legislation
that shines a light on individuals like
Bob. H.R. 276, the RISE Act, would es-
tablish the Recognizing Inspirational
School Employees Award Program
within the Department of Education to
highlight the dedication of education
support professionals like Bob.
Bob is a perfect example of the peo-
ple who make our communities great. I
could not be prouder of all that Bob
has done to better the lives of families
in Mt. Olive, Illinois.
Keep up the great work, Bob.
f
BETTER REFORM FOR THE
PEOPLE
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I am
here today to speak out against H.R. 1.
When Republicans were in the major-
ity, we reserved H.R. 1 for legislation
that actually benefited the American
people by putting more money in their
pockets and growing the economy
through the historic tax reform bill
passed last year. Now here we are,
under a new majority, planning to vote
on a bill telling folks that their hard-
earned taxpayer dollars will be going
to a political candidate that they
would never support.
This bill goes too far and is nothing
more than a power grab from the
Democrats to try to ensure one-party
rule. This socialist, top-down, one-size-
fits-all election system violates States’
rights, fails to criminalize fraudulent
voter registration, and eliminates
every American’s constitutional right
to free speech under the First Amend-
ment.
We do not need the heavy, over-
reaching hand of the Federal Govern-
ment corrupting every single election
across this great Nation.
Madam Speaker, I have said it before
and I will say it again: This legislation
is not reform for the better, and it is
not for the people.
f
STATE AND LOCAL TAX
DEDUCTION
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker,
forcing Americans to pay Federal tax
money they have already paid to State
and local governments is double tax-
ation, and it is wrong. But that is just
what the tax law passed by my Repub-
lican colleagues in 2017 did.
The law places a severe $10,000 re-
striction on the State and local tax de-
duction. According to the United
States Department of the Treasury,
more than 11 million households will
exceed this new cap. In my district,
around 42 percent of filers use the
SALT deduction, and I have heard from
many constituents stuck this year
with a higher tax bill.
Madam Speaker, Illinois already
pays approximately $1.36 for every dol-
lar we receive in Federal spending. It is
not right that our communities now
must bear the burden for the Presi-
dent’s irresponsible tax law.
Lifting these punishing caps is a top
priority for my constituents, and I am
pleased that there is growing bipar-
tisan support for the effort. This week,
I cosponsored legislation introduced by
Chairwoman NITA LOWEY, a Democrat,
and PETER KING, a Republican, to re-
store the full SALT deduction.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join us in this effort and
help bring needed tax relief to the com-
munities we all represent.
f
TERM LIMITS FOR CONGRESS
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker,
my esteemed colleague, Representative
ROONEY, has introduced a bill, H.J. Res.
20, to limit the number of terms that a
Member of Congress may serve to three
terms. I signed on to cosponsor this bill
right away.
Term limits would take power away
from special interests and lobbyists
and give it back to the people. When
Members stay in Congress for too long,
they lose touch with the people back
home and allow special interests to
hold sway more than regular people.
A Congress out of touch with its con-
stituents cannot do a good job rep-
resenting the American people. This
bill would make sure our constituents
will have a representative body that
they recognize.
The power of incumbency is a coun-
terbalance to the will of the people.
Term limits would encourage inde-
pendent congressional judgment and
reduce election-related incentives for
wasteful government spending.
This bill would create a much better
political system by inspiring political
leaders with a desire to serve their con-
stituents, not themselves; political
leaders who respond to voters’ con-
cerns, not a career path in special in-
terests.
Madam Speaker, I call on my fellow
Members to support this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2518 March 7, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
This package of 17 important amend-
ments was made in order by the rule.
The substance of these amendments
ranges from commonsense informa-
tion-gathering to protecting our Na-
tion from foreign influence.
For instance, one amendment ex-
pands an existing ban to protect
against a greater universe of threats. It
provides that the Federal Election
Campaign Act, which already bans for-
eign nationals from contributing to
American elections, ought also to ban
them from contributing to State or
local ballot initiatives or referenda,
where their undue influence might
allow outside control of State and local
matters.
Our colleagues have also joined with
us in efforts to understand and appre-
ciate the different experiences of
American voters and to ensure that
voters of all kinds are included at the
ballot box by supporting information-
sharing between States and the Elec-
tion Assistance Commission.
One amendment focuses on greater
reporting of demographic information,
shining a light on who is voting so that
we can better grasp who is partici-
pating or perhaps feels left out of our
diverse electorate.
In States where information about
age, gender, race, and ethnicity is al-
ready available to the State, this
amendment will simply require States
to include that demographic informa-
tion about voters in their annual re-
port to the Election Assistance Com-
mission on voter registration statis-
tics.
Our colleagues also support efforts by
the Government Accountability Office
to study the extent to which member-
ship diversity requirements have been
met in State redistricting commis-
sions, ensuring that justice and fair-
ness in representing the people is the
priority, not partisan advantage to ei-
ther party.
In a similar vein of being welcome to
diverse voters, an amendment requires
that the poll worker training manual
provided by the Election Assistance
Commission ensures that services are
delivered in a culturally competent
manner to voters who need these serv-
ices, including voters with disabilities,
those with limited English proficiency,
and voters of diverse cultural and eth-
nic backgrounds, all regardless of the
gender, sexual orientation, or gender
identity of the prospective voter.
This amendment seeks to give each
voter full and equal access to the poll
worker services that are critical to in-
clusive and efficient election adminis-
tration and engagement with our sa-
cred duties in this election.
This amendment also contains sev-
eral component parts that focus on
transparency and accessibility of infor-
mation to everyday citizens so they
can feel confident about the integrity,
prudence, and independence of this gov-
ernment.
One amendment would stop campaign
contributions providing an endless
piggybank to candidates long after
they have left office, or their cam-
paign.
Another amendment gives citizens an
important and accessible window into
lobbying information. It would require
the Attorney General to establish
within the Department of Justice a sin-
gle lobbying information disclosure
portal through which members of the
public could obtain hard copies and
electronic copies of registration state-
ments filed under the Lobbying Disclo-
sure Act of 1995 and the Foreign Agents
Registration Act of 1938. The effect of
this amendment would be to combine
and make easily accessible information
that is currently available from dis-
parate sources, including the House,
the Senate, and the Department of Jus-
tice. Efforts like these increase infor-
mation flow, transparency, and con-
fidence in our government.
Madam Chair, I think these amend-
ments are worthy of our support.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I yield myself such time
as I may consume.
I thank my friend and chairperson of
our committee, Ms. LOFGREN. It is
great to be able to work together and
show some bipartisanship.
As many who may have been paying
attention yesterday to our long debate
on this bill know, that has been one of
my chief complaints about H.R. 1. We
haven’t seen the bipartisanship that
the new majority, the new Democratic
majority, promised.
b 1230
Every one of these amendments were
offered by members of the Democratic
conference. While our amendments in
the only markup process that we had
for this 622-page bill were all shot down
on a partisan roll call, I want the
RECORD to show that Republicans be-
lieve in bipartisanship and this en bloc
group of amendments clearly shows
that.
While individually I may not have
supported every one of them, this is
what bipartisanship and good principle
compromise leads to. It leads to us
spending a lot less time on the floor de-
bating individual amendments, but
also saving time for the amendments
that are that much more important.
And I certainly hope that, unlike I
have seen throughout the process al-
ready, this en bloc of bipartisan
amendments, this en bloc of really
Democratic amendments that have
been accepted on a bipartisan basis,
could be the linchpin. As we move for-
ward today, I certainly hope that my
friends on the other side of the aisle
can accept some Republican amend-
ments because we have yet to accept
one. So I hope this is a goodwill ges-
ture that will lead to more bipartisan-
ship as the day goes on.
Again, while I and many members of
our conference may not have supported
these amendments individually, we felt
it was a good faith effort to be able to
work together. And, again, I want to
thank my colleagues on the other side
of the aisle, especially with the House
Administration Committee, a com-
mittee that has done its due diligence
in putting a massive, mammoth bill
forward to the floor today. I still have
problems with the process, I still have
problems with the overall bill, but this
en bloc amendment should not be one
of those.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, a few
of the Members who have offered
amendments would like to speak brief-
ly on them.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from California (Mr. HARD-
ER).
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam
Chair, I thank Chair LOFGREN for her
leadership on this issue.
Madam Chair, I rise today to urge my
colleagues to support my amendment
to limit the influence of lobbyists on
elected officials.
Here is a stat that blows me away.
D.C. is home to 11,000 registered lobby-
ists. That is 25 lobbyists per Member of
Congress.
During one of my first nights in D.C.,
I got invited to dinner with some of my
freshman colleagues. I thought it was
going to be a chance to talk about the
issues that I hear from families in my
community: the cost of healthcare,
education, maybe jobs. But imagine my
surprise when the only thing these lob-
byists wanted to talk about was what
would benefit their clients.
This happens in the city every day.
Thousands of lobbyists here, in one
city, creating an ecosystem of easy ac-
cess where they can push their client’s
agenda in front of elected representa-
tives.
My amendment is simple. It says
that if you are a lobbyist and you
reach out to a Member of Congress, you
must make clear that you are a lob-
byist, you must make clear who your
clients are, and you better tell us who
pays you. This is common sense.
Back home, I hear a common frustra-
tion that Washington doesn’t listen.
This problem is real and it has got to
stop. My community has had enough
with back-room deals. This amendment
is one step in the right direction, and I
urge this body to vote in favor.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Chair, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. O’HALLERAN), who has sev-
eral amendments.
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Chair, as
I travel throughout my district, I hear
Arizona’s concerns about the integrity
of our elections, our elected leaders,
and those who serve them in the high-
est positions of our government.
At a time when millions of Ameri-
cans feel uncertain about the state of
our democracy, Congress must act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2519
March 7, 2019
I am proud to support H.R. 1, which
will strengthen our democracy and
close ethics loopholes.
I want to thank the chairwoman and
the ranking member for agreeing to
adopt my three amendments to the un-
derlying bill. These amendments,
which include my Taxpayers DIME Act
and my Protecting Defense Dollars
Act, will do right by our taxpayers by
increasing transparency and account-
ability when it comes to travel, includ-
ing on government and military air-
craft.
These amendments will crack down
on bureaucrats abusing ethics rules in
place of lavish travel on private jets,
first-class flights, and more. Several of
these amendments have previously re-
ceived bipartisan support.
Regardless of party, those who serve
the American public must be held to
the highest ethical standards. Our abil-
ity to hold government officials ac-
countable to taxpayers is a hallmark of
our democracy, and we must work to
uphold that right.
Again, I thank my colleagues for in-
cluding my commonsense amendments
in this package.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Chair, I continue to reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. SCHNEIDER), who has an
amendment here.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Chair, I
want to thank my colleague for yield-
ing.
Madam Chair, the American people
elected a new Congress to clean up cor-
ruption and make Washington work for
them.
To that end, this week we will pass
H.R. 1 to elevate the people’s voice in
our politics, restrict the influence of
dark money in our campaigns, expand
voting rights protections, and limit
corporate influence.
At the foundation of this effort is a
commitment to increasing trans-
parency, so the American people know
who is behind the money funding the
political ads they see and how much
these individuals are spending.
Currently, too many political action
committees, including so-called super-
PACs, have an easy way around the im-
portant disclosure requirements. By of-
ficially organizing a PAC or super-PAC
just before an election, these commit-
tees can spend on ads to influence an
election, without disclosing anything
until after the voting has already oc-
curred.
In another scheme, PACs borrow
money to pay for advertising and oper-
ations and incur debts that are not
paid off by donors until long after the
election.
Both of these practices are extremely
troubling and obfuscate who is donat-
ing to PACs. Voters are left in the dark
until it is too late.
This amendment is a simple first step
to address these abuses by requiring
the Federal Election Commission to re-
port recommendations to Congress for
how we can crack down on these prac-
tices by PACs.
I call on my colleagues to join us to
increase transparency and support this
amendment.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

AMENDMENT NO. 23 OFFERED BY MR. HICE OF
GEORGIA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 23 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 565, strike line 12 and all that follows
through ‘‘court.’ ’’’ on line 20.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. HICE) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Georgia.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Chair,
the Office of Government Ethics is a
prevention and education agency. OGE
is responsible for ensuring compliance
with ethics requirements, such as fi-
nancial disclosure and conflict of inter-
est rules.
These are the folks that the execu-
tive branch employees call when they
have an ethics question. Their mission
is to advise Federal employees on eth-
ics matters.
OGE is not an investigative office,
but that is exactly what H.R. 1 wants
to turn OGE into, by granting the di-
rector the authority to subpoena infor-
mation and records.
Here is the thing. OGE does not even
need to have subpoena authority. It al-
ready has the power to request any in-
formation needed from Federal agen-
cies, and the Federal agencies are re-
quired to comply under the Ethics in
Government Act.
The only reason to give subpoena au-
thority is to empower OGE to harass
executive branch employees. This is
not farfetched, Madam Chair.
The former director of OGE, Shaub,
was openly hostile to the Trump ad-
ministration and to Mr. Trump person-
ally, even before he took office. Under
Shaub, OGE went so far as using its of-
ficial Twitter account in an attempt to
coerce President-Elect Trump to divest
his business interests. That is not what
OGE’s role is supposed to be.
We don’t want to allow an office that
has become so partisan to have sub-
poena authority and thereby open the
door to overt harassment to executive
branch employees.
I would just remind my Democrat
friends that if this bill does become
law—and it won’t—but if it does, a fu-
ture Democratic administration will
eventually also have to deal with the
same type of issues with the Office of
Government Ethics.
Let me further remind everyone that
the inspector general of the agency al-
ready has authority to subpoena infor-
mation and documents, so we don’t
need to expand this and extend it to
the director.
At the end of the day, this bill has
much bigger problems than this small
OGE subpoena authority provision. It
is a bad bill. I will not be supporting it,
obviously, but I know that many of my
friends on the other side of the aisle
will be supporting this bill.
Frankly, there is no amendment that
is made in order by the Rules Com-
mittee that can fix this legislation.
Some amendments, I believe, including
this one, can at least make it margin-
ally better, but it is a bad bill through
and through.
I believe the American people, frank-
ly, are going to be outraged when they
find out what is in this piece of legisla-
tion, such as public financing for con-
gressional candidates. The American
people don’t want that. They don’t
want tax dollars, particularly, six
times going to Federal candidates.
And then there is the automatic
voter registration requirement. I think
the American people will be irate when
they find out about this. This par-
ticular provision forces States to
transfer individuals’ personal informa-
tion from government agencies and
services and then transfer those over to
election officials for voter registration.
Obviously, that is a violation of the
10th Amendment, but it is even worse
than that. The Democratic authors of
this legislation will not tell the Amer-
ican people that this provision will
lead to huge numbers of illegal aliens
and noncitizens being registered to
vote.
And here is the problem. Illegal
aliens and noncitizens use government
agencies and services. Their informa-
tion, according to H.R. 1, would then be
sent to election officials, along with
everyone else’s, and they will be reg-
istered to vote.
The only safeguard that H.R. 1 has to
prevent an illegal alien from being
automatically registered to vote is if
the alien proactively declines, which is
not likely to happen because they don’t
want to draw attention to themselves
to begin with because they are here il-
legally. So for us to expect that they
would go publicly and draw attention
to themselves, it just simply is not
going to happen. That just flies in the
face of logic.
Not only does H.R. 1 make it signifi-
cantly more likely for ineligible voters
to be registered, it also makes it next
to impossible for States to remove in-
eligible voters from the voter registra-
tion list once they are on there. I doubt
that anyone could have devised a bet-
ter way, or a worse way, as it really is,

to ensure illegal aliens get registered
to vote.
I urge my colleagues to vote against
H.R. 1, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from California is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I must
oppose the gentleman’s amendment. It
strips the subpoena power from the Di-
rector of the Office of Government Eth-
ics.
Recent years have made it clear that
the OGE needs to be strengthened. The
subpoena power is a key enforcement
tool, and a necessary one, for the Office
of Government Ethics.
The former head of OGE said, in
working with the current administra-
tion it has become clear we need to
strengthen the ethics program. That
individual resigned as head of the agen-
cy in July of last year, after almost 5
years as its head.
The OGE was set up in the aftermath
of the 1970 Watergate scandal to clean
up government. Some of that cleanup
has relied on norms of behavior that
are no longer in effect. We need to
make sure that we have the ability
with the OGE head to actually obtain
information so they can do their job.
b 1245
I do want to touch on a few other
points raised by the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. HICE).
You know, there has been a lot of dis-
cussion over and over that the small
donor program is funded by taxpayers.
That is incorrect. You can just read
the bill and see that is incorrect.
The freedom from influence fund is
entirely funded by a nominal, addi-
tional assessment on criminal tax
fraud cases, at the upper end, and cor-
porate malfeasance fines and forfeit-
ures. That is the entire source of fund-
ing. If there is not enough funding from
those sources to fully fund the pro-
gram, then the program is not fully
funded.
That is in the bill itself; so I think it
is important that we all understand
that.
In terms of the automatic voter reg-
istration system, this has worked very
successfully in a number of States, and
six more are in the process of imple-
menting it.
There are quite a few—we think,
ample—safeguards to make sure that
only those eligible to vote are, in fact,
registered to vote. AVR agencies have
reliable data about citizenship status
and age, and there are separate rules
for those agencies that don’t collect
that information.
I would note, also, that there has
been discussion about how this is an
unfair Federal imposition on States.
This is only for Federal elections. This
whole bill, H.R. 1, is about Federal
elections. And why is that? Article I,
Section 4 gives the authority to Con-
gress to pass laws about the conduct of
Federal elections.
We have seen over and over, through-
out the United States, efforts to sup-
press the vote in ways we think are im-
proper by purging eligible voters from
the rolls, by preventing people from
registering through bogus and arcane
ID rolls, by making sure that voters
can’t get to the polls because they have
moved the polls, by eliminating early
voting that is so helpful to people who
work so hard that they might not be
able to get to the polls before the poll
closes. So this is for Federal elections.
And why is that important? Each one
of us here in the House of Representa-
tives has one vote. That is as it should
be, as the Founders established it.
The people who send us here should
have the equivalent right to vote for
their Representative. There shouldn’t
be a way that one person in one State
has an adequate right to vote but the
vote is suppressed in some other State.
That is not democracy; that is not fair;
and that is what H.R. 1 will fix.
Madam Chair, I urge that we oppose
the gentleman from Georgia’s amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE).
The amendment was rejected.
AMENDMENT NO. 24 OFFERED BY MS. PRESSLEY

SEC. 1052. LOWERING MANDATORY MINIMUM
VOTING AGE IN FEDERAL ELEC-
TIONS.
(a) LOWERING VOTING AGE TO 16 YEARS OF
AGE.—A State may not refuse to permit an
individual to register to vote or vote in an
election for Federal office held in the State
on the grounds of the individual’s age if the
individual will be at least 16 years of age on
the date of the election.
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—This section shall
apply with respect to elections held in 2020
or any succeeding year.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentlewoman
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, I rise
today in support of my amendment,
H.R. 1, the For the People Act.
H.R. 1 is bold, transformative legisla-
tion which seeks to restore the people’s
faith that government works for the
public interest, not special interests.
We were sent to Washington with a
sacred task to do everything in our
power to reinstate Americans’ hope
and faith in our democracy.
My amendment to H.R. 1 strikes at
one of the fundamental goals of this
legislation by ensuring that those who
have a stake in our democracy will also
have a say in our democracy. By low-
ering the voting age from 18 to 16 years
of age, my amendment will allow
young people to have a say in our Fed-
eral elections, to help shape and inform
the policies that will set the course for
the future.
From gun violence to climate
change, our young people are orga-
nizing, mobilizing, and calling us to ac-
tion. They are at the forefront of social
and legislative movements and have
earned inclusion in our democracy.
Beginning at the age of 16, young
people are contributing to both the
labor force and their local economies
by paying income taxes, and yet they
are deprived of the opportunity to exer-
cise their right to vote.
In this country, we affirm that when
a person walks into the voting booth
and pulls that lever, there is no
meritocracy or hierarchy. The booth is
the equalizer.
Despite many reasons in our lives
growing up—in my family—to feel in-
visible and small, my mother reminded
me, as a super voter each election day
that, on this day, we were powerful. I
believed that then, and I still do. When
we step into that voting booth, we
bring the totality of our lived experi-
ences. The vote we cast absorbs and
honors it all.
Some have questioned the maturity
of our youth. I don’t.
A 16-year-old in 2019 possesses a wis-
dom and maturity that comes from
2019 challenges, hardships, and threats.
A 16-year-old will bring with them
the 2019 fears that their father’s insulin
will run out before the next paycheck.
A 17-year-old will bring with them
the 2019 hopes to be the first in their
family to earn a college degree.
A 16-year-old will bring with them
the 2019 lessons they learned picking
up shifts, waiting tables to support
their family while their mother was de-
ployed.
A 17-year-old will bring with them
the 2019 solemn vow to honor the lives
of their classmate stolen by a gunman.
And now is the time for us to dem-
onstrate the 2019 courage that matches
the challenges of the modern-day 16-
and 17-year-old.
I would like to thank my colleagues,
Representatives MENG and SCHA-
KOWSKY, for their leadership on this
issue and for cosponsoring my amend-
ment; the Rules Committee, under the
leadership of Chairman MCGOVERN, for
bringing my amendment to the House
floor for consideration; and I also wish
to thank my staff, Aissa and Lynese,
specifically.

my colleagues to support this amend-
ment, and I yield 2 minutes to the gen-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2521
March 7, 2019
I am proud to cosponsor it with her. It
addresses a crucial and often ignored
issue that I have been fighting to raise
awareness of during my time in Con-
gress.
I have met with students across the
State of New York and across the coun-
try and am incredibly impressed with
their drive and passion directed at the
democratic process.
Across the country, these students
are getting involved. They are march-
ing. They are advocating for their gen-
eration’s future, and they are asserting
their position in our society.
This is why I am proud to have intro-
duced a constitutional amendment in
the 115th and the 116th Congress to
lower the voting age to 16 for Federal,
State, and local elections.
The amendment in front of us today
gives 16-year-olds the right to vote in
Federal elections. In localities that
have already granted 16-year-olds the
right to vote, we have seen an increase
in voter participation and better de-
bate.
Madam Chair, 16-year-olds partici-
pate in our democracy already. They
are legally permitted to work. They
pay Federal taxes on their income and
can even be tried as adults in court. It
is only just that they are given the
right to vote.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts (Ms.
PRESSLEY) for championing this cause.
I know this fight will continue.
I urge my colleagues to support the
amendment.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to
this amendment.
The ACTING CHAIR. The gentleman
is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts (Ms.
PRESSLEY), my new colleague, for par-
ticipating in the legislative process.
This is why we are here. We are here to
debate the issues, whether we agree or
disagree. That is what this institution
is all about. And it is great to see new
Members be active on very important
issues.
I have to say, I think there might be
a constitutional issue with this amend-
ment. The last time we lowered the
voting age, in 1971, I believe we had 18-
year-olds fighting for our country in
Vietnam.
It seemed wrong back then. The kids
that were eligible for the draft.
Through no fault of their own, through
no choice of their own, they were asked
to go fight for our freedoms in a for-
eign country. Being 1 year old at the
time, I don’t really remember that de-
bate, but I can tell you, it was the
right thing to do.
However, for constitutional reasons—
and, also, I am of the opinion that we
shouldn’t arbitrarily lower the voting
age just because, right now, I believe
Democrats think they will gain more
votes.
H.R. 1 is bad enough because I believe
it will institutionalize a Democrat ma-
jority here in this House of Representa-
tives, but to be so brash and, possibly,
unconstitutional to decide and lower
the voting age only for political rea-
sons is something that I don’t think
this institution should be doing.
I have two 18-year-old boys who got
to cast their first vote this year. There
was some thought before election day.
I didn’t know if I would get their votes,
but since then, they told me they have
voted for me. And a close race like
mine, it made a difference.
But this policy is not well thought
out. It is not constitutional, and it
should not be part of this bill. I am
going to urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, I re-
spectfully disagree with the gentleman
from Illinois, and I, too, appreciate the
opportunity to engage in a civil dis-
course with him.
The data supports the fact that by
extending the table of democracy,
given what we have learned in Mary-
land, that, in fact, we have seen more
robust voter participation by both 16-
and 17-year-olds and those over the age
of 18. I think that we should be culti-
vating that relationship with the
young people and their government and
their participation as early as possible.
Although a constitutional amend-
ment is one approach, I do think that
we have a mandate from this elec-
torate, as a Congress, to be bold; and
this is the opportunity to do exactly
that, and we should be acting.
There is nothing spontaneous about
this. There have been advocates who
have been organizing in communities
for decades on this very issue and, of
course, colleagues in this very House.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, how much time is re-
maining?
The ACTING CHAIR. The gentleman
has 3 minutes remaining.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.
GREEN).
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Chair, I just want to share a thought
on this.
It is interesting that recently we just
raised the alcohol purchasing age to 21.
We don’t allow a 16-year-old to buy a
beer, and the decisionmaking is be-
cause of their ability to reason at that
age. That is why we moved their abil-
ity to buy a simple beer to age 21. And
now the other side wants to grant a 16-
year-old the ability to decide the fu-
ture of the country. I think this is fool-
ish.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, it is a great debate to
have.
The problem we have here in this
country, all 16-year-olds are still le-
gally minors. They can’t be tried as
adults in the court of law unless, under
special circumstances, of heinous
crimes.
They can’t join the military. They
won’t even be eligible for the draft that
took so many of our young men to
Southeast Asia, where many never
came home, the last time the voting
age was lowered.
In some States, 16-year-olds can’t
even drive their car alone. They can’t
take out a loan. They can’t take out a
mortgage. They can’t open a credit
card. And they can’t even run for the
offices that we would be asking them
to be allowed to vote for.
This is an amendment that has polit-
ical reasons behind it. It is the reason
that I believe the Democrats are push-
ing it. It is because they believe they
will be able to increase the number of
Democrat votes that are put forth in
the next election.
This institution should not be used
for that. This bill is political enough.
This bill, as a whole, is nothing more
than a charade to make permanent the
Democratic majority that just came
into existence just a few months ago.

That is why I believe H.R. 1 is a bill
that should be voted against. Please
vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1, and please vote
‘‘no’’ on this amendment for the rea-
sons that I put forth.
Again, I thank my colleague from
Massachusetts and my colleague from

pating in this process.

(3) The Federal government should not
concern itself with the political ideology or
affiliation of any of its citizens, when apply-
ing the law, offering services, or evaluating
applications for federal benefits or awards.
(4) The protection of free speech is broad
and covers expressive and political speech.
(5) Political speech, including the financial
contributions to political or issue advocacy
campaigns, is a vital part of our Nation’s
free exchange of ideas and avenues of free ex-
pression must be preserved and protected.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Tennessee.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Chairwoman, I rise today to offer my
amendment expressing the sense of
Congress that free speech should be
protected.
H.R. 1 is a misguided bill with many
problems. One problem, in particular,
has united everyone from the Heritage
Foundation to the ACLU. It is the
bill’s assault on free speech.
The ACLU itself says H.R. 1 will
‘‘chill speech essential to our public
discourse.’’ When the ACLU admon-
ishes a Democrat bill, everyone should
take notice.
My amendment is simple. It reaf-
firms the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States. The
First Amendment, after all, guarantees
the most fundamental right of our
Democratic society: ‘‘Congress shall
make no law . . . abridging the free-
dom of speech.’’
Our Founding Fathers knew that in
order for the American experiment to
work, the people must be free: free to
participate in the democratic process,
free to vote in elections, free to help
candidates and causes they believe in,
and free to speak up when their elected
officials are no longer representing
them.
The freedom of speech enshrined in
the First Amendment has helped make
America the most exceptional country
in the history of the world. Unfortu-
nately, H.R. 1 tramples on that very
freedom.
Madam Chair, I offer this amendment
to express the sense of Congress that
the freedom of speech must be pre-
served and protected because, without
it, the American experiment won’t ever
be the same again.
A vote against this amendment is a
vote against free speech. If you don’t
believe me, ask the ACLU.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to support this amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chairwoman,
I claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from California is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to this amendment, re-
luctantly, because it is only the last
paragraph in the amendment that
causes concern.
The amendment expresses a sense of
Congress that free speech should be
protected. Who can disagree with that?
Our Founding Fathers envisioned a ro-
bust and open discourse. They did not
fathom speech that was unaccountable
to anonymous corporations that would
drown out the voices of individual
Americans.
The concern we have on this amend-
ment is the last paragraph, really, is
an attempt to protect the Citizens
United decision and the flow of unlim-
ited dark money into our politics and
elections.
It is important to note that, under
the guise of free speech, some are sug-
gesting that we need to protect anony-
mous special interests. Nothing stops
people or entities from donating to po-
litical campaigns or politicians, but
they must be transparent about it.
Justice Brandeis indicated, and I
think he is very wise, that sunshine is
the best disinfectant, and the Amer-
ican people cannot fully exercise their
First Amendment rights if they do not
have all of the information necessary
to react in an informed manner.
We all have the right to know who is
trying to influence elections, and it
may well change our minds if we know
who is saying what. Ultimately, this
amendment is flawed because disclo-
sure does not limit speech.
In Citizens United, the Court af-
firmed holdings in other cases, that
disclaimer and disclosure requirements
impose no ceiling on campaign-related
activities and do not prevent anyone
from speaking. Indeed, the Court held
the disclosure is ‘‘a less restrictive al-
ternative to more comprehensive regu-
lations.’’
Lauded conservatives have long es-
poused this principle, and the Supreme
Court has repeatedly endorsed disclo-
sure because it helps voters hold elect-
ed leaders accountable. In fact, eight of
the nine Supreme Court Justices
upheld disclosure in the Citizens
United case as necessary for voters to
hold leaders accountable.
Perhaps no one said it better than
Justice Antonin Scalia in Doe v. Reed.
Justice Scalia said: ‘‘Requiring people
to stand up in public for their political
acts fosters civic courage, without
which democracy is doomed.’’
Much has been said about the ACLU,
and I appreciate what the ACLU does
on many scores, but they have a sto-
ried history of litigating constitutional
issues that I support. However, we have
differed on our approach to campaign
finance laws. They have upheld and
supported the Citizens United decision
and they oppose McCain-Feingold.
While I support so much of the good
work they do, I think they are mis-
taken on this issue.
I include in the RECORD a letter from
Democracy 21, which is a very thought-
ful rebuttal to the ACLU’s position.
DEMOCRACY 21,
March 7, 2019.
Re Response to ACLU Letter on H.R. 1.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: Democracy 21
strongly supports H.R. 1, the ‘‘For the People
Act of 2019,’’ and urges you to vote for the
legislation, which is the most comprehensive
effort to repair our democracy since the
post-Watergate reforms of the 1970’s.
In particular, the bill contains a series of
important reforms to address serious prob-
lems with our campaign finance system. The
legislation provides a small donor, matching
funds system for House and presidential elec-
tions that will encourage small donations
and remove candidate dependence on
wealthy contributors and special interest
money. It also contains important improve-
ments to the disclosure laws to address the
growing problem of undisclosed ‘‘dark
money’’ that is being spent to influence fed-
eral elections. And it provides effective
standards to ensure that supposedly ‘‘inde-
pendent’’ spending is not done in cooperation
or coordination with candidates or their
agents, thus evading contribution limits.
We want to address constitutional con-
cerns about some of these measures that
have been raised by the ACLU in a letter
dated March 6, 2019. We note that the ACLU
has participated as a plaintiff or amicus to
seek invalidation of reform measures in key
Supreme Court cases, including Buckley v.
Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), McConnell v. FEC, 540
U.S. 93 (2003) and Citizens United v. FEC, 130
S.Ct. 876 (2010). Many of the ACLU’s chal-
lenges to campaign finance reform measures,
including disclosure requirements, were re-
jected by the Court in these cases.
ACLU concerns about disclosure provisions
The provisions of the DISCLOSE Act incor-
porated into H.R. 1 are essential to closing
gaping disclosure loopholes through which,
in the last four elections, wealthy donors
and special interests gave $1 billion in secret,
unlimited contributions to nonprofit groups
that spent the money to influence federal
elections. Unlimited, secret contributions,
also known as dark money, are the most
dangerous contributions in American poli-
tics because there is no way to hold the
donor and officeholder accountable for cor-
rupt practices.
In its March 6 letter, the ACLU particu-
larly criticizes the DISCLOSE Act incor-
porated into H.R. 1. Those provisions require
disclosure of the sources of funding used for
‘‘campaign-related disbursements’’ that are
intended to influence federal elections. Dat-
ing back to the Buckley case, and as re-
affirmed in Citizens United, the Supreme
Court has consistently upheld disclosure re-
quirements because they serve the important
governmental interests of ‘‘providing the
electorate with information about the
sources of election-related spending’’ in
order to help citizens ‘‘make informed
choices in the political marketplace.’’ Citi-
zens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914.
As Justice Kennedy wrote for an 8–1 major-
ity in Citizens United, disclosure provisions
‘‘impose no ceiling on campaign-related ac-
tivities’’ and ‘‘do not prevent anyone from
speaking.’’ Id. In Citizens United, the Su-
preme Court upheld disclosure provisions ap-
plicable to section 501(c)(4) nonprofit groups.
The ACLU’s principal objection is that
H.R. 1 requires disclosure of spending that
‘‘reaches beyond the bounds’’ of express ad-
vocacy. ACLU Ltr. at 12. Yet the Court in
Citizens United addressed precisely this issue
and upheld a disclosure requirement for a
broadcast ad that referred to a candidate in
the pre-election period, but that did not con-
tain express advocacy.
The Court explicitly stated that ‘‘we reject
Citizens United’s contention that the disclo-
sure requirement must be limited to speech
that is the functional equivalent of express
advocacy.’’ Id. at 916.
Thus, the principal constitutional argu-
ment raised by the ACLU with regard to the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2523
March 7, 2019
DISCLOSE Act—that disclosure require-
ments cannot extend beyond express advo-
cacy—has already been squarely and over-
whelmingly rejected by an 8 to 1 vote in the
Supreme Court. While the ACLU states that
it particularly objects to disclosure require-
ments for ‘‘electioneering communications,’’
i.e., non-express advocacy ads that refer to a
candidate in the pre-election period, ACLU
Ltr. at 13, this is the very issue that the
Court addressed in upholding such disclosure
requirements in Citizens United.
The ACLU also objects to disclosure re-
quirements for money spent on ads that pro-
mote, support, attack or oppose (PASO) the
election of a candidate, complaining about
‘‘applying vague and subjective standards to
regulation of political speech.’’ ACLU Ltr. at
14. Yet again, the Supreme Court directly ad-
dressed this issue, and rejected an identical
criticism of the same test in the McConnell
case.
In McConnell, the Court stated that the
words used in the PASO test—promote, at-
tack, support, oppose—are not unconsti-
tutionally vague because they ‘‘ ‘provide ex-
plicit standards for those who apply them’
and ‘give the person of ordinary intelligence
a reasonable opportunity to know what is
prohibited.’ ’’ 540 U.S. at 170 n. 64 (internal ci-
tations omitted).
The Court further stated that ‘‘any public
communication that promotes or attacks a
clearly identified federal candidate directly
affects the election in which he is partici-
pating. The record on this score could
scarcely be more abundant.’’ Id. at 170. These
rulings should put to rest the objections
raised by the ACLU about the PASO test.
The ACLU also raises privacy and
associational concerns with the disclosure
requirements in the legislation. It invokes
the Court’s decision in NAACP v. Alabama,
357 U.S. 459 (1958), which protected the
associational interests of a civil rights group
against disclosure of the group’s membership
lists when the group was under attack from
government officials in the 1950s South. We
note that the NAACP today is itself a sup-
porter of H.R. 1, and that the disclosure pro-
visions in H.R. 1 could not be more different
from the disclosure requirements addressed
by the Court in the 1958 NAACP decision.
The DISCLOSE Act provisions in H.R. 1 re-
quire disclosure only of donors who give
$10,000 or more in a two-year election cycle
to a group which engages in campaign-re-
lated spending. That high dollar threshold
alone will exclude disclosure of the vast ma-
jority of donors to, and members of, most
membership organizations, and instead will
require disclosure only of very large donors
to such groups.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court in both
Buckley and McConnell has already rejected
the analogy between campaign finance dis-
closure requirements and the disclosure of
membership lists that was struck down in
the NAACP case. The Court said in McCon-
nell, ‘‘In Buckley, unlike NAACP, we found no
evidence that any party had been exposed to
economic reprisals or physical threats as a
result of the compelled disclosure.’’ Id. at
198.
Indeed, H.R. 1 has an explicit safe harbor
from disclosure for any donor who may be
subject to ‘‘serious threats, harassment or
reprisals.’’ Sec. 4111(a) adding Sec.
324(a)(3)(C). This again aligns with the Su-
preme Court’s requirements on this issue.
The Court has made clear that disclosure
requirements are not invalid because of a
generalized or theoretical concern about
‘‘public harassment,’’ but instead are invalid
only in specific cases where a group can show
a ‘‘reasonable probability’’ that disclosing
the names of its contributors would ‘‘subject
them to threats, harassment, or reprisals
from either Government officials or private
parties.’’ Citizens United, 130 S.Ct. at 916.
Absent such a showing, campaign finance
disclosure requirements are constitutional.
And even if there is such a specific showing
of a specific threat, the disclosure require-
ments would be held unconstitutional only
for the specific group involved based on the
specific showing of harm to that group. The
disclosure laws would otherwise remain con-
stitutional.
The ACLU states a concern that the bill
would ‘‘require disclosure of an overbroad
number of donors,’’ ACLU Ltr. at 15, but it
fails to acknowledge or to give proper weight
to other protections for privacy interests
that are contained in the bill. A group can
set up a separate bank account for its spend-
ing on campaign-related disbursements and
then is required to disclose only those donors
of $10,000 or more to this separate account.
All other donors to the organization would
not be disclosed.
In addition, any donor can restrict his or
her donation to the organization from being
used for campaign-related disbursements. If
the group agrees to the restriction and seg-
regates the money, the identity of the donor
is not disclosed. By these measures, groups
and donors can ensure that donors whose
funds are not used for campaign-related ex-
penditures are not subject to any disclosure,
thereby respecting any donor’s particular-
ized privacy interests.
ACLU concerns about coordination provi-
sions
A second area of concern with H.R. 1 raised
by the ACLU is the provisions related to
strengthening the coordination rules in the
campaign finance laws. These rules play a
major role in protecting the integrity and ef-
ficacy of contribution limits which are, in
turn, the major bulwark against corruption.
While independent spending is not subject
to contribution limits, any spending that is
coordinated with a candidate or his agents is
treated as a contribution and therefore is
subject to limits. Because of weak rules and
even weaker enforcement by the Federal
Election Commission, the existing coordina-
tion rules do not effectively restrain cam-
paign-related spending by Super PACs, non-
profit groups and other outside spenders
from being functionally coordinated with the
candidates supported by the spending.
In this fashion, the rise of individual-can-
didate Super PACs has played an especially
pernicious role. These Super PACs are typi-
cally set up with the involvement of the can-
didate or his or her close associates, and the
candidate is often involved in helping to
raise unlimited huge contributions for the
Super PAC.
This money is then spent, purportedly
independently of the candidate, to promote
the candidate’s election. But because there
are not effective rules against coordination,
these individual-candidate Super PACs have
operated in de facto coordination with the
candidates they are set up to support. In
practice, they have become dedicated soft
money campaign accounts for candidates,
thus eviscerating the contribution limits
which should apply to money raised and
spent by federal candidates.
While the use of individual-candidate
Super PACs began after Citizens United with
presidential candidates in 2012, they rapidly
have spread to congressional races. By the
2018 election cycle, 259 individual-candidate
Super PACs supporting federal officeholders
and other candidates had raised $176 million
in unlimited contributions.
The coordination provisions in H.R. 1
strengthen existing coordination rules to
conform to Supreme Court decisions which
require independent spending to be ‘‘totally’’
independent of a candidate. Buckley, 424 U.S.
at 47.
The ACLU tempers its objections to these
provisions of the bill, noting that it ‘‘strong-
ly supports stricter enforcement of rules re-
stricting coordination between campaigns
and outside groups’’ and acknowledging that
‘‘H.R. 1 would make strides in the right di-
rection by clarifying the definition of coordi-
nated expenditures treated as contributions
to a campaign.’’ ACLU Ltr. at 17. Yet it ob-
jects that the definition of coordination
could encompass ‘‘communications with the
candidate about the public policy issues of
the day without a sufficient nexus to the po-
tential corrupting influence of very large ex-
penditures.’’ Id. at 18.
In stating this objection, the ACLU fails to
give proper weight to an explicit provision in
the bill which protects such communications
by creating a safe harbor from application of
the coordination rules for any person’s ‘‘dis-
cussions with the candidate or committee, or
with any agent of the candidate or com-
mittee, regarding that person’s position on a
legislative or policy matter (including urg-
ing the candidate or committee to adopt
that person’s position) . . .’’ Sec. 6102 adding
sec. 326(b)(2).
The ACLU acknowledges this safe harbor,
Ltr. at 19, but misinterprets it. As set forth
in the text of the bill, the safe harbor applies
to legislative or policy discussion ‘‘so long as
there is no communication between the per-
son and the candidate or committee . . . re-
garding the candidate’s or committee’s cam-
paign advertising, message, strategy or pol-
icy,’’ id. (emphasis added).
The ACLU’s concern that ‘‘[d]iscussion of
‘message’ or ‘policy’ is integral to discussion
of legislative and policy positions,’’ id., is al-
ready adequately addressed by the safe har-
bor provision, which permits all legislative
message and policy discussion so long as it is
not about campaign policy, or the cam-
paign’s message.
Raising additional concerns, the ACLU ob-
jects to treatment as a coordinated expendi-
ture of a payment by an outside spender for
republication of a candidate’s own campaign
material, although it correctly notes that
this same republication provision has long
been part of existing law. ACLU Ltr. at 18. It
notes that there are regulations issued by
the FEC which have interpreted this provi-
sion of existing law, and claims those regula-
tions are necessary to the constitutionality
of the law. Even if true, there is nothing in
H.R. 1 which would prevent the FEC from
similarly construing the bill’s re-promulga-
tion of the same republication language,
which is all that the bill does on this matter.
Finally, the ACLU notes that the coordina-
tion provisions of H.R. 1 create a new cat-
egory of ‘‘coordinated spenders,’’ based on
certain specified relationships, activities or
status between candidates and outside spend-
ers. The bill then provides that certain speci-
fied categories of campaign-related spending
by such ‘‘coordinated spenders’’ will be
treated as coordinated. The ACLU questions
whether such treatment can be ‘‘based solely
upon a speaker’s identity.’’ ACLU Ltr. at 19.
This is, at best, a half-hearted objection
because the ACLU also then ‘‘agrees that a
speaker’s identity coupled with the contents
of the communications can be factors in de-
termining whether a particular communica-
tion was coordinated with a candidate such
that it should be considered a campaign con-
tribution.’’ Id. The ACLU nonetheless ques-
tions whether spending can be treated as co-
ordinated ‘‘absent any additional informa-
tion indicating the speaker acted pursuant
to a common plan.’’ Id.
But the Court has never limited the defini-
tion of coordinated spending only to spend-
ing pursuant to an explicit discussion about,

or a ‘‘common plan’’ for, a particular expend-
iture. The Court has instead cast a wide net
in demanding that independent spending be
‘‘totally independent,’’ Buckley, 424 U.S. at
29, and ‘‘not pursuant to any general or par-
ticular understanding with a candidate,’’
Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Com-
mittee v. FEC, 518 U.S. 604, 614 (1996), and
‘‘truly independent’’ or ‘‘without any can-
didate’s approval (or wink or nod).’’ FEC v.
Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Com-
mittee, 533 U.S. 431, 442 (2001).
The standards set forth in H.R. 1 look both
to certain relationships between the outside
spender and the candidate, and certain ac-
tivities between the outside spender and the
candidate, to determine whether the spend-
ing meets the standard set by the Court of
being ‘‘totally’’ and ‘‘truly’’ independent. If
the relationship between the candidate and
spender, or the activities of the candidate on
behalf of the spender (such as helping to
fundraise for the spender), indicate that they
do not meet this high standard for true inde-
pendence, then the proposed rule would ap-
propriately deem spending by that person to
be coordinated.
Conclusion
The reforms contained in H.R. 1 will make
essential improvements in the transparency
of the money spent to influence federal elec-
tions and in shutting down avenues that are
currently being exploited to evade and evis-
cerate candidate contribution limits. The
bill is carefully drafted to conform to the
Supreme Court’s campaign finance rulings,
and to appropriately balance constitu-
tionally protected privacy and speech inter-
ests with the government’s compelling inter-
ests in deterring corruption and the appear-
ance of corruption through disclosure and
the restoration of effective contribution lim-
its.
Democracy 21 urges you to vote for H.R. 1.
Sincerely,
FRED WERTHEIMER,
President.
DONALD J. SIMON,
Counsel.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I
would note, also, that we have just re-
ceived a letter from The Leadership
Conference on Civil and Human Rights
expressing their strong support for
H.R. 1. This is an organization that no
one can fault for their firm leadership
on human, civil, and constitutional
rights for many decades.
I include in the RECORD a letter from
The Leadership Conference on Civil
and Human Rights.
THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
ON CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS,
Washington, DC, March 1, 2019.
Support H.R. 1, the For The People Act.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of The
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human
Rights, a coalition of more than 200 national
organizations committed to promoting and
protecting the civil and human rights of all
persons in the United States, and the 50 un-
dersigned organizations, we write in strong
support of H.R. 1, the For the People Act.
H.R. 1 represents a transformative vision
for American democracy. It would create a
democracy that welcomes every eligible vot-
er’s chance to participate in civic life, and a
democracy that demands integrity, fairness,
and transparency in our nation’s elections.
For far too long, voter suppression has been
a shameful reality in our country—undercut-
ting the power and representation of African
Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and
Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and
other groups historically excluded from our
political process. The ability to meaning-
fully participate in our democracy is a racial
justice issue. It is a civil rights issue. And
the need for legislative action is urgent. We
commend the 235 House co-sponsors of this
critical legislation.
Our nation will soon mark the 54th anni-
versary of the Bloody Sunday march, where
John Lewis and 600 voting rights activists
were viciously beaten and attacked on March
7, 1965 on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in
Selma, Alabama. History was made in Au-
gust 1965 with the passage of the landmark
Voting Rights Act (‘‘VRA’’), which sought to
end racial discrimination at the ballot box.
Nearly five decades later, in 2013, five jus-
tices of the Supreme Court gutted the VRA’s
most powerful tool—the preclearance sys-
tem. That system had enabled the Justice
Department and federal courts to block pro-
posed discriminatory voting restrictions in
states with well-documented histories of dis-
crimination.
In the aftermath of the Shelby County v.
Holder decision, North Carolina, Texas, and
other jurisdictions previously covered in
whole or part by the VRA preclearance re-
quirement began to implement voter sup-
pression laws. In striking down the North
Carolina law in 2016, the Fourth Circuit de-
scribed the law as ‘‘the most restrictive vot-
ing law North Carolina has seen since the era
of Jim Crow’’ with provisions that ‘‘target
African Americans with almost surgical pre-
cision.’’ There have been findings of inten-
tional discrimination in at least 10 voting
rights decisions since Shelby County.
The Trump administration has only made
matters worse by damaging our democracy
and institutions—from elections to the cen-
sus to the free press. The administration’s
assault on voting rights can be seen in the
creation of the sham Pence-Kobach commis-
sion, a political ploy that was ultimately
discredited and disbanded. We also saw it in
its defense of Texas’s discriminatory photo
ID law and Ohio’s voter purge efforts. The
Trump administration has not filed a single
VRA case, despite numerous recent state and
local efforts to block access to the ballot in
communities of color. Yet the Trump admin-
istration cited its need to enforce the VRA
as its justification for adding an untested
citizenship question to the 2020 Census—a
justification that a federal judge recently
found to be pretextual and unlawful.
People turned out in record numbers dur-
ing the 2018 election to reject this assault on
voting rights and cast their votes for democ-
racy reform. Not only is this reflected in the
most diverse Congress in our nation’s his-
tory, but voters also cast their ballot to end
gerrymandering and make voting more ac-
cessible in red and blue states across the
country. However, many states continue to
create barriers to voting, and that is why
H.R. 1 is so critical.
H.R. 1 would enhance and ensure democ-
racy in America by:
Committing to restoring the Voting Rights
Act: H.R. 1 contains a commitment to re-
storing the landmark VRA and updating its
preclearance provision, which is crucial to
ensuring that our political process functions
fairly and equitably. VRA restoration is
being pursued on a separate legislative track
that will involve investigatory and evi-
dentiary hearings, thus enabling Congress to
update the preclearance coverage formula
and develop a full record on the continuing
problem of racial discrimination in voting.
In 2006, the VRA was reauthorized on a unan-
imous vote in the Senate and a near-unani-
mous vote in the House. We need the same
type of broad and bipartisan support for re-
storing the VRA today. Safeguarding democ-
racy should not be a partisan issue.
Restoring voting rights for formerly incar-
cerated people: H.R. 1 would restore voting
rights for people with felony convictions, a
necessary repudiation of our nation’s dis-
criminatory and racially violent past. This
would re-enfranchise approximately 4.7 mil-
lion voters nationwide. Reforming felony
disenfranchisement has bipartisan support;
last November, 65 percent of Florida voters
cast their ballots to restore the right to vote
for over 1.4 million people.
Reforming voter registration: In the No-
vember 2016 election, nearly 20 percent of
people who were eligible but did not vote
cited registration hurdles as the main reason
for not voting. H.R. 1 would modernize
America’s voter registration system and im-
prove access to the ballot box by estab-
lishing automatic voter registration
(‘‘AVR’’), same day registration (‘‘SDR’’),
and online voter registration for voters
across the country, and by ensuring that all
voter registration systems are inclusive and
accessible for people with disabilities. AVR
alone could add an estimated 50 million peo-
ple to the voter rolls and SDR increases
voter turnout by roughly 10 percent.
Combating voter purging: H.R. 1 would
overturn the Supreme Court’s troubling 2018
decision in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph In-
stitute that allowed Ohio to conduct massive
purges from its voter rolls based on non-vot-
ing in past elections. Such practices dis-
proportionately target and remove tradition-
ally marginalized people from registration
rolls. Voting should not be a ‘‘use it or lose
it’’ right.
Prohibiting deceptive practices and voter
intimidation: H.R. 1 would ban the distribu-
tion of false information about elections to
hinder or discourage voting. This provision
is particularly important in an era in which
Facebook and other digital platforms have
been readily manipulated to spread misin-
formation about the time, place, and manner
of voting to vulnerable communities. The
bill would also increase the criminal pen-
alties for intimidating a voter for the pur-
pose of interfering with their right to vote,
or causing them to vote for or against a can-
didate.
Banning voter caging: H.R. 1 would ban
voter caging and prevent challenges to vot-
ers’ eligibility to vote by individuals who are
not election officials, unless the challenge is
accompanied by an oath under penalty of
perjury that the challenger has a good faith
factual basis to believe the person is ineli-
gible to vote or register to vote.
Creating a federal holiday and ensuring
early voting and polling place notice: H.R. 1
would make Election Day a federal holiday.
It would also require at least 15 consecutive
days of early voting, including weekends, in
federal elections and ensure that early vot-
ing polling places are accessible by public
transportation. The bill would also require
that voters be given a minimum of seven
days’ notice if the state decides to change
their polling place location.
Reforming redistricting: H.R. 1 would be a
milestone in the battle against the extreme
partisan gerrymandering our country has
witnessed in recent years, by requiring
states to draw congressional districts using
independent redistricting commissions that
are bipartisan and reflect the demographic
diversity of the region. The bill would estab-
lish fair redistricting criteria and ensure
compliance with the VRA to safeguard vot-
ing rights for communities of color.
Modernizing election administration: H.R.
1 would reauthorize the Election Assistance
Commission—an independent, bipartisan
commission that plays a vital role in ensur-
ing the reliability and security of voting
equipment used in our nation’s elections. It
would also promote election reliability and

security by requiring voter-verified perma-
nent paper ballots and enhanced poll worker
recruitment and training. And H.R. 1 would
prohibit state election administrators from
taking an active part in a political campaign
over which they have supervisory authority.
H.R. 1 would also make significant ad-
vances in the areas of campaign finance and
ethics reform. It would correct the rampant
corruption flowing from the corrosive power
of money in our elections. It would replace
the current campaign finance system that
empowers the super-rich and big corpora-
tions with one that relies on small donors
and public matching funds. It would end se-
cret election spending and force disclosure of
all election-related spending. And it would
call for a constitutional amendment to over-
turn the disturbing Citizens United decision
that made it impossible to restrict outside
spending by corporations or billionaires. In
addition, H.R. 1 addresses our government
ethics crisis by, among other things, requir-
ing the development of a code of conduct for
Supreme Court Justices to enhance account-
ability on ethics and recusal issues; over-
hauling the Office of Government Ethics to
strengthen federal ethics oversight; estab-
lishing more robust conflict of interest re-
quirements for government officials; prohib-
iting members of Congress from using tax-
payer dollars to settle allegations of employ-
ment discrimination; and requiring presi-
dents to disclose their tax returns.
H.R. 1—the For the People Act—provides a
North Star for the democracy reform agenda.
It is a bold, comprehensive reform package
that offers solutions to a broken democracy.
Repairing and modernizing our voting sys-
tem goes hand in hand with reforms that ad-
dress the rampant corruption flowing from
the corrosive power of money in our elec-
tions, and reforms that address the myriad
ethical problems that plague all three
branches of the federal government. The re-
forms in H.R. 1 are necessary to advance ra-
cial justice and ensure that our government
works for all people, not just a powerful few.
The civil and human rights coalition is
strongly committed to expanding the fran-
chise and fixing our democracy, and we urge
Congress to pass this historic legislation.

Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chairwoman,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Chairwoman, how much time do I have
remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 3 minutes remaining.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Chair, I just want to make a few spe-
cific comments in regard to the amend-
ment and how it impacts H.R. 1 in gen-
eral.
First, there are no special interest
protections in this amendment, none
whatsoever. I remind my colleagues of
what the ACLU actually said about
H.R. 1. It places a chill on ‘‘speech es-
sential to our public discourse.’’
Further, I would like to stress that
the Court has long affirmed the rights
of individuals and organizations to
have free speech.
With those comments and clarifica-
tions, Madam Chairwoman, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, we
have no additional speakers at this
point.
I would just note that—and I under-
stand the gentleman’s points one
through four. I completely agree. It is
number five in your amendment that
causes me concern about whether there
is actually an undercutting of H.R. 1’s
disclosure requirements, and that is
the concern we have and why I am so
sorry that I cannot support the amend-
ment.
I do think that we have a disagree-
ment over disclosure. I don’t under-
stand why, because the Supreme Court,
including Justice Scalia, recommended
that to us, and we never followed up
with Justice Scalia’s admonition that
we should have disclosure as a remedy
for concern over unlimited money.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Chairwoman, I would just like to read
that point five. This is what it actually
says: ‘‘Political speech, including the
financial contributions to political or
issue advocacy campaigns, is a vital
part of our Nation’s free exchange of
ideas and avenues of free expression
must be preserved and protected.’’
That is all it says, let the American
people decide. That is essentially what
it says, that free speech should be pro-
tected.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I un-
derstand, but the concern that has
been expressed to me by a number of
people who have read this, probably
lawyers who spent more time on con-
stitutional cases than I have, is that
the concern is that this, as a part of
the bill, would undercut the disclosure
requirements that are established
within it, and that is the reason we
cannot come to an agreement.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentlewoman from California has ex-
pired.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. In conclu-
sion, Madam Chairwoman, again, as I
look at that point five, or paragraph
five, supporting the free exchange of
ideas and avenues of free expression, I
struggle to see where disclosure issues
are raised in that paragraph.
But as my colleagues, I have no one
else to comment on the bill. I am ready
to have the amendment considered, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Tennessee will be
postponed.

There are authorized to be appropriated
such sums as may be necessary to carry out
this part.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. GREEN) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Texas.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentle, yet courageous, lady
from California for leading this floor
discussion debate, if you will. I thank
the Rules Committee for allowing this
rule, this amendment to be in order,
and I also would like to thank my staff
for the stellar, outstanding job they
have done to help bring this amend-
ment to the floor.
Madam Chairwoman, on November
19, 1863, the 16th President of the
United States of America standing
near the battlefield at Gettysburg pro-
claimed that ‘‘government of the peo-
ple, by the people, for the people, shall
not perish from the Earth.’’ That is
what our bill, H.R. 1, is all about, gov-
ernment of the people, by the people,
for the people.
Madam Chairwoman, you cannot
have government of the people, by the
people, for the people without the pre-
cious right to vote. The right to vote is
something that people have fought for
in this country. Dr. King marched for
it; JOHN LEWIS went to jail for it, the
Honorable JOHN LEWIS, a Member of
this House; Schwerner, Goodman,
Chaney died for it.
The right to vote, H.R. 1, is about
protecting the right to vote. This
amendment is one that will help us to
inculcate new, young people into the
voting process. The amendment simply
allows those who are in high school to
receive voter registration information
while they are in school on the school
campus.
b 1315
It does not change the laws related to
registration and qualification to vote.
It merely allows the principal at a
school to go to the young people and
provide them with voter registration
information so that they may decide.
It does not impose upon them a duty to
register, but it does give them the op-
portunity to. This is a good thing in a
country where we believe that govern-
ment of the people and by the people
shall not perish from the Earth.
Madam Chairman, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chairman, I claim the time in
opposition, although I am not opposed
to the basis of the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chairman, I am not opposed to
what this amendment does, although I
would point out, once again, this is an-
other unfunded mandate. This is an-
other cost that the CBO has already
said, from what they can score, this
bill is going to cost taxpayers $2.8 bil-
lion with a potential for billions more
for what they couldn’t even offer a con-
gressional budget score for. So I have
some issues with that, although I ap-
preciate the direction my colleague is
going with this.
I think providing voter registration
materials at schools is something that
is probably being done now. I would
hope that local county clerks—I know
mine are—are already doing that. But I
am not opposed to that language.
However, I disagree with my col-
league from Texas that H.R. 1 is a bill
by the people and for the people.
Frankly, I believe every single Amer-
ican who is eligible to vote should have
their vote counted and they should
have their vote protected.
We all, as Americans—Republicans
and Democrats—want every vote to
count. We want to make sure everyone
can get registered to vote. At a time in
our country when registration turnout
is exceedingly high compared to pre-
vious generations, we are doing that.
Make no mistake about it. This bill
is not by the people. H.R. 1 is not for
the people. H.R. 1 is for the Members of
Congress who sit in this institution
who are going to eventually get tax
dollars to pay for their own campaign
ads. That is why this bill is a bad bill.
I appreciate the amendment that my
colleague is offering, but by no means
is H.R. 1 going to ensure that we have
the protection to ensure that every eli-
gible American voter has their vote
counted and protected.
Madam Chairman, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair-
man, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LOFGREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. This is a splendid
amendment. It will do a lot to allow
young people to channel their excite-
ment and to understand they are im-
portant and they are going to be par-
ticipating as voters when they turn 18.
It works well with the amendment that
will be offered by Mr. NEGUSE later
that allows for preregistration of 16-
and 17-year-olds so that when they turn
18 they will automatically be reg-
istered to vote.
I know that there is some concern on
both sides of the aisle about the idea of
a 16-year-old preregistering, that
change in the voting eligibility. We
don’t know how that amendment will
turn out, but certainly these amend-
ments would do much to make sure
that young people are thoroughly con-
nected to our government and under-
stand that the government belongs to
them and their families.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman
for yielding.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I
close with these words. This is a
participatory democracy. If it is to
function efficaciously, then the right
to vote must be protected.
I join my colleague on the other side
in his position that all votes should be
counted and that every person who has
the right to vote should be in a posi-
tion to vote. This amendment helps to
assure that young people will start to
participate in the participatory democ-
racy.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I would like to thank
my colleague and friend from Texas
(Mr. GREEN). Again, I agree with what
Chairperson LOFGREN said about the
excitement of students in high schools
being able to understand what it means
to be able to register to vote and par-
ticipate in the political process. That
is why I visit high schools throughout
my district on a regular basis each
time we are back from Washington, off
this floor and in our districts for our
district work period.
I am going to, again, extend the olive
branch of bipartisanship to ensure that
I am not going to oppose this amend-

through, but I will note to many of my
colleagues on the floor, Madam Chair-
man, we just had two Republican
amendments offered, and not one
passed. The olive branch of bipartisan-
ship has to work both ways. I am,
again, reaching out, and I will continue
to do so throughout the day, but it is
not without frustration that that olive
branch has not yet been returned.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The amendment was agreed to.

date of election by delivering the ballot on
that date to a polling place.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chairman, I
urge support for the underlying legisla-
tion, H.R. 1, which in my mind reaf-
firms the right to vote and empowers
the individual citizens in our democ-
racy and empowers their role in our de-
mocracy over the wealthy special in-
terests that has been the trend as of
late.
My amendment asks that in the spir-
it of this bill, which is to protect vot-
ing rights, that we protect Americans
who opt to vote by mail from unneces-
sary impediments to voting. Specifi-
cally, this amendment requires States
to provide voters with an opportunity
to return ballots at a polling place on
election day.
At its face value, this might not
seem like a drastic ask, but it merits
consideration, granted efforts by
States to shortchange eligible voters
from casting their ballot by denying
them the right to return the ballot on
election day. In Arizona, about 228,000
people dropped off their ballots at the
polling places on election day in No-
vember of this general election, a ma-
jority of which, I should add, were Re-
publican voters.
The reason why I believe that my
amendment should be supported is to
protect the vote-by-mail process. In
2016, 16 States showed a combined per-
centage of greater than 50 percent of
votes cast early, by mail, or via absen-
tee ballots, including my State of Ari-
zona. As more Americans chose to vote
by mail, lawmakers in this Chamber
should facilitate rather than hinder the
right to vote by mail.
Voting by mail allows voters to take
their time examining and researching
the candidates and issues that align
with their values, thus making that
very important informed decision on
election day. That only strengthens
our democracy and empowers that indi-
vidual voter.
Voting by mail also allows voters not
to be constrained by work, school, fam-
ily, or other sensitive matters that
would hinder their ability to wait at
polling places for long periods of time.
As you well know, other portions of
this legislation outline and address the
issue of forcing voters to wait hours to
cast their ballots, which is unaccept-
able. Voting by mail can help reduce
these incidents and provide more op-
tions that are considerate of a person’s
lifestyle or their particular needs.
Vote by mail helps alleviate under-
resourced, consolidated, or distant
polling places from having an influx of
voters on election day. By ensuring
that all polling sites accept vote-by-
mail ballots on election day, voters’
confidence in the electoral process, I
believe, is upheld. Vote by mail is in-
tended to increase voter participation
during non-Presidential election years
which tend to have overall lower voter
turnout rates.
The scope of this legislation is to
promote and protect the right to vote
that every American citizen is entitled
to. For many constituents, voting by
mail is the most practical and conven-
ient method to exercise that right.
With ongoing efforts at all levels of
governance to restrict voting, now
more than ever it is important to en-
sure that regardless of voting in person
or by mail that that vote is cast, proc-
essed, tabulated, and accepted as valid.
Madam Chair, I would hope that you
would join me in ensuring States are
not able to place harmful restrictions
on voters. States should continue to do
their due diligence and protect voters
by allowing them to return their bal-
lots on election day. Anything less
would be a direct attack on voters’
rights and would disenfranchise a
growing percentage of nontraditional
voters across this Nation.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I claim the time in oppo-
sition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chairman, I have a couple of
questions. One question, in particular,
is: If the gentleman from Arizona,
Chairman GRIJALVA, has this informa-
tion, I would like to know. This is al-
ready the process that we follow in my
home State of Illinois.
Are there any States that don’t allow
this already that the gentleman is
aware of?
Mr. GRIJALVA. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I
yield to the gentleman from Arizona.
Mr. GRIJALVA. I think there have
been efforts in my home State to begin
to restrict the use of election day drop-
ping off of vote-by-mail forms and
other discussions, and this is both a
preventive and encouraging amend-
ment that prevents any of those ac-
tions, and more importantly, to en-
courage States to apply that fairly.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I will reclaim my time,
but let the RECORD show it is not a
process, it is illegal in the State, my
colleague’s home State.
I am not against this process hap-
pening because it happens in my home
State right now. The problem we have
is we don’t want somebody who is eligi-
ble to cast a ballot, who got that vote-
by-mail ballot, and they decided on
election day to fill it out. We want
them to be able to go to their polling
place and not have to wait in line, and
we want them to be able to turn it in.
The problem we have on our side of
the aisle is it is ballot harvesting. It is
the process in North Carolina where a
Republican is likely going to jail, if
convicted. But that same process that
will likely send that person to jail, if
convicted, is legal in California. We
have a problem with somebody besides
that voter taking absentee ballots
unwatched, not a bipartisan effort, not
any control mechanisms, bringing it to
the polling place or to the county clerk
on election day or after election day.
Those are issues that we are concerned
about in the bill.
I don’t oppose this amendment be-
cause, again, it is already the process
we follow in my home State.
Madam Chairman, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. SARBANES), who is the
author and leader of the legislation,
H.R. 1.
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
I just want to support this amend-
ment. Again, what we are talking
about here with H.R. 1 is increasing
confidence, engagement, and participa-
tion on behalf of the voters. This op-
portunity to be able to return mail-in
ballots at polling places is a way to
further that.
I also want to say that with respect
to this idea we have to distinguish be-
tween election fraud and voter fraud;
what we saw in North Carolina was
election fraud by a political operative
taking advantage of voters, not voters
engaged in fraud. So there is a very im-
portant distinction there.
I also really wanted to quickly cor-
rect the RECORD for my colleague from
the other side of the aisle who men-
tioned a moment ago that somehow
under H.R. 1 taxpayer money would be
used to fund candidates’ campaigns.
Nothing could be further from the
truth. The bill provides explicitly that
there will be no taxpayer funds going
to any kind of candidate committees or
candidate campaigns. I just wanted to
correct the RECORD. I am happy to con-
tinue doing that over the course of the
debate.
Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield myself the
remainder of my time, Madam Chair.
I would remind everybody that this
amendment provides the States with
flexibility. It is providing convenience,
as my colleague mentioned, and as a
preventive tool, and no prohibition on
voters returning mail ballots would ac-
tually occur or slow down the process.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chairman, I yield myself the
balance of my time.
Madam Chairman, again, I don’t op-
pose the process. It is already in exist-
ence in my home State to ensure that
every eligible American voter has their
vote counted and protected.
There are legitimate concerns about
the ballot harvesting process; other-
wise somebody might not have to face
a trial in North Carolina.
I certainly appreciate the author
coming to the floor to, once again, talk

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2528 March 7, 2019
about the bill and some of the changes
that were made since it was introduced
on January 3, the first day of Congress,
cosponsored by every Member of the
other side of the aisle, a 571-page bill. I
certainly hope everybody had a chance
to take a look at that bill before sign-
ing their name on the dotted line, be-
cause the provision that the author put
in place, if he would have reached out
to any of the three Republicans on the
House Administration Committee, we
would have gladly discussed some of
our priorities, but there was no olive
branch of bipartisanship whatsoever.
b 1330
The sheer fact that somehow the bill
has been changed to now create this
fine that is going to be corporate mal-
feasance dollars, it is never going to be
able to get the amount of money in
that candidates are going to expect
when running for Congress. Candidates,
even like the neo-Nazi who ran against
my good friend DAN LIPINSKI in the last
race, will now be eligible for this cor-
porate malfeasance money.
Everybody on that side of the aisle
knows, when candidates for Congress,
including Members of Congress on the
other side of the aisle, aren’t going to
get what they expect into their cam-
paigns from this corporate malfeasance
fund—which is corporate dollars that
we weren’t supposed to be able to take
as Members of Congress in our cam-
paigns anyway but now somehow it is a
good idea to do—you know what is
going to happen? They are going to
say, ‘‘I don’t have the money in my
campaign to run a race,’’ and they are
going to ask the taxpayers to bail it
out.
Everybody on that side of the aisle
knows that is going to happen, and the
shell game they are playing right now
is very frustrating.
The CBO couldn’t even score this new
provision. We don’t even know how
much this is going to cost beyond the
possible $3-plus billion.
This is a bill designed to keep a
Democratic majority in this Congress
so that we don’t have a chance to pre-
side over these hearings anymore.
That is not the way to run elections.
That is not what our Constitution
wants. That is not what anybody
should support.
Madam Chair, again, I am not op-
posed to this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-

The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 28 OFFERED BY MR. RODNEY
DAVIS OF ILLINOIS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 28 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, as the designee of the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), I
have an amendment at the desk,
amendment No. 28.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 529, line 12, strike ‘‘Not later than’’
and insert ‘‘(a) IN GENERAL—Not later than’’.
Page 530, after line 3, insert the following:
‘‘(b) CONTENTS.—The code of conduct issued
under subsection (a) shall contain require-
ments that are at least as stringent as the
requirements placed on Members of Congress
under Rule XXIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives (known as the Code of Of-
ficial Conduct).’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, it is great to have many
conversations with you today. This is
what is great about the institution:
Our forefathers set up a legislative
branch to debate, to cast votes, and
then to legislate.
We won’t always agree on every
issue. There are times we will vehe-
mently disagree with each other. But,
Madam Chair, after the debate is over,
we all move on and look forward to
working with each other.
Madam Chair, today, I rise in support
of amendment 28 because Members of
Congress, all of us in the legislative
branch, are, appropriately, held to
stringent ethical standards that are de-
signed to prevent financial or material
gain for actions taken while we are leg-
islating in this institution. We should
ensure all branches of government are
held to high ethical standards, too.
This commonsense amendment would
require the Judicial Conference of the
United States to implement a judicial
code that is at least as stringent as the
requirements placed on Members of
Congress. This amendment would be a
step in the right direction for providing
transparency in government, which the
American people expect and deserve.
Again, I gave the olive branch to my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
on the last two amendments, and I cer-
tainly hope that that olive branch can
be returned on this Republican amend-
ment, and I will reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I rise in opposition to this
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam
Chair, this amendment is well inten-
tioned but riddled with inconsistencies
that render it ineffective and unneces-
sary.
Although judges should be held to
high ethical standards, it is a false
equivalence to claim that Members of
Congress and judges face the same di-
lemmas. Judges do not accept cam-
paign funds, do not represent constitu-
ents, and have no term limits.
Every person who has the privilege to
serve in our government should be held
to a code of conduct, yet it is a misstep
to assume that all branches of govern-
ment have the same prerogatives and
ethical pitfalls.
H.R. 1 already contains a reasonable
approach to expanding ethics for the
United States Supreme Court, and this
amendment would confuse the clarity
and enforcement of these standards.
The Judicial Conference of the
United States is best suited to issue a
code of conduct for the courts of the
United States. Judges know best what
predicaments judges face and how best
to protect the integrity of our courts
from corruption and improper conduct.
We should pass H.R. 1 without this
amendment so that we can create ef-
fective, enforceable ethical standards
for our courts.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I thank my colleague
from Georgia for debating this amend-
ment with me.
There are a lot of what I believe are
constitutional issues with H.R. 1, legis-
lative overreach that defies the equal
branches of government. This one does
not. All we are simply doing with this
amendment is asking the Judicial Con-
ference of the United States to imple-
ment a judicial code up and down the
judicial spectrum.
Maybe it will actually help ensure
that, as judges go through the con-
firmation process in the Senate for
whatever level of Federal judgeship he
or she may be nominated, it might help
us understand who these judges are.
This is a very commonsense amend-
ment. We are not saying Congress is
going to legislate judicial conduct. We
are just saying that we are the law-
makers. Why don’t we ask the Judicial
Conference to do it for the judges, just
like our standards are set by Congress
and the executive branch standards
should be set by the executive branch.
These are small things that make a
big difference in a big bill. Again, I
have extended the olive branch of bi-
partisanship this entire day, yesterday,
and I would certainly hope that that
would be extended back to us because
we have yet, in this entire process of
H.R. 1—being a 622-page bill yesterday
and added pages upon pages yesterday
and today—not one single Republican
amendment has been accepted. Not
one. Maybe this is it.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

tleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY
DAVIS).

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentlewoman

Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Wisconsin.
Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, I rise
today to offer an amendment to H.R. 1,
the For the People Act, which would,
among other provisions, require Fed-
eral and State governments to phys-
ically provide voting registration ma-
terials at the same time they provide
notification of a restoration of voting
rights under the bill. Voting is the
most powerful voice that we have in
our democracy.
As a Wisconsinite, I am proud to
stand today to fight for everyone’s
right to vote. Wisconsin has been the
petri dish for some of the most per-
nicious voting suppression efforts, in-
cluding partisan gerrymandering, all
designed to marginalize some votes.
Where our votes are counted, our
voices are heard. I am here to say no
more—no more—to suppression.
Anyone who works to suppress the
vote does not support democracy,
Madam Chair. Anyone who limits the
ability of all people to express their
voice through the ballot does not sup-
port democracy.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I rise this time in oppo-
sition to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I was a strong supporter
of the First Step Act, and I continue to
support criminal justice reform efforts.
As a matter of fact, just last week, a
former czar in the Obama administra-
tion, Van Jones, said that, ‘‘The con-
servative movement in this country,
unfortunately,’’ from his point of view,
‘‘. . . is now the leader on this issue of
reform,’’ talking about criminal justice
reform.
We need to make sure that we don’t
have petty drug users spending more
time in Federal prison than Jared the
Subway guy who was a pedophile, but
we have to review this amendment
very carefully.
We still haven’t figured out the proc-
esses and procedures of an amendment
that passed, part of H.R. 1 that is in
the underlying bill that would allow
felons to vote without any determina-
tion of whether that felon may be like
Jared the Subway guy.
Who is to say he doesn’t live near a
polling place where his polling place is
a school? How in the world can we
move forward on getting voter reg-
istration materials to felons without
understanding who is eligible to go to
the exact polling place they are sup-
posed to vote at or not?
I don’t want pedophiles, sex offend-
ers, going into a polling place in many
rural areas that the only place they
have is a school with children.
The provision in the bill needs to be
changed, needs to be vetted very care-
fully. We need to have some certainty
here.
I certainly do not support this
amendment because I still am not sure
that a felon who is not allowed around
children won’t be forced to cast his or
her vote around children.
That is why this bill needs to be put
back into our committees of jurisdic-
tion, where almost 40 percent of the ju-
risdiction was never marked up in the
first place.
This is a rush. I don’t blame my col-
leagues who are here today. I think
Chairperson LOFGREN and the members
of the House Administration Com-
mittee have done an excellent job put-
ting a bill that is terrible forward, but
the only reason we are here on the
floor this week is because Speaker
PELOSI and the Democratic leadership
team are forcing this issue.
The American people and the Amer-
ican taxpayers aren’t going to stand
for the provisions that are in this bill.
I don’t know why we are rushing it,
and I certainly wish there was more bi-
partisanship. I certainly wish there
was clarification on whether or not a
former convicted felon who is a sex of-
fender is going to be allowed in a poll-
ing place that happens to be a school,
where they can’t go into or can’t get
within a certain amount of yardage to,
outside of election day.
Madam Chair, I can’t support this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, may I in-
quire of the Chair how much time I
have left.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Wisconsin has 33⁄4 minutes re-
maining.
Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, let me
commend the gentleman for his active
participation in the First Step Act, the
criminal justice reform. Let me com-
mend him on his efforts to restore free-
dom to felons and, as he indicated,
murderers and drug dealers and other
kinds of criminals who he worked so
hard to restore their right to freedom.
This amendment deals with really
low-hanging fruit in terms of criminal
justice reform. It just says that, when
the department has decided that some-
one has finished their term, when they
have finished their sentence, when they
are released, they would simply receive
those instructions as to how to register
to vote.
If there is a pedophile—and I would
have welcomed the gentleman’s amend-
ment—perhaps it can be part of the
rules to say that you must vote by ab-
sentee ballot.
Madam Chair, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LOFGREN),
chairwoman of the committee.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Madam Chair, nothing in H.R. 1 im-
pacts any State law that requires an
individual who has been convicted of
an offense against a child staying away
from a school. Luckily, we have vote-
by-mail and early voting at county fa-
cilities in the bill, so that is really not
a real issue.
b 1345
Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for that clarification.
Democracy demands hard work, and,
again, I commend the gentleman for
his hard work to put criminals back
onto the street.
This is very low-hanging fruit. There
have been studies that have indicated
that restoring the voting rights of fel-
ons really means that they will be
more likely to not re-offend because we
are bringing them back into the civil
discourse of our communities.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I certainly wish that the
underlying piece of legislation actually
addressed our concerns, which is why I
would urge both sides of the aisle to
send this back to committee to ensure
that, while it doesn’t specifically say
that State laws can’t be followed when
it comes to allowing sex offenders into
polling places, it also doesn’t prevent
it. That is the problem with this top-
down overreach.
There is nothing in this bill, H.R. 1,
that would prevent a sex offender from
walking in and demanding his or her
right to vote while surrounded by chil-
dren that he or she is not allowed
around because of a previous convic-
tion or a sex offender registration sta-
tus.
I appreciate my colleague from Wis-
consin’s work on the First Step Act,
also; and I also have to offer a correc-
tion.
The First Step Act was actually to
get nonviolent offenders out of our
prisons, petty drug users who have
been put away because maybe they
didn’t have the information that the
assistant U.S. attorney wanted and
then, all of a sudden, they are
ratcheted into a long jail sentence be-
cause of mandatory minimums. These
are the issues that have bipartisanship.
By no means does the First Step Act,
or any act of criminal justice reform
that I support or that anybody else I
know would support, want murderers
out of prison. That is not the case.
If that is the case, we have some
more questions about this amendment
and we have some more questions
about this bill. We want to make sure
those jail cells are reserved for the peo-
ple who are the most hardened crimi-
nals.
We have got to work together on
criminal justice reform to take the
next step in the First Step Act. We
need to make it better, but it is all for
nonviolent offenders.

I have some serious concerns when
sex offenders get out of prison or
maybe they don’t even go to prison for
that long, like Jared, the Subway guy,
because he may have had a lot of
money, may have had the ability to
hire a good lawyer; but so many petty
drug offenders who are going to be the
beneficiary of the First Step Act
didn’t.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-

closing, I hope that my colleague will

deal with murderers or pedophiles. It

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentlewoman
from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Wisconsin.
Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, my
amendment simply requires an ongoing
evaluation after every Federal election
of the efforts to ensure that those with
disabilities have successfully been able
to exercise their right to vote.
The Government Accountability Of-
fice would be charged with assessing
polling place accessibility, privacy
issues, and the extent of poll worker
training on the rights of individuals
with disabilities, as well as on acces-
sible voting machines, among other
identified barriers. They would provide
their recommendations, if any, to Con-
gress.
I recently had a constituent come
into my office and speak about the con-
tinued challenges faced by those with
disabilities when it comes to exercising
this fundamental right, such as inac-
cessible voting machines that were lo-
cated and situated as to not provide
privacy for the voter.
And this is not just an anecdotal evi-
dence of the problem. According to the
National Council on Independent Liv-
ing, over 2 million people with disabil-
ities didn’t vote in 2016, and this isn’t
just an issue of voter apathy. Study
after study shows that our voting sys-
tem is still inaccessible.
What we know is that, even with laws
in place, not all polling places are ac-
cessible because of physical barriers,
unprepared and untrained staff, or ac-
cessible equipment that is either not
functional or turned off.
Let me be clear: This bill takes steps
forward to address those barriers, and I
appreciate the addition of those meas-
ures.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I claim the time in oppo-
sition to the amendment, although I
am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I am not opposed to this
amendment. I think we should work to-
gether to ensure that all those who
have disabilities have access to be able
to cast their vote, and I know my home
State of Illinois is doing yeoman’s
work, our local county clerks are doing
yeoman’s work to ensure that all those
who need reasonable accommodations
get them. So I thank the gentlewoman
from Wisconsin for offering it.
Before I reserve, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Montana (Mr.
GIANFORTE).
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Chair, we
all agree that Americans should vote
and participate in our Republic. We all
agree that every American’s vote de-
serves to be counted and protected. But
the bill, the underlying bill we consider
today, is riddled with problems.
My friends across the aisle call this
bill the For the People Act, but it
should really be called the ‘‘Protect
Professional Politicians Act.’’
One of the most egregious parts of
this bill is the creation of Federal fund-
ing for elections. Taxpayers will pay
for politicians’ campaigns whether
they agree with them or not. Under
this bill, if someone gives a politician
$200, the Federal Government will send
$1,200 of money to that politician.
Those mailers that fill your mailbox,
well, under the ‘‘Protect the Profes-
sional Politicians Act,’’ you will pay
for them.
Those attack ads that flood your TV,
well, you will pay for them.
Those high-priced political consult-
ants in Washington, D.C., well, you will
pay for them, too.
Since when is it a good idea to have
taxpayers’ hard-earned money shoveled
into a trough for a politician’s cam-
paign?
Montanans don’t want that. At a re-
cent townhall, 97 percent of Montanans
told me they oppose taxpayer funding
for political campaigns.
Imagine Republicans and Democrats
working together on a bipartisan bill
that addresses voting and election re-
forms. We could have done that. We did
that with election security in the last
Congress.
But that is not what happened with
H.R. 1, the ‘‘Protect Professional Poli-
ticians Act.’’ Maybe that is one of the
reasons why diverse groups like the

March 7, 2019
Montana Chamber of Commerce and
the ACLU have opposed this bill.
I join those groups, and I strongly
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on H.R. 1, the Protect
Professional Politicians Act.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. MOORE. Can the Chair inform
me about the time available to both of
us?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Wisconsin has 3 minutes remain-
ing. The gentleman from Illinois has
21⁄2 minutes remaining.
Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. SARBANES).
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Chair, I just
want to support the amendment. Obvi-
ously, we want to make voting as ac-
cessible as we can to everybody, and
this is a very, very important step in
terms of supporting that with respect
to people with disabilities. I want to
thank my colleague for introducing the
amendment.
I did, also, just want to correct the
RECORD. The last speaker, who may not
have been here a few minutes ago, was
suggesting that, under H.R. 1, taxpayer
money would go to fund political cam-
paigns, candidates’ campaigns, and I
just want to reiterate that the bill is
explicit that that would not happen.
There will be no taxpayer funds used
to support candidates’ campaigns. We
have provided for that. We have come
up with another way to support the
matching fund that we want to see, to
lift up small donors out there and give
them a voice in their own democracy.
I know the gentleman who spoke a
moment ago might not have been here
previously, so I just wanted to make
sure I got that on the RECORD.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, again, thank you to my
colleague from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE).
I support this amendment, and I am
going to ensure that we have no opposi-
tion over here.
But I do have a problem with the bill,
and I appreciate the author of the bill
being here. If I had that much time
dedicated to authoring a 571-page bill
with the help of outside special inter-
est groups that were commended at the
opening press conference, I would be
here to defend it, too. But there are so
many problems, so many unanswered
questions.
The sheer fact that the shell game of
corporate fines is supposed to fund up-
wards of billions of dollars to congres-
sional campaigns—my district alone
would have been eligible for $6 million-
plus just by using the last campaign.
Multiply that times 435 and add some
extra candidates in there, like the neo-
Nazi candidate who would be eligible
for this funding who ran against Demo-
crat DAN LIPINSKI. These are issues
that we don’t have questions answered
because the CBO hasn’t scored.
CBO has already said $2 billion-plus
for sure, possibly another $1 billion to
the taxpayers under this fund, but how
much is going to be raised from this
corporate malfeasance?
And until this day, until this week, I
had no idea that the Democratic ma-
jority is okay with putting more cor-
porate money into their own campaign
coffers. Corporate dollars are not al-
lowed in our campaigns now, as you
know, Madam Chair, but we are going
to use corporate fines at a level we
don’t know what it amounts to? We are
going to use those to fill campaign cof-
fers of Members of Congress? Seri-
ously? That is why the bill needs to go
back to committee.
I would love to work with the author.
I am one of the most bipartisan Mem-
bers of Congress, according to The
Lugar Center, but I never got a call. I
would love to help write this bill.
We tried to make that bill better.
This is another olive branch to the
other side on an amendment. I am
going to continue to show bipartisan-
ship that has yet to be reciprocated
from the author and from the com-
mittee.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, I just
want to thank the gentleman, again,
for his support of this amendment.
I think that America’s motto, E
Pluribus Unum—out of many, one—will
really be honored by this reporting re-
quirement which I believe will provide
information that will move us closer to
an election process that is truly inclu-
sive and accessible for all Americans.
That is what makes democracy work.
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
my amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 31 OFFERED BY MR. DAVIDSON
OF OHIO
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 31 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 63, strike line 19 and all that follows
through page 64, line 7 and insert the fol-
lowing:
(3) The term ‘‘exempt State’’ means any of
the following States:
(A) A State which, under law which is in
effect continuously on and after the date of
the enactment of this Act, operates an auto-
matic voter registration program under
which an individual is automatically reg-
istered to vote in elections for Federal office
in the State if the individual provides the
motor vehicle authority of the State (or, in
the case of a State in which an individual is
automatically registered to vote at the time
the individual applies for benefits or services
with a Permanent Dividend Fund of the
State, provides the appropriate official of
such Fund) with such identifying informa-
tion as the State may require.
(B) A State in which the percentage of the
aggregate number of individuals who were
eligible to vote in the regularly scheduled
general elections for Federal office held in
the State in November 2018 and who voted in
such elections was more than 5 percentage
points greater than the percentage of the ag-
gregate number of individuals who were eli-
gible to vote in the regularly scheduled gen-
eral elections for Federal office held in the
State in November 2014 and who voted in
such elections.

b 1400
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chairwoman, all too often in Wash-
ington, we mistake activity for
progress, and in many cases we apply
that misguided framework onto the
States.
There are few better examples of this
than Washington’s dabbling in our
election laws over the last 2 or 3 dec-
ades.
The National Voter Registration Act,
our last big partisan bill, aimed at in-
creasing turnout, did not actually
achieve that aim. It increased voter
registration, but as the Congressional
Research Service has said:
Its effect on turnout remains unclear. Its
cost and mandates on the States, however,
were very clear.
That is exactly what I am talking
about in terms of mistaking activity
for progress.
The centerpiece of division A’s voting
section is automatic registration. Ac-
cording to my colleagues on the other
side, it covers all sorts of problems: up-
dating the voter rolls, lack of partici-
pation, et cetera.
No excuse vote by mail, same-day
registration can be important, but is
the automatic voter registration sec-
tion that is hoped for the driver of par-
ticipation?
This is an aggressive mandate in a
bill full of aggressive mandates.
Fifteen States and Washington, D.C.,
have automatic registration. Only five
States do it at every welfare and gov-
ernment agency. Three States require
registrants to decline by postcard.
This bill would more or less include
all three of these provisions.
This bill would also require the auto-
matic preregistration of 16-year-olds.
If it went into law, it would amount
to, at the very least, a top three most
aggressive automatic registration pro-
gram all across the country, but the
bill says that if you are in a State
where you have already got an auto-
matic registration program on the
books, you don’t have to comply with
all the mandates in the bill.
My amendment would do the same
thing, but for outcomes instead of for
registration.
The outcome that this bill looks for
is turnout.
States that have seen massive in-
creases in turnout should get rewarded,
and that is what this amendment does.

H2532 March 7, 2019
It lets States who have achieved in-
creased turnout be rewarded by exemp-
tion from the mandates in this bill to
continue the success that they have
been able to achieve with their own
programs.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. HAALAND).
The gentlewoman from California is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
This amendment aims to exempt
States that have taken measures to in-
crease voter turnout that are not sub-
ject to additional Federal voter reg-
istration mandates, and I think what it
really does is undermine the progress
that would be made under H.R. 1.
In November of 2016, the general elec-
tion, nearly one in five people who
were eligible to vote but who did not
vote cited registration issues as their
main reason for not casting a ballot.
H.R. 1 sets a national standard for
voter registration and access to the
ballot in Federal elections.
Now, an improvement in participa-
tion rates is fine, but it doesn’t mean
that proven programs, such as the
automatic voter registration program,
aren’t necessary.
You know, automatic voter registra-
tion is not simply to increase turnout.
It serves a more fundamental purpose:
to protect the right to vote by remov-
ing bureaucracy and obstacles from the
process of registering to vote.
Now, nearly every State that has im-
plemented automatic voter registra-
tion has seen dramatically increased
registration rates. High rates of voter
registration are inherently healthy for
a democracy.
Madam Chair, I include in the
RECORD a letter that I received just
yesterday from Kate Brown, the Gov-
ernor of Oregon.
STATE OF OREGON,
March 6, 2019.
DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: I write in
strong support of H.R. 1, the For the People
Act of 2019, which includes bold and nec-
essary reforms to strengthen our democracy,
protect and expand voting rights for all
Americans, and improve campaign finance
laws. As the Governor of Oregon and former
Secretary of State, this is an issue that I—
like many Americans—care deeply about,
and I urge you to vote in support of this leg-
islation.
Voting is our country’s greatest collective
responsibility, and we must work continu-
ously to safeguard the sanctity of our elec-
tions. Across the country, the fundamental
right of voting itself is increasingly at risk.
More states are moving to obstruct voting
rights than are increasing access to the bal-
lot. It’s imperative that Congress take ac-
tion to bolster our democracy and fight
every effort to undermine it by ensuring
that, as a country, we are making it easier,
not harder, for people to have their voices
heard.
Several key provisions in H.R. 1 reflect the
work that Oregon has done to lead the way
on expanding voter access, including cre-
ating a national automatic voter registra-
tion system, allowing citizens to register to
vote online, and expanding vote-by-mail.
As you know, Oregon was the first state to
pass automatic voter registration (AVR) in
2015. This law, combined with our vote-by-
mail election system, makes Oregon the
most modern, efficient, and secure state to
vote in the country. Oregon’s AVR program
has added nearly 400,000 voters to the state
rolls, already significantly increased voter
turnout, and has ensured 90 percent of eligi-
ble voters in our state are registered.
Across the country, this success is being
recognized and replicated. Seventeen states
and the District of Columbia have since
adopted some form of automatic voter reg-
istration. These reforms have been successful
in creating a stronger and more inclusive de-
mocracy. And here in Oregon, it’s supported
by both Democrats and Republicans.
Every eligible voter in the U.S. should
have equal, easy access to the ballot box, and
I commend Congress for their focus on this
critical issue. This week, I urge you to pass
this important legislation.
Sincerely,
GOVERNER KATE BROWN.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, Gov-
ernor Brown notes that Oregon was the
first State to have automatic voter
registration. It went into effect in 2015
and has added nearly 400,000 voters to
the State rolls. Nearly 90 percent of eli-
gible voters are, in fact, registered to
vote. What that means is they can par-
ticipate in our elections, which I think
is very important.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chairwoman, the amendment that I
have offered is in keeping with the
spirit of the bill. States are balancing
the right of everyone to have access to
the polls.
Automatic voter registration has al-
lowed so much access to the polls, that
it has created challenges for States to
be able to comply, even with people
who are only supposed to vote legally.
They have access to voter registration
through Motor Voter and other ways
when they are not even residents of the
United States, and it puts burdens on
States to comply with that.
This would be a one-size-fits-all man-
date from the Federal Government
that may be needed in some States
where access has been challenging and
where voter turnout has been low, but
in States that have had high voter
turnout, that do have effective regimes
where you have not just access, but
you have participation at levels that
have increased by 5 percent or more, to
continue on the path of success that
they have had without disruption from
Federal mandates that would poten-
tially do that.
The Brennan Center says:
Automatic voter registration is gaining
momentum across the country.
Currently, 15 States and D.C. have
approved the policy, meaning that over
a third of Americans live in a jurisdic-
tion that has either passed or imple-
mented automatic voter registration.
This policy is winning at the State
level and overall push for turnout is
also winning.
My amendment is complementary to
this bill’s enterprise and it would do
nothing to undermine the pushes that
are already going on at the State level.
It was Madison who said that States
are:
. . . best acquainted with the situation of
their people.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I ap-
preciate the spirit with which this
amendment is offered, but I disagree.
This is about Federal elections. The
Constitution says that the Congress
has the ability to promulgate laws
about Federal elections.
The reason why we are looking at it
is there have been States who have
gone into AVR, they are grandfathered
into the bill, but the problematic
States are those States that are trying
to suppress the vote, trying to keep
people from voting, and we need to do
something about that.
Madam Chair, while we are here, I do
want to say something about, not the
gentleman’s comments, but the prior
comments of the ranking member
about the costs of the bill.
We have a score from CBO, and al-
most all the money that CBO has
scored goes to grants to the States to
upgrade their computer systems: $1.5
billion from 2019 to 2024; 750 for other
computer assistance; and the other big
amount is for making polling places
accessible to disabled voters. So it is
not about the other provisions in the
bill.
I would also like to note, and I put
this into the RECORD yesterday, the
Joint Committee on Taxation has esti-
mated that the fine and forfeiture fund
that will go into the Freedom From In-
fluence Fund is estimated to raise
$1.948 billion between 2019 and 2029.
They also estimate that it will reduce
the deficit by $83 million, which is in-
teresting, because it will deter people
from cheating on their taxes. So the
comments made about the money were
simply incorrect.
I know that the Joint Committee on
Taxation material is in the RECORD
under general leave. I will make sure
that the CBO report is also included.
Madam Chair, I would just end with
this: I appreciate the tone of the gen-
tleman’s arguments and the intent of
his amendment, but I do think it se-
verely undercuts the advances that
H.R. 1 would make.
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam

The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Strike subtitle F of title IV.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Ohio.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chairwoman, I want to quote from a
speech delivered by a former SEC, Se-
curities and Exchange Commission,
chair:
Certain mandates, which invoke the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission’s manda-
tory disclosure powers, seem more directed
at exerting societal pressure on companies to
change behavior, rather than to disclose fi-
nancial information that primarily informs
investment decisions.
That is not to say that the goals of such
mandates are not laudable. Indeed, most are.
Seeking to improve safety in mines for
workers or to end horrible human rights
atrocities in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo are compelling objectives, which, as a
citizen, I wholeheartedly share.
But, as Chair of the SEC, I must question,
as a policy matter, using the Federal securi-
ties laws and the SEC’s powers of mandatory
disclosure to accomplish these goals.
Those are the words of Mary Jo
White, President Obama’s SEC Chair.
She understood what this body under-
stood when it adopted the rider in the
appropriations bill my amendment
seeks to protect.
The SEC cannot and should not be
used as a tool for social engineering.
The disclosure laws cannot be used as a
method to compel noneconomic behav-
iors. The SEC has known this since the
1970s, when it received hundreds of dif-
ferent petitions to add dozens of dif-
ferent disclosure requirements. It stat-
ed at the time, ‘‘The Commission’s ex-
perience over the years in proposing
and framing disclosure requirements
has not led it to question the basic de-
cision of the Congress that, insofar as
investing is concerned, the primary in-
terest of investors is economic. After
all, the principal if not the only reason,
why people invest their money in secu-
rities is to obtain a return. A variety of
other motives are probably present in
the investment decisions of numerous
investors; but the only common thread
is the hope for a satisfactory return,
and it is to this that a disclosure
scheme intended to be useful to all
must be primarily addressed.’’
Madam Chair, we don’t know what
each individual investor wants, disclo-
sure requirements have proven very
costly, and I urge my colleagues to
support the position of the Obama SEC
Chair and the SEC since the 1970s,
which my amendment seeks to pre-
serve.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chair, I claim the time in opposition to
the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chair, I rise in opposition to amend-
ment No. 32, which represents an unfor-
tunate attempt to protect the influ-
ence of dark corporate money in poli-
tics.
I am so proud of the package of bills
included in H.R. 1, because I believe
that the work we are doing here will
transform our democracy.
One of the bills included in H.R. 1 is
my Transparency in Corporate Polit-
ical Spending Act, which will reverse a
law that prevents the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, or SEC,
from requiring corporations to disclose
political spending to their share-
holders.
The only reason that the law my
measure will reverse is even on the
books is that for years, conservatives
in Congress have misused the appro-
priations process to enact anti-trans-
parency measures, contrary to our
most fundamental democratic values.
This amendment would keep that
anti-transparency law in place.
I cannot for the life of me understand
why my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle seem so keen on helping cor-
porations keep their political spending
a secret. How is that good for our de-
mocracy?
Indeed, Justice Scalia, in another
case after Citizens United, wrote: ‘‘Re-
quiring people to stand up in public for
their political acts fosters civic cour-
age, without which democracy is
doomed.’’
The situation could not be simpler.
Americans deserve to know which cor-
porate interests are donating money to
influence our elected officials.
b 1415
Corporations should play by the same
rules as Michiganders in my district in
Macomb and Oakland Counties and
that the rest of Americans play by and
disclose their political contributions
because secret corporate spending
poses a threat to our democracy and to
investor confidence.
Since the disastrous decision in the
Citizens United v. FEC case allowed
corporations to make unlimited polit-
ical contributions, investors and citi-
zens concerned about the future of
American democracy have looked to
the SEC to require corporate disclosure
of political spending. We need to untie
the hands of the SEC so that it can
move forward with finalizing a crucial
rule requiring corporations simply to
disclose their political spending.
Requiring public corporations to be
honest with their shareholders, cus-
tomers, and the public about the polit-
ical donations they make is essential
to taking our democracy back from the
hands of special interests.
This is why I rise in vehement oppo-
sition to this amendment, and I urge
my colleagues to oppose it as well.
Madam Chair, I reserve the remain-
der of my time.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chairwoman, companies are already
going ahead and disclosing political do-
nations. 196 of the Fortune 500 compa-
nies have disclosure policies in place,
up from 174 in 2015. More companies are
deciding this is the right way to ap-
proach their political giving.
But I don’t have anything to say
against their voluntary decision. I do
think it is a mistake to force compli-
ance through disclosure laws at a time
when public markets are less attrac-
tive than ever for going public.
Capital formation in the United
States of America could easily be im-
proved and has, in fact, suffered by a
heavyhanded regulatory approach.
Corporations are not treated dif-
ferently than individuals are. There is
nothing that compels an individual to
disclose every single dollar they donate
and to whom. This would go in the
other way.
If you decide to go public in the
United States, you are treated dif-
ferently under the law than a private
company or a private individual. The
reality is, under the law, you should be
treated the same way. In some cases,
you are allowed to give a donation pri-
vately, and in other cases, you are not.
Corporations have to comply with that
law. The Federal Election Commission
administers that law, not the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chairwoman, how much time do I have
remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 21⁄4 minutes remaining.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chairwoman, I am glad to hear that
some corporations are good citizens.
However, we cannot leave our basic
functioning of our democracy to the
whims of individuals.
Some corporations protected the
safety of their workers before we had
the OSHA laws. Some corporations
didn’t use child labor before we had our
child labor laws. We need fundamental
rules to make sure there is sunshine in
this area.
Now, I yield the remainder of my
time to the gentleman from Maryland
(Mr. SARBANES), my friend.
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
I just really wanted to echo what was
just said, a couple of things that were
said.
First of all to note that, clearly, best
practices have emerged with respect to
public companies making this kind of
information available, but if that best
practice has merit, then it ought to be
applied across the board, which is the
argument that we are making. I thank
you for your work and interest in this
issue.
The SEC is there to protect share-
holders. It is there to protect the pub-
lic. That is the purpose of that agency.
Within the basket of things and meas-
ures that it can do to protect the pub-
lic is to promote this kind of disclo-
sure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2534 March 7, 2019
The rider that we are trying to get
rid of in this bill that you would strike,
that rider is preventing that kind of in-
quiry and disclosure and protection of
the public to occur, and that is why it
is so important that that rider be
struck. I agree with the gentleman in
his opposition to this amendment.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LOFGREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I think
there has been a lot of talk about
transparency today. We have had a
transparent process in the committees,
15 hours of hearings, but this repeals a
rider that was privately put on an ap-
propriations bill by Republicans to pre-
vent the SEC from doing something
that they want to do.
Let’s get real. I mean, this actually
just undoes a secret rider on an appro-
priations bill. This is the way bad law
gets made.
We are here in the middle of the day,
in public, debating amendments, not
secretly putting little riders on appro-
priations bills that hamstrung the SEC
for making sure that there is sunlight
on what corporations are doing.
I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chair, I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chair, may I ask how much time I have
remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 11⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. I wonder,
Madam Chairwoman, whether folks op-
posed to my amendment would be in
favor of requiring every single person
and corporation to disclose every dol-
lar that they give. That is essentially
what you are saying here: We want to
treat publicly traded companies dif-
ferently than we want to treat every
other company and every other indi-
vidual. And we realize that the FEC
isn’t competent or qualified to do that
job, so we want to add another agency
to do this.
President Obama’s own Chair of the
SEC stated: When disclosure gets too
complicated or strays from its core
purposes, it can lead to information
overload, a phenomenon in which ever-
increasing amounts of disclosure make
it difficult for investors to focus on the
information that is material and most
relevant to the decisionmaking of in-
vestors in the financial markets.
As has been stated, the fiduciary re-
sponsibility of the directors of the
company, of the shareholders, and of
the people making investments is a
common denominator. There may be
disparate political views in these
days—there surely are—and unpopular
positions may be at odds with the fidu-
ciary responsibilities of companies.
This should have been debated in a
Financial Services Committee—one of
the other flaws of this path that we are
on today—subrogating all of the au-
thority of the other committees with
only a handful of the amount of par-
ticipation.
Lastly, I would say that a majority
of Democrats actually voted for the ap-
propriations bill with the riders that
are at the heart of the opposition’s ob-
jection to my amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Ohio will be post-
poned.
AMENDMENT NO. 33 OFFERED BY MR. DAVIDSON
OF OHIO
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 33 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chairwoman, I have an amendment at
the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Strike subtitle E of title IV.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Ohio.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chairwoman, my amendment would up-
hold an appropriations policy rider in-
cluded in the FY 2019 appropriations
package that this body, on a bipartisan
basis, just voted on last month. That
provision prevents the IRS from the
collection of donor information for
501(c)(4) social welfare organizations.
In 2013, when the IRS attempted to
issue rules that would clamp down on
these organizations, there was bipar-
tisan pushback from groups as dis-
parate as the ACLU and Tea Party Pa-
triots.
The IRS has a poor track record on
the handling of donor information of
these organizations. The 2013 IRS scan-
dal of targeting conservative groups is
the perfect example of this. The IRS
asked groups excruciatingly detailed
questions, even as far as for the details
of the prayer meetings of pro-life orga-
nizations. Government agencies inves-
tigating the intimate details of an or-
ganization’s efforts to participate in
issue advocacy creates an unconstitu-
tional chilling effect on free speech.
The IRS is a tax collection agency,
not an arbiter of the fitness of an orga-
nization’s political viewpoint. My
amendment is about the fundamental
First Amendment rights for citizens
and groups to participate in public dis-
course.
Finally, H.R. 1’s needless removal of
a bipartisan policy rider does not make
sense in the context of this bill’s inclu-
sion of the DISCLOSE Act. I oppose the
First Amendment privacy issues raised
by the DISCLOSE Act provisions, like
the ACLU opposes the DISCLOSE Act,
but duplicative collection of informa-
tion, especially through a scandal-rid-
den agency like the IRS, which has
scandalously overstepped its bounds
and authority and jurisdiction, high-
light what this amendment is all
about. It is inappropriate for the IRS
to collect this sort of information.
It is my hope that we can maintain
the well-considered appropriations
rider already included in the package
passed just last month.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I claim the
time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chairwoman, I
rise today in opposition to the amend-
ment.
This amendment would strike a crit-
ical provision of H.R. 1 that cracks
down on organizations that are flood-
ing our elections with dark money. In
the 2018 cycle, $150 million was spent
by groups that did not have to disclose
their donors. Voters had no idea who
was spending this money to influence
their vote.
What it does is create a system in
Washington that leaves elected offi-
cials beholden to mega-donors, rather
than the needs of their constituents.
This is a direct threat to our democ-
racy, and it is coming from within this
Chamber.
This is a problem that is only getting
worse. Since Citizens United, dark
money spending has gone up by more
than 8,000 percent. Part of the problem
is the law isn’t being enforced. Some
so-called social welfare organizations
are devoting too much of their time to
political activity, yet they are allowed
a tax-exempt status and don’t have to
disclose their donors. And the IRS
can’t do anything about it.
We must allow the IRS to move for-
ward on the 2013 rule to define accept-
able levels of political activity by
these organizations. This will create a
clear standard. If a group violates this
standard, and it fails to adhere to its
social welfare mission, then it should
lose its tax-exempt status, and it
should register as a PAC.
If you are going to spend millions of
dollars to influence someone’s vote,
then you better have the courage to
stand behind your words. Instead,
mega-donors have taken advantage of a
loophole that allows them to donate to
a tax-exempt welfare organization
while hiding their identity.
All Americans should care about the
abuse of social welfare organizations.
It undermines the sanctity of so many
other valuable and necessary organiza-
tions.
Let’s be clear about what is hap-
pening here. This amendment serves
one purpose: to hide mega-donor sup-
port for campaigns. Let’s pull back the

curtain and let Americans see who is
really behind those negative ads.
Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the re-
mainder of my time.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chair, may I inquire of the amount of
time remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 3 minutes remaining.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chairwoman, even the scandal-ridden,
2013-era IRS that targeted conservative
groups, overstepping its jurisdiction by
trying to shape the speech and conduct
of organizations rather than collect
their taxes, withdrew the rulemaking
process at the heart of what is sought
in this H.R. 1 bill. It is a chilling effect.
As we talk about one of our rights,
access to the ballot box at the Federal
level, and we consider that, I think it
is important to remember the founding
principles that led to the creation of
this country, and they are enshrined in
the Federalist Papers.
I include in the RECORD a copy of
Federalist Paper No. 59, wherein Madi-
son makes the case that Article I, Sec-
tion 4 of the Constitution is about the
Federal Government’s right to defend
itself. It is not about Congress being
the prime driver of elections.
CONGRESS GETS TO REGULATE ELECTIONS
Federalist No. 59:
It is absolute not the first province of the
federal government. This is what Hamilton
said in Federalist 59:
They have submitted the regulation of
elections for the federal government, in the
first instance, to the local administrations;
which, in ordinary cases, and when no im-
proper views prevail, may be both more con-
venient and more satisfactory; but they have
reserved to the national authority a right to
interpose, whenever extraordinary cir-
cumstances might render that interposition
necessary to its safety.
Article 1 section 4 is about the federal gov-
ernment’s right to defend itself. It is not
about Congress being the prime driver of
elections.
b 1430
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. As we look
at this, we have the Federal Election
Commission. We have bodies of law
that require disclosure, and we have or-
ganizations that sometimes violate
those disclosure laws, and those com-
panies are prosecuted when they do
that.
Here, we want to take and add the
IRS responsibility of shaping that dis-
closure, and only for these types of
groups and these types of donations. It
is intended to have a chilling effect on
the speech, and that is at the core of
the objection for groups that don’t
agree on much.
Between the ACLU and the NRA they
don’t often agree, but they agree that
H.R. 1 is bad, and this goes to the heart
of their objection.
Madam Chair, I ask unanimous sup-
port for my amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LOFGREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, just to
note, Congress never intended for
501(c), for social welfare organizations
to just be conduits for dark campaign
spending.
In exchange for nonprofit status and
tax exempt status, the law requires
them to engage exclusively in the pro-
motion of social welfare.
Now, how is that defined? The IRS
was trying to get a bright line on that,
but they were stopped by a secret rider
put in an appropriations bill.
Obviously, the appropriation at large
got votes from both sides of the aisle
because you need to keep the govern-
ment down. But that is not the way
you legislate. That is a sneaky way to
change the law.
To repeal this provision of H.R. 1
would be a huge mistake, because what
we are doing is setting things right so
that people know what they can do and
what they can’t do.
Yes, you can speak, but don’t expect
to get a tax break because you are
speaking about politics. You get a tax
break because you are doing charitable
work.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman
for yielding.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. SARBANES).
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I thank him for his work in intro-
ducing the bill that would repeal this
rider that prevents the IRS from the
kind of inquiry that should be done.
This is about figuring out who is
leaning into the big money game. So it
goes with a number of other riders that
we have seen that have been put in
place over the last few years.
We want to know if Federal contrac-
tors are leaning into the big money
game. That is why we want the execu-
tive branch to have rules of disclosure
with respect to what is happening with
money and Federal contractors. That
is why we wanted to get rid of the rider
that would stop that from happening.
We want to know if public companies
are leaning into the big money game.
That is why we want to get rid of that
rider that would stop the SEC, since
they are supposed to protect the public
from following that disclosure and
looking into whether money is coming
into that space.
And in this instance, we want to
make sure that these entities that are
supposed to be tax exempt aren’t lean-
ing into the big money game, and the
IRS is there as the agency to do that.
Madam Chair, we need to make sure
we protect that ability.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, how much
time is remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado has 1 minute remaining.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, this is
more than one simple issue. This is
about rule of law; it is about trans-
parency; and it is about the democracy
that we must become if we are to re-
turn power back to our communities.
This is already the law.
What my colleagues on the other side
want to do is prevent the government
from enforcing the law.
This is about rule of law and making
sure we are enforcing what is already
on the books, and we are prohibiting
the abuse of social welfare organiza-
tions and we are bringing to light dark
money.
The voters of this country deserve to
know who is spending money, millions
of dollars, to influence their vote. It
should not be hidden. The people of our
communities deserve to know who is
spending that money to influence our
vote, and that is why I ask folks in this
Chamber, my colleagues, to oppose this
amendment and let’s restore our de-
mocracy and return power back to our
communities.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Chairwoman, in Alabama v. the
NAACP, the courts upheld the right to
protect the privacy of donor informa-
tion.
The right to privacy is fundamental
to our Bill of Rights, and it is threat-
ened. It has a chilling effect, as has
been enumerated from any number of
groups. My colleagues know this.
Just recently, social welfare groups,
as defined by 501(c)(4), engaged in so-
cial welfare to support infanticide, a
bill that could not get a vote to cloture
in the Senate.
It would require the IRS, instead of
the body of jurisdiction, the Election
Commission, to deal with donors.
The IRS should be narrowly focused
on collecting tax revenue, not on elec-
tions law, and we have seen abuses of
their already-limited jurisdiction.
This is the right thing to do. I en-
courage my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I ask for everyone
who can find a way to see through the
distortion of information that is being
presented here to support our Bill of
Rights, protect the right to privacy,
and vote for this amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

tleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON).

Mr. LUJÁN. Madam Chair, our de-
mocracy is at its best when all voices
are heard. Unfortunately, whether due
to an antiquated voting system or re-
strictive voter laws, too many Ameri-
cans face too many obstacles to par-
ticipating in our elections.
There is also an immediate need to
protect election security. Russia at-
tacked our democracy in 2016 and could
do so again. That is why, last Congress,
I introduced a Voting Innovation Prize
Act, to tap into America’s innovative
spirit to strengthen our democracy.
These are competitive grants.
Today, I am proud to offer an amend-
ment based on that legislation. My
amendment will expand the election
infrastructure grants to promote voter
participation, secure our elections, and
increase funding.
Madam Chair, I thank Chairman
BENNIE THOMPSON for working with me
on this amendment, and I urge adop-
tion of this amendment and the For
the People Act.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Chair, I ask
unanimous consent to claim the time
in opposition to the amendment, al-
though I am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection
to the request of the gentleman from
Indiana?
There was no objection.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Indiana is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Chair, although I
strongly oppose H.R. 1, I appreciate the
intent of Mr. LUJÁN’s amendment.
This amendment would improve the
election infrastructure innovation
grant program established in H.R. 1 by
requiring consultation with the Direc-
tor of the National Institute of Stand-
ards and Technology.
NIST is already working with the
Election Assistance Commission to de-
velop voluntary standards and guide-
lines for voting systems and is well-po-
sitioned to support the Department of
Homeland Security, the National
Science Foundation, and the Commis-
sion’s election security research ef-
forts.
I would like to note that the amend-
ment does not add the Committee on
Science, Space, and Technology as a
recipient of the report required by sec-
tion 321(b).
I am the ranking member of the Re-
search and Technology Subcommittee,
which has jurisdiction over the DHS
Science and Technology Directorate,
the NSF, and the NIST, all of which
are implicated by section 321.
Although I do not expect H.R. 1 to
ever become law, I hope election secu-
rity is something that we can do on a
bipartisan basis in the future. This
process has been rushed, and appro-
priate due diligence to create strong
and effective bipartisan election and
security reforms has not been done.
Once again, I support the intent of
this amendment, but I oppose H.R. 1.
Madam Chair, I thank the gen-
tleman, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. LUJÁN. Madam Chair, I yield as
much time as she may consume to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN), the chair of the Committee on
House Administration.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I think
this amendment improves the bill. It
revises the election infrastructure
grant program and includes an empha-
sis on increasing voter participation, in
addition to the emphasis on improving
election infrastructure that is cur-
rently included in H.R. 1.
I am especially pleased that it en-
gages the National Institute of Stand-
ards and Technology, NIST, which is
really the premier agency to help us on
technical issues. So I think it is a very
good amendment.
And while I have the floor, I would
like to note that I will include in the
RECORD a letter from the AFL–CIO and
a letter from the American Federation
of Teachers urging support of H.R. 1.
AFL–CIO,
Washington, DC, March 5, 2019.
UNITED STATES HOUSE,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
AFL–CIO, I am writing to express our strong
support for H.R. 1, the ‘‘For the People Act
of 2019.’’ By expanding access to the ballot
box, reducing the influence of big money in
politics and strengthening ethics rules for
public servants, this legislation includes
many of the most important reforms nec-
essary to restore the promise of our democ-
racy.
For years, right-wing groups backed by
wealthy donors have been working aggres-
sively to suppress the right of every Amer-
ican citizen to cast a ballot. They have sup-
ported laws to make it harder to register and
to vote and they have used the corrosive
power of money to drown out the voices of
working people.
H.R. I would expand the franchise by pro-
moting early voting, same day and online
registration. It would create a system of
public financing powered by small donations
and require super PACS and dark money po-
litical organizations to make their donors
public. It would restore voting rights for for-
merly incarcerated individuals and commit
Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act to
end racial discrimination in voting.
Record wealth inequality, mass incarcer-
ation and low voter turnout are all symp-
toms of a broken political system. AFL–CIO
proudly supports H.R. 1 as we continue the
fight to fix our democracy and restore the
balance of power to working people.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM SAMUEL,
Director, Government Affairs Department.
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS,
Washington, DC, March 6, 2019.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 1.7
million members of the American Federation
of Teachers, I urge you to vote YES on H.R.
1, the For the People Act of 2019.
There is no question that we have seen an
erosion of voting rights, a loosening or ig-
noring of ethics rules and conduct, and an
ever-increasing presence of big money in
elections. All of this undermines America’s
democracy. That is why passage of H.R. 1 is
so important. It represents a historic effort
to restore both the rights of working people
and the promise of our nation’s democracy.
It will give power back to the people by lim-
iting the influence of the corrupt and by ex-
panding voting rights for all Americans.
The For the People Act will strengthen the
government’s ethics laws while imposing
much-needed restrictions on campaign fi-
nance regulations. For far too long, the in-
fluence of money in politics—especially un-
accountable ‘‘dark money’’ funneled into our
system by wealthy individuals and large
companies—has been a negative force in
elections across our nation. The bill will put
an end to anonymous election spending and
force disclosure of all election-related spend-
ing.
The AFT also strongly supports H.R. 1’s
call for a constitutional amendment to over-
turn the disturbing Citizens United decision.
This case has had a corrosive effect on our
democracy, giving powerful corporations a
disproportionate amount of influence in our
elections. Since this case was decided, big
corporations have been using their record
profits to try to silence the voices of hard-
working Americans. No donor should be able
to hide its identity as it floods the system
with hundreds of millions of dollars in an ef-
fort to pass an extreme agenda that will gut
the salary, healthcare and pensions of work-
ers.
It’s time to restore balance and guarantee
that a teacher in Cleveland has the same
voice in our democracy as a CEO on Wall
Street. H.R. 1 moves us in that direction.
The bill’s promise to focus on voting is ab-
solutely essential as a civil rights matter
and as a democracy issue. It commits to re-
storing the Voting Rights Act; restoring vot-
ing rights for formerly incarcerated people;
reforming voter registration; combating
voter purging; prohibiting deceptive prac-
tices and voter intimidation; creating a fed-
eral holiday for Election Day; ensuring early
voting and polling place notice; reforming
redistricting; and modernizing election ad-
ministration.
Expanding voting rights in 2019 is vital to
our democracy. It’s hard to understand how
any members of the House of Representa-
tives would vote against it, yet we have seen
all too frequently an allegiance to partisan
politics rather than to the basic values of
civic participation.
Passage of H.R. 1 will help confront the
many real threats facing our democracy
today. I hope you will vote YES when it
comes up for a vote this week in the House.
Sincerely,
RANDI WEINGARTEN,
President.
Mr. LUJÁN. Madam Chair, I urge
adoption of this amendment, I urge
adoption of H.R. 1, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New Mexico (Mr. LUJÁN).
The amendment was agreed to.

March 7, 2019
AMENDMENT NO. 37 OFFERED BY MR. POCAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 37 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
After subtitle G of title II, insert the fol-
lowing (and redesignate subtitle H as sub-
title I):
Subtitle H—Residence of Incarcerated
Individuals
SEC. 2701. RESIDENCE OF INCARCERATED INDI-
VIDUALS.
Section 141 of title 13, United States Code,
is amended
(1) by redesignating subsection (g) as sub-
section (h); and
(2) by inserting after subsection (f) the fol-
lowing:
‘‘(g)(1) Effective beginning with the 2020 de-
cennial census of population, in taking any
tabulation of total population by States
under subsection (a) for purposes of the ap-
portionment of Representatives in Congress
among the several States, the Secretary
shall, with respect to an individual incarcer-
ated in a State, Federal, county, or munic-
ipal correctional center as of the date on
which such census is taken, attribute such
individual to such individual’s last place of
residence before incarceration.
‘‘(2) In carrying out this subsection, the
Secretary shall consult with each State de-
partment of corrections to collect the infor-
mation necessary to make the determination
required under paragraph (1).’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Wisconsin.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chair, first off,
let me thank the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. SARBANES) for this bill
and the gentlewoman from California
(Ms. LOFGREN) for all her work on this
bill.
This is an important promise that we
made to the American people that we
would clean up Washington, and I
think H.R. 1 is going to go very far in
doing that.
This amendment specifically address-
es an important aspect of continuing to
make the process for democracy
stronger in this country. This amend-
ment would end the practice of prison
gerrymandering.
Starting this decennial Census, this
amendment would require persons who
are incarcerated in correctional facili-
ties to be counted as a resident of their
last place of residence before incarcer-
ation.
There is only one constitutional
mandate as it pertains to the Census:
The Federal Government must count
all persons present in the country at
the time of the Census.
We know we will get an accurate
count of incarcerated individuals. The
only question, then, is: Where do we
count them?
If we count incarcerated persons as
being present at their last known resi-
dence, we know that the right commu-
nity will receive the appropriate
amount of population-based funding it
needs to take care of all of their citi-
zens, because the odds are that an in-
carcerated person will return home
after release to the community in
which they most recently lived.
If we count incarcerated persons as
residents of correctional facilities,
more often than not we are simply
swelling the population count of com-
munities in which incarcerated individ-
uals do not actually live, participate in
civil society, or utilize government
services outside prison walls.
Let’s stop this charade. Let’s stop
the dramatic distortion of representa-
tion at State and local levels, and let’s
end the inaccurate creation of commu-
nity populations that mislead research
and planning efforts.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, which is also supported by
the Brennan Center for Justice, Com-
mon Cause, and the Leadership Con-
ference on Civil and Human Rights.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to
the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I appreciate the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin’s interest in re-
districting and gerrymandering.
Coming from the State of Illinois, I
like the independent redistricting pro-
visions of H.R. 1.
I have some concerns as to why one
State’s redistricting plan is now part of
the bill when it was supposed to be a
nationwide approach, but we will get to
that later.
b 1445
Gerrymandering is a process like in
my home State of Illinois that can poi-
son the political process. We have Dem-
ocrat supermajorities in the House of
Representatives in Illinois. We have
Democrat majorities in the Illinois
State Senate, supermajorities. We have
a Democrat Governor. I certainly hope
we get redistricting reform by the time
2021 rolls around.
But this amendment is about gerry-
mandering. This amendment is about
the census, and my biggest concern
goes back to, again, this bill was not
even marked up in the Oversight and
Reform Committee. This issue was not
even brought up during a single hear-
ing that the Oversight and Reform
Committee held on H.R. 1.
This amendment also could upend a
foundational principle of the census.
Since 1790, the census has been count-
ing people at their usual residences on
census day. I guess, when Charles Man-
son was alive out in the 21st District of
California, he got counted at the max-
imum security Federal prison.
All alternatively housed populations
are actually counted the same way, or
are supposed to be. Who is to say that
somebody who lives at Charles Man-
son’s old home, a relative, doesn’t
write him down on the census form,
too. I have some concerns about double
counting that this amendment does not
address. But prisoners have been count-
ed at their prison, college students
have been counted at their dorms. I re-
member in 1990, I filled out a little cen-
sus form in Mills Hall at Millikin Uni-
versity in Decatur, Illinois, to be
counted as part of the census.
I didn’t check with my mom to see if
she counted me at home too. Military
servicemembers are counted at their
U.S. station base. Counting one popu-
lation differently than other similarly
situated populations only serves to de-
crease the accuracy of the census. The
census count is actually about appor-
tionment that State legislatures use to
draw new lines, or independent com-
missions use to draw new congressional
lines, State legislative lines. Hopefully,
they don’t gerrymander. This is not
about redistricting.
The Census Bureau works with
States to provide detailed data about
prison populations that would allow
the States to redistrict however the
State chooses. That is why I am op-
posed to your amendment. I do respect
you being here to participate in the
process. I certainly wish that we could
have sat down and maybe worked out a
better amendment that would have ad-
dressed all of our concerns, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chairwoman, I
yield such time as she may consume to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LOFGREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chairwoman,
I appreciate the thoughtful comments
made by the ranking member, but I do
think this is a special situation, and it
is why the NAACP Legal Defense and
Education Fund is in support of this
amendment.
As the NAACP Legal Defense and
Education Fund has noticed, the prac-
tice of counting prison inmates as part
of the district where the prison is lo-
cated has a disproportionate impact on
African American and Latino commu-
nities. That is because members of
those communities, for a variety of
other bad reasons, are incarcerated at
higher rates and housed at prisons far-
ther from their homes than other com-
munities.
The gentleman from Illinois is cor-
rect. You may be counted in the census
at your university dorm, but you can
also vote from your university dorm.
The inmates can’t vote.
Actually, they are properly allocated
to the communities where they are
from. Doing otherwise has the impact
of disenfranchising communities of
color around the United States, and
that is why this amendment is an im-
portant one and why the Brennan Cen-
ter for Justice and the NAACP sup-
ports it.
I thank the gentleman for offering
the amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2538 March 7, 2019
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chair, I would
just like to add, in 2016 when the cen-
sus in the Federal Register asked for
comment on this, 77,000 people did com-
ment. Only four wanted to keep this
provision. Everyone else wanted to
change this, out of 77,000. That is prob-
ably about the percent of people who
think Nickelback is their favorite band
in this country. It is pretty low.
I think if you look at—if Nickelback
is your favorite band, I apologize to the
gentleman.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Will
the gentleman yield?
Mr. POCAN. Yes, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Why
would the gentleman criticize one of
the greatest bands of the nineties?
Mr. POCAN. Wow. One more reason
why there is a difference between
Democrats and Republicans, clearly
found on the floor of Congress today.
I would argue, when I look at the
small communities in Wisconsin and I
would probably argue in Illinois, where
there are correctional facilities, those
populations really do bloom because of
the people who are incarcerated there,
but almost no one goes back to that
community. So this is a much better
and more accurate way to have a cen-
sus. I hope that it will be supported,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chairwoman, I stand here to
say that my colleague from Wisconsin,
I know he did not mean to offend the
many thousands, upon thousands of
Nickelback fans in his district in Wis-
consin. I will stand here to save you
from doing that and having to face the
political consequences at the ballot
box.
Madam Chair, I enjoyed debating
back and forth and it is always good to
have some good humor on the floor of
the House. And, yes, I actually do have
a Nickelback song on my running
playlist that I listen to on a regular
basis.
I was ridiculed for that when I posted
my playlist one time, and I know some
in this Chamber—even up at the dais—
are still laughing about that.
But this amendment is a bad amend-
ment. I wish we could have worked to-
gether on it. I hope we can work to-
gether on any gerrymandering in this
Nation together as we know it, and I
look forward to working with the gen-
tleman in the future.
I do have to recommend a ‘‘no’’ vote
on this amendment because it does not
address the underlying issues with ger-
rymandering, and the underlying issues
that I have with this bill. I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chairwoman, I
will just wrap up by saying I appreciate
that very brave admission of your
fandom for Nickelback. That is very
brave and I do recognize that. I didn’t
think we were going to talk about
Nickelback on the floor today. Some-
how it came up.
Madam Chair, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 38 OFFERED BY MR. POCAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 38 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chairwoman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
In title III of the bill—
(1) redesignate subtitle G as subtitle H
(and conform the succeeding subtitle accord-
ingly); and
(2) insert after subtitle F the following new
subtitle:
Subtitle G—Use of Voting Machines
Manufactured in the United States
SEC. 3601. USE OF VOTING MACHINES MANUFAC-
TURED IN THE UNITED STATES.
Section 301(a) of the Help America Vote
Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081(a)), as amended by
section 1504, is amended by adding at the end
the following new paragraph:
‘‘(8) VOTING MACHINE REQUIREMENTS.—By
not later than the date of the regularly
scheduled general election for Federal office
occurring in November 2022, each State shall
seek to ensure that any voting machine used
in such election and in any subsequent elec-
tion for Federal office is manufactured in
the United States.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Wisconsin.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chairwoman, I
rise today to offer an amendment that
I think everyone in this Chamber can
support. Whenever possible, voting ma-
chines used in America should be made
in America.
Aside from the obvious that it just
makes sense to have the infrastructure
of American democracy made in Amer-
ica, this amendment seeks to help safe-
guard our elections. Manufacturing
voting machines in America will en-
sure that production lines are secure,
and that we know without a doubt
whether or not our voting machines
have been compromised.
Today’s amendment simply requires
States to seek to ensure that any vot-
ing machine used in any election for
Federal office is a machine that is
made in this country. The deadline for
this requirement would be the 2022
election.
Madam Chair, I believe that the in-
tent of this amendment is clear. I an-
ticipate strong support from my col-
leagues, and for that reason I will stop
here, urge the Chamber to vote in favor
of this amendment, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposi-
tion to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I thank my good friend
from Wisconsin. I didn’t know if he
wanted to mention Creed this time or
not, but we can have a great debate on
nineties music, if you like. But I do
want the gentleman to come over and
see my playlist after this is done. We
will have some fun.
I am opposed to this amendment be-
cause American manufacturing em-
ploys more than 12 million men and
women, contributes $2.25 trillion to the
U.S. economy annually, has the largest
economic impact of any major sector,
and accounts for more than three-quar-
ters of all private-sector research and
development in the Nation. I support
American manufacturing whole-
heartedly.
However, my good friend’s amend-
ment is not about American manufac-
turing. It is about the many com-
plaints that I have had regarding H.R.
1—and I have already stated—about
Federal overreach in mandating States
to comply with a requirement that is
within their jurisdiction.
This bill continues to burden the
American taxpayer by adding programs
that would be footed by everyday
Americans and would have to be paid
for by county governments, by local
governments, and municipalities that
already have budgets that are
stretched too thin. It is another un-
funded mandate. It is another unfunded
mandate from the Federal Govern-
ment.
Unnecessary regulations of election
equipment also present an undue bur-
den on the States who administer these
elections. This requirement gives State
and local officials less options. This is
ultimately a federalism issue. We be-
lieve that our State and local govern-
ments can maintain safe, secure elec-
tions that allow every one of their con-
stituents, our constituents, to vote,
and also ensure that every single
American who is eligible to vote has
their vote counted and has their vote
protected. That is our goal.
H.R. 1 doesn’t accomplish this goal,
and much to my chagrin, I say to my
friend from Wisconsin, I am opposed to
this amendment, although I am not op-
posed to him.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chairwoman, I
yield such time as she may consume to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LOFGREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chairwoman,
I support this amendment, given the
level of foreign interference in the elec-
tions in 2016 and 2018 and efforts to pen-
etrate our voting systems. I think it
makes sense that we use American-
manufactured systems as well as soft-
ware. But I would note this: this
amendment is not proscriptive. It says
that ‘‘States shall seek to ensure.’’
That is not a mandate to do it. Really,
this is saying this is a good thing to do.
I think it is a good thing to do.
While I have the microphone, I would
like to note that we have just received

a letter from 27 religious institutions,
including the Alliance of Baptists, Af-
rican American Ministers In Action,
the National Council of Churches, the
NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social
Justice and the Presbyterian Church in
the United States, in favor of H.R. 1,
which I include in the RECORD.
MARCH 6, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: As national faith-
based advocates and congregations we urge
passage of H.R. 1—the For the People Act.
Our organizations strive for policies and sys-
tems that diminish inequality, support the
most vulnerable, nurture human potential,
and protect the health and well-being of all
members of our society and of creation. We
look to our government to reflect those
ideals and we support a strong democracy:
. . . where voting is a fundamental right
and a civic responsibility.
. . . that serves the people rather than the
private interests of public officials and
wealthy political donors.
. . . where our influence is based on the
force of ideas, not the size of our wallets.
. . . where people know who is trying to
gain influence over our representatives, who
is trying to influence our votes, and how and
why policy is being made.
. . . that works to respond to the needs of
all people and their communities, building
trust in governance and equity.
A broken democracy has clear and detri-
mental impacts on the issues important to
us. We are faithful advocates who work with-
in the existing political system, yet that sys-
tem no longer seems capable of contending
with the big problems facing our country,
our communities, and our congregations.
The faith community offers witness to what
is obvious to most Americans: our democ-
racy is out of balance.
The current system allows powerful cor-
porate and wealthy interests to regularly
defy the foundational principles of fairness,
equity, ethics, accountability, and respect
for the rule of law. The unfortunate result is
that our government has become more re-
sponsive and accountable to wealthy polit-
ical donors than to the public. Today’s bro-
ken democratic system subjugates deeply
held, age-old values to the profit motive.
People of faith know that Washington is
not representing their best interests when
millions of Americans who are eligible to
vote cannot do so because they are not reg-
istered, voter ID laws are used as a tool to
suppress the vote, millions of Americans are
disenfranchised due to a felony conviction,
and a number of states are improperly purg-
ing eligible voters from the registration
rolls.
People of faith know that Washington is
not representing their best interests when
congressional districts are drawn to achieve
highly partisan results at the expense of fair
representation for citizens.
People of faith know that Washington is
not representing their best interests when
ethics rules governing our highest leaders
and decision-makers are deeply flawed and
are not subject to proper oversight and en-
forcement.
People of faith know that Washington is
more accountable to corporate interests
than to the public when they can spend huge
sums of money influencing our elections and
our government.
People of faith know that we can’t fix the
issues that the faith community cares about
the most—such as poverty, immigration, cli-
mate change, racial justice and health care—
until we fix our democracy.
To that end, the undersigned national faith
organizations support H.R. 1, The For the
People Act.
We recognize the historic opportunity our
country faces to repair our political system
and, as people of faith, we are hopeful in the
possibility of renewal.
We applaud efforts to reform our election
processes and our governing politics so that
the interests of all are served, not just those
with money.
We support attempts to restore ethical
norms which inhibit self-interested corrup-
tion on the part of lawmakers.
We support provisions that enhance the in-
fluence of low-income and middle-income
people on policy-making through their vote
and their engagement in the civic body.
We support campaign finance reforms that
sustain and encourage elected officials to
serve their constituents and to legislate on
behalf of the common good.
We embrace reforms that favor account-
ability and transparency in our government
and in our lawmakers’ decision-making.
We urge Congress to seize this moment to
pass the comprehensive democracy reform

Madam Chairwoman, again, this
amendment, I am opposed to because I
believe it is Federal overreach, but I do
want to address an issue. As we can
see, this would require American man-
ufacturers to begin producing even
more pieces of equipment that would
then have to comply by the standards
of this amendment, which is fine.
I am all for creating American jobs,
but we also have a problem with the
underlying bill. I tried to pass an
amendment in the only markup that
happened on this now almost-700-page
bill. The amendment would have made
sure that anyone who helped craft this
bill, especially the special interest
groups who were recognized on the day
this bill was introduced and announced
at a press conference, people who
helped write this bill should have to
sign a document that says that they
will not profit from this.
What doesn’t happen is, if somebody
who helped craft this bill decides to
open a manufacturing facility and
make money off of the legislation, we
need to know that. Because that
amendment did not pass during the
markup process, we won’t know if that
happens.
I would love to work with my col-
league from Wisconsin to put a provi-
sion in place like that, and at that
point in time this may be an amend-
ment I could support.
Before we talk about any more nine-
ties music, I am going to yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chairwoman, I
can assure my colleague, I do not plan
on going into the voting machine busi-
ness so he doesn’t have to worry about
me anyway. I don’t think anyone in
this body will.
I do urge all of my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment, and I yield back
the balance of my time.

Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of my amendment, which is
aimed at ensuring that a voter is not
confused or misled by a bad ballot de-
sign that could lead to that voter over-
looking a race—that is called an
undervote—or even voting for the
wrong candidate.
I want to explain the problem,
Madam Chair, and then what I suggest
is the remedy because, unfortunately, I
have seen a bad ballot design basically
cause chaos in my home State of Flor-
ida in two recent past elections.
First, I want to go back to the 2000
Presidential race, Gore v. Bush, where
a very—unfortunately, a famous—poor-
ly designed butterfly ballot confused
voters in Palm Beach County. Many el-
derly citizens who thought they were
voting for Al Gore actually voted for
Pat Buchanan.
Why was this significant? Because we
had a Presidential race where 6 million
voters voted and it was decided by 500-
plus votes, and Pat Buchanan got an
unexpected 3,400 votes in a very liberal
Palm Beach County.
Then, again, just recently in the 2018
midterms, again, in a very close Senate
race, this time a race that was about a
12,000-vote margin, more than 30,000
voters in Broward County did not make

a choice in a U.S. Senate race. It is ar-
guable that this is because the Senate
candidates’ names were under a set of
long instructions, and according to ex-
perts, people don’t read long instruc-
tions, and then they overlooked this
Senate race.
So this amendment makes a good at-
tempt to remedy this situation. It
would allow States to use the election
assistance grants that are now being
authorized by H.R. 1 to improve ballot
designs. Although our Election Assist-
ance Commission publishes best prac-
tices and guidelines how to design a
good ballot, these guidelines are vol-
untary, and local election administra-
tors often face difficulties in trying to
translate the best practices into the
real world.
So with the funds provided by this
amendment, States will be allowed to
use their election assistance grants to
create programs to train workers, re-
search, model, and implement ballots
designed by the best practices. This
promises Americans the chance to cast
their vote for their intended candidate.
We have seen problems with bad bal-
lots. They are not just theoretical hic-
cups. They can and will, literally,
swing elections.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to
this.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I thank my friend and
colleague from Florida and fellow 2012
election year classmate.
We want to make sure every vote is
counted. We want to make sure that
every eligible voter in this country is
registered, casts their votes, and that
their vote is protected.
I have a lot of faith in the American
people, and I have a lot of faith in the
American voters. I think simple sets of
instructions under, above, or below a
race may or may not be a consider-
ation in whether or not somebody de-
cides to vote.
I find it ironic that most of the time
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle will blame ballot design, but only
when they lose. The fact that a Repub-
lican won in Florida meant that there
is obviously a ballot issue. The fact
that a Republican won in the 2000 Pres-
idential race, it has got to be a ballot
issue.
Let’s address ballot issues through-
out the country. Let’s make sure that
we have the ability to plan ahead, and
that is what this bill doesn’t do. It
doesn’t plan ahead and allow us to look
at what is the next best, safest voting
technology in the future. This bill will
require paper marked ballots when we
don’t know what may or may not be
safer in the future, but we are going to
limit ourselves now.
Now, my biggest concern with this
amendment is it is another example of
this bill being rushed. If this were a
well-thought-out piece of legislation,
then we wouldn’t need amendments
clarifying the bill’s intent.
This amendment in particular shows
how we should have taken more time
in the markup, and we should have had
more committees that had jurisdiction
mark this bill up instead of the vague
language that is scattered throughout
the bill.
If Members had more than 15 minutes
of questioning—which I had in the one
hearing as the ranking Republican on
the committee, the only committee
that marked this bill up—then we
could have gotten to the bottom of this
vague language.
Madam Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. COLLINS), my colleague.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I just wanted to come down. I
was listening to this debate. Some of it
is good-hearted because, frankly, you
just don’t want to get so frustrated
with a bill that was so rushed with 600-
and-some pages that was not gone
through.
I pointed out on the floor yesterday,
Madam Chair, that there is a part of
this bill that actually does—go back
and read it. The chairwoman of this
great committee, whom I have a lot of
respect for would not have done this, I
believe, if she was allowed to have done
this, but it actually criminalizes keep-
ing a 4-year-old from voting.
Now, this amendment is fine, but it
goes to this issue: Ten committees had
jurisdiction. One of the biggest was the
Judiciary Committee on which I am
the ranking member. We had a hearing,
but no markup—don’t want to get close
to that; Oversight, hearing, no markup.
This is what happens when you rush
bills to the floor.
This is what happens when your
agenda is bigger than the process. This
is what happens when you don’t care
what is on the floor, you just want a
talking point.
If we are going to continue this for 2
years, fine. The American people will
see through this. But I think my rank-
ing member from committee is correct.
You cannot continue to do this and
people not figure out we are not sure
what is going on anymore.
This is a frustrating point with this
because some of this could have been
caught. We probably still wouldn’t
have agreed on much of this. Some of
this bill is actually good, Supreme
Court ethics and some other things in
here we could have worked on.
But when you come to the floor like
this and you don’t mark it up and you
do it like this, this is what you get: the
hope of a lot of amendments to clarify,
the hope of a lot of amendments to
change.
Just do the work of committee. That
is what I don’t understand.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, Mr. COLLINS is showing,
once again, that in the immortal words
of the best-selling band of the 2000s,
Nickelback, if today was your last day,
I would always yield to my good friend
from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS).
Vote ‘‘no.’’
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Chair, I just
want to say that this amendment is
very simple.
You do not want elections with aster-
isks. Voters should be able to vote for
the candidate they intend to vote for.
There should be no confusion because
of the ballot.
Madam Chair, I yield such time as
she may consume to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LOFGREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of the amendment.
This amendment clarifies that the
election administration improvement
grants that are in the bill may be used
by localities or the States to imple-
ment and model best practices for bal-
lot design, ballot instructions, and, I
will say, testing of ballots, which is
very important.
Most of the grants are really oriented
towards computer systems, which is
also very important, but I have seen
some of these ballots where you could
see why you could get confused; and,
really, if you look at our friends in the
tech world, you can design something
so you vote yes or no just by the way
the design is done.
Now, I think most of the ballot mis-
takes—there is no evidence it is by in-
tention; it was just error. But you can
create something so that people make
a mistake.
The last thing we want for the most
precious right that we have is for peo-
ple to make inadvertent errors. We
want people to cast their votes for
whom they choose and then to have
their vote counted for whomever it is
they choose. It is that simple.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentle-
woman for the amendment. I think it
is a good one.
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Chair, I
thank the chairwoman for her com-
ments, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL).
The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. BEYER) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Virginia.
Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I am very pleased
to be able to offer this amendment
with my good friend from the First
District of North Carolina, Mr. G. K.
BUTTERFIELD.
Madam Chair, I am the father of four,
and for the last 40 years I have tried al-
ways to take one of my children into
the voting booth with me until they
got too old, one by one, to come in be-
cause I wanted them to see by example
how important it was to vote.
I tried to show them that this is a
really big deal. Our dinner conversa-
tions for these 40 years have been al-
ways about the world, the country, in-
evitably, then about politics and then
about government, because nothing is
more important to our representative
government than this idea of self-de-
termination, that every one of us has
the obligation to be part of our polit-
ical process.
But, sadly, as we all know, way too
many young people do not participate
in our process. If we get to 10 percent,
11 percent, 12 percent under the age of
29, we are thrilled that they show up.
So their voice is lost far too often.
So our amendment simply authorizes
$25 million, over the next 2 years, in
grant money to be issued to the Elec-
tion Assistance Commission, and that
is for them to give to eligible States
money to be used to carry out plans,
policies, and programs to increase
youth involvement in elections. It does
things like encourage States to imple-
ment methods to promote the
preregistration of young voters.
I know this is probably already part
of the bill itself, the requirement for
preregistration, but in the 20 States
that have it that you can register at
age 15 or 16—not vote until you are 18—
but if you do that, then you get a much
higher voter participation.
It petitions States to modify the cur-
riculum of secondary schools to pro-
mote civic engagement and activities
to inspire young people to engage.
Madam Chair, I try to accept every
invitation that I get from a high school
to come be part of their classes. I came
to 84 high school graduations when I
was Lieutenant Governor because I get
so discouraged when not just kids, but
even adults don’t know the names of
their Governor or their U.S. Senators
or certainly not their Congressman,
and they have no idea how the Con-
stitution works and how valuable it is.
We have to educate them, and this is
a small investment in encouraging
States to provide those curricula and
others that can make it. They need
substantive opportunities to partici-
pate in our political process and con-
tributing to practical solutions.
Madam Chair, I feel deeply, if you
can give good practice to kids, that
will lead to good habits, good habits to
good character, and as we all know,
character is destiny.
So this small, humble amendment
simply authorizes the Appropriations
Committee to invest $25 in the Election
Assistance Commission to help get our
kids involved in politics at the best and
young ages.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I rise in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I appreciate my col-
league from Virginia offering this
amendment. I know he misspoke when
he said $25 is being authorized in this
amendment. It is actually $25 million
that is being authorized.
That is my biggest hang-up with the
bill. We have got a lot of pressing
things in this country that $25 million
can be spent on: infrastructure
projects, pediatric cancer research, and
putting it towards curing Alzheimer’s,
ALS, what have you, a lot of other pri-
orities. We don’t need a Federal pro-
gram that is going to potentially cost
$25 million to do what States, local-
ities, and local organizations are doing
right now.
I commend the gentleman for want-
ing to get more young people involved.
I have got 18-year-olds. I sometimes
wish they were a little more interested
in what was happening at all levels of
government, but that comes with time.
It is interesting the gentleman talks
about being around the dinner table
with family talking about what it
means to serve and what it means to
enact policy. That is how I got here.
b 1515
I am the son of a 16-year-old who
walked into a fast-food restaurant and
then never left and is going to cele-
brate 60 years with the same company
this year. Because he had a dream to
own his own restaurant one day, my
dad was able to move us to Illinois and
achieve the American Dream.
He and my mom, a high school drop-
out, taught me around the dinner table
how decisions in Washington and in
Springfield, Illinois, affected their abil-
ity to hire people at their local McDon-
ald’s in Taylorville, Illinois.
That is what got me interested in
politics. That is what got me inter-
ested in government. Much to the cha-
grin of some on the other side of the
aisle and some on my own side of the
aisle, that is probably why I am here.
We want to encourage young people,
but that encouragement happens
around the dinner table. It happens al-
ready, and it shouldn’t cost $25 million.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I yield to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LOFGREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I com-
mend Mr. BEYER and Mr. BUTTERFIELD
for this amendment providing grants.
Over the period of time that the bill
covers, this is actually a pretty small
amount of money, and it is subject to
appropriations.
I do think it is difficult to put a price
on our democracy. We need to make
sure that young people are involved
from the get-go. We have seen that
young people don’t necessarily have
the tools to become engaged in our de-
mocracy.
It is fine if our ranking member gave
his instruction to his twins around the
dinner table. I commend him for that.
But not every person in America has
been so fortunate, and we need every
American to participate.
I would like to say that this amend-
ment, coupled with Mr. AL GREEN’s
amendment for the pilot project and
Mr. NEGUSE’s amendment, which will
come later in the proceedings, really
does put on the agenda outreach to the
young people of America to participate
in our democracy.
I know that there are people on both
sides of the aisle who have concerns
about changing the voting age in this
bill and want to study that further. For

those people, these amendments are
going to create vigorous outreach to
the young people of America so they
can be participants, and I commend the
gentlemen for offering it.
Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, may I inquire how much
time I have left.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 3 minutes remaining.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I appreciate the chair-
person offering her support for this
amendment. She mentioned it is tough
to put a price on democracy. That is
exactly what H.R. 1 is doing.
The price of democracy in every sin-
gle congressional district, for every
single candidate running for Congress,
is now, according to this bill, $4.5 mil-
lion in corporate money and, eventu-
ally, taxpayer dollars. That is the price
of democracy that my Democratic col-
leagues have put into every Member of
Congress’ campaign coffers if this bill
goes through.
The price of democracy should be the
freedoms that we enjoy on the floor of
this great institution to be able to de-
bate back and forth. The price of de-
mocracy should not be legislated at
$4.5 million for each and every Member
of Congress who is blessed enough to
serve in this institution.
Madam Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. COLLINS), my good friend.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I appreciate the chair here, and
I do want to follow up on that.
I think the price of democracy has
actually been paid by the blood, sweat,
death, and lives of those who have
fought for this country for over 200-
something years.
That is the price of democracy. Those
of us who have seen it in Iraq and other
places, while serving there, understand
that.
It is not found in a 600-page bill being
rushed to the floor, not going through
markup. Let’s at least be very honest
about that.
I appreciate the gentleman wanting
to involve others in that. I appreciate
wanting to make sure that we have
young people’s involvement. But we
are also, frankly, as Members of this
body, given a great opportunity.
There is not a high school, elemen-
tary school, or middle school in this
country that would turn us away. We
can go anytime we are in our district
workweeks and encourage those teach-
ers who are trying every day to teach
them reading, writing, and civic re-
sponsibility. That is what our jobs give
us the ultimate privilege of doing.
I appreciate the chairwoman of the
committee saying that we are going to
have vigorous outreach. She just said:
Well, $25 million spread over the life of
this bill is not that much.
It is either a lot of outreach or it is
a little bit of money or really, frankly,
it is neither. It is just a feel-good to
make sure that we are getting people
involved, which we should be doing.
I don’t think I want to join in an at-
tack on teachers, who are trying their
best to instill civics, by saying we are
not doing it well enough, and we are
going to give a little bit of money
spread out very thinly across the coun-
try to do something that our teachers
strive every day in classrooms to do.
I respect the work of those teachers
who are doing that, and I think Mem-
bers of Congress ought to be able to go
in and do what we do, take our office
and go to the very ones who we are en-
couraging to show them that we are
human, that we do understand, that we
listen, and we answer all their ques-
tions, no matter how small or how
large those questions are.
It is one of the greatest joys that I
have, going to these schools each and
every time I can and listening to them
and saying: You can do this.
I was once an intern here, and I share
that story. When they come to my of-
fice, they can see that.
That is what it takes.
I appreciate the gentleman’s intent. I
have never questioned his intent. I
want to see this happen as well. But it
also happens many times in this body.
We believe money and a little bit of
conversation has it.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, may I in-
quire how much time I have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Virginia has 30 seconds remain-
ing.
Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I want to
say that all we are doing is giving the
Appropriations Committee the flexi-
bility to do this. We are going to spend
over $700 billion on defense for people
fighting for our democracy. We can
spend a tiny, tiny fraction of that to
make sure that American citizens un-
derstand what they are fighting for.
This is a really important thing.
By the way, it is never an attack on
teachers. Every teacher I have talked
to would like more resources so they
can do their job more effectively.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 45 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF
MARYLAND
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 45 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 136, beginning line 2, strike ‘‘, except
that’’ and all that follows through ‘‘Sun-
days’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Let me first start by thanking Mr.
CRIST of Florida for cosponsoring this
amendment. I also want to recognize
the work of my good friend from Mary-
land, JOHN SARBANES, on the under-
lying bill and his efforts to make our
democracy work for the people.
My amendment would guarantee ac-
cess to early voting during every day of
the week, including Sundays, to every
American.
Early voting makes voting more con-
venient by providing Americans with
greater flexibility and opportunity to
cast a ballot. More and more Ameri-
cans are taking advantage of early vot-
ing, with more than 40 million citizens
casting ballots before election day last
year.
But guaranteeing fair and flexible
early voting on Sundays is not just a
matter of convenience. It is critical for
minority voters who disproportion-
ately take advantage of Sunday early
voting and often face higher barriers
and disparate burdens when deciding to
cast a ballot: lost pay, childcare ex-
penses, transit costs.
In my State and in States across the
country, churches promote ‘‘take your
souls to the polls’’ programs that take
church parishioners from Sunday serv-
ices to the voting booth. So cuts to
Sunday early voting, as we have wit-
nessed across this country, have had a
negative impact, especially on commu-
nities of color.
Six States have cut back on early
voting, and even more have tried but
were blocked by the courts.
In North Carolina, lawmakers delib-
erately cut Sunday voting, saying 6
days of voting in one week is enough.
But this action was struck down be-
cause, as the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals noted, it targeted African
Americans with almost surgical preci-
sion.
Our democracy doesn’t work if we
don’t give people the fullest oppor-
tunity to make their voices heard. We
should make it easier for people to
vote, not harder, and this amendment
does exactly that.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I claim the time in oppo-
sition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, personally, Sunday
mornings are sacred for me and my
family and for a lot of other people,
too, including those public servants
who work the polls on early voting.
But this isn’t about Sunday or any
other day. It is about my colleagues
dictating to States and local officials
on how they should run their elections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2543
March 7, 2019
State and local election officials
know their voters best and what works
for them. This amendment is yet an-
other example of the Federal Govern-
ment trying to push a one-size-fits-all
standard on States and localities.
I don’t believe the Federal Govern-
ment should be mandating to States
how to run their elections, even to the
minute details such as polling hours,
especially because, I guess, in my home
State, it already happens.
When you look at my district, they
have early voting hours on Sundays, so
I don’t know how widespread the prob-
lem is since it already happens in Illi-
nois. It seems like another top-down
approach that could adversely affect
some communities, especially rural
communities, that may not be able to
afford to have a polling place open on
Sundays.
It is a problem with the entire bill.
The costs keep going up and up and up
on our local officials without a lot of
certainty that funds are going to flow
to help them with that.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, in an ideal world, perhaps, we
don’t mandate from the Federal Gov-
ernment, but when the Fourth Circuit
determines that the North Carolina
Legislature did it to target African
Americans with almost surgical preci-
sion in eliminating Sunday voting, it is
time for action at the Federal level so
we can ensure every American has the
right to vote.
Madam Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. CRIST), my friend and a
cosponsor of this amendment.
Mr. CRIST. Madam Chair, I thank
my friend, the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN), for his leadership on
this issue.
Souls to the Polls is a bedrock of
Florida elections. For my colleagues
who may be unfamiliar, minority com-
munities, particularly African Amer-
ican and Latino, use Sunday early vot-
ing to energize their communities to
make their voices heard. For those
without reliable transportation or with
unpredictable work schedules, Sunday
voting is critical and sacred.
This is how a healthy democracy
should work, communities organizing
themselves to increase participation,
doing their civic duty. Higher turnout
and greater participation strengthen
our democracy, giving elected leaders a
stronger, more representative voice.
Unfortunately, some States have tar-
geted Sunday Souls to the Polls voting.
My own State tried to shut it down in
2012.
This amendment would block States
from using voter suppression tactics
against Souls to the Polls.
I urge my colleagues to support the
Brown-Crist amendment and let the
underlying bill pass.
Let’s refresh our democracy, for the
people.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I have kind of said all I
need to say about this amendment, so
while I have a few extra minutes, I un-
derstand the chairperson has received
an estimate from a joint committee re-
garding how much this new corporate
funding program for congressional
campaigns will bring into the Federal
Government over the next 10 years.
First, I would love to see a copy of
that, now that we are only 1 day away
from voting on this bill. This is eerily
similar to the games that my col-
leagues across the aisle played with the
Congressional Budget Office score. I
will remind them once again that we
still don’t have a figure of how much
this section of H.R. 1 will cost Amer-
ican taxpayers.
Second, if we look at the potential
cost of the 6-to-1 government match
program and the Presidential campaign
matching program, these together
could represent billions and billions of
dollars every election cycle.
Now, what you will hear from the
other side is that, if they don’t have
the funds for these programs, the caps
for these programs would uniformly be
lowered. What that means is that ei-
ther the programs will die or my coun-
terparts across the aisle are going to
turn to taxpayer dollars to ask us to
fulfill what they have claimed as abso-
lutely necessary programs.
What does this sound like to you, a
well-thought-out public policy proposal
or a shell game with American tax dol-
lars?
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LOFGREN), the chair-
woman of the Committee on House Ad-
ministration.
b 1530
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, first, I
would like to thank Congressmen
BROWN and CRIST for an excellent
amendment that improves the bill con-
siderably.
On the point just raised by the rank-
ing member, the report given by the
Joint Committee on Taxation was put
into the RECORD yesterday, and it is
their estimate of how much will be
raised, and their estimate that we will
reduce the deficit by $83 million.
We are waiting; the CBO is crunching
numbers, which is hard to do because
each amendment has to be crunched as
we go along.
But I will say this: During the mark-
up in the House Administration Com-
mittee, we did outline the vessel for
the Freedom From Influence Fund. We
didn’t have the jurisdiction to do the
assessment on criminal wrongdoing by
corporations and tax cheats, but we did
create the Freedom From Influence
Fund, and we did create the step-down
on the program if there is insufficient
funding. So this is not a new thing.
I think it is sound policy.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, how much time do I
have left, if I may inquire?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 3 minutes remaining.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, this is another clear ex-
ample of why this bill needs to be voted
down or put back, preferably put back
to committee.
I am the ranking member of the
House Administration Committee, and
I stood across this floor from my col-
leagues who now use the excuse and
say, Well, it was submitted into the
RECORD yesterday.
There has been a lack of communica-
tion, a lack of bipartisan outreach
from the Democratic side of the aisle,
and this is another example of the
‘‘Keystone-coppish’’ behavior of the
folks that have introduced now an up-
wards of 700-page bill that has not been
marked up, has not been discussed, de-
bated by 40 percent of the committees
that have—by nine other committees
that have jurisdiction over 40 percent
of the bill.
So when I hear the chairperson talk
about jurisdictional issues as to why
she couldn’t discuss this with me in
our markup process, I am wondering
why she couldn’t turn and tap me on
the shoulder, since I was about 6 inches
away, and say, Hey, we don’t have ju-
risdiction, but here is what we esti-
mate this is going to cost.
It just goes to show that this is a
shell game. This is a game that is
going to cost taxpayers billions. This is
a game that we, and the American tax-
payers, are going to have to pay for;
and it is offensive that we have zero
communication.
I have shown time and time again—
we Republicans have offered and sup-
ported bipartisan—supported Democrat
amendments. We have offered the olive
branch of bipartisanship throughout
this process to try and make this bill
better, and we have been shut down by
the Democrats every single time we
have and every step of the way.
This bill is not going to guarantee
that every single American voter who
is eligible to vote has their vote count-
ed and has their vote protected. What
this is going to guarantee is that this
bill is going to be rammed through on
a partisan roll call tomorrow.
This bill is going to cost taxpayers
billions, and we are not going to have
the price tag because the Democrat
majority, who is trying to enrich them-
selves and their own campaigns, the
Democratic majority, who is trying to
keep themselves in a permanent major-
ity, are going to obfuscate, put new
programs, and plans, and charades, and
shell games in place, that are going to
end up costing taxpayers, put more
corporate money into congressional
campaigns and, in turn, break the
American taxpayers under the guise of
election reforms.
Madam Chair, this process is not
what the Democratic majority prom-
ised when they took over. This process
has been riddled with a lack of biparti-
sanship, a lack of transparency, and
special interests helping write this

mammoth, now 700-page bill that is
going to nationalize our election sys-
tems and put billions of dollars into
the campaign coffers of Congressmen

Nation.
That is not what the taxpayers of

ance of my time.

The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 47 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF

port the modification.
The Clerk read as follows:
Modification to amendment No. 47 of-
fered by Mr. BROWN of Maryland:
The amendment is modified to read as fol-
lows:
Page 168, line 3, strike ‘‘before the date of
the election;’’ and insert ‘‘before the date of
the election or the first day of an early vot-
ing period (whichever occurs first);’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection
to the request of the gentleman from
Maryland?
There was no objection.
The Acting CHAIR. The amendment
is modified.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, my amendment would require
States to notify voters of polling loca-
tion changes no later than 7 days prior
to the first day of early voting, pro-
viding every voter as much time as
possible to plan how and when they
will vote, and avoiding last minute
polling place changes that, more often
than not, discourage people from exer-
cising their right to vote.
Research shows that the most impor-
tant factor that impacts whether some-
one votes or not is the location of the
polling place and the effort it takes to
get there.
A 2011 study in the American Polit-
ical Science Review said changing a lo-
cation of a polling place can signifi-
cantly lower voter turnout.
Unfortunately, since 2008, and further
accelerated in 2013, when the Supreme
Court struck down key parts of the
Voting Rights Act, nearly 15,000 polling
places have been closed across the
country; many of them are located in
southern Black communities.
Polling places have been used as po-
litical tools to shape the outcome of
elections for generations, and it con-
tinues to happen today.
Before the 2018 elections, States and
local election boards closed polling
places at colleges and universities, con-
solidated polling places in predomi-
nantly-minority neighborhoods to save
money, and moved polling locations
away from public transportation.
These changes discourage participa-
tion in our democracy, and make our
system of government weaker. That is
why Congress must take action to pro-
tect the rights of the people, to have a
government by the people, for the peo-
ple.
By providing sufficient notice, every
voter can decide whether to cast a vote
on Election Day or, as this bill pro-
vides, take advantage of early voting
or no-excuse absentee voting.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I claim the time in oppo-
sition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I am proud to be a cham-
pion for open and fair elections, and en-
couraging all American citizens to par-
ticipate in their fundamental right to
cast their vote.
My challenge to this amendment is
similar to my larger challenges to the
underlying bill. What this amendment
seeks to do is already a Federal re-
quirement and is updating its specific
requirement.
This is a great example of when the
Federal Government steps into legis-
lating something that is outside of its
jurisdiction, and is forced to update its
own legislation.
State and local election officials are
charged with determining how to best
administer fair elections and open elec-
tions for all of their citizens. This in-
cludes notifying them of their polling
place, and of any changes. Federally
mandating details is unnecessary and,
really, not the role of the Federal Gov-
ernment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Sadly,
Madam Chair, in this country there are
far too many States and/or local elec-
tion officials that are not committed
to fair and open elections. And as we
have seen by decisions in courts at
every level, rolling back actions by
State legislatures to change polling
sites, to take away early voting oppor-
tunities, there are some times in the
history of this Nation, and this is one
of them, when it comes to protecting
voting rights, where it is a Federal re-
sponsibility to do so.
In an optimal world, in an optimal
situation, where we had truly free and
fair and open elections, perhaps this
amendment and perhaps even this leg-
islation wouldn’t be required. That is
not the world we live in today, al-
though it is an aspirational place to be.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I again thank my friend
and colleague from the great State of
Maryland for offering the amendment.
Unfortunately, I have to be opposed to
this amendment for the variety of rea-
sons I mentioned.
I believe in the greatness of America.
I believe we have a great system where
other countries from around this globe
only wish they could choose their own
leaders, like Americans get the oppor-
tunity to do so.
We have a system of federalism. We
have a system that, I believe, works
best from the bottom up; and I believe
a top-down approach, that this 700-page
mammoth bill will provide for our
local election officials, will hinder
them, and cost them, and stop them
from being able to administer the best,
most open elections they possibly can.
I have a lot of faith in the county
election officials that are operating in
my district, in central and south-
western Illinois. I believe they run a
very fair election process. I want to
give them the tools and the flexibility
to meet the needs of my constituents
and our constituents; and the Federal
Government doesn’t need to be the
voice to do so. Our local officials can
do that better.
I am ready to close, so I will just re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LOFGREN), the chair of
the House Administration Committee.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I just
want to say how much I appreciate the
amendment offered by Mr. BROWN. It
improves the bill by making sure that
voters are notified, not just 7 days be-
fore the poll is moved, but before early
voting begins, maximizing the oppor-
tunity to actually get to the poll.
Many Americans, right now, have a
single day to vote, and if you are a
working person, you may not even
have time off, you may not even be
able to get to the polling place. That is
what H.R. 1 is all about.
And just getting to the federalism
issue. Article I, section 4 explicitly
says, ‘‘Congress may at any time by
law make or alter such regulations’’
about Federal elections. That is what
we are doing here.
We need to do more because there are
jurisdictions in our country that are
specifically trying to prevent people
from voting based on race. That is why
we have got the Voting Rights Act that

But this bill just relates to Federal
elections which we have jurisdiction to
do. We need to make sure that the ef-
forts to keep people from exercising
their right to vote in Federal elections
are defeated. That is what H.R. 1 is
about. That is what Mr. BROWN’s

AMENDMENT NO. 48 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF
MARYLAND
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 48 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
This amendment would require a por-
tion of early voting hours to occur out-
side of normal business hours. This
simple, yet effective amendment would
ensure that every working individual
has the opportunity to cast their ballot
without taking time off from work,
having to find child care, or risking
being reprimanded by their employer.
b 1545
While early voting has become in-
creasingly commonplace, States and
localities continue to change and re-
strict hours every election, sometimes
closing as early as 4 p.m., making it
problematic for those whose workdays
may have irregular schedules or are
unable to take time away from work.
Despite State laws guaranteeing
many workers time off to go vote, too
many Americans have neither the lux-
ury of an employer that will give them
time off to vote nor the financial free-
dom to risk losing a few hours’ wages
in order to participate in our democ-
racy. That is why early voting is so im-
portant.
But holding early voting during busi-
ness hours is just another way citizens
have been impeded from exercising
their right to vote, particularly mid-
dle-class working Americans in the
service, manufacturing, and other blue-
collar industries. These Americans
often rely on a 9 to 5 schedule and
don’t have the same opportunity to
vote.
To ensure everyone’s voice can be
heard and early voting is convenient
for every American, locations should
remain open well after the traditional
close of business.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I claim the time in oppo-
sition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I have said the same
thing about previous amendments. I
think this is an overreach issue. I don’t
think the Federal Government should
be involved in the minute details of
early voting hours.
States aren’t asking us to set our
hours here in Congress; we shouldn’t,
as the Federal Government, ask our
State and local election officials who
know better how to run free, fair, and
a lot less costly election processes.
We have got a problem in this coun-
try, Madam Chair, with a shortage of
election day workers. We have got a
problem with poll workers.
In my home State of Illinois, every
other year it is a holiday. It hasn’t
helped us get more election workers. It
hasn’t helped us get more poll workers.
What it has done is it has created a
holiday and a day off where many peo-
ple can come vote or they can enjoy
the already open early voting processes
that States like mine have in place and
the opportunities to cast their votes in
a wide variety of ways.
This is another example of a Federal
top-down approach that obviously
shows there is a distinct difference be-
tween my Democrat colleagues and me
and all of us on this side of the aisle.
We believe in a bottom-up approach of
governing; they believe in a top-down
approach.
The bottom-up approach, I believe,
leads to more efficiencies, leads to fair-
er and better and freer elections, and a
top-down approach is nothing but cost-
ly to the taxpayers in unfunded man-
dates.
One thing that really frustrates me
is, if you are going to impose Federal
mandates, you cannot leave States
open to the potential liability because
the mandate is so broad. And that is
exactly what this bill does. That is ex-
actly why I am opposed to this amend-
ment.
Madam Chair, I am ready to close. I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, keeping the same terminology
of ‘‘bottom-up’’ and ‘‘top-down,’’ I
think the Founders contemplated both,
that when it comes to Federal elec-
tions, it would be both a bottom-up and
a top-down.
As my friend from Illinois was re-
minded during the last debate, Article
I, Section 4 says, and I will read it in
its entirety: ‘‘The times, places, and
manner of holding elections for Sen-
ators and Representatives shall be pre-
scribed in each State by the legislature
thereof’’—that sounds like bottom-up
to me—‘‘but the Congress may at any
time by law make or alter such regula-
tions, except as to the places of choos-
ing Senators.’’
I think that is what you would refer
to as a top-down, contemplated by the
Founders, implemented and embraced
here in H.R. 1. Why? So that we can
protect, expand, promote, and defend
the right for every single American to
vote and to make sure it is as conven-
ient and accessible to every American
regardless of race, color, creed, gender,
sexual orientation, or gender identity.
Madam Chair, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I thank my colleague
from Maryland.
You know, like some of the legisla-
tion we pass here, it has to go through
the rulemaking process later. That is
no different than our forefathers and
our Founders of the Constitution.
If you read Alexander Hamilton, he
responds to the concerns that the
power of the national government to
determine the time, places, and man-
ner of elections of the Representatives
of the House might actually, at that
time, result in the elevation of the
wealthy over the mass of citizens.
The fear seems to have been that the
national government may conspire to
hold elections in only parts of the
States populated by the wealthy. That
would presumably prevent lower in-
come citizens from voting.
Hamilton rejected that fear on sev-
eral grounds, including the fact that
such places do not exist, but that the
rich are scattered throughout the
States.
Hamilton argued that every member
of this country should have the right
to vote, but the Federal overreach
should not be something we are actu-
ally encouraging right now.
Let’s look at what our forefathers ac-
tually said about the provisions in the
Constitution, just not using them to
put forth a political agenda.
Madam Chair, I am urging a ‘‘no’’
vote on this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 49 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF
MARYLAND
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 49 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 182, line 21, strike the semicolon and
insert the following: ‘‘, together with a de-
scription of any actions taken in response to
such instances of voter intimidation or sup-
pression;’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, I yield myself as much time as I
may consume.
This amendment will require States
to include in their biannual report to
Congress on the voter information hot-
line statistics to include a description
of any actions taken in response to re-
ports of voter intimidation or suppres-
sion.
Discouraging voter participation
through intimidation or suppression
tactics runs against the very founda-
tion of our democracy, but these tac-
tics continue to play an unfortunate
role in our elections today.
When I ran for Lieutenant Governor
of Maryland in 2010, my opponent hired
a consultant who advised my opponent
that ‘‘. . . the first and most desired
outcome is voter suppression’’ by hav-
ing ‘‘African American voters stay
home.’’
To that end, my opponent made
thousands of election day robocalls to
Democrat voters telling them that
Democrats had won; although, in fact,
the polls were still open for 2 more
hours.
The call told voters: Relax. Every-
thing is fine. The only thing left is to
watch it on TV tonight.
It reached 112,000 voters in majority
African American areas.
This is just one example of the des-
picable tactics that have become com-
monplace in our elections.
We have the responsibility to con-
front these attempts to target individ-
uals and influence whether or not they
vote.
In 2019, too many Americans are still
being harassed, threatened, and barred
from exercising their right to vote. My
amendment will ensure election offi-
cials do their job by helping voters who
don’t know where to vote, why their
polling place is closed, or why they are
being turned away.
This is an essential element to make
our elections more free, more fair, and
will help safeguard the integrity of our
elections by holding election officials
accountable for protecting every citi-
zen’s right to vote.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to
the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, this amendment would
have the effect of the Federal Govern-
ment compiling statistics without con-
text and without vetting on very seri-
ous criminal matters. Unless there was
some sort of follow-up on the reports,
it could actually do more harm than
good.
I am also afraid that certain partisan
organizations could take advantage of
this. So bear with me. Let’s talk
through this and let’s see how this
would work.
People call into this hotline, submit
allegations of serious crimes, and then
it is sent to the State and now the Fed-
eral Government. Partisan groups who
helped author this bill would then use
statistics from the hotline to then
bring unverified lawsuits under the
new third-party actions that are al-
lowed in this bill.
This is a recipe for disaster. The stat-
ed purpose of H.R. 1 is to increase
transparency in politics, but instead,
unfortunately, this provision would
only invite corruption.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, turning back to the amendment,
what the amendment does is it simply
holds local election officials account-
able and to be responsive to the claims,
the calls, the concerns that are raised
to them regarding voter intimidation,
voter suppression, ensuring that when
they are collecting that information,
that they also report on what the re-
sponse is to the claims that are made.
Madam Chair, I yield the balance of
my time to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LOFGREN), chair of the
House Administration Committee.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I
would like to commend the gentleman
for this amendment.
When you make a phone call in to
complain about harassment or intimi-
dation, that information may or may
not ever become known, so this is real-
ly a pro-transparency measure.
The amendment says: ‘‘together with
a description of actions taken in re-
sponse to such instances of voter in-
timidation or suppression.’’
The State legislatures may not
know, we may not know how many ef-
forts are being made. We should know
that to see whether what we have done
here is sufficient, whether the Voting
Rights Act that will be following along
this bill later in the spring needs to ad-
dress this.
Madam Chair, this is an excellent
amendment.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I believe the EAC, Elec-
tion Assistance Commission, is sup-
posed to track this information.
The key point, too, that I made ear-
lier is that there is no verification, and
that is a problem with this amend-
ment. It is a problem with the bill.
There are no protections for bad behav-
ior.
This is why we tried to get rid of bal-
lot harvesting. It was why the amend-
ment was offered in committee. I
mean, we have already seen what bad
actors can do.
It cost taxpayers hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars in North Carolina, and
they have to run a new special elec-
tion, but that is okay because that
may not have been a crime in Cali-
fornia. But that is all right. The Demo-
crats didn’t want to accept that be-
cause they might like the process
somewhere else.
I think what is wrong is wrong and
we ought to be able to have protec-
tions. I am not convinced that the
American people have the protections
that they need and that they deserve to
stop what happened in North Carolina
from happening somewhere else.
This is another example of overreach,
another example of something already
happening, already existing agencies
that should be compiling this informa-
tion; and there are no safeguards and
there will be no verification of allega-
tions, and that is unfortunate.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, may I inquire how much time I
have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland has 11⁄2 minutes remain-
ing.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, the issue raised by the gen-
tleman from Illinois is neither helped
nor harmed by this amendment. He
raises an issue that we can take up per-
haps another day.
But what this bill simply does is it
requires that local elected officials be
responsive and report on the responses
they take to claims of intimidation
and suppression.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, we would love to take up
ballot harvesting today, too, but, un-
fortunately, we are not given the
chance to. The Democrats voted it
down in the only markup that we had,
the smallest committee in Congress, 5
hours last week, with 40 percent of the
bill not going through regular order,
not going through the committee proc-
ess.
This is not a process that has been
open. It is not a process that has been
transparent. It is not a process that
has been bipartisan.
Clearly, we have accepted many
Democrat amendments on our side. Not
one single Republican amendment has
been accepted by the Democrat side.
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

CONDEMNING ANTI-SEMITISM AND
ANTI-MUSLIM DISCRIMINATION
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 183) condemning anti-
Semitism as hateful expressions of in-
tolerance that are contradictory to the
values and aspirations that define the
people of the United States and con-
demning anti-Muslim discrimination
and bigotry against minorities as hate-
ful expressions of intolerance that are
contrary to the values and aspirations
of the United States, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 183
Whereas the first amendment to the Con-
stitution established the United States as a
country committed to the principles of toler-
ance and religious freedom, and the 14th
amendment to the Constitution established
equal protection of the laws as the heart of
justice in the United States;
Whereas adherence to these principles is
vital to the progress of the American people
and the diverse communities and religious
groups of the United States;
Whereas whether from the political right,
center, or left, bigotry, discrimination, op-
pression, racism, and imputations of dual
loyalty threaten American democracy and
have no place in American political dis-
course;
Whereas white supremacists in the United
States have exploited and continue to ex-
ploit bigotry and weaponize hate for political
gain, targeting traditionally persecuted peo-
ples, including African Americans, Latinos,
Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pa-
cific Islanders and other people of color,
Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, the LGBTQ
community, immigrants, and others with
verbal attacks, incitement, and violence;
Whereas the Reverend Martin Luther King,
Jr., taught that persecution of any American
is an assault on the rights and freedoms of
all Americans;
Whereas on August 11 and 12, 2017, self-
identified neo-Confederates, white national-
ists, neo-Nazis, and Ku Klux Klansmen held
white supremacist events in Charlottesville,
Virginia, where they marched on a syna-
gogue under the Nazi swastika, engaged in
racist and anti-Semitic demonstrations and
committed brutal and deadly violence
against peaceful Americans;
Whereas a white nationalist murdered nine
African American worshipers at the Emanuel
African Methodist Episcopal Church in
Charleston, South Carolina, on the evening
of June 17, 2015, in the hopes of igniting a na-
tionwide race war;
Whereas on October 27, 2018, the perpe-
trator of the deadliest attack on Jewish peo-
ple in the history of the United States killed
11 worshippers at the Tree of Life Synagogue
building in Pittsburgh and reportedly stated
that he ‘‘wanted all Jews to die’’;
Whereas anti-Semitism is the centuries-old
bigotry and form of racism faced by Jewish
people simply because they are Jews;
Whereas in 2017 the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation reported a 37 percent increase in
hate crimes against Jews or Jewish institu-
tions and found that attacks against Jews or
Jewish institutions made up 58.1 percent of
all religious-based hate crimes;
Whereas there is an urgent need to ensure
the safety and security of Jewish commu-
nities, including synagogues, schools, ceme-
teries, and other institutions;
Whereas Jews are the targets of anti-Se-
mitic violence at even higher rates in many
other countries than they are in the United
States;
Whereas it is a foreign policy priority of
the United States to monitor and combat
anti-Semitism abroad;
Whereas anti-Semitism includes blaming
Jews as Jews when things go wrong; calling
for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harm-
ing of Jews in the name of a radical ideology
or extremist view of religion; or making
mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or
stereotyped allegations about Jews;
Whereas Jewish people are subject in the
media and political campaigns to numerous
other dangerous anti-Semitic myths as well,
including that Jews control the United
States Government or seek global, political,
and financial domination and that Jews are
obsessed with money;
Whereas scapegoating and targeting of
Jews in the United States have persisted for
many years, including by the Ku Klux Klan,
the America First Committee, and by mod-
ern neo-Nazis;
Whereas accusing Jews of being more loyal
to Israel or to the Jewish community than
to the United States constitutes anti-Semi-
tism because it suggests that Jewish citizens
cannot be patriotic Americans and trusted
neighbors, when Jews have loyally served
our Nation every day since its founding,
whether in public or community life or mili-
tary service;
Whereas accusations of dual loyalty gen-
erally have an insidious and pernicious his-
tory, including—
(1) the discriminatory incarceration of
Americans of Japanese descent during World
War II on their basis of race and alleged dual
loyalty;
(2) the Dreyfus affair, when Alfred Dreyfus,
a Jewish French artillery captain, was false-
ly convicted of passing secrets to Germany
based on his Jewish background;
(3) when the loyalty of President John F.
Kennedy was questioned because of his
Catholic faith; and
(4) the post-9/11 conditions faced by Mus-
lim-Americans in the United States, includ-
ing Islamophobia and false and vicious at-
tacks on and threats to Muslim-Americans
for alleged association with terrorism;
Whereas anti-Muslim bigotry entails preju-
dicial attitudes towards Muslims and people
who are perceived to be Muslim, including
the irrational belief that Muslims are inher-
ently violent, disloyal, and foreign;
Whereas Muslims and people perceived to
be Muslim are subjected to false and dan-
gerous stereotypes and myths including un-
fair allegations that they sympathize with
individuals who engage in violence or terror
or support the oppression of women, Jews,
and other vulnerable communities;
Whereas in 2017, mosques were bombed in
Bloomington, Minnesota, and burned in Aus-
tin, Texas, Victoria, Texas, Bellevue, Wash-
ington, and Thonotosassa, Florida, and mass
attacks on Muslim communities were
planned against communities in Islamberg,
New York, in 2019, Jacksonville, Florida, in
2017, and Garden City, Kansas, in 2016;
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion reported that hate crimes against Mus-
lims or Muslim institutions in the United
States increased by over 99 percent between
2014 and 2016;
Whereas attacks motivated by bigotry
against those who are Muslim or perceived
to be Muslim have substantially increased
since the September 11, 2001, terrorist at-
tacks;
Whereas the violation of an individual’s
civil rights based on his or her actual or per-
ceived membership in a particular religious
group clearly violates the Constitution and
laws of the United States; and
Whereas all Americans, including Jews,
Muslims, and Christians and people of all
faiths and no faith, have a stake in fighting
anti-Semitism, as all Americans have a
stake in fighting every form of bigotry and
hatred against people based on religion, race,
or place of birth and origin: Now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives—
(1) rejects the perpetuation of anti-Semitic
stereotypes in the United States and around
the world, including the pernicious myth of
dual loyalty and foreign allegiance, espe-
cially in the context of support for the
United States-Israel alliance;
(2) condemns anti-Semitic acts and state-
ments as hateful expressions of intolerance
that are contradictory to the values that de-
fine the people of the United States;
(3) reaffirms its support for the mandate of
the United States Special Envoy to Monitor
and Combat Anti-Semitism as part of the
broader policy priority of fostering inter-
national religious freedom and protecting
human rights all over the world;
(4) rejects attempts to justify hatred or
violent attacks as an acceptable expression
of disapproval or frustration over political
events in the Middle East or elsewhere;
(5) acknowledges the harm suffered by
Muslims and others from the harassment,
discrimination, and violence that result
from anti-Muslim bigotry;
(6) condemns anti-Muslim discrimination
and bigotry against all minorities as con-
trary to the values of the United States;
(7) condemns the death threats received by
Jewish and Muslim Members of Congress, in-
cluding in recent weeks;
(8) encourages law enforcement and gov-
ernment officials to avoid conduct that
raises the specter of unconstitutional
profiling against anyone because of their

ment of blame or targeting members of an
entire religious group for increased sus-

vidual or small group of individuals; and

front the reality of anti-Semitism,

bigotry, as well as historical struggles
against them, to ensure that the United
States will live up to the transcendent prin-
ciples of tolerance, religious freedom, and
equal protection as embodied in the Declara-
tion of Independence and the first and 14th
amendments to the Constitution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the resolution under
consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself 5 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of H. Res. 183, which condemns anti-
Semitism unambiguously, as well as
anti-Muslim bigotry and all forms of
prejudice against minorities, as con-
trary to fundamental American values
and principles. This resolution makes
clear that we condemn anti-Semitism,
Islamophobia, and racism no matter
where on the political spectrum they
may emanate from, right, left, or cen-
ter.
This resolution is a statement of our
values as a Nation. While it focuses on
concerns raised in the last few weeks
regarding anti-Semitism and
Islamophobia, it addresses those nox-
ious forms of bigotry in the context of
our broader concern with all forms of
bigotry and hatred in our country.
Bigotry against members of minority
groups based on their actual or per-
ceived religion, ethnicity, race, or na-
tional origin are among the cardinal
sins of our Nation. As the resolution
notes, tolerance and religious freedom
are among our country’s fundamental
principles, so much so that they are en-
shrined in the very First Amendment
to the Constitution.
Sadly, without constant vigilance,
our Nation has seen darker moments
where religious and other forms of hate
have reared their ugly heads. Often,
our Nation has fallen short of its ideals
when they succumbed to the dema-
goguery of bigots.
Indeed, one of the biggest problems
facing our country today, and one that
has bedeviled it in the past, is the fact
that white supremacists have
weaponized bigotry and hatred to
achieve political gains. They do so by
stoking hatred and division among
Americans based on religion, race, eth-
nicity, or other characteristics.
To combat this, it is imperative that
all of us—but especially those of us in
public life—speak out against such
hate. Unfortunately, sometimes the
perpetrators of religious and other
forms of bigotry are themselves public
figures and even, distressingly, Mem-
bers of this House.
Indeed, in the last few weeks, com-
ments have been made by some of my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle
that can fairly be characterized as
anti-Semitic, and I have condemned
these remarks.
Anti-Semitism is among the most an-
cient of prejudices and is associated
with pernicious stereotypes, including
the claim that Jews exert control over
the government and the global polit-
ical and financial systems, that they
are obsessed with money, and that
their loyalty to their home countries is
somehow in question.
Assertion of these beliefs does not
constitute merely making statements
of political or policy positions. Rather,
propagation of these beliefs has,
throughout history, resulted in harass-
ment, discrimination, violence, and
murder against Jews.
While anti-Semitism is an ancient
prejudice, its effects are not ancient
history. Less than 6 months ago, a gun-
man murdered 11 worshippers at the
Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh,
reportedly stating that he ‘‘wanted all
Jews to die.’’ Nearly 2 years ago in
Charlottesville, Virginia, white su-
premacists chanted, ‘‘Jews will not re-
place us.’’
Despite this ugly history, Members
on both sides have questioned the loy-
alty and patriotism of Members of this
House. The trope that support for
Israel, particularly among Jewish
Americans, is the result of a ‘‘dual loy-
alty’’ to Israel and the United States is
deeply offensive to me.
What I find equally despicable is a
somewhat analogous ‘‘dual loyalty’’
trope increasingly deployed against
Muslim Americans. This includes the
recent implication by one of our col-
leagues that another colleague is a spy
and a State Republican poster in the
West Virginia State capitol that im-
plied an association between that same
colleague and the September 11, 2001,
attacks in New York.
Indeed, statements have repeatedly
been made in the recent past by public
officials, including the President,
which can fairly be characterized as
anti-Muslim more generally.
Particularly since the September 11
attacks, Muslim Americans have faced
a gauntlet of prejudice alleging that
they are inherently violent, disloyal,
and foreign, and this has led to hate-
motivated violence. In 2017, for exam-
ple, at least five mosques were bombed
or burned in various cities around the
country.
Efforts to question the loyalty or pa-
triotism of anyone in this country
based on their religion or on any in-
nate characteristic is completely out
of bounds.
It is my fervent hope that this reso-
lution will be a chance for us, both as
an institution and also as a Nation, to
remind ourselves of what we all believe
in, and to come together and heal.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
voting for this resolution today, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN).
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, at Sunday
school, Jewish kids learn the imperish-
able words of Hillel, who said: If I am
not for myself, who will be for me? But
if I am for myself only, then who am I?
And if not now, when?
Today, we must all stand strongly
and proudly for ourselves and our com-
munities, but we must also stand in
strong solidarity with other people and
their communities. We must act now
because in America and in nations all
over the world, anti-Semitism, anti-
Muslim bigotry, and other forms of
racism and intolerance are sharply on
the rise.
These old and lethal poisons are not
only a threat to individual Jews and
Muslims and African Americans and
Hispanic Americans and Asian Ameri-
cans and Native Americans walking
down the street, and to our children
playing at school, they are the com-
mon enemy of liberal democracy,
which depends upon tolerance and plu-
ralism to survive.
As the world’s oldest liberal democ-
racy and a thriving multiracial and
multicultural society, America must
reject the myths and stereotypes and
libels and tropes that make up these
ancient hatreds.
Anti-Semitism and racism are the
gateway to destruction for everything
that we believe in as a society. They
are a threat to the values of our con-
stitutional creed: pluralism and toler-
ance, religious freedom and freedom of
association, equal protection for all
citizens.
Let us stand up today for our most
hard-won American ideals, and let us
vote for this resolution condemning
racism and anti-Muslim bigotry and
other forms of racism and intolerance.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I don’t know where to begin. I really
don’t. As Members of Congress duly
elected by a constituency to serve in
this body, who come here with the hope
and the thought that we exchange
ideas and come to this body to actually
participate, for the second time in 8
weeks, I am here with my friend from
New York debating a resolution that
all of us should have learned in kinder-
garten: Be nice; don’t hate.
This resolution doesn’t need to be
seven pages. It is just wordy. I agree
with it. We don’t need to hate, no mat-
ter where it comes from. But what

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2549
March 7, 2019
bothers me the most, Mr. Speaker, is
what I am finding right here.
Just the other day on this floor, we
celebrated the institution of this body
with the dean of the House. We spoke
of Mr. Dingell. We spoke of DON YOUNG.
We spoke about the institution of this
House. What is becoming more and
more concerning for me about this
process and what breaks my heart as
much as any anti-Semitic thought, any
anti-Muslim thought, any anti-any-
body thought, is that we have broken
down in this House.
Last week, we brought to the floor a
bill that was supposed to be about fire-
arms, which my friends across the aisle
mistakenly didn’t understand the pen-
alty associated with the bill.
Yesterday, I was just on the floor of
this House talking about a bill that
really, because they rushed it through
committee, came to the floor of this
House in which, if you keep a 4-year-
old from voting, you are a criminal.
This is what happens when we rush.
This week, the entire week almost,
has been taken up by sentiments of a
Member that were anti-Semitic, re-
peating, as Rahm Emanuel said, some
of the ugliest stereotypes that we have
had.
But it goes back, again, to my con-
cern here. At 3:20 this afternoon, I was
handed, or at least it was printed, one
of the resolutions. I have three more of
this resolution that has taken all
week. How long does it take to figure
out ‘‘just don’t hate’’? How many
times, how many, you know, pages
does it take to cite evil is evil?
My heart breaks, Mr. Speaker. My
heart breaks for this institution when
we say that we see something that is
anti-Semitic, but we say, well, they
may not have known it was. It is anti-
Semitic. It is anti-Muslim. It is what-
ever you want to call it. It is just
wrong. My heart breaks.
Then I find out that we changed it
now lately as to add other groups in
here who undoubtedly saw they weren’t
a part of the group, so we added in new
groups to the list. I guess since we are
at it, why didn’t we add Mormons? Why
didn’t we add Jehovah’s Witnesses?
They have been attacked. Mormons
have many times been accused of dual
allegiance. Ask a former Presidential
candidate.
Mr. Speaker, I wish the Chair and I
could engage in a colloquy. He is a
good gentleman from North Carolina.
Explain this to me, why it took a
whole week to figure out to say, ‘‘Hate
is hate.’’ We don’t need seven pages.
We need people to understand that
words have consequences; that being a
Member of Congress matters; that
being a Member of Congress says that
when you say something, we can de-
bate civilly.
My friends from New York and Mary-
land, we disagree on most anything. We
could probably disagree about how
many clouds are in the sky, about pol-
icy, but it is not a disagreement that
hate is hate.
b 1615
And we shouldn’t overlook it and try
and lump it with everything else and
give moral equivalency. But here we
are again. Here we are again.
Mr. Speaker, I hope we are not here
in another 4 weeks, because the first 8
weeks we have been here twice. Please
let us get back to being the people that
this country needs us to be.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, listening
to the gentleman from Georgia, I think
I heard him say that he and his col-
leagues were going to vote for this res-
olution. I am glad to hear that, espe-
cially since I noted that after the
march in Charlottesville and the mur-
der in Charlottesville when a censure
resolution was brought up, the Repub-
licans, who were then in control of the
House, refused to bring it to the floor.
So I am glad that they are willing to
vote for this resolution today.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
distinguished gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Mrs. LURIA).
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I am a
Jewish American woman who served
for 20 years in uniform and continue to
serve in the United States Congress.
At the age of 17, when I entered the
United States Naval Academy, I first
took the oath to support and defend
the Constitution against all enemies,
foreign and domestic. I subsequently
repeated that oath six times at every
promotion in rank and, most recently,
when I had the honor to become a
Member of Congress.
Is that not enough to prove my loy-
alty to our Nation?
I deployed six times, serving in six
ships in the Middle East and Western
Pacific, working under challenging
conditions while operating complex
weapons systems, overseeing nuclear
reactors, driving ships, and, ulti-
mately, commanding a combat-ready
unit of 400 sailors.
Is that not enough to prove my loy-
alty to our Nation?
In the first 3 years my husband and I
were married, we spent almost 2 years
apart so that we could both serve at
sea and deploy three times.
Is that not enough to prove my loy-
alty to our Nation?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
the gentlewoman from Virginia an ad-
ditional 30 seconds.
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, am I to
look back on my military career and
the sacrifices it meant for my family
and remain silent in the face of people
questioning my loyalty to my country?
I believe that I speak clearly for all
fellow Jewish veterans that this echoes
of language that has been used to
marginalize and persecute the Jewish
people for centuries.
The recent accusations of dual loy-
alty call into question the equal foot-
ing of Jewish Members in elected office
and, by extension, all Jews living in
America.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to vote on
this resolution in condemnation of this
rhetoric.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I don’t think the gentleman from
New York (Mr. NADLER) would question
my belief that what happened in Char-
lottesville or anywhere else was bad. I
don’t think he really meant that, Mr.
Speaker, because I do believe it is bad.
And I think what is bad is having to
write this thing, seven pages, and hav-
ing to figure this out.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from New York (Mr.
ZELDIN).
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, let’s all be
honest with each other. We are here
today, right now, because of anti-Se-
mitic rhetoric from one Member of this
Chamber said again and again and
again. We would not be on this floor
right now otherwise to discuss this
topic.
If that Member were a Republican,
that Member’s name would be in this
resolution, and this resolution would
be all about condemning anti-Semi-
tism, and it would be done so force-
fully.
That Member in January had to
apologize for talking about a hypnosis
of Israel that they had over the entire
world. That Member had to apologize
in February for saying: If you support
Israel, it must be because you are
bought off by Jews. That Member
called it an unequivocal apology even
though she filled it with equivocation.
Now we are back again this time by
the Member saying that, if you support
the U.S.-Israel relationship, that you
must have pledged allegiance to a for-
eign government—except this time
that Member is refusing to apologize.
Even if you gave that Member every
benefit of the doubt that she had no
idea what she was doing, why now
wouldn’t she be apologizing? Why
would she be more emboldened to
refuse an apology altogether?
I, apparently, am giving Representa-
tive OMAR more credit than the Speak-
er is because I don’t believe she is
naive. I believe that she knows exactly
what she is doing.
It is an American value, by the way,
to have reasonable, legitimate criti-
cism of a government, whether it be
the U.S. Government, Israel, or any
other government. It is not an Amer-
ican value, though, to be hurling anti-
Semitic rhetoric.
Anti-Semitism must be condemned,
unequivocally and emphatically.
We have Members of this Chamber
who associate with Louis Farrakhan,
who says: ‘‘Hitler was a very great
man.’’ Let’s talk about a double stand-
ard.
In January, we all came to this
Chamber. We condemned white su-
premacy. We named a Republican
Member. We kicked that Member off of
his committees; he can’t serve on the
Small Business Committee. But this
Member will continue to serve on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee.

But, no, now we can’t come here and
just emphatically, solely, forcefully
condemn anti-Semitism and name
names. But if it was a Republican, we
would.
It is time to call out these state-
ments for what they are: pointed, big-
oted, unreasonable, illegitimate, anti-
Semitic.
I commend my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle who have been
speaking out about all this anti-Semi-
tism. A few Members come to mind:
Chairman ENGEL, Congressman
DEUTCH, Congressman NADLER, Con-
gresswoman LOWEY, Congressman
GOTTHEIMER.
Many of my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle, I believe, to their core
know how very wrong this is.
There are many other Members to
name as well, and I would be remiss if
I didn’t take this opportunity to say
thank you to each and every one of
them, because support of Israel, sup-
port of Jews, standing against anti-
Semitism has been bipartisan in the
past. It should be bipartisan today, and
it should be bipartisan for every mo-
ment in the future.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the dis-
tinguished whip.
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
NADLER) for yielding me time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this
resolution condemning anti-Semitism,
Islamophobia, and bigotry against mi-
norities.
This resolution expresses our rejec-
tion of all attempts to weaponize words
and sow discord and division.
Make no mistake, our Caucus is uni-
fied, but unity does not mean una-
nimity. We are the most diverse Cau-
cus in the history of Congress. We are
a true reflection of who and what
America is.
Each of us brings our own familiar
backgrounds and personal experiences
to this august body. Those experiences
help shape our values and our perspec-
tives as we do the work of the Amer-
ican people.
We learn from one another, and we do
so following President Lincoln’s dec-
laration: ‘‘With malice toward none;
with charity for all; with firmness in
the right as God gives us to see the
right, let us strive on to finish the
work we are in.’’
This resolution condemns hateful ex-
pressions of intolerance, honors the
heritages and experiences of all who
serve in this body, and commits all of
us to the continued search of a more
perfect Union.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS).
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS)
for yielding me time, and I thank the
gentleman from New York (Mr. NAD-
LER) for his comments.
We are here today because a Member
of this body issued a series of anti-Se-
mitic statements, and I couldn’t help
but think of what justice means and
what mercy means.
Well, we want to temper justice with
mercy. So the first time we come to
understand that maybe the depth of
what was said was maybe accidental;
the second time maybe less so; and cer-
tainly the third time, we now have a
pattern.
We begin to wonder how we extend
mercy when justice cries out against
one who is anti-Semitic.
It doesn’t help that the Democratic
leaders have attempted to rationalize
and protect this individual, whether it
is appearing on the cover of a national
magazine, whether it is saying: ‘‘She
did not understand the full weight of
the words.’’ One wonders what more
needs to be done to try to eradicate
anti-Semitism from this body.
Some have said that to specifically
condemn these statements and remove
her from her committee assignment
would stifle legitimate criticism of
Israel. But the problem with that argu-
ment is this:
The comments made were not di-
rected at Israel, were not directed to
policy, were not directed towards the
American-Israel relationship. They
were, instead, directed to Americans
with the allegation that they have a
dual loyalty, which is an ancient anti-
Semitic cliche that has been used to
target the Jewish community through-
out history.
How about this in the future? If a
Member of Congress desires to criticize
Israel or criticize American policy to-
wards Israel, maybe they can do so
without resorting to an anti-Semitic
rhetoric that is inflammatory, unnec-
essary, and, frankly, it is hateful.
So we stand here today and we look
at a resolution condemning hatred of
any kind. Who can disagree with that?
I don’t. I don’t disagree with that.
But what I will say is you cannot
temper justice any longer with mercy,
with rationalization. Sooner or later,
you have to face what the awful truth
is. And if someone is going to persist in
making anti-Semitic, hateful state-
ments, to bury that is inexcusable.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished
majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, let me sug-
gest at the outset that no party be too
self-righteous on the issue of sup-
porting prejudice and bigotry too
often. This is a very serious matter. It
is important to call out anti-Semitism
in a way that is unmistakable and un-
ambiguous.
We must do so because whenever
some people begin to question the alle-
giance or patriotism of Americans, in-
deed, whether certain people fully be-
long as part of our country, it is crit-
ical to set the record straight.
Recent statements employing time-
worn tropes of dual loyalty have deeply
and correctly unsettled American Jew-
ish communities because their allega-
tion is, simply put, that American
Jews who support Israel are not loyal
to this country.
I stand as a very strong supporter of
Israel and a very loyal American. Such
allegations fall into—as has been said—
a century-old and dark history of Jews
being marginalized and set apart. They
recall past evils that occurred in other
countries and in our own when, accord-
ing to the Anti-Defamation League,
people accuse Jews of ‘‘being disloyal
neighbors or citizens’’ because of their
connection to Israel or Jewish commu-
nities elsewhere in the world.
That was false, and it was bigoted.
To be clear, the First Amendment
protects the right of every American to
criticize policies and leaders, whether
our own country or others.
That is the glory of our democracy.
b 1630
However, in these past few weeks,
those who say they are only criticizing
Israel’s leaders or policies have, in-
stead, been making claims about the
allegiance and motivation of Israel’s
defenders.
I do not believe there is anyone in
our Caucus, not one, who wishes to si-
lence debate over policy. Rather, what
is being called for is an end to the invo-
cation of age-old, anti-Semitic tropes
that demonize people instead of criti-
cize policies.
Accusations that Jews bear dual alle-
giance because of support for Israel or
concern for its safety are false and
they are also hurtful canards that must
be opposed and exposed for what they
are: bigotry. They elicit legitimate
fear and uncertainty in the individuals
and communities they target.
In much the same way, we have also
seen vile examples of hatred aimed at
painting Muslim Americans as some-
how disloyal to our Nation, or not fully
belonging, causing similar feelings of
insecurity and distress.
No Muslims could come to our coun-
try. Those feelings cannot be dis-
counted either. One of our own col-
leagues was the target of an
Islamophobic attack, impugning a
Member of this House. That ought to
be unacceptable to all of us.
We have seen this same form of ex-
clusion, hatred in recent years when-
ever acts of bigotry have been directed
towards African Americans, and when
Latino and Latina citizens have been
yelled at to ‘‘go back’’ to their coun-
try. This is their country.
This phenomenon is also a reminder
of the horrific internment of Japanese
Americans during the Second World
War. None of us ought to be like
Pontius Pilate and think that we have
not fallen short of the principles enun-
ciated in our Declaration.
In our multicultural Republic, some-
times it is incumbent upon the Amer-
ican people to speak as one Nation, in-
divisible, and make a clear affirmation
that all Americans have an equal share

in our Republic, that no one’s race, or
creed, or origin can call into question
one’s love of country.
I will continue to urge unity in the
face of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia,
xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia,
racism against African American,
Latino, Asian Americans, and other
forms of prejudice and discrimination.
American Jews, including those who
serve our Nation in Congress, need to
be reassured that they are equal part-
ners in the diverse coalition for justice,
opportunity, tolerance, and equality,
and that they have true allies who
stand with them as firmly as they have
stood with others.
I will continue to make that clear.
America is rightfully respected for its
Declaration of Independence and its
Constitution, as amended and per-
fected, both of which proclaim the dig-
nity and rights of individuals endowed
by our Creator.
But America has also seen, too often,
the denial of that dignity and equality
to millions of its citizens based upon
the color of their skin, the land of their
birth, or the faith of their forebearers.
My colleagues, if we are to be better
than our past, we must reject all forms
of bigotry and prejudice directed at
any of our fellow human beings and fel-
low Americans. Let us all, in solidarity
and in union with the principles of our
country, support this resolution.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, could
you please tell me how much time the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS)
has remaining, and how much time do
I have remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 9 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Geor-
gia has 83⁄4 minutes remaining.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT).
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, accord-
ing to Proverbs, something that people
who are practicing Jews and Christians
believe, it says that there are seven
things that are detestable to the Lord.
They are: ‘‘Haughty eyes, a lying
tongue, hands that shed innocent
blood, a heart that devises wicked
schemes, feet that are quick to rush
into evil, a false witness who pours out
lies, and a person who stirs up conflict
in the community.’’
It goes so far as to say, these are
things the Lord hates. So the word
hate is not wrong in the Jewish and
Christian tradition, but anything be-
yond this is wrong. And, yes, there has
been persecution of Christians. There
has been persecution of Muslims, but
anybody who is persecuting a people in
the name of Christianity is not acting
as a Christian. That is not part of the
faith.
But what makes this so dangerous—
and the reason I will vote against this
resolution—is because we came here
because of an anti-Semitic remark. We
came here to condemn anti-Semitism,
but this resolution, as changed up over
the last hour, now condemns just about
everything, and the reason that is so
dangerous is that anti-Semitism, ha-
tred for the children of Israel, is a very
special kind of hatred that should
never be watered down.
There has never been a persecution of
a people like the Jewish people from
1933 to 1945. Over 6 million were killed.
It started with little things, hateful re-
marks made about the children of
Israel that grew and grew, and it was
okay because it was made by somebody
who had a grudge. It was let go, and it
built until it led to the death of 6 mil-
lion Jews. We have to say no.
We will not let it go on. That is why
I will vote against it. It has watered
down the sentiment.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BASS).
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, the Congres-
sional Black Caucus condemns all
forms of white supremacy, anti-Semi-
tism, and Islamophobia in the strong-
est terms possible.
This could have been an issue that
sowed further division among the coun-
try, but, instead, has united everyone
around our shared values, condemning
all forms of bigotry and hatred. The
Congressional Black Caucus stands
firmly against all expressions of hate,
and is concerned by the recent uptick
in hateful rhetoric and crimes tar-
geting minority communities.
For example, a white nationalist
murdered nine African American wor-
shipers at Emanuel African Methodist
Episcopal Church in Charleston, South
Carolina, on the evening of June 15,
2015, in hopes of igniting a nationwide
race war; or the perpetrator of the
deadliest attack on Jewish people in
the United States’ history at the Tree
of Life synagogue building in Pitts-
burgh that killed 11 worshippers.
It is unfortunate that the President
of the United States has shown a com-
plete lack of leadership on these issues
and has, in fact, fanned the flames.
As chair of the Congressional Black
Caucus, the CBC remains committed to
building a more perfect union by en-
gaging in constructive dialogue that
affirms America as a nation welcoming
to all.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to
what I was talking about when we first
started this, and being saddened to be
here, and also how we are continually
rushing stuff to the floor. I know it is
an oversight, but it goes back to my
very first statement here, and, again, I
can remind everyone here, if we wanted
to write a simple resolution here, hate
is hate. It is not good. Don’t say it.
Think about what you are doing. You
could have done this in half of a para-
graph.
Not to belittle any of this, this is all
wrong, but on page 7, number 7, we
have a resolution that says, ‘‘condemns
death threats received by Jewish and
Muslim Members of Congress.’’
I am a Member who has had someone
put in jail for threatening to kill me
and my daughter. Why don’t we con-
demn that? We forgot it. We forgot it.
Like we had other groups in this bill,
that we have written three times, that
we had to add because we forgot them.
As I mentioned earlier, why didn’t we
add Mormons? Why didn’t we add Jeho-
vah’s Witnesses?
It is not that the issue here is the
hate and what happened and where it
went back to. Our speakers on both
sides have gone to the very issue of
why we are here. I go back to the issue
of what I talked about earlier, that I
am saddened for the state of our House
that we are so concerned about trying
to make talking points and finishing
it, that we rush stuff to this floor. This
is not what we do or who we are.
Hate is hate. It is bad. It is wrong.
Quit saying it, but don’t keep rushing
stuff to the floor when you don’t even
really understand what you put in the
bill.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ENGEL), the distinguished
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote
‘‘yes’’ on this measure today, but I do
have concerns about how we are deal-
ing with these issues. Obviously, all
forms of hatred and bigotry are intoler-
able and we should go on the record as
saying so.
I am voting for this because when I
read the resolution, I agreed with ev-
erything it says. But let me say this to
the criticism that the Democratic ma-
jority won’t condemn anti-Semitism. A
few weeks back we took the virtually
unprecedented step of accepting a Re-
publican motion to recommit, the pro-
cedural tool the majority never sup-
ports because it condemned anti-Semi-
tism. We were proud to set aside prece-
dent to condemn anti-Semitism then,
and in today’s resolution, we are doing
so again today.
So contrary to what some are saying,
that is twice in the course of a month
that the Democratic majority is con-
demning anti-Semitism on the floor of
the House.
But I must say, the words spoken by
our colleague from Minnesota last
week touched a very real, very raw
place for me. My desire for the House
to go on record again, specifically con-
demning anti-Semitism, wasn’t a de-
sire to single the gentlewoman out or
to stifle debate on U.S. policy towards
Israel, but it was a desire and need to
say that certain words, no matter who
utters them, have no place in our pub-
lic discourse and, indeed, can be very
dangerous.
When a Member of our body speaks
the way the Representative from Min-
nesota spoke, then we need to single it
out and say we will not tolerate it. In
the last week, these problems have
been compounded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2552 March 7, 2019
Since the comments that sparked
this controversy, the gentlewoman
from Minnesota has become the target
of vile, racist Islamophobic smears and
threats. One begets another. And we
have got to put a stop to it now. That
is horrific. Islamophobia has no place
in this body or anywhere in the United
States, and anti-Semitism certainly
doesn’t either.
I wish we had had a separate resolu-
tion about anti-Semitism. I think we
deserved it. I think it was wrong not to
have it. I don’t think we should mix ev-
erything. But I want to say very clear-
ly and very loudly that anti-Semitism
will never be tolerated by me, never be
tolerated by this body, and no Member
of Congress should be making anti-Se-
mitic statements.
No Member of Congress should be
saying hurtful things and then not
apologizing for them. So I hope we can
put everything together to support this
resolution. It condemns all kinds of ha-
tred, whether it is Islamophobia, anti-
Semitism, any kind of hatred that is
what we need to do. And any time that
anti-Semitism rears its ugly head, we
need to stop it.
This resolution is a fine resolution,
and I will support it. But I am very dis-
appointed that we weren’t able to have
a separate resolution to specifically
condemn anti-Semitism and what our
colleague said that really was a very
hateful term.
I hope we can put everything to-
gether in this House. I know we can. I
know people on both sides of the aisle
want to work together. We want to
stomp out any form of hatred, particu-
larly anti-Semitism.
I will continue to work with anybody
who wants to do that.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I appreciate my colleague from New
York’s statement just then. It is frank-
ly a shame that he had to come say
that in this context, but I appreciate
what he said because he is right on. He
is correct.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
GAETZ).
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman for yielding, and I fully as-
sociate myself with the comments of
the gentleman from New York con-
demning anti-Semitism, full stop, an
entirely appropriate thing to do.
I just think it is curious how we
ended up here. We are having this de-
bate right now because Democrats had
an objection to something said by a
Democrat. So they launch off on this
drafting project, and then lo and be-
hold, I hear all of the remarks on the
floor, and a lot of the substance in the
resolution is about President Trump,
and criticizing him and trying to open
wounds.
This is, unfortunately, becoming the
new mantra of the left in the Congress.
When they have got a problem that
they can’t solve, it must be President
Trump’s fault.
It is a lot of the sentiment that we
see echoed out of the Judiciary Com-
mittee where there is no Russian collu-
sion. The Mueller report is about to
drop and Democrats know it is not
going to allege Russian collusion, so
they have to launch an 81-pronged in-
vestigation to harass our President.
They can’t get their own House in
order, so everything has to be the fault
of a President who is creating more
economic opportunity, reducing unem-
ployment, ending wars, and doing a
heck of a job for the country.
b 1645
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45
seconds to the distinguished gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER).
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, as a
Jewish Member of Congress who lost
family in the Holocaust and whose
grandfather fought the Nazis, I need no
reminder about our responsibility to
confront bigotry, hatred, and intoler-
ance wherever it is found.
No matter how hard one tries, the al-
legation of dual loyalty simply does
not constitute legitimate opinion
about foreign policy. It is a slur
against Jews. It is indefensible, and it
is deserving of condemnation by every-
one every time. More than anything, it
is offensive to question my loyalty or
anyone’s loyalty to the United States
of America here simply because I am
Jewish, the same way it was appalling
to question President John Kennedy’s
loyalty to the United States because he
was Catholic.
I am glad that Congress is voicing its
opposition to anti-Semitism and made
it clear that a dual loyalty smear is
unacceptable.
Unfortunately, it was also clear from
the discussions this week and the ulti-
mate resolution that anti-Semitism is
being treated differently than other
forms of bigotry and hatred. There
shouldn’t be an asterisk next to anti-
Semitism, and I will continue to fight
it.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, how
much time is remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 41⁄4 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Geor-
gia has 4 minutes remaining.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45
seconds to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ).
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Speaker, one thing we are all reminded
of this week is that words have power,
and divisive words cause pain. Every
Jewish person in America, no matter
where they are from, could share a
story of deeply painful anti-Semitism
that they have personally experienced.
For me, at its worst, Nazi-obsessed
internet trolls mercilessly taunted my
children with Holocaust threats too
vile for me to describe on this floor.
This pain is frequently felt by all too
many Americans. How you look or
speak, whom you love, or where you
live and pray can still invite unwanted
and potentially dangerous words of
hostility.
The conversation today about anti-
Semitism, allegiance, and loyalty is
necessary because remaining silent
against hatred and bigotry is not an
option.
I am a second-generation American
on both sides of my family. Two gen-
erations later, it was possible for me to
become a Member of the U.S. Con-
gress—only in America. So, ques-
tioning my allegiance is painful and
personal.
Unfortunately, this dual loyalty
question is not isolated to Jews. Words
have power. We must carefully choose
our words and make sure that we use
them to unite us and not to divide us.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), who is the distin-
guished Speaker of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank
him for bringing this important resolu-
tion to the floor of the House.
I commend the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN) and the very
distinguished gentleman from Lou-
isiana for his participation in writing
this important resolution.
It is in the spirit of unity and soli-
darity with my colleagues as we come
together in this Chamber of our Amer-
ican democracy to condemn all forms
of hatred, racism, prejudice, and dis-
crimination with a hopefully single and
strong voice.
It is a profoundly disturbing reality
that anti-Semitism is on the rise in
America today, and anti-Semitic at-
tacks increasingly are at the highest
rate on record. Appalling acts of hatred
and bigotry are being inflicted on all
elements of our society, be they Afri-
can American, Latino, people from
Asia, and attacks in terms of people
being Muslim or other religious faiths.
This isn’t who we are as a country.
We all believe that there is a spark of
divinity in every person who exists,
that we are all God’s children, and that
we come to meet with each other in a
way that commands respect for that
provenance of our being all God’s chil-
dren. Then we see people making at-
tacks on each other throughout the
country, whether it is in Charlottes-
ville or whether it is anti-immigrant
attitudes that have reared their ugly
heads in our country. It is in that spir-
it that I come to the floor almost emo-
tionally to speak about this.
In the Congress and across the coun-
try, we must accept debate on any sub-
ject in a legitimate way, whether it is
on our U.S.-Israel policies and the rest.
That is protected by the value of free
speech and democratic debate in the
United States and in Israel.
Israel is our friend in that region. We
support Israel out of friendship and out
of shared values, but also because it is
in our national interests to do so. But
not every one of us in this body agrees

March 7, 2019
on every provision or any consider-
ation in that relationship. That is a
separate and complete issue from anti-
Semitism.
Anti-Semitism, whether it is in the
form of attacks on Jewish people, anti-
Semitic tropes, prejudicial accusa-
tions, or any other form of hatred, is
deeply and unequivocally offensive and
must be condemned wherever it is
heard. All of us must remember, as
Members of Congress and as the Presi-
dent of the United States, that our
words are weightier once we cross the
threshold into Congress, and, indeed,
they weigh a ton when someone be-
comes the President of the United
States.
It is also disturbing that
Islamophobia and white supremacism
remain a sinister and shameful pres-
ence in America today. Too often that
goes undernoticed or unchecked. Such
attacks have even targeted some of us
in this body.
We must condemn these attacks and
confront them. As Members of Con-
gress and Americans, we have a solemn
and urgent responsibility to fight to
end the scourge of bigotry, racism, and
hatred in our country.
I do want to again salute our col-
league, CEDRIC RICHMOND, our distin-
guished former chair of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus and now distin-
guished leader in the whip’s operation,
for his leadership in shaping this legis-
lation, and, again, Congressman JAMIE
RASKIN of Maryland for his leadership
role in all of this.
I salute all of our Members for dem-
onstrating the courage to have this dif-
ficult conversation and for doing so in
a spirit of great respect, disagreeing
sometimes, but never questioning the
patriotism or motivation of anyone
with whom we serve.
I thank Chairman NADLER of the Ju-
diciary Committee for the work that
he has done to give us this important
moment on the floor of the House.
Mr. Speaker, I hope that we will have
a unanimous vote in support of this
resolution.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I do again want to go back to some-
thing.
I appreciate the words that have been
said here. Again, I cannot emphasize
this enough. It took seven pages to de-
scribe what simply can be said is: Don’t
hate; watch what you say; you are a
Member of Congress; we deserve better;
the House deserves better. When we un-
derstand this, then we can begin to un-
derstand.
Also, I want to go back to something
that I will hit again. It goes back to
this is again something put together
because we couldn’t come to agreement
on the very nature of what started this,
which was anti-Semitic comments. And
having to have some of our Jewish leg-
islators come down here and condemn
that is sad, wanting to have to vote for
something that, at the very heart, tore
them apart. You can hear it in their
voices, but yet they have to vote for
this.
We also put it together getting it at
3:20 this afternoon. We left out the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. We left out Wiccans. We left
out Jehovah’s Witnesses. We left out
disabled people who are often discrimi-
nated against and have hateful things
said about them.
We also, in the thing, found out that
the only ones we are going to condemn
getting death threats are Jewish Mem-
bers and Muslim Members. We are not
condemning anything else. This is just
another attempt to rush to do some-
thing, to fix something.
I said last week, and I will say it
again: What makes you feel good
doesn’t always heal you. This is an-
other example of a rush project.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCARTHY), who is the minority lead-
er.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I want
to start by thanking a Member from
the other side of the aisle, Chairman
ELIOT ENGEL. I thank the gentleman,
for when he heard the language, he
stood up. I thank the gentleman for his
work.
To all the Members who are here,
this shouldn’t be this hard. We should
not have to go through the number of
versions that we had to. We shouldn’t
have to be on this floor even speaking
about this. I hope we won’t be back.
Of all the things that have happened
this Congress, this is what we have
talked about the most. This is the ac-
tion that this Congress has taken the
most. Twice we have to make a state-
ment that we are opposed to anti-Semi-
tism.
The first time it took the minority.
It doesn’t have very many abilities to
bring something to the floor, but we
did, and we spoke with one voice. But
now we are back in a few weeks stating
the same thing, but without apologies,
without apologies from that voice.
It did not have to be this hard. Mr.
Speaker, we didn’t have to break the
72-hour rule that you put in this year
to make it less than an hour because of
fear of what would happen tomorrow
on a motion to recommit.
I will pledge to you this from this
side of the aisle, and I hope you under-
stand this clearly: Any hatred, we take
action.
I hope you have seen from the action
on this side of the aisle where we
stand, Mr. Speaker. We didn’t have to
have a resolution, but when it came to
the floor, we voted for it. We took ac-
tion before it came to the floor, and it
wasn’t simply: Please apologize.
It didn’t have to be this hard.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, our Madam Speak-
er was right. America is better than
this. But to my Members, Congress is
better than this.
Please do not make history write
about our time with these 2 years that
the most we have ever done is that we
had to keep bringing resolutions to the
floor to tell people that anti-Semitism
is wrong if that is the only action we
are going to take. I know we are better
than this.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
Mr. Speaker, as we come to the con-
clusion of our second time doing this, I
will echo the sentiments of our leader
who just spoke, and I will echo the sen-
timents of most everyone who has spo-
ken here that this is wrong.
One time, we should learn; two times,
we are getting nothing out of this any-
more because, undoubtedly, we are get-
ting no input because we are just put-
ting everything we can imaginable that
we could think of in a short amount of
time unless somebody brought it up
into a resolution and saying: This is
hate. We don’t need to do this.
We don’t need a manual to tell us
who we can’t hate.
How is it so hard?
Why do we blow process?
Why do we disrespect this institution
by bringing together things that are
thrown together at the last minute
that leave out death threats to any
other Member besides two groups of
Members, that leave out others who
have been hated upon?
b 1700
It breaks my heart. After just a day
or so ago speaking of the institutional
spirit and hearing the dean of this
House talking about working together,
it breaks my heart that we are 8, 9
weeks into the session and this is our
largest accomplishment, telling the
world: Don’t hate.
That is our largest accomplishment?
Mr. Speaker, my fear is, with this
today, I don’t want to be here again.
But with the way this was handled, I
fear we may be.
We are better than this. This should
not be where we are at.
Why do we keep coming back? Be-
cause many times, Members forget the
awesome responsibility that they have
been given as Members of Congress.
Our mouths and our tongues can be
our greatest enemy. Let us remember
that as we seek guidance each day.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
the balance of my time to the distin-
guished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
RICHMOND).
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from New York
for yielding.
Let me just say that we are better
than this, and we have seen in this
body where we have had Members at-
tacked. We came together right here in
this body, where we all held hands. We
said that words have consequences, and
we were going to do better. We were
going to set an example. Before we
could walk off the floor, there was a
commercial running to attack the

character of our then-leader, NANCY
PELOSI.
So hollow words mean nothing to me.
Booker T. Washington once said that
we are as separate as the fingers, but
we are as whole as the hand. We come
together today, hopefully as whole as
the hand, to condemn anti-Semitism,
bigotry, racism, all of the phobias,
Islamophobia, homophobia. What we do
is push love, like Dr. King said.
But in the eulogy for Dr. King, Dr.
Benjamin E. Mays blamed, in part, the
American people for the assassination.
He pointed out that the assassin heard
enough condemnation of Dr. King and
of Negroes to feel that he had public
support.
When Dylann Roof murdered nine
worshippers in Charleston, he thought
he had public support.
The shooter at the Tree of Life syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh thought he had
public support.
The neo-Nazis and the white nation-
alists who marched in Charlottesville
thought they had public support.
The shooter of Gabby Giffords
thought he had public support.
The shooter of STEVE SCALISE
thought he had public support.
What we are doing here today is
making it unequivocally clear to the
public that no one has the support to
engage in discrimination and racism
and anti-Semitism.
Dr. Mays went on to challenge us as
Americans to do better. He said: ‘‘We,
and not the assassin, represent Amer-
ica at its best.’’ He said we have the
power—not the prejudiced, not the big-
oted, not the anti-Semite, not the as-
sassin—to make things better.
We, too, in Congress have the power
and the obligation to make things
right. Though we come from dramati-
cally diverse backgrounds and though
we have lived very different lives, we
must all, right now, stand together
against bigotry.
We must make clear to those who
traffic in all forms of hatred—neo-
Nazis, white nationalists, racists of all
kinds, anti-Semites, Islamophobes,
homophobes, transphobes, and those
who demonize and demean immigrants
from Latin America and throughout
the world—that they have no place in
the public discourse.
For the record, this will be our third
time on anti-Semitic measures. We
voted against both of them. You all
voted for one and then voted against
the other.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, as one of the first
Muslim woman elected ever in the history of
the United States to Congress, I rise in sup-
port of opposing all forms of hate. No one
should ever experience feeling less than, live
in fear, or be exposed to oppression, discrimi-
nation or violence because of their sexual ori-
entation, their immigration status, their faith,
the color of their skin, their ethnicity, their in-
come status or any other form of identifiers. I
rise in support of our United States Constitu-
tion where all beings are created equal and
will fight every day to oppose racism in our
country.
I urge my colleagues to have an open heart,
to be present, to serve with compassion, and
to hear one another. My colleagues have a
rare opportunity to serve with me, an Amer-
ican Muslim woman, who can offer a different
understanding of what it is to be a country that
is truly equal and inclusive.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
NADLER) that the House suspend the
rules and agree to the resolution, H.
Res. 183, as amended.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, on that I
demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 407, nays 23,

AMENDMENT NO. 54 OFFERED BY MR. BRINDISI
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 54 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 184, insert after line 2 the following:
SEC. 1908. LIMITING VARIATIONS ON NUMBER OF
HOURS OF OPERATION FOR POLL-
ING PLACES WITHIN A STATE.
(a) LIMITING VARIATIONS.—Subtitle A of
title III of the Help America Vote Act of 2002
(52 U.S.C. 21081 et seq.), as amended by sec-
tion 1031(a), section 1101(a), section 1611(a),
and section 1621(a), is amended—
(1) by redesignating sections 308 and 309 as
sections 309 and 310; and
(2) by inserting after section 307 the fol-
lowing new section:
‘‘SEC. 308. LIMITING VARIATIONS ON NUMBER OF
HOURS OF OPERATION OF POLLING
PLACES WITH A STATE.
‘‘(a) LIMITATION.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in
paragraph (2) and subsection (b), each State
shall establish hours of operation for all poll-
ing places in the State on the date of any
election for Federal office held in the State
such that the polling place with the greatest
number of hours of operation on such date is
not in operation for more than 2 hours
longer than the polling place with the fewest
number of hours of operation on such date.
‘‘(2) PERMITTING VARIANCE ON BASIS OF POP-
ULATION.—Paragraph (1) does not apply to
the extent that the State establishes vari-
ations in the hours of operation of polling
places on the basis of the overall population
or the voting age population (as the State
may select) of the unit of local government
in which such polling places are located.
‘‘(b) EXCEPTIONS FOR POLLING PLACES WITH
HOURS ESTABLISHED BY UNITS OF LOCAL GOV-
ERNMENT.—Subsection (a) does not apply in
the case of a polling place—
‘‘(1) whose hours of operation are estab-
lished, in accordance with State law, by the
unit of local government in which the poll-
ing place is located; or
‘‘(2) which is required pursuant to an order
by a court to extend its hours of operation
beyond the hours otherwise established.’’.
(b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of
contents of such Act, as amended by section
1031(c), section 1101(d), section 1611(c), and
section 1621(c), is amended—
(1) by redesignating the items relating to
sections 308 and 309 as relating to sections
309 and 310; and
(2) by inserting after the item relating to
section 307 the following new item:
‘‘Sec. 308. Limiting variations on number of
hours of operation of polling
places with a State.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from New York (Mr. BRINDISI) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Chairman, I first
want to thank the gentleman from
Maryland for his work on this impor-
tant topic, and I also want to thank
him for his willingness to work with
Members of this body to address our
concerns regarding the finance of this
bill.
Thanks to the changes that I sup-
ported and pushed for, we have ensured
that no taxpayer dollars will go to-
wards financing political campaigns. It
is a testament to what we can accom-
plish when we work together and com-
promise.
This bill has many important provi-
sions which will make it easier for
working families to have their voices
heard. My amendment would extend
these wins to the people of upstate New
York who have been treated unfairly
for years by arbitrary restrictions on
polling hours.
In New York State, voters in New
York City and neighboring downstate
counties have 6 more hours to vote in
Federal primary elections compared to
voters in my district. A voter in New
York City can vote on their way to
work when the polls open at 6 a.m. A
voter in Binghamton, on the other
hand, can’t vote in that very same
election until their polls open at noon.
My amendment would fix this situa-
tion and institute some basic rules to
prevent States from reducing polling
hours for people based solely on where
they live. This is an important step to
ensure that all voters across the State
are treated fairly.
I urge adoption of my amendment,
and I again thank the gentleman from
Maryland for his leadership on this
bill, and I urge our colleagues to pass
the underlying legislation.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Georgia is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Chairman, as
we look at H.R. 1, at least the limited
amount of time that we have had to ac-
tually consider H.R. 1 as it has been
rushed through the committee process
and it has been rushed to the House
floor—it grew from 571 pages when we
had the opportunity to briefly review it
on one day for 5 hours when it was be-
fore the House Administration Com-
mittee. It has significantly grown since
then before it even came to the floor.
But as those who do take a look at it
realize, yes, there may be some good
ideas in H.R. 1. And what is inter-
esting, those good ideas that are in
H.R. 1 are things that are already in
States. They are ideas that States have
implemented.
This amendment, when you look at
it, it sounds like a good idea. Well, let’s
put all of the polling places on the
same timeframe.
I submit to my good colleague from
New York, if there is an issue in New
York, then the gentleman ought to
lobby his State legislature to make
that change because the Constitution
gives that power to the State legisla-
tures.
Mr. Chairman, as I was coming to
Washington again this week, I left my
home early on Tuesday morning, and I
went to the State capitol in Georgia
where I had the opportunity to address
both the statehouse and the State leg-
islature, which I served in both of
those bodies.
What was amazing, as I talked about
this bill, there was bipartisan opposi-
tion to this bill. Why? Because this bill
strips away the authority of States to
actually set their own laws regarding
elections.
Some may think it is a good idea to
centralize that power here in Wash-
ington, D.C., but the problem is the
landscape of America is diverse. The
geography of America is diverse, and
the States are more well-suited to ac-
tually meet the constituencies’ needs
of that State.
Some would say that the Federal
Government is more powerful; we can
actually enforce this across the board.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2560 March 7, 2019
Well, the one-size-fits-all doesn’t work,
and besides that, we don’t do very
much very efficiently.
As I was looking at the State legisla-
ture, there is one thing that I know:
Their session in Georgia is going to end
in a few days, and by the end of that
session, they will have passed a budget
and appropriations to fund the State of
Georgia for the next year, and it will
balance.
Mr. Chairman, do you know the last
time that we did that by our deadline?
Newt Gingrich was Speaker of the
House. We can’t even pass our own ap-
propriations here. We are not even fol-
lowing our own laws, but we want to
take on more laws and force the States
to follow what we think is a good idea?
Early voting, we established that in
Georgia years ago, and it has worked
well, and we have worked to perfect
that.
Mr. Chairman, while this amendment
may sound good and it may be well-
needed in New York, I would submit to
my colleague that this is something
that the New York Legislature should
take up. This is not something that
should be under the purview of Con-
gress.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Chairman, I again
urge adoption of my amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Chairman,
again, I love this country. I love what
this country has stood for. I love the
idea of our Founding Fathers, who
made this Nation the greatest Nation
in the history of the entire world. It is
unique because our Founders under-
stood that a government that is closest
to the people is the most effective and
the most efficient. This bill will undo
220-plus years of States setting their
own voting requirements, running
their own voter laws.
As I have stated, there is little that
we do efficiently here, and we have al-
ready uncovered that there are a lot of
unintended consequences in this bill. If
the States make mistakes, they are
much faster, much quicker, and more
responsive to correct those mistakes
than we would be here.
I encourage my colleagues to vote
against this amendment and vote
against the underlying measure.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. BRINDISI).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Chair, I demand a
recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from New York will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 56 OFFERED BY MR. CASE
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 56 printed
in part B of House Report 116–16.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.

lows:

‘‘(6)’’.
Page 453, line 19, strike ‘‘(5)’’ and insert

subtitle accordingly):
Subtitle E—Empowering Small Dollar
Donations
SEC. 5401. PERMITTING POLITICAL PARTY COM-
MITTEES TO PROVIDE ENHANCED
SUPPORT FOR CANDIDATES
THROUGH USE OF SEPARATE SMALL
DOLLAR ACCOUNTS.
(a) INCREASE IN LIMIT ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO
CANDIDATES.—Section 315(a)(2)(A) of the Fed-
eral Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C.
30116(a)(2)(A)) is amended by striking ‘‘ex-
ceed $5,000’’ and inserting ‘‘exceed $5,000 or,
in the case of a contribution made by a na-
tional committee of a political party from
an account described in paragraph (11), ex-
ceed $10,000’’.
(b) ELIMINATION OF LIMIT ON COORDINATED
EXPENDITURES.—Section 315(d)(5) of such Act
(52 U.S.C. 30116(d)(5)) is amended by striking
‘‘subsection (a)(9)’’ and inserting ‘‘subsection
(a)(9) or subsection (a)(11)’’.
(c) ACCOUNTS DESCRIBED.—Section 315(a) of
such Act (52 U.S.C. 30116(a)), as amended by
section 5112(a), is amended by adding at the
end the following new paragraph:
‘‘(11) An account described in this para-
graph is a separate, segregated account of a
national committee of a political party (in-
cluding a national congressional campaign
committee of a political party) consisting
exclusively of contributions made during a
calendar year by individuals whose aggre-
gate contributions to the committee during
the year do not exceed $200.’’.
(d) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments
made by this section shall apply with respect
to elections held on or after the date of the
enactment of this Act.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 172, the gentleman
from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Hawaii.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Chair, I rise today to
speak in favor of my proposed amend-
ment.
This amendment will empower small
dollar donors to participate in our elec-
tions process and focus the attention of
candidates and political parties on
earning financial support from a broad-
er base of voters.
All across our political spectrum, we
decry the historically low esteem in
which Congress is now held, as well as
the utter absence of many, if not most,
of our fellow citizens from their gov-
ernment, as if the two were unrelated.
For, of course, low esteem breeds ab-
sence, and absence breeds low esteem.
Most Americans simply feel left out,
without a voice, unvested, unwanted,
and, thus, the downward cycle.
Nor is this just about low esteem and
absence. For the vast majority of
Americans are not vested in our gov-
ernment, and if our government is only
supported and is only representative of
the very few, mostly moneyed and in-
fluential, interests of our country, then
that does not lead to representative de-
cisions and erodes the consent of the
governed, the political and social con-
sensus on which our democracy is
based.
As just one manifestation of this
dangerous and worsening syndrome,
the Center for Responsive Politics re-
viewed 2018 election-cycle contribu-
tions and found that, still again: ‘‘Only
a tiny fraction of Americans actually
give campaign contributions to polit-
ical candidates, parties, or PACs. The
ones who give contributions large
enough to be itemized, over $200, is
even smaller. The impact of these do-
nations, however, is huge.’’
In fact, according to the center,
while less than a half percent of the
population contributed $200 or more,
their contributions totaled 71 percent
of all individual contributions in 2018
to candidates, PACs, parties, and out-
side groups.
The clear corollary is that the vast
majority of Americans do not partici-
pate in our elections with their finan-
cial support and that, of those who do
contribute, their voices are drowned
out in a sea of larger contributions
from a precariously narrow interest
base.
This is why leading reform groups
such as Issue One and its ReFormers
Caucus, a fully bipartisan group of now
over 200 former Members of Congress,
Governors, and Cabinet members com-
mitted to nonpartisan solutions to fix-
ing our broken system, cites increased
and broadened voter participation in
the election process through means
such as amplifying the voices of small
donors as key to returning our govern-
ment to the people.
My amendment would take one small
but meaningful step in that direction
by authorizing national political party
committees of any party to contribute
up to $10,000 to a candidate, twice the
amount currently authorized, if the
amount consists solely of individual
contributions of less than $200, and by
making corresponding changes in the
limit on coordinated expenses.
By permitting such committees to
provide enhanced support to their can-
didates through use of separate, small
dollar amounts, this change would
incentivize greater attention by com-
mittees of all parties to small dollar
donors, greater participation by such
donors in the political process, and rep-
resentation of a broader and more rep-
resentative America by those elected.
I urge support for my amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2561
March 7, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today in opposition to H.R. 1.
The people have a right to know
what this bill truly is: a Big Govern-
ment, central command takeover of
our elections by the new House major-
ity. This bill should be called the
Democratic Politician Protection Act.
This legislation is virtually a com-
plete takeover by the Federal Govern-
ment of State and local voting jurisdic-
tions. It imposes new mandates, includ-
ing more than 2 weeks of mandatory
early voting and same-day registra-
tion, and diminishes the process of
election day voting by expanding ab-
sentee voting and allowing both cur-
rent and newly registered voters to
cast their ballot by mail, with no addi-
tional safeguards to that process.
The bill also allows felons to vote,
violating our Constitution by usurping
the 14th Amendment ability of States
to determine whether felons may vote
or not.
An example of its impracticality can
be seen in Lenhartsville Borough,
Berks County, in my district, a small
borough with a polling place that aver-
ages 60 voters each election. This bill
would mandate that Lenhartsville open
and operate a polling place for 15 days
of early voting. That is absurd.
Astonishingly, this bill also includes
a 6-to-1 match of public funds to the
campaign of a candidate that indi-
vidual taxpayers may not even support
on contributions up to $200. That is a
possible $1,200 match of public funds
going to fund political campaigns for
each contribution.
b 1830
This legislation is not for the people.
It is for partisan power. H.R. 1 isn’t
just terrible policy, it is an attempt to
rewrite the rules of the political proc-
ess itself and change the rules to favor
one side.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to oppose it, and I hope they will stand
with me in defending the Constitution
and the sanctity of our elections. I
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Chairman, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate the comments
of my colleague, but I did not detect in
his comments any objection to the
amendment, and I hope that that
means that he would agree that a much
broader and more representative group
of Americans should, in fact, be
incentivized to participate in the polit-
ical process.
I hope he would agree that one of the
basic problems we have in this country
today is the disincentivizement and the
disenfranchizement of too many people
who just simply don’t feel a heart and
zone of participation. I hope he would
agree that this amendment, at least, is
one way to accomplish that.
Speaking also to the broader purpose,
he made reference to the fact that this
was a partisan bill, and I would refer
him to Issue One, which I referenced in
my comments, and to the ReFormers
Caucus, which is about 100 each, Re-
publicans and Democrats, Members
that he would recognize, leaders of
both parties, now retired, who have
looked back on their service in this
Congress and have concluded that
many of the provisions in this bill are
the right way to go, not just this
amendment, but many, many of those
provisions, and I hope he would ref-
erence those leaders of the party for
guidance going forward with respect to
the intent of this bill.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman
for participating in the process, and I
would like to ask the gentleman a
question about the amendment.
I know you have been here before. We
haven’t had the chance to really meet,
but congratulations. I look forward to
working with you.
Is this just raising the limit that po-
litical parties can give from $5,000 to
$10,000?
Mr. CASE. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I
yield to the gentleman from Hawaii.
Mr. CASE. No, that is not correct. It
provides that if contributions are re-
ceived from donors of $200 or less, those
may effectively be pooled into a seg-
regated account by either political
party and then contributed to can-
didates in an amount over and above
the amount allowed for contributions
of over $200. So, therefore, you will see
that that would incentivize both par-
ties to start to think a little more seri-
ously about getting contributions from
donors at less than $200.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I thank the gentleman for
the clarification. I appreciate that.
I am still opposed to the amendment
because, unfortunately, these
incentivization programs that are code
word incentivized are part of H.R. 1,
and instead I think they are going to
be gamed by many of the same people
who are gaming the system right now.
Many of my colleagues on the Demo-
cratic side of the aisle said they want
to get money out of politics, and we
are talking about putting more in. The
amendment here is just a small part of
a big problem of what this bill is about.
Mr. MEUSER talked about how bad
this bill is going to be about getting
money back into politics. If the goal is
to take money out of politics, then
H.R. 1 clearly is not the answer. This
amendment, while great intentions to
my colleague from Hawaii trying to do
what we can, I would love to sit down
with the gentleman in a bipartisan way
to talk about how we can make cam-
paign finance reforms work.
But the clear fact is we have been
shown zero consideration as Repub-
licans over here to try and work out so-
lutions in this bill. We weren’t asked to
even be considered to help write provi-
sions in this bill. No one was even
called, none of us, no one on our side.
As a matter of fact, I guess we didn’t
know the special interest groups who
helped write this bill and who were
touted in the press conference when
this bill was announced.
We got zero Republican amendments
passed during our markup in only one
committee, which left 40 percent of the
bill out from being marked up. That is
not the regular order that the Demo-
crats promised when you took the ma-
jority. That is what we get.
Today, the olive branch has been ex-
tended numerous times. I have accept-
ed Democrat amendments, and do you
know what? Not a single Republican
amendment has passed, even one dur-
ing the last round of votes that all it
did was give a sense of Congress that
we like free speech.
Seriously? You have got to be kid-
ding me. You couldn’t even accept that
amendment? How partisan can this
new Democrat majority be?
This is why this bill is terrible. It is
the biggest terrible bill I have ever
seen in my time here in Congress.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Chairman, first of all,
to my colleague, I accept the gentle-
man’s offer to work in a bipartisan way
to fix some of these major problems. I
look forward to it, number one.
Number two, the gentleman ref-
erenced that special interest groups
had drafted this amendment. If there is
a special interest group, it is the Re-
Formers Caucus, on a bipartisan basis.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Will
the gentleman yield?
Mr. CASE. I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Real
quick, I was not referring to the
amendment. It was the bill itself.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.

H2562 March 7, 2019
to fix the broken culture in Wash-
ington. H.R. 1 will help to reduce the
role of money in politics and address
the culture of corruption in Congress. I
rise today to support my amendment,
No. 57.
This bill also takes key steps to ex-
pand voting access to eligible voters.
Currently, my constituents in Pennsyl-
vania have no access to early voting
and have severe absentee restrictions
on voting by mail. This bill will intro-
duce early voting and vote by mail to
all 50 States, which will greatly help
working families who may have trouble
voting around their working schedules
on election day.
I am introducing an amendment to
further expand this early voting provi-
sion to mandate at least 10 hours of
early voting each day for the final 15
days before election.
Expanding access to early voting, es-
pecially in Pennsylvania, is a key com-
ponent to bringing the government
back to the people by helping people
with inflexible hours or people who
work shift work to exercise their right
to vote. This ensures that their voice is
heard and that they are represented in
our government.
This week, with H.R. 1, we are taking
a big step to returning us to govern-
ment of, by, and for the people.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in opposition to this
amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, it is great to have you
in the chair again tonight.
I rise to oppose this amendment; al-
though, again, I want to compliment
my new colleague, Ms. HOULAHAN, for
coming down here and being a partici-
pant in the legislative process. It has
been great to get to know the gentle-
woman and work with her, and I look
forward to working together on a bi-
partisan basis as we move forward dur-
ing this term.
I have got to oppose this amendment
because I have opposed others that are
just like it.
We want every American to be able
to cast their vote, to be registered to
vote, and to be able to have their vote
counted and their vote protected. My
issue is with a top-down approach from
the Federal Government versus the
State and local governments. This
amendment, though well-intentioned,
just, again, infringes on our State and
local officials’ ability to determine
how best to run their elections.
Additionally, this mandate increases
the cost of all election offices, as it is
tasked to recruit, train, and deploy ad-
ditional poll workers, where we already
know we have a shortage.
I would love to work with my col-
league, Ms. HOULAHAN, moving forward
to address many issues involving elec-
tion reform. Unfortunately, I just don’t
think H.R. 1 is the answer, and I don’t
think it is going to be passed into law,
so there are going to be opportunities
for us to work together. Again, my bi-
partisan olive branch is reaching out,
once again, to the gentlewoman’s side,
and I certainly hope we can do so.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I
very much appreciate the bipartisan
spirit and the olive branch that the
gentleman has reached out to me.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SAR-
BANES).
Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chairman, I
want to thank the gentlewoman for
yielding her time, and I want to com-
mend her on this amendment.
I want to respond to this idea of this
kind of top-down federalization of our
voting. That is not what is happening
here. The States are going to continue
to have the authority to put together
how elections operate. What we are
doing is we are collecting best prac-
tices and then making a policy decision
at the Federal level that those best
practices ought to extend across the
country.
If you think about it, Mr. Chairman,
that is our role as Federal legislators.
Our purpose here is to gather up wis-
dom from all parts of the country, fig-
ure out what things work and what
things don’t work, and if it rises to a
level of being a good policy suggestion,
then putting that into legislation.
That is what we are doing, and that is
what this particular change would do,
and it would make it much easier for
people to access the ballot box.
So, again, I want to thank Congress-
woman HOULAHAN for this amendment,
and I support it.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the com-
ments from the author of this bill. He
and I have had some spirited discus-
sions over the last day and a half, but
I appreciate his willingness to want to
address issues. I just don’t think this
bill is the answer.
To respond to the author of the bill,
there is a big difference between offer-
ing best practices to our State and
local officials about how best to run
their elections, there is a big difference
between best practices and suggestions
versus mandates, and that is clearly
what H.R. 1 is. It is going to be a man-
date.
It is so nebulous. We get answers one
day that change the next. There is zero
bipartisanship. We haven’t been in-
cluded. All of a sudden, we get a new
shell game: Move over; we are going to
fund it by doing this and put corporate
money now into congressional cam-
paigns, which is illegal now, but I guess
it is a solution for getting money out
of politics to the majority.
I don’t understand this. This has got
to be one of the most discombobulated
processes that I have ever been a part
of. I can’t help myself to think there is
no way that every Democrat who co-
sponsored this bill on day one thinking
they were going to talk about election
reform had any idea of so many of the
terrible, terrible provisions for tax-
payers that are in this bill.
Again, Mr. Chairman, if you vote for
this bill, you are putting corporate
cash into congressional campaigns.
There is no way the billions upon bil-
lions of promises that are made to con-
gressional candidates and incumbents
are going to be able to be fulfilled with
this new, nebulous corporate malfea-
sance fund that we haven’t even had
scored by the CBO.
Billions of dollars of taxpayer money
are going to fund a revamp of how pub-
lic money goes into congressional cam-
paigns. This is the worst of the worst of
the worst of what the D.C. swamp is all
about.
I am going to lightly oppose this
amendment because I really respect
Ms. HOULAHAN and her efforts. I just
have a big problem with the bill, as I
think you can tell.
Mr. Chairman, I will give Ms.
HOULAHAN, likely, the last word. I re-
serve my right to close, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Chairman,
again, I urge the adoption of my
amendment and also the adoption of
H.R. 1 so that we can once again re-
store the faith of the people and focus
on the working Americans of today.
Mr. Chairman, if you do a shift or
even if you have a 9 to 5 job, it is very,
very hard to get to the polls, particu-
larly in Pennsylvania.
Mr. Chairman, I look forward to sup-
port of my amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I think every American who
is eligible to vote deserves to have the
right to vote, to have their vote count-
ed, and to have their vote be protected.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Minnesota.
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Chair, I rise
today to offer my amendment that
would allow the Federal Election Com-
mission to represent itself in actions
before the United States Supreme
Court so that it may fulfill its role as
the people’s top election watchdog.
Under current law, the FEC is almost
always represented by the solicitor
general when it has business before the
U.S. Supreme Court, effectively remov-
ing the FEC attorneys from the process
and centralizing litigation within the
Department of Justice.
It is a revelation that troubles me
and many and should worry us all.
Unfortunately, we have seen the
President use the Department of Jus-
tice and its appointees not to promote
truth and accountability, but as a po-
litical tool with which to suppress
those who challenge his unilateral ap-
proach to campaigning and governing.
The identity, priorities, skills, and
role of lawyers representing the gov-
ernment play a significant role in de-
termining the nature and outcome of
litigation.
These cases are often charged with
partisan politics, and the American
people need an advocate who operates
with a degree of separation from a par-
ticular party or administration and
can faithfully execute the unique man-
date bestowed upon the FEC.
As the people’s last line of election
oversight, the FEC must have the
power to act independently in its busi-
ness before the courts so that it may
hold this administration, and all ad-
ministrations to come, accountable to
the people, the law, and the Constitu-
tion.
My amendment would ensure that it
can.
At a time when campaign finance law
has become increasingly complex and
dangers of direct conflicts of interest
have become more prevalent, my
amendment will strengthen the FEC’s
enforcement powers and help the court
navigate the increasingly blurry
boundaries of what is and what is not
legal during Federal elections by hav-
ing a subject matter expert empowered
to present arguments.
Mr. Chair, I respectfully urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, once again, I claim time in
opposition.
The CHAIR. The gentleman is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, the language of the amendment
is pretty innocuous. The problem I
have is the portion of the bill that it is
amending, the sheer fact that, in this
now almost 700-page, mammoth bill
that anyone thinks it is a good idea to
weaponize the FEC by making it par-
tisan. It is the furthest thing from
where we should be as an institution.
This amendment is going to do noth-
ing to address this partisan FEC that
the bill establishes.
The biggest threat to our elections is
actually partisanship, and a partisan
FEC will undermine the neutrality
that voters expect of an agency that
oversees Federal elections, especially
when the billions upon billions upon
billions of new dollars come in from
the programs that are created in this
bill.
A partisan FEC is going to give en-
hanced powers to the chairman to
make decisions on behalf of the com-
mission that have been reserved for
years for the full commission.
I fully expect a lower standard of pro-
tection of free speech to be embraced
by a partisan FEC.
As a former chairman of our own
Franking Commission here in the
House of Representatives, I think bi-
partisan agencies can work together,
bipartisan commissions can work to-
gether.
Heck, we are not even allowed to
send a bulk mail piece out of this insti-
tution without Republicans and Demo-
crats signing off on it. If we can’t send
bulk mail out without it being bipar-
tisan, why in the world would we want
to make the FEC partisan?
Do the Democrats really want the
Trump administration to have a par-
tisan FEC? I don’t want any party to
have a partisan FEC. I want it to re-
main an institution where it takes bi-
partisanship to get results.
I would urge my good friend, Mr.
PHILLIPS, if he hasn’t, to sit down with
some of the FEC commissioners and
talk to them about their opinion of
why the FEC is bipartisan, and I would
urge the gentleman to work with them.
This bill is not going to pass. The
amendment, likely, will get ruled by
the chairman to be a part of this bill.
The bill is not going to become law. It
is going to go die in the Senate. But I
would urge the gentleman to work with
the FEC, talk with them on the reason
why, why it is bipartisan.
We don’t want our Ethics Committee
here in the House to have a partisan
edge. We don’t want our Franking
Commission to have a partisan edge.
Why in the world do we want the FEC
to have a partisan edge?
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Chair, I appre-
ciate the comments of my colleague
from Illinois.
However, to say that this weaponizes
the FEC I do take exception to be-
cause, indeed, it is just the opposite.
It empowers the FEC to actually do
its job, which is to look out for voters.
That is quite simple and quite apparent
to me.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chair, it is a
good amendment because it allows the
FEC to be represented in an effective
way.
As to the underlying bill, I can’t
think of another agency of the Federal
Government, commission, where you
have an even number. Most have an un-
even number so you don’t have dead-
locks.
We are deadlocked at the FEC. They
are dead in the water.
Is it because of bipartisanship? Right
now there are two Republican commis-
sioners, one Democratic commissioner,
one independent commissioner, and
two vacancies. They can’t make a deci-
sion.
There are backlogged cases that go
on for years. This is really a disservice
to America to not be able to play that
cop on the beat, because it is a com-
pletely dysfunctional agency.
We need to change that. And that is
what the underlying bill does. It allows
a nonpartisan career staff to make ini-
tial fundings. It provides that there
can be no more than two commis-
sioners in the same party, so we are
not going to have a partisan takeover.
And then it allows the commission to
overrule the nonpartisan staff, if nec-
essary.
We need reform at the FEC. This
amendment is part of it, and I credit
the gentleman for offering it.
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Chair, I want to
thank Representative SARBANES for his
tireless work in bringing this impor-
tant legislation to the floor and Chair-
man MCGOVERN for making my amend-
ment in order.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, again, I have a problem with the
underlying bill and the FEC issue.
It is not that hard to be bipartisan
when we send bulk mail in the House.
It may take a little longer. It may be
a little more difficult. But, you know
what, bipartisanship works. There is a
reason for it here.
Frankly, if the FEC isn’t working, if
the FEC is such an agency that has
zero credibility in the mind of the ma-
jority right now, then why in the world
are we spending time marking up a 700-
page, mammoth bill in the House Ad-
ministration Committee when we
ought to just reauthorize the FEC?
I certainly hope that our committee
can work toward making that happen.
And that is something that has not
been done that we should be able to get
bipartisanship on. I look forward to
working with Chairperson LOFGREN
when that day comes over the next 2
years.
Mr. Chair, I am going to oppose the
amendment because of the underlying
language regarding the FEC.

(E) The individual or (in the case of the
covered periods described in subparagraphs
(A) and (B) of paragraph (3)) an immediate
family member of the individual paid a civil
money penalty or criminal fine, or was sen-
tenced to a term of imprisonment, for vio-
lating any provision of the Federal Election
Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30101 et seq.).
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 172, the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. LEVIN) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Michigan.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I
am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 1, the For
the People Act.
This historic package of democracy
and anticorruption reforms will put
power back in the hands of the people
and restore the American people’s faith
that government works for the public
interest, not the special interests.
I am pleased that my bill, the Trans-
parency in Corporate Political Spend-
ing Act, is included in H.R. 1. I am also
proud today to present an amendment
to prohibit violators of our Federal
election campaign laws from serving
on critically important redistricting
commissions in the States.
Our democracy has been under at-
tack from foreign interference, gerry-
mandering, hidden corporate money,
and voter suppression. Today, the time
has come to reform our system and re-
store faith in our political process.
I believe we have a duty to transform
our democracy from a spectator sport
into a true dialogue in which we all
participate to debate the issues, defend
our interests, and demand our rights.
By passing H.R. 1, we will move one
step closer to that transformation by
breaking the grip of special interests
and ensuring that the American people
come first in our democracy.
Among its many important provi-
sions, this historic democracy reform
package includes my Transparency in
Corporate Political Spending Act,
which will eliminate the policy rider
that lets corporations keep their un-
limited political spending secret.
In addition, I look forward to this
Chamber’s consideration of my amend-
ment to H.R. 1. This amendment would
protect our democracy by prohibiting
campaign finance law violators and
their immediate family members from
serving on redistricting commissions.
Congress needs to ensure that we set
out commonsense minimum criteria
for people who will serve on redis-
tricting commissions in States across
the country. My amendment will en-
sure that redistricting commissions na-
tionwide are free of individuals and im-
mediate relatives of individuals who
have knowingly and willfully com-
mitted a violation of the Federal Elec-
tion Campaign Act.
In November 2018, the people of
Michigan overwhelmingly passed Vot-
ers Not Politicians, a ballot initiative
that sets up a nonpartisan redistricting
commission to create State legislative
and congressional districts after the
2020 census. About seven or eight
States have already done this, and
more are considering it.
If we are going to transform our de-
mocracy, we need to do it right. I could
not be more proud to vote to end the
dominance of big money in our polit-
ical system, to guarantee free and fair
elections that are open to all, and to
ensure public officials work for the
public interest.
I would like to thank Congressman
SARBANES and the members of the De-
mocracy Reform Task Force for their
unrelenting efforts to reclaim our de-
mocracy as one for and by the people.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support the For the People Act and to
support this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I am going to rise in opposition
to this amendment, although I am not
opposed.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I am not opposed to this amend-
ment.
I just want to take the time to wel-
come our new colleague, the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), and I would
like the gentleman to give my utmost
thanks to his dad, who we stood on this
floor, with these same microphones,
and I was able to work in a bipartisan
way with him to pass the EACH Act
that allowed for a religious exemption
from the individual mandates of
ObamaCare, of the Affordable Care Act.
That is now law, and that is a sign of
bipartisanship that I hope to be able to
continue while we work together.
Give him my best. The Christian Sci-
entists that are in my district at
Principia College, one of the largest
Christian Science institutions in the
Nation, are very thankful that they are
not now being penalized by the Tax
Code for a religious exemption from
seeking medical care from doctors and
medical professionals.
So my thanks to the gentleman’s fa-
ther, and I thank the gentleman for
being here.
Mr. Chair, I am not going to oppose
this amendment. I will reserve just in
case somebody wants to come up and
talk about something else and I can
rebut them, but I am ready to close if
the gentleman is.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I
deeply appreciate the gentleman from
Illinois’ kind remarks. I will absolutely
give my dad his regards. I will call him
tonight and tell him, seriously, that
the gentleman said that.
I really appreciate the incredible
honor and opportunity to be here work-
ing with the gentleman to do the peo-
ple’s business.
I really hope we will get a chance to
work together on any number of bills
to perfect and expand our democracy.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance

Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I com-
mend my friend, the Congressman from
Maryland (Mr. SARBANES) for offering
one of the most significant reforms to
our election system in a generation. I
am particularly pleased that H.R. 1
puts redistricting in the hands of inde-
pendent commissions, where it belongs.
Under the bill, each State will create
15-person independent redistricting
commissions that represent the
public’s interests first and foremost,
without consideration of political
party advantage.
However, to prevent the real or per-
ceived risk of bias, H.R. 1 excludes sev-
eral categories of people from serving

on these commissions, including polit-
ical candidates or officeholders, cam-
paign officials, big donors, and lobby-
ists.
My amendment would simply add to
this list those individuals who are reg-
istered agents under the Foreign
Agents Registration Act, FARA.
FARA has been in law since the 1930s.
It requires disclosure when an indi-
vidual is acting as a political rep-
resentative of foreign governments.
As with H.R. 1’s current exclusions,
adding foreign agents will help ensure
that those serving on the independent
redistricting commissions are not at
risk of actual or perceived conflicts of
interest.
Coming from the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, which gave our Nation
the term ‘‘gerrymander,’’ I am pleased
that H.R. 1 will put an end to this de-
vice by allowing voters to choose their
representatives rather than the other
way around.
My amendment aims to close a loop-
hole by ensuring that registered for-
eign agents, like lobbyists and big do-
nors, may not serve on redistricting
commissions.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I claim the time in opposi-
tion, although I am not opposed to the
amendment.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I thank my colleague from
Massachusetts. It is great to see her,
and I thank her for putting this amend-
ment forward.
I have a problem with the underlying
provisions of the bill. I actually sup-
port redistricting reforms.
I am from Illinois. I am a Republican.
We are not going to have a single say
in how the Democrats in the super-
majority Illinois House and the super-
majority Illinois Senate, and our newly
elected Democratic Governor, we are
not going to have a say in how these
maps are drawn.
I certainly hope we can get an inde-
pendent redistricting commission be-
cause, since this bill is not going to
pass the Senate, it is not going to be-
come law. I certainly hope that we
could come together and work on some
independent redistricting issues.
Mr. Chair, I will, again, not oppose
the amendment.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
such time as she may consume to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chairman, I con-
gratulate the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts for simply an excellent
amendment. This strengthens the pro-
visions in the underlying bill to make
sure that agents of foreign principals
would have no role in these commis-
sions.
I think it is important that we un-
derstand that the citizens who serve on
these commissions have no agenda, not
for one party or the other, and cer-
tainly not for some foreign country.
It is really a very good amendment. I
am so glad that she offered it.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I am highly concerned with
the redistricting provisions in this bill
now. It seems that now, as part of the
bill, that one State is going to be ex-
empted out.
At what point, then, do we not ques-
tion why everyone doesn’t have the
same ability to opt out of provisions of
this bill, just like the State of Iowa has
done in an amendment that was ac-
cepted.
The sheer fact that if Iowa’s inde-
pendent redistricting commission is
better and, thus, we shouldn’t have to
apply the same standards as the other
49 States in this great Nation, then
why don’t we use Iowa’s independent
redistricting commission standards for
everyone? Why don’t we make the
whole bill about Iowa?
I mean, I have been talking about
federalism and States having to follow
top-down Federal mandates, in most
cases, that are going to be unfunded or
nebulously funded because we really
don’t know how they are going to get
those funds to our States and local-
ities. But the sheer fact that we are de-
bating a bill that has a provision about
independent redistricting that could
have been very, very bipartisan, now
we have exempted one State out, it ba-
sically tells all of us that is a better
commission.
I hope that when we come back, after
this bill passes the House, unfortu-
nately for many of my colleagues who
are going to vote for it on the other
side of the aisle, I hope we can come to-
gether and have the debate on whether
Iowa’s commission is better than what
was proposed in this bill.
You cannot have a 700-page bill that
talks about how gloriously good for the
people it is, for all of the provisions
that are this top-down approach, and
then, all of a sudden, you exempt one
State out of what could have been one
of the most bipartisan provisions, and
that is independent redistricting.
If you are serious about governing,
the majority ought to offer an amend-
ment, ought to offer a change, to make
Iowa’s independent commission the
language of this bill. Make it work in
States, even where they have inde-
pendent commissions.
I would sure like it to work in Illi-
nois. Maybe California would want to
use Iowa’s commission because clearly
it is better than what you have in the
bill, or we wouldn’t have had to take
an amendment on it.
Well, I think I got my point across.
I say to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN), your amend-
ment is a good amendment. I apologize
I had to use this time to address an
issue that is very frustrating, but the
gentlewoman is talking about redis-
tricting.
I appreciate what she has done. I wel-
come her to the floor of the House, and
I look forward to working with her.
Again, my offer to the gentlewoman
is the same as others. When this bill
fails in the Senate, let’s come together
on some provisions. I will continue to
throw the bipartisan olive branch out
toward that side of the aisle, and I look
forward to working with the gentle-
woman. Congratulations. I won’t op-
pose the amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman from Illinois. I
also look forward to working in a bi-
partisan way to restore our govern-
ment to the people.
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amend-
ment. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1. I yield
back the balance of my time.

In subtitle J of title I, insert after section
1704 the following (and redesignate the suc-
ceeding provision accordingly):
SEC. 1705. EXTENDING GUARANTEE OF RESI-
DENCY FOR VOTING PURPOSES TO
FAMILY MEMBERS OF ABSENT MILI-
TARY PERSONNEL.
Section 102 of the Uniformed and Overseas
Citizens Absentee Voting Act (52 U.S.C.
20302) is amended by adding at the end the
following new subsection:
‘‘(j) GUARANTEE OF RESIDENCY FOR SPOUSES
AND DEPENDENTS OF ABSENT MEMBERS OF
UNIFORMED SERVICE.—For the purposes of
voting for in any election for any Federal of-
fice or any State or local office, a spouse or
dependent of an individual who is an absent
uniformed services voter described in sub-
paragraph (A) or (B) of section 107(1) shall

such spouse or dependent is accompanying
that individual—

domicile in that State, without regard to
whether or not that individual intends to re-
turn to that State;
‘‘(2) be deemed to have acquired a resi-
dence or domicile in any other State; or
‘‘(3) be deemed to have become a resident
in or a resident of any other State.’’.

Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chairman, under
current law, our brave men and women
serving our country in uniform are able
to maintain their residency status for
the purposes of voting during deploy-
ment. Current law also protects voting
residency status if a spouse of a serv-
icemember is absent from their State
in order to accompany the servicemem-
ber on a deployment.

However, current law does not pro-
tect the residency status of a spouse if
he or she is absent but without accom-
panying the deployed servicemember.
My amendment fixes this loophole. It
will ensure that these spouses may
maintain their voting residency status,
regardless of whether they accompany
their spouse. Moreover, my amendment
would extend the same protection to
voting-age dependents.
The absence of a servicemember who
is deployed can be an enormous hard-
ship on a family. It means a caregiver
is no longer at home to share in par-
enting duties. In these cases, it is nat-
ural to rely upon friends and family,
even those in another State, for sup-
port. However, these families should
not lose the right to vote in their home
district if they are absent while their
spouse is deployed. Furthermore, my
amendment extends those same protec-
tions to voting-age children.
This is an amendment about ensuring
those who sacrifice the most for the de-
fense of our Nation are treated fairly
and that they have a voice and a vote
in our elections.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I claim the time in opposi-
tion, although, once again, I am not
opposed to the amendment.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, this is a great amendment. I
commend Mrs. TRAHAN because it is vi-
tally important that we protect the
families of our Nation’s military. It is
very important we remember those
who sacrifice everything to serve us,
and we should ensure that they are
able to weigh in to whomever rep-
resents them in government.
I am going to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this
amendment, again, an olive branch to
the other side of the aisle.
I appreciate the gentlewoman’s will-
ingness to legislate. It is great to work
with her, and I will be supporting this
amendment.
Since I see the chair up, in case she
says something I have to rebut, I will
reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chair, I yield
such time as she may consume to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN).
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chairman, I want
to say what a smart amendment this
is, and I am so grateful that the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts has taken
the time to put this together.
We all care about our men and
women in the armed services, to make
sure they are treated fairly. But over
the years we have been here, none of us
came up with this amendment before
this evening.
I really thank the gentlewoman.
Great kudos to her. We are lucky that
she is a Member of our House of Rep-
resentatives.
Like the ranking member, I will be
happy to vote ‘‘aye’’ on this amend-
ment. I think it is very important, and
I am grateful to the gentlewoman for
offering it.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, let the RECORD show that I
liked the amendment first. I liked it
before the chairperson.
Listen, it is a great amendment, and
I look forward to voting for it.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-

Mr. KIM. Mr. Chair, I have an amend-

In subtitle F of title I of the bill—

SEC. 1505. PAPER BALLOT PRINTING REQUIRE-

Section 301(a) of the Help America Vote
Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081(a)), as amended by
section 1504, is amended by adding at the end
the following new paragraph:
‘‘(8) PRINTING REQUIREMENTS FOR BAL-
LOTS.—All paper ballots used in an election
for Federal office shall be printed in the
United States on paper manufactured in the
United States.’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 172, the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. KIM) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my
amendment to H.R. 1.
Mr. Chair, our democracy isn’t work-
ing for the majority of Americans. This
is a simple message I hear from the
people in my district every single day:
there are too many barriers to partici-
pate in our democracy; there is too
much dark money influencing our poli-
tics; there are too many loopholes for
bad actors to skirt our ethics laws and
use the revolving door of politics to en-
rich themselves instead of empowering
the American people.
H.R. 1 isn’t just a step in the right di-
rection, it is a massive shift that takes
power and puts it back in the hands of
our constituents. It is legislation that
reminds us that our government must
be for the people, but just as impor-
tantly, our democracy must be by the
people.
That is why I rise today to offer this
amendment to H.R. 1, which will re-
quire Federal election ballots to be
made in America.
In short, this is a win-win for the
American people. It will help protect
and create American jobs by ensuring
that manufacturing stays right here in
America. It will help protect the integ-
rity of our Federal elections, which are
increasingly under attack by foreign
powers.
We have an opportunity today to not
only help clean up our government, but
create jobs and secure our elections.
I hope that my colleagues from both
sides of the aisle will come together to
make the democracy we swore to pro-
tect truly of, by, and for the people.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this commonsense made-in-
America amendment, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I claim the time in opposition to
the amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I don’t know if I have had a
chance to formally meet Mr. KIM. I
welcome him and thank him for being
here to participate in the process.
Mr. Speaker, I guess I would like to
have some details on what percentage
of ballots that are used in the United
States right now are not printed in the
U.S.
The issue I have is not with United-
States-made printing materials, it is
with the sheer fact that we are having
a top-down approach once again.
I mean, there is always going to be
extenuating circumstances. Some of
our territories may raise the cost of
importing paper to be able to now live
up to the paper ballot marking what-
ever requirements that are in this 700-
page bill.
We can work together on these provi-
sions, but we also might want to work
together as this bill fails in the Senate.
Mr. Chair, if this is something Mr.
KIM wants to work on together, I am
willing to work on it with him, but
let’s have some room in there for some
exceptions.
I mean, let’s say it is almost election
day, you have got wildfires roaring all
over California and there is a paper
shortage in the country. We can’t stop
the election, so maybe we need some
exceptions. We can’t stop the election,
maybe we need an exception.
So let’s work together, let’s do some-
thing like that so that nobody loses a
chance to be able to cast their vote on
election day, to have their vote count-
ed, and even just as importantly, to
have their vote protected.
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for
his amendment. I have got to oppose
this, because there are no exceptions in
here, but I appreciate the gentleman’s
willingness to work together after this
is done.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.

Mr. KIM. Mr. Chair, I just want to
start by saying that I am very much
looking forward to being able to con-
tinue to work with the gentleman from
Illinois throughout my time here. I ap-
preciate his welcome to me here on the
House floor.
Mr. Chair, for me, as we go about
this, it is essential that we understand
that our ballots are the most funda-
mental form of our democracy that
citizens here are engaged in, that we
understand them as a tangible mani-
festation of that participation that
each and every voter plays.
So this is a manifestation of our
value, our collective value that with
this most important symbol of our de-
mocracy, this tangible form that our
voters take, that this should be some-
thing of, by, and for the American peo-
ple.
That is something that I think would
be an important signal from the United
States Congress across this country
that we recognize the importance of
that and we want to hold and commit
to making sure that this tangible piece
of our democracy is something that is
made in America.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I thank the gentleman from New
Jersey.
Look, I am all for increasing Amer-
ican manufacturing, I am all for build-
ing new paper plants, but I would urge
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle to remember they are probably
going to burn more fossil fuels. You
know, if we are going to have to cut
down more trees, maybe we will get
some bipartisanship when it comes to
deforestation, which could help cut
down on forest fires that may cause the
problems that would need the excep-
tions that we talked about earlier.
So I certainly hope this fits into the
New Green Deal provisions that are
going to be voted on in the Senate.
There is a lot of talk about paper in
this bill. And in this bill, actually the
paper keeps growing. It is upwards of
700 pages now.
Mr. Chair, I just got a very impor-
tant piece of paper with the new CBO
score, so I assume we are going to be
talking about that soon.
Ms. LOFGREN. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I
yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chair, I would re-
mind the gentleman of the recycled
ballot amendment that had passed ear-
lier today relative to the issue of cut-
ting down trees.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I am all for more paper produc-
tion. Those paper plants that exist in
my district, you know, they use recy-
cled materials, too. I am more than
happy to have more trees be deforested
out of areas that are caught up in
wildfires on an annual basis.
If we could have the paper that is
going to work, if the other side is okay
with burning more fossil fuels to make
this happen, hey, maybe we won’t need
those exceptions I talked about, maybe
we will have enough American manu-
facturing and paper jobs. Some of the
best paying jobs in my district are at
the paper mills.
Mr. Chair, I am certainly looking for-
ward to working with the gentleman
when this bill fails. Especially after
seeing some of the preliminary num-
bers out of this new CBO score. I don’t
know how many cosponsors of this bill
are going to actually be able to cast a
vote for it, but I will reserve judgment
until I see the board tomorrow.
Mr. Chair, I am ready to close, but
since I have the right to close, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the
perspective on the other end, and I un-
derstand our common value that, of
course, we would want to see things
made in America, and I want to make
sure that I constantly, as I will every
time on this House floor, seek biparti-
sanship as we move forward.
I reiterate that this is a common-
sense amendment that is simply good
policy. My amendment would give a leg
up to domestic supply chains and en-
sure that taxpayer dollars are used to
support local middle-class jobs and
boost our economy.
Amendments like mine also ensure
that when Federal agencies buy prod-
ucts to carry out their responsibilities,
that they put American manufacturers
first.
Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Chair, I thank all those who have

our upcoming major historic vote on
H.R. 1.
As we speak, I am working under a
mandate from the people of central
Virginia. They expect me to fight back
against a broken Washington and to
work to protect our democracy, wheth-
er from special interests, barriers to
voting, or foreign influence.
Right now, we are seeing an uptick in
hostile attacks against election sys-
tems across the globe, with the rise of
the internet, anonymous hackers, non-
state actors, and foreign intelligence
operatives, as they rise as formidable
and dangerous adversaries.
Our elections are the bedrock of our
democracy.

If our voting infrastructure is com-
promised or attacked, the entire integ-
rity of our electoral system could come
into question.
This was especially clear following
Russia’s interference in the 2016 elec-
tion, and it is almost certain that ne-
farious actors will continue their delib-
erate attempts to attack our elections
or put in doubt the outcome of those
elections.
During this time, it is critical that
the U.S. election officials have accu-
rate and up-to-date information about
where our election security systems
are most vulnerable.
This amendment pushes back against
foreign attempts to interfere in our
electoral process and helps identify any
potential threats that may exist.
This amendment would use the in-
valuable expertise of public servants in
the intelligence community and De-
partment of Homeland Security to
strengthen the security of Federal and
State election systems.
My amendment would require a Fed-
eral assessment of the scope of poten-
tial threats to the security of Amer-
ica’s election system, including cyber,
terror, and state actor threats.
This assessment would happen 180
days prior to every general election to
allow the States the opportunity to re-
spond and strengthen their voting sys-
tem.
Additionally, this legislation would
direct the Director of National Intel-
ligence and DHS to update Federal and
State officials on possible vulnerabili-
ties and to provide assessments on how
best to stop these threats.
As a former CIA case officer, I great-
ly appreciate the objective and non-
partisan work of the national security
and intelligence communities. With
their help, we can fight back against
foreign interference, we can safeguard
our elections.
The dedicated men and women of our
national security agencies and of our
intelligence agencies have dem-
onstrated their ability to collect infor-
mation on foreign actors’ intentions
and provide election security assess-
ments that are intellectually rigorous,
objective, timely, and useful to the
States they would provide them to.
As we are having an important dis-
cussion about safeguarding the integ-
rity of the vote, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment to H.R. 1.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, I claim the time in opposi-
tion to the amendment, even though I
am not opposed to it. I think this is a
darn good amendment.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I am going to support this
amendment.
Mr. Chair, it is great to work with
Ms. SPANBERGER, and I thank her for
her service as an intelligence officer
for our great Nation. This is an issue
that she knows better than me and she
knows better than most of us here in
this institution. I look forward to sup-
porting this amendment, and I wel-
come the gentlewoman to the U.S.
House of Representatives and look for-
ward to working with her.
Mr. Chair, I would love to work with
the gentlewoman on issues like this
when this bill does not pass the Senate
and is signed into law and we can work
together in a bipartisan way. I will
continue to show bipartisanship. I con-
gratulate and welcome the gentle-
woman.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
RODNEY DAVIS) for his comments and
for his support of this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LOFGREN),
my colleague.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chairman, this
just goes to show how lucky we are
that someone with the background of
Congresswoman SPANBERGER has been
elected to the House. With her back-
ground in the CIA, we gain a special ex-
pertise on issues of national security.
You know, States don’t have a CIA,
they don’t have an NSA, and if foreign
actors are attacking us, they are not in
a position to find that out.
I think that the gentlewoman from
Virginia understands the workings of
our national security agencies and the
importance of giving them metrics on
what to do and with whom so that we
are completely safe.
Mr. Chair, I am so delighted that she
has offered this very smart amend-
ment, and I look forward to approving
it, and I thank her so much for the wis-
dom that she brings to the House.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
b 1930
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chairman, again, let the RECORD show
I was for the amendment once again
before the chairperson. I should get
kudos.
Listen, this is a good amendment. I
congratulate the gentlewoman on her
election, being a Member of Congress,
and helping to legislate and partici-
pate.
I also want to use a few seconds to
really highlight the work of our intel-
ligence officials in the administration
and our Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, especially Secretary Nielsen and
her team, working with our local offi-
cials in Illinois before the last election
to ensure that there was no nefarious
activity that could have come about in
our home State.
Our home State election officials got
a lot of accolades from the Department
of Homeland Security, and I think the
Department of Homeland Security and
their team, especially Secretary
Nielsen, deserve the accolades, also.
So, with that, I am ready to close. I
congratulate Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chair, I am
ready to close, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Ms. SPANBERGER. May I reclaim
my time, Mr. Chair?
The CHAIR. Is there objection to the
request of the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia?
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. May
I reclaim my time?
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman from Illinois and the gentle-
woman from Virginia both reclaim
their time.
There was no objection.
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from
Virginia is recognized.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. SARBANES).
Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
Actually, I want to echo the remarks
of the gentleman from Illinois and the
remarks of the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia in congratulating Congress-
woman SPANBERGER on this excellent
amendment and emphasizing, as they
did, how lucky we are to have the ben-
efit of the expertise that is brought to
this Chamber by Congresswoman
SPANBERGER, based on her national se-
curity experience. We need to maxi-
mize what people can offer here, and
this amendment is a perfect example of
that.
There is increasing anxiety out there
among the populace about these at-
tempts to hack into our election infra-
structure. This measure will make sure
that we are all on alert to that. I thank
the gentlewoman for the amendment.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chair, I am
ready to close, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, how much time do I have left?
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Illi-
nois has 31⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I am having a lot of fun down
here, but I yield back the balance of
my time.

amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Virginia (Ms.
SPANBERGER).
The amendment was agreed to.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments
made by subsection (a) shall apply with re-
spect to disbursements made on or after the
date of the enactment of this Act.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 172, the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, the legisla-
tion before us today, the For the Peo-
ple Act of 2019, represents a major step
forward toward improving government
transparency and accountability, ex-
panding voting rights, and draining the
corrosive influence of money in our
politics.
These are the very issues I hear
about over and over again as I travel
across my district in mid-Michigan,
and these are the issues that my con-
stituents sent me to Washington to ad-
dress.
Simply put, people in Michigan and
across the country know in their bones
that the current system isn’t working
and want a return to honesty and de-
cency in our politics. Passing H.R. 1 is
a huge step forward in increasing con-
fidence in our system.
Mr. Chair, my amendment today
would add important provisions to
close a loophole in our current cam-
paign finance laws that allows foreign
governments and foreign nationals to
influence American elections through
campaign ads. Right now, a foreign en-
tity can legally buy an ad through so-
cial media that supports or attacks a
candidate. Right now, a foreign entity
can legally purchase an ad that focuses
on an issue of legislative importance.
My amendment would close this loop-
hole by implementing new require-
ments to ensure that foreign govern-
ments don’t influence our elections.
The amendment specifically would
prohibit a foreign entity from buying a
campaign ad, on digital media or on
TV, that supports or attacks a can-
didate or an ad that focuses on an issue
that is meant to divide us rather than
unite us.
Mr. Chair, I am a former CIA officer,
a former Pentagon official. I have
spent my life preventing homeland at-
tacks and preserving the democratic
system that we all love. I am intro-
ducing this amendment because the at-
tempts by Russia to interfere in the
2016 elections targeted vulnerable vot-
ers and took advantage of the lack of
disclosure in our laws. During the 2016
election in my home State of Michi-
gan, we were specifically targeted and
witnessed disturbing evidence of Rus-
sian interference in our elections.
It is important to remember what we
are talking about. These ads, which I
have a bunch printed out over here,
purposely divide us. They sow discord.
They target ethnic groups. And they
generally attempt to influence Amer-
ican elections.
Some may say that these ads were a
relatively small number of the ads in
our elections and that it is a relatively
meager investment. As defenders of
American interests and our national
security, we must ensure that our laws
do not allow this to happen at any
level.
I urge my colleagues to do the right
thing: Support preservation of the
American democracy. Reject foreign
influence in our elections.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I claim time in opposition, al-
though I am going to do the right thing
and not oppose this amendment.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I know our time together to-
night is winding down. This, I think, is
the last amendment we are going to de-
bate tonight.
I thank Ms. SLOTKIN for her amend-
ment and thank her for her service to
our country. It is a pleasure to be able
to serve in this great institution with
the gentlewoman.
As I said, I am not going to oppose
the gentlewoman’s amendment. Con-
gratulations. I certainly wish this
would be part of something that could
go into law, because this bill is not
going to go into law. I certainly look
forward to working with her to address
these issues as we move forward.
Congratulations, and I thank the
gentlewoman again for her service here
now.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to my colleague from Maryland
(Mr. SARBANES).
Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding her time,
and I also congratulate her on this
amendment and her service here in the
House and contributing her expertise,
again, as I said a moment ago with re-
spect to our other colleague. Providing
her insight and her experience here in
shaping these amendments and making
our legislation stronger is absolutely
valuable. We need to make our democ-
racy more resilient.
The gentlewoman made the point
that too often now these foreign adver-
saries can get into our politics and sow
discord. The way we push back at that
is by putting our antenna out, our
radar, making sure we are keeping that
kind of spending out of our politics.
That is exactly what the gentle-
woman’s amendment does. I thank her
for it. I support it.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Well,
I would be remiss to not thank my col-
league from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES)
for being a cosponsor of this amend-
ment. We have had some lively discus-
sions back and forth. My apologies. I
thank the gentleman for his efforts on
this amendment, too.
I am ready to close, but congratula-
tions once again to Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, I look for-
ward to working across the aisle on
this important amendment. I think it
is not a partisan issue. It is an Amer-
ican issue. I look forward to talking
with my Republican colleagues about
how we can break this thing off and
turn it into law.
Ms. LOFGREN. Will the gentle-
woman yield?
Ms. SLOTKIN. I yield to the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chair, I join in
the celebration of the new Members of
this House of Representatives. The gen-
tlewoman from Michigan has experi-
ence in preserving our national secu-
rity. Not everyone who is here serving
has done what she has done, and the
gentlewoman who preceded her.
Our body is richer because of the ex-
perience that they have brought to this
Congress, and I think this excellent
amendment really is a product of the
expertise that she brings to this insti-
tution.
I am grateful for her amendment. I
look forward to joining the ranking
member in approving it and in cele-
brating her service to our country here
in the House of Representatives.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Chair, I include in the RECORD a list of

NATIONAL RIGHT TO LIFE
COMMITTEE, INC.
Washington, DC, March 5, 2019.
Re H.R. 1, the so-called ‘‘For the People Act
of 2019’’.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The National Right
to Life Committee (NRLC), representing
state right-to-life organizations nationwide,
urges you to oppose the so-called ‘‘For the
People Act of 2019’’ (H.R. 1), introduced by
Rep. John Sarbanes.
This legislation has been carefully crafted
to maximize short-term political benefits for
the dominant faction of one political party,
while running roughshod over the First
Amendment protections for political speech
that have been clearly and forcefully articu-
lated by the U.S. Supreme Court in a series
of landmark First Amendment rulings, cul-
minating in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life,
551 U.S. 449 (2007) and Citizens United v. Fed-
eral Election Com’n, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).
Because this legislation would severely im-
pede the exercise of our organization’s con-
stitutional rights, and the rights and privacy
of our donors and supporters, NRLC intends
to include any roll call that occurs on H.R.
1 in our scorecard of key roll calls of the
116th Congress:
Enactment of H.R. 1 would not be a curb on
corruption, but is itself a type of corrup-
tion—an abuse of the lawmaking power, by
which incumbent lawmakers employ the
threat of criminal sanctions, among other
deterrents, to reduce the amount of private
speech regarding the actions of the law-
makers themselves. Further, this legislation
would add a commissioner to the Federal
Election Commission (FEC), causing a par-
tisan takeover by significantly increasing
the likelihood that the agency could make
decisions benefiting the political party in
power.
THE TRUE PURPOSES OF H.R. 1
Our organization’s name and contact infor-
mation always appear on our public commu-
nications, and we openly proclaim the public
policies that we advocate. But there is very
little in this bill, despite the pretenses, that
is actually intended to provide useful or nec-
essary information to the public. The over-
riding purpose is precisely the opposite: To
discourage, as much as possible, disfavored
groups (such as National Right to Life) from
communicating about officeholders, by ex-
posing citizens who support such efforts to
harassment and intimidation, and by smoth-
ering organizations in layer on layer of
record keeping and reporting requirements,
all backed by the threat of civil and criminal
sanctions.
SPEECH-RESTRICTIVE PROVISIONS OF H.R. 1
The bill would codify, in Section 324, a
vague and expansive definition of ‘‘the func-
tional equivalent of express advocacy,’’ that
applies to communications that ‘‘when taken
as a whole, it can be interpreted by a reason-
able person only as advocating the election
or defeat of a candidate for election for Fed-
eral office.’’ There is little that an organiza-
tion could say by way of commentary on the
votes or positions taken by an incumbent
member of Congress that would not fall
within this expansive definition, in the eyes
of some ‘‘reasonable person’’—most often, an
annoyed incumbent lawmaker or his
operatives.
The time periods over which the govern-
ment would have authority to regulate
speech about those who hold or seek federal
office—so-called ‘‘electioneering communica-
tions’’—would be dramatically expanded
under H.R. 1.
H.R. 1 also contains additional provisions
that would place an unacceptable burden on
the exercise of First Amendment rights. H.R.
1 mandates burdensome disclaimers on tele-
vision, radio, and online advertisements that
are likely to bury the substantive message
and make some advertising, especially on-
line, functionally impossible.
PARTISAN TAKEOVER OF THE FEC
In title VI, H.R. 1 would destroy the FEC’s
long-standing bipartisan structure. Pro-
ponents claim that the provision is aimed at
ending ‘‘frequent deadlocks,’’ but this is a
sham argument leading down a dangerous
road.
In the excellent piece by the Institute for
Free Speech (IFS), titled ‘‘Establishing a
Campaign Speech Czar and Enabling Par-
tisan Enforcement: An Altered FEC Struc-
ture Poses Risks to First Amendment
Speech Rights’’ issued on January 31, Brad
Smith comments,
But, in fact, tie votes have always been a
small percentage of FEC votes. Historically,
they have totaled approximately one percent
to four percent of Commission votes on en-
forcement matters. . . . Although critics
claim that tie-votes sap the FEC’s ability to
enforce campaign finance laws, in fact, it is
assuredly the opposite. The only reason that
the FEC has any legitimacy is its bipartisan
makeup. Particularly in the current environ-
ment, it is inconceivable that an agency em-
powered to make prosecutorial decisions
about the legality of campaign tactics, com-
munications, funding, and activities on a
straight party-line vote would have any le-
gitimacy.
DISCLOSURE OF DONORS
Our members and supporters have a right
to support our public advocacy about impor-
tant and controversial issues without having
their identifying information posted online,
exposing them to harassment or retribution
by those who may disagree with their beliefs.
In an additional piece from the IFS, titled
‘‘For the People Act’’ Replete with Provi-
sions for the Politicians, by Eric Wang,
issued on January 23 he writes,
The right to associate oneself with a non-
profit group’s mission and to support the
group financially in private is a bedrock
principle of the First Amendment that the
government may not abridge casually. This
is particularly true when the cause is con-
tentious, such as abortion, gun control,
LGBTQ rights, or civil rights, and associa-
tion with either side on any of these issues
may subject a member or donor to retalia-
tion, harassment, threats, and even physical
attack, as recent events have tragically re-
minded us. The potential divisiveness of
these issues does not diminish their social
importance and the need to hash out these
debates in public while preserving donors’
privacy.
It should be self-evident that the real pur-
pose of such burdensome requirements is not
to inform the public, but to deter potential
donors from financially supporting the work
of groups such as National Right to Life in
the first place.
We strongly urge you to oppose this per-
nicious, unprincipled, and constitutionally
defective legislation. In our scorecard and
advocacy materials, the legislation will be
accurately characterized as a blatant polit-
ical attack on the First Amendment rights
of National Right to Life, our state affili-
ates, and our members and donors.
Sincerely,
CAROL TOBIAS,
President.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Washington DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of March
for Life Action and the millions of pro-life
Americans who march to end abortion, I am
writing to voice our opposition to H.R. 1, the
misnomered ‘‘For the People Act of 2019.’’
Many aspects of the bill seek to put an
undue burden on organizations and individ-
uals who speak out for the unborn—discour-
aging these people from participating in the
political process. When H.R. 1 reaches the
House floor March for Life Action will score
a ‘‘yes’’ vote negatively in our scorecard for
the First Session of the 116th Congress.
H.R. 1 would regulate a new category of
speech—communications that ‘‘promote,’’
‘‘attack,’’ ‘‘support,’’ or ‘‘oppose’’ (‘‘PASO’’)
federal candidates and elected officials.
Under this broad and vague standard, groups
that merely speak about federal legislation
or policy issues could be forced to file FEC
reports that they did not have to file before.
This is conflicting to Supreme Court prece-
dent limiting the regulation of speech to
communications that could have no reason-
able meaning other than to advocate the
election or defeat of a candidate.
The main beneficiaries of H.R. 1 would be
incumbent politicians and campaign finance
attorneys while those who would suffer most
would be grassroots activists. The legislation
would greatly increase the already onerous
legal and administrative compliance costs,
liability risk, and costs to donor and
associational privacy for public groups that
help inform citizens speak about policy
issues and politicians. Instead of being able
to inform the public organizations will have
to divert resources away from their advocacy
activities to pay for compliance staff and
lawyers. Some groups will not be able to af-
ford these costs or will violate the law un-
wittingly. Less speech by private citizens
and organizations means politicians will be
able to act with less accountability to public
opinion and criticism.
When our great nation’s founders articu-
lated the rights of Americans, they not only
included the right to life but also the right
to free speech. As those who speak up for the
unborn, we uniquely combine those two
rights. H.R. 1 would take away one of those
rights, the freedom of speech, making it al-
most impossible for us to speak up for those

HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA,
March 6, 2019.
KEY VOTE: ‘‘NO’’ ON THE ‘‘FOR THE PEOPLE
ACT’’ (H.R. 1)
Heritage Action opposes the For The People
Act (H.R. 1) and will include it as a key
vote on our legislative scorecard.
This week, the House will vote on H.R. 1,
the ‘‘For The People Act.’’ Lawmakers
should not let this legislation’s misleading
name fool them—it is comprised of unconsti-
tutional and ill-advised policy mandates
that the Democratic Party would use to hi-
jack America’s election processes. H.R. 1 is a
very long, complex bill that is a liberal wish
list of ‘‘reforms’’ ranging from voter reg-
istration and elections to campaign finance,
lobbying, and judicial ethics.
Free and fair elections are the bedrock of
American government. They are funda-
mental to our way of life and confidence in
our representative system. H.R. 1 cloaks
itself in the guise of transparency and fair-
ness but in reality is a partisan scheme to
choke off dissent and squelch Republican
candidates and conservative political voices.
This bill is aptly ‘‘renamed’’ by Senate Ma-
jority Leader Mitch McConnell as the ‘‘Dem-
ocrat Politician Protection Act.’’ It is an un-
precedented attempt to seize control of elec-
tions through federal government power.
This fundamentally flawed legislation es-
tablishes a new taxpayer-funded bailout of
political campaigns, weaponizes the Federal
Elections Commission by destroying the cur-
rent bipartisan makeup, and creates a new,
subjective category of ‘‘campaign-related’’
speech that is regulated by Washington bu-
reaucrats who are empowered to enforce
these regulations with penalties and censor-
ship.
According to The Heritage Foundation,
H.R. 1 would implement the following
changes:
1. Makes it easier to commit fraud and pro-
motes chaos at the polls through same-day
registration, as election officials have no
time to verify the accuracy of voter registra-
tion information and cannot anticipate the
number of voters, ballots, and precinct work-
ers that will be needed to ensure a safe and
secure election process.
2. Degrades the accuracy of registration
lists by automatically registering individ-
uals from state databases, such as DMV and
welfare offices, which provides an oppor-
tunity to register large numbers of ineligible
voters, including aliens as well as multiple
or duplicate registrations of the same indi-
viduals.
3. Constitutes a recipe for massive voter
registration fraud by hackers and cyber
criminals through online voter registration
not tied to an existing state record, such as
a driver’s license.
4. Requires states to count ballots cast by
voters outside of their assigned precinct,
overriding the precinct system used by al-
most all states that allows election officials
to monitor votes, staff polling places, pro-
vide enough ballots, and prevent election
fraud.
5. Prevents election officials from checking
the eligibility and qualifications of voters
and from removing ineligible voters. This in-
cludes restrictions on using the U.S. Postal
Service’s national change-of-address system
to verify the address of registered voters;
participating in state programs that com-
pare voter registration lists to detect indi-
viduals registered in multiple states; or ever
removing registrants due to a failure to vote.
6. Cripples the effectiveness of state voter
ID laws by allowing individuals to vote with-
out an ID and to merely sign a statement in
which they claim they are who they say they
are.
7. Expands regulation and government cen-
sorship of campaigns and political activity
and speech, including online and policy-re-
lated speech. H.R. 1 imposes onerous legal
and administrative compliance burdens and
costs on candidates, citizens, civic groups,
unions, corporations, and nonprofit organiza-
tions.
8. Requires states to unconstitutionally re-
store the ability of felons to vote the mo-
ment they are out of prison. Section 2 of the
14th Amendment gives states the constitu-
tional authority to decide when felons who
committed crimes against their fellow citi-
zens may vote again. Congress cannot over-
ride a constitutional amendment with a stat-
ute.
9. Transfers the right to draw congres-
sional districts from state legislatures
to‘‘independent’’ commissions whose mem-
bers are unaccountable to voters. H.R. 1
makes it a violation of federal law to engage
in ‘‘partisan’’ redistricting and mandates in-
clusion of alien population, both legal and il-
legal, in all redistricting. This is an anti-
democratic, unconstitutional measure that
takes away the ability of the citizens of a
state to make their own decision about re-
districting.
10. Violates separation of powers and di-
rectly interfere with the President’s con-
stitutional duties. H.R. 1 bans his political
appointees, such as the Attorney General,
from participating in, directing the defense
of, or assisting in any matter (including law-
suits against a President’s policies, pro-
grams, executive orders, or his enforcement
of the law) in which the President is named
as a party.’’
Although Democrats are promoting H.R. 1
as a bill that would ‘‘strengthen our democ-
racy and return political power to the peo-
ple’’, it is an anti-democratic bill that would
wreak havoc on our election system by ma-
nipulating election rules in favor of Demo-
crats. It is nothing but a progressive power
grab and Heritage Action urges all House
Members to vote against it.
Heritage Action opposes the For the Peo-
ple Act (H.R. 1) and will include it as a key
vote on our legislative scorecard.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I am
not going to oppose this amendment,
and it has been great debating with the
other side tonight. I look forward to a
livelier debate tomorrow.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, I appre-
ciate the spirit of the gentleman from
Illinois and look forward to working
with everyone.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of

The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN).
The amendment was agreed to.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chair, I move
that the Committee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. HILL
of California) having assumed the
chair, Mr. CUELLAR, Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration
the bill (H.R. 1) to expand Americans’
access to the ballot box, reduce the in-
fluence of big money in politics, and
strengthen ethics rules for public serv-
ants, and for other purposes, had come
to no resolution thereon.

NEVER FORGET THE HEROES ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ZELDIN) is recognized for 60
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the
topic of my Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today alongside Mr. ROSE, Mrs. MALO-
NEY, Mr. NADLER, Mr. KING of New
York, and others, to urge the imme-
diate passage of the Never Forget the
Heroes Act, introduced by Representa-
tives CAROLYN MALONEY, NADLER, and
KING, which would fully fund and ex-
tend the 9/11 Victim Compensation
Fund authorization through 2090.
Representatives MALONEY, NADLER,
and PETER KING have been stalwart ad-
vocates of this effort fighting on behalf
of 9/11 victims and their families since
the beginning, and it is thanks to their
leadership that we passed the Zadroga
Act, creating the 9/11 Victim Com-
pensation Fund and why we are still
here fighting today.
I can’t thank enough and praise
enough the leadership of Representa-
tives MALONEY, NADLER, and KING on
this very important issue on behalf of
the victims of September 11.
James Zadroga was one of those fear-
less leaders who rose up on 9/11. He was
also the first NYPD officer whose death
in 2006 was connected to toxic exposure
at the World Trade Center site. The
James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Com-
pensation Act was later signed into law
in 2011 to help our 9/11 first responders.
Madam Speaker, 5 years later, the
Zadroga Act was permanently reau-
thorized and included $4.6 billion for
the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund
over 5 years, which was established to
provide compensation for the victims
of 9/11 and their families, and it con-
tinues to provide compensation for
those suffering from 9/11-related ill-
nesses decades later and their loved
ones.
First responders who worked on the
pile day and night aiding in the search,
rescue, and cleanup efforts were
breathing toxic debris and ash that are
now known to have caused over 50 dif-
ferent types of cancer. However, last
month, the 9/11 Victim Compensation
Fund issued an alarming report, which
stated its funding was insufficient to
compensate all claims, and the fund
would have to make severe cuts to
awards across the board.
This is unacceptable. And regardless
of party affiliation, regardless of which
district or State you come from, it is
imperative that this legislation is
passed and sent to the President imme-
diately to become law so we can ensure
these victims receive the compensation
they deserve.
This isn’t a one-off issue. This isn’t
just a New York issue. This isn’t a
Democratic or Republican Party plat-
form or political football. This is a re-
sponsibility we all shoulder as Ameri-
cans, first and foremost. It is the spirit
of our Nation, and it is who we are as
a people.
It is important to remember that 9/11
first responders live not only in New
York, but in 433 out of 435 congres-
sional districts across this country.
These were the very men and women
who, in the face of evil, were willing to
put it all on the line to help save their
fellow Americans, who ran into the
towers as everyone else ran out. It is
unconscionable that time and again
they have been forced to plead their
case as to why they are worthy of our
support.
People who came down when the
Zadroga Act was first getting author-
ized—sick—weren’t there to fight in
2015 when it was permanently reau-
thorized because they had passed away
due to their injuries.
People who were here in 2015 when
that fight was made for the Zadroga
Act to be permanently reauthorized are
not here today to fight for the Victim
Compensation Fund because they
passed away and succumbed to their in-
juries.
We should not make them take doz-
ens of trips down here to Washington,
D.C., begging for support. Let them
stay where they are and take care of
their health. That is most important.
It is so important that we imme-
diately passed the Never Forget the
Heroes Act, which will ensure these he-
roes receive the support they have
more than earned.
This past September 11, 17 years
since the attacks, we came together, as
we always do, to remember those who
were taken from us that day. But this
year marked an especially harrowing
occasion. By the end of 2018, more peo-
ple had died from 9/11-related illnesses
than were killed on September 11.
Tonight, we are going to hear from
the authors of the Never Forget the
Heroes Act, Representatives CAROLYN
MALONEY, PETER KING, and JERRY NAD-
LER, and so many others from both
sides of the aisle, on why this legisla-
tion is important for the victims of 9/
11, for their communities, and for our
Nation.
In addition to those who are joining
us this evening, there are also so many
activists and outside organizations
fighting on behalf of 9/11 victims and
working to ensure they receive full
compensation: Jon Stewart, who has
traveled to Washington countless times
to fight for them and was just here last
week; John Feal, from my district, and
the FealGood Foundation; and so many
more, including the great advocates
from organized labor, especially law
enforcement and first responders in
New York and nationwide.
From everyday men and women in
my district to us on the floor of the
House of Representatives, it is up to
each and every one of us to never for-
get the men and women whom we lost
that day, those whom we have lost
since, those suffering from 9/11-related
illnesses, and their families.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY), a fellow New Yorker
who has been a stalwart champion of
this legislation going all the way back
to the passage of the Zadroga Act.
I know our 9/11 first responders, their
families, those suffering from 9/11-re-
lated illnesses, and all those affected
by this dark moment in our Nation’s
history are so grateful to Mrs. MALO-
NEY for her tireless work on behalf of
them.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from New York (Mr.
ZELDIN), my friend and colleague, for
initiating this Special Order and for
bringing us together to speak out in
support for the bipartisan Never Forget
the Heroes Act, which we must pass in
this Congress.
On September 11, 2011, we lost 2,997
people. But the death tolls from 9/11
may be far higher. It seems like every
week I hear about the passing of an-
other first responder and survivor.
Soon the deaths from 9/11-related ill-
nesses may outnumber those lost on
that horrific day.
Thousands more are living with the
effects of 9/11, with chronic diseases,
with cancer, with a whole host of other
9/11-related illnesses.
Over 10,000 responders and survivors
have been certified as having 9/11-re-
lated cancers. These are the men and
women who rushed in and spent
months combing through the wreck-
age. They are the residents and the
workers who were told by the Federal
Government, they were told that the
air they were breathing was safe when,
in fact, it was filled with toxic pollut-
ants.
They are firefighters, police officers,
Federal and local law enforcement,

medical workers, construction work-
ers, and other heroes. All of them are
victims of 9/11 as well.
The 9/11 attacks caused one of the
biggest public health crises our coun-
try has ever faced. And those aren’t
just my constituents. They aren’t just
from New York or New Jersey. They
are Americans.
We were attacked because we were a
site of economic strength in America.
Then they attacked our Pentagon, a
symbol of the strength of our military.
And then they were coming to the Cap-
itol, a symbol of strength of our de-
mocracy.
These people live in every single
State. We documented, and the GAO
documented, 434 of the 435 congres-
sional districts had someone who was
harmed by 9/11.
Our whole country owes them a debt.
On 9/11 we counted on them, and in re-
turn, we made a promise never to for-
get.
This needs to be more than a slogan
and more than a bumper sticker. It is
our sacred duty to make sure that they
get the support they so justly deserve.
In 2010, after years of tireless effort,
Congress reaffirmed its commitment to
never forget the sacrifices made on
September 11 by passing the bipartisan
James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Com-
pensation Act.
We established the World Trade Cen-
ter Health Program and the Nation-
wide Provider Network and reopened
the Victim Compensation Fund to pro-
vide the thousands of injured and ill 9/
11 responders and survivors with med-
ical treatment for 9/11 health-related
conditions and economic compensation
for losses resulting from the attack.
In 2015, we permanently authorized
the World Trade Center Health Pro-
gram and reauthorized the Victim
Compensation Fund until 2020.
So now we need to get to work again.
The problem is bigger than expected.
The number of cancer cases has
jumped.
Cancer claims now account for one-
third of claims—up from one-fifth just
a few years ago. Death rates have gone
up.
This January saw a 235 percent surge
in death claims to the Victim Com-
pensation Fund compared to the end of
2015, most of which are the result of
cancers.
More and more 9/11 first responders
and survivors are in need of the Victim
Compensation Fund. Increased enroll-
ment has led to a need for more fund-
ing. And in February, the special mas-
ter of the September 11 Victim Com-
pensation Fund announced that the
fund was running out of money and
would have to cut compensation
awards by 50 percent to 70 percent be-
cause of budget shortfalls. These cuts
went into effect on February 25, and
have already devastated first respond-
ers, survivors, and their families.
This is unacceptable. We cannot let
this stand, and we won’t.
Last week, with my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives NADLER, KING, and I intro-
duced the Never Forget the Heroes Act.
Already, we have an unprecedented 150
cosponsors in 1 week. This was a joint
effort, along with Congressman ZELDIN,
Congressman ROSE, Congressman
GOTTHEIMER, and many others.
Our bill will restore any cuts to
awards, ensure that future eligible re-
cipients are fully compensated, and
make the Victim Compensation Fund a
permanent program for the lives of the
recipients.
We promised sick and injured 9/11
first responders and survivors that we
would fully compensate them for the
losses they have suffered. They
shouldn’t have to come begging for us
to do our job, come begging back over
and over again to Congress.
For some, 9/11 is a distant memory.
For them, they remember this and 9/11
with every breath, with every cough,
with every doctor’s appointment, and
with every death in their families.
They are counting on us. They are
counting on Congress, just like we
counted on them on that terrible day
and in the weeks afterwards.
Never Forget is a promise. I urge my
colleagues to join us in ensuring that
we honor it.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN),
my distinguished colleague, for orga-
nizing this important remembrance.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to maintain proper
decorum in the Chamber.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mrs. MALONEY really
inspires us all. And when she said that
these 9/11 victims, their families are
counting on us, they certainly know
that they can count on her.
So I thank Congresswoman MALONEY
for leading this effort for so many
years. She has been a great champion
in this cause, and it is great to assist
her however I can. That is why Con-
gressman ROSE and I wanted to be here
coleading this Special Order on a bipar-
tisan basis to support Congresswoman
MALONEY, Congressman NADLER, and
Congressman KING, who have been the
champions of this effort.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from New York.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Madam Speaker, I thank Con-
gressman ZELDIN, Congressman ROSE,
and Congressman GOTTHEIMER for real-
ly helping to achieve the 150 cosponsors
that we have.
I have asked, and the gentleman has
joined me in asking, Chairman NADLER
to schedule hearings as quickly as pos-
sible. We hope to continue getting co-
sponsors. Hopefully, we will get every-
one in this body to make a firm state-
ment in support of the survivors and
the heroes.
I thank the gentleman and others so
much for all that they have been doing.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for her com-
ments.
Madam Speaker, next, I am going to
yield to my friend from New Jersey
(JOSH GOTTHEIMER), who is really a
leader in so many different forms. He
co-chairs the Problem Solvers Caucus.
If I had to make a pitch for the bill
that should be at the top of the list for
every caucus—there are many caucuses
here in this Chamber—this should be
an important priority, if not number
one on the list, but I would put a pitch
in for number one. He is a great Mem-
ber, and I have a lot of respect for him.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr.
GOTTHEIMER).
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker,
I am thankful to be able to speak on
behalf of this important bipartisan leg-
islation.
Madam Speaker, I ask that Mrs.
MALONEY keep that jacket on, so we
can remember the importance of our
firefighters who ran into those build-
ings. That is excellent. I thank Mr.
ZELDIN for his leadership and his
friendship, and I am really grateful. I
thank Mr. ROSE for his leadership as
well.
On 9/11, as we all know, our first re-
sponders ran directly into danger when
others ran out. Just like we should al-
ways stand by our veterans and Active
Duty, we are here today because we
must continue to get the backs of all
first responders and others who get our
backs every day, especially those who
stood up to the terrorists that morning
and ran into the burning buildings on 9/
11 and in the weeks that followed.
They are heroes and need our help.
On 9/11, our world changed in an in-
stant. Hundreds of Jersey cops and New
York law enforcement, firefighters,
EMTs, and others from around the
country answered the call of duty and
rushed toward the pile, some staying
there for weeks.
If you ask how they were able to
summon the courage that day, they
will tell you that they were simply
doing their job. Our Nation has an obli-
gation to do everything in our power to
take care of our first responders and
survivors of those horrific attacks by
terrorists on American soil.
Now, too many first responders are
suffering from serious illnesses and
cancers from exposure to harmful tox-
ins, smoke, and debris from the pile.
We lost thousands that day and have
lost thousands since because of those
effects. In fact, during those first few
days, many didn’t even wear a mask or
an appropriate mask. They were told
that they would be fine.
Congress set up the September 11th
Victim Compensation Fund to help
cover and compensate for 9/11 injuries,
lost earnings, benefits, and out-of-
pocket medical expenses. Many of
those who were exposed back in 2001
are, sadly, first developing symptoms
now, and still are. There just aren’t
enough allocated resources to cover all
those who have suffered.
As a result, the special master of the
fund recently announced that injured

and ill 9/11 first responders and sur-
vivors would receive cuts of 50 or 70
percent of their benefits that they were
promised, that their families could
count on, that their children could
count on.
That is absolutely unacceptable. We
can’t leave law enforcement and first
responders with brain tumors and end-
stage lung disease by the wayside.
It is heartbreaking to hear their sto-
ries, and I heard so many earlier this
week in New Jersey when we got to-
gether. They talked about how there
are hundreds of first responders and
volunteers still going through the
Mount Sinai monitoring program, hop-
ing for the best, but expecting the
worst. It is in the back of the minds of
all those who were there that day:
When will I be diagnosed? Will it be too
late? What will happen to my children
and my family?
As of earlier this year, more than
47,000 claims have been filed with the
September 11th Victim Compensation
Fund and more than 11,000 additional
claims are expected by 2020 when the
fund is set to expire unless Congress
acts. We must do the right thing by our
first responders once and for all. No ex-
cuses.
That is why I am very proud to be an
original cosponsor of this bipartisan
legislation, the Never Forget the He-
roes Act, to fully fund the September
11th Victim Compensation Fund so
that no 9/11 survivor has to ever worry.
As Mr. ZELDIN said, there is nothing
partisan about this. The bipartisan
Problem Solvers Caucus just talked
about it this morning, how important
it is, including Mr. ROSE.
This is a fight where we have had
many champions, from Jon Stewart to
Congresswoman MALONEY to Congress-
man KING, and I am grateful to all of
them. Representatives NADLER, ZELDIN,
ROSE, FITZPATRICK, SHERRILL, and
SMITH, I thank all these Members for
coming together in this bipartisan
fight. Again, this was an attack on
American soil by terrorists.
I thank all the families and all our
first responders for their incredible
service to our great country.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congressman GOTTHEIMER for
his words and his leadership with what
is a bipartisan caucus here in the
House of Representatives where people
from all across the entire country
come together. As the name of the cau-
cus says, you just want to solve prob-
lems. You want to make your time
here in Congress worthwhile. You want
to be able to go back to the voters 2
years later and say this is what I did
during my term, and have something
positive, productive, and constructive
to show for it.
The fact that the gentleman dedi-
cates so much of his energy toward
solving problems, building bridges, and
bipartisanship is to be commended. I
thank the gentleman for who he is, and
for his efforts here on the floor tonight.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, next, I
get to introduce an amazing colleague
who was here in the Chamber, a Mem-
ber of Congress, during the attacks on
September 11. He was here in the days
afterward, the years when the Zadroga
Act was still getting passed and reau-
thorized, and here now during this
fight for the September 11th Victim
Compensation Fund.
He has been there every single step of
the way since day one, and he is really
an amazing Member of Congress and
leader, really on the global stage. I just
got back from the OSCE Parliamentary
Assembly, and he is leaving his mark
on human trafficking and other issues
around the globe.
At this time, on this really impor-
tant issue tonight, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I thank Mr. ZELDIN for his
leadership, not just tonight, but it has
been ongoing and very effective. I
thank CAROLYN MALONEY for her prime
sponsorship of this important legisla-
tion.
I am very proud to be a Never Forget
the Heroes cosponsor, along with an-
other very strong group of bipartisan
Members who will not let this oppor-
tunity to enact this legislation pass.
We will get this done.
Madam Speaker, everyone remem-
bers where they were and what they
were doing. I was actually chairing a
Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing
when a group of cowards hijacked four
airliners in order to perpetrate the
worst act of terrorism in American his-
tory.
Nearly 3,000 innocent people lost
their lives that day, including 700 from
my State. Who can forget the coura-
geous first responders running up the
stairs of the burning buildings with
total disregard for their own safety,
saving others at the expense of their
own lives.
No one remembers the shock, horror,
and numbing sorrow of this day, how-
ever, more than the families and the
close friends of the victims. I have
worked with and befriended many fam-
ily members of 9/11 victims, and I can
state unequivocally that there would
not have been a 9/11 Commission and
other historic policy initiatives with-
out their extraordinary tenacity, com-
mitment, and courage. That includes
what was known as the four Jersey
girls, widows who simply would not
take ‘‘no’’ for an answer. They were a
driving force behind the establishment
of that very important historic com-
mission.
I got to know a lot of the others. I ac-
tually hired a school principal who lost
her husband, Alan, in 9/11, and I am re-
minded every time I am in the district
office, and other days as well, what she
has lost and how painful and how sor-
rowful that was on that day.
For more than 17 years, the families
and the friends of those who died have
had to endure their loss and a broken
heart. Now we know the carnage, the
consequences, the ongoing loss of life,
and the health crisis attributable to 9/
11 are even worse than anyone could
have imagined. New cases of 9/11-caused
conditions are being diagnosed by the
doctors at the World Trade Center
Health Program every day, with close
to 12,000 cases of 9/11-caused cancers di-
agnosed so far, including 600 cases with
breast cancer, 2,400 with prostate can-
cer, 600 with thyroid cancer, 500 with
lung cancer, and 500 with kidney can-
cer.
There have also been other kinds of
catastrophic consequences, with people
who are suffering from PTSD, some
9,000 so far and counting.
Congress enacted the World Trade
Health Center Program Fund and Sep-
tember 11th Victim Compensation
Fund to provide health services for re-
sponders at the three crash sites, and
others in the vicinity of the World
Trade Center site for health conditions
related to toxic exposures from the at-
tacks.
There are over 6,800 New Jerseyans
receiving healthcare services from the
World Trade Center Health Program,
1,200 of whom are from my district,
constituents of mine.
Just last month—and this was shock-
ing, frankly—the September 11th Vic-
tim Compensation Fund special master
announced that, due to a lack of fund-
ing, the Justice Department will have
to cut awards on pending cases by 50
percent and any new claims that are
filed by 70 percent.
These cuts will devastate the first re-
sponders, our firemen, police, and
emergency personnel. They will also
represent a gross injustice for sur-
vivors and their families who spent
countless hours and days in search of
their loved ones.
I remember going to the site a couple
of days after. I went with Tony
Principi, who was then the Secretary
of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Unfortunately, there was a sense, a
falsely conveyed sense, that maybe you
didn’t have to wear the mask, so many
of those guys and those ladies on the
ground were breathing in a toxic mix of
chemicals that now have manifested
into very serious disease.
This is an important bill. It is bipar-
tisan, and again, I thank the gen-
tleman (Mr. ZELDIN) for bringing us all
together tonight, my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle; Congresswoman
MALONEY for her leadership; and of
course, all the others who are cospon-
sors of this bill.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congressman SMITH for his
words tonight and pointing out that
special master’s report that just came
out, which really stresses the urgency
to get this done immediately. That is
tough and unacceptable news for all
those victims to read that report, and
for the advocates, so I thank the gen-
tleman for his leadership.
Congressman SMITH from New Jersey
is fighting hard on behalf of his con-
stituents on this issue and for all 9/11
families.

might be a fun fact as to when was the
last time that there was a bipartisan
Special Order in the Chamber. I don’t
know, is this even a first?
I am leading tonight’s event with
Congressman MAX ROSE of Staten Is-
land, who is our next speaker. Con-
gressman ROSE is a freshman who was
elected to represent a great congres-
sional district in New York. I represent
the greatest congressional district in
New York.
Staten Island, I know, is a pretty
special place as well, and Congressman
MAX ROSE is a military veteran. I have
a tremendous amount of respect for
him, for his military service.
Right after World War II, almost 100
percent of the House was made up of
military veterans. Right after Viet-
nam, it was a little over 75 percent. I
think it was about 77 percent right
after Vietnam. Now the number is less
than 1 in 5. We have to get that number
up. Republicans, Democrats, conserv-
atives, liberals, anywhere you are in
the 50 States, it is good to have more
vets here in Congress. I thank the gen-
tleman for running, for serving, and for
co-leading tonight’s Special Order.
The gentleman contacted me as soon
as he was elected after the November
election to talk about different ways
that we can work together, and it is
great that our bipartisan Special Order
here tonight is for this particular
cause. It is an honor to lead tonight
with him.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ROSE), the
freshman Congressman from Staten Is-
land.
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam
Speaker, I thank Mr. ZELDIN for his
kind words. The honor is all mine, from
one post-9/11 veteran to another post-
9/11 veteran, from Staten Island or
Long Island. I truly respect your serv-
ice as well to our great country and ap-
plaud the gentleman for putting the
country first ahead of any other polit-
ical considerations as we try to do
what is right here.
I would also like to, of course, thank
the other original cosponsors of this
bill, people who have fought for this in-
credibly important project and initia-
tive for more than a decade, CAROLYN
MALONEY, JERRY NADLER, and PETE
KING.
I wanted to start off by telling a
story of one of my constituents, Rob
Serra. Rob graduated from the acad-
emy on September 10, 2001. His first
day on the job with the New York City
Fire Department was 9/11. When he saw
the burning towers from the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, he did ex-
actly what first responders across the
city and across the country did with-
out hesitation, and that is, he raced to
the scene. He raced right to danger.
For weeks, he joined so many in
digging through the rubble, looking for
survivors, looking for their friends,
looking for those who were not as for-
tunate. Dust loaded with cement, as-
bestos, lead, glass fibers, and other
chemicals caked to his face. He knew
this would probably kill him, but he
served without question because it was
the right thing to do.
Rob is a young man, but he is now in
a wheelchair, retired from the FDNY
before he could even truly begin his ca-
reer. He is not looking for handouts. He
is looking for respect, for acknowledg-
ment, and for his government to just
do the right damn thing, not just for
him and for his family, because he is
already covered, but he knows there
are thousands of heroic Americans just
like him across the country who are
getting sick but facing drastic cuts to
their benefits.
Just about every Member in this
body has a constituent like Rob and his
family. They all deserve more than our
tweets and statements. They need ac-
tion. They deserve nothing less because
we need to do more than just say,
‘‘Never forget.’’ We need to do more
than just shake somebody’s hand and
say that we have a picture of the Twin
Towers in our office or that we decided
to serve in this body because of 9/11.
We need to make sure that these he-
roes are never forgotten and are always
taken care of. That means making sure
every victim and their families get the
benefits and care they deserve, because
this wasn’t an attack on New York.
This was an attack on the United
States of America.
Keeping our promise to these heroes
is not a New York problem. It is an
American issue that we have to address
and fix as a country. There are VCF
claims from all 50 States and 99 percent
of congressional districts. In a few
years, we may face the tragic fact that
more people will have died from 9/11-re-
lated injuries and diseases than were
lost on the day of the attacks.
Each and every person that dies is
yet another victim of al-Qaida’s at-
tack. Unless Congress acts to fully and
permanently fund the September 11th
Victim Compensation Fund, benefits
will be cut and promises will be bro-
ken. This isn’t due to mismanagement
or fraud or any other fact than that
more people are getting sick.
I applaud this administration for
doing the right thing and effectively
managing this program. I applaud the
President for that. But it is unaccept-
able that we will not adequately fund
it, and I won’t stand for it. I am hope-
ful we can get this done, because we
truly have no other choice.
b 2015
Mr. ZELDIN. I didn’t realize Con-
gressman ROSE is a Purple Heart too.
Mr. ROSE of New York. I was in the
wrong place at the wrong time for that
one.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for his service in
the military and for his new service he
just started here in the House. I had to
throw in the Army, too, knowing that
we do have another speaker here who is
a Navy helicopter pilot, if I understand
correctly. We have got a couple of
Army folks in the House. I thank the
gentleman for his service to our coun-
try going back many years, even
though he just started here in the
House 2 years ago.
Mr. ROSE of New York. Absolutely, I
thank the gentleman. Go Army.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, our
next speaker tonight also had a distin-
guished career serving in government
before joining Congress. He rose up the
ranks at the FBI. He is a very well-re-
spected member of the FBI who be-
lieves in law enforcement and the rule
of law. He also loves our military so
much that over the course of years,
every single year for Christmas we
have been able to travel to Iraq or Af-
ghanistan, going to the Middle East, to
visit the troops as we did this past
Christmas, all over Kuwait on Christ-
mas Day.
The FBI was impacted greatly on
9/11. They went into the towers as well
while many people were running out.
So I thank Brian, not only for his serv-
ice with the FBI, but for his continued
fight for all of those first responders,
as we should remember those FDNY
and the NYPD who went in to the tow-
ers. There were many other types of
law enforcement who ran in as well, in-
cluding many FBI agents.
On behalf of all those FBI agents, I
thank the gentleman for continuing
the fight. It is great to have another
State Representative from Pennsyl-
vania.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
FITZPATRICK).
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
I would like to thank my colleagues
from New York, LEE ZELDIN, Mr. ROSE,
Mr. KING, Mrs. MALONEY, and Mr. NAD-
LER, for holding this Special Order to-
night. I am proud to join my colleagues
in this fight to reauthorize the Sep-
tember 11 Victim Compensation Fund
to ensure that our 9/11 survivors and
their families have the resources and
the support to which they are owed.
As my colleagues can attest, we lost
some amazing human beings on that
day: firefighters, police officers, EMTs,
medics, mothers, fathers, sons, and
daughters.
Victor Saracini, a resident of Bucks
County, Pennsylvania, a constituent in
my district, was the captain and pilot
of United Airlines Flight 175 which our
entire country and the entire world
witnessed fly into the south tower.
While 9/11 shattered many pre-
conceived notions we have had, it
strengthened our collective American
identity. Our Nation emerged from
that day stronger because of the brav-
ery and selflessness of the heroes who
risked and, in many cases, lost their
lives to save people they didn’t know
and had never met.
Their sacrifice has come at a tremen-
dous cost. In over 17 years since that
fateful day, nearly 10,000 people have
suffered from cancers induced by
breathing in toxic dust at Ground Zero,
dust that included thousands of con-
taminants, including lead and mercury.

CORRECTION
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2576 March 7, 2019
Madam Speaker, in just one statistic
on how this problem is still prevalent,
the National Law Enforcement Officers
Memorial reported that 15 police offi-
cers died in 2018 from 9/11-related ill-
nesses, 15 just last year alone. This
problem is pervasive, and this problem
is persistent. It is incumbent upon the
Federal Government to stand up and
defend those who defended us. The Sep-
tember 11 Victim Compensation Fund
must be reauthorized immediately. It
is a moral obligation of this body. It
simply cannot wait.
Again, I want to thank the members
of the New York delegation for holding
this Special Order and for giving me
the opportunity to express my grati-
tude for the heroes and their families
and the need to reauthorize this fund. I
second my colleagues’ sentiment to-
night. This is a moral obligation of this
House. We must get this done, and we
must get it done immediately.
I want to thank Mr. ZELDIN for rep-
resenting the Problem Solvers Caucus
tonight. In recognizing JOSH
GOTTHEIMER, I wanted to say to my col-
league, MAX ROSE and I are going to be
testing a new rule that we put into
place, and we are going to get to 290 co-
sponsors come hell or high water. We
will get there which will force that
matter on to this floor. It will pass. It
will pass overwhelmingly, and we will
get this done for the 9/11 victims and
their families.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congressman FITZPATRICK for
setting his goals with cosponsorship
not just high but also appropriately.
Every Member of this Chamber should
be cosponsoring this bill so, hopefully,
we will get those numbers up a lot, but
much credit to Congresswoman MALO-
NEY, to Congressman NADLER, and to
Congressman KING, for the advocates
from the outside, especially across the
New York City metropolitan area, we
are already starting strong with 150 co-
sponsors.
The next speaker is a United States
Naval Academy graduate. She was a
helicopter pilot. She is a new Rep-
resentative from New Jersey’s 11th Dis-
trict, and she is hitting the ground run-
ning with important leadership on this
issue fighting for her constituents.
There is a story to be told to Members
of Congress who maybe weren’t here in
2015 or even 5 years before that when
Congressman NADLER, whom we will be
hearing from next, was getting the
Zadroga Act first passed, a lot of Mem-
bers were new in 2015 when we were
permanently reauthorizing the Zadroga
Act. Now, if you look back to 2015, we
have a lot of new Members who weren’t
here in 2015. The education, as we talk
to people who live far away from where
we live in New York and New Jersey,
they might not even know what the
Zadroga Act is. They might not know
what the 9/11 Victim Compensation
Fund is. That is why it is great to see
Congressman ROSE and Congresswoman
SHERRILL leading the fight to educate
their fellow freshman and others to
make sure that they cosponsor this ef-
fort.
I thank the gentlewoman for her
service. I kind of apologize for my Go
Army joke before. I won’t mention the
three-game winning streak that MAX
and I have going. Hopefully that didn’t
bring the gentlewoman down too much
before we hear her great remarks to-
night.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from New Jersey (Ms.
SHERRILL).
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from New York,
as I like to call it the suburbs of north-
ern Jersey.
But as my colleagues before me have
made clear, this Congress must honor
the first responders and survivors of
9/11 and make the September 11 Victim
Compensation Fund permanent.
For 8 months and 19 days after Sep-
tember 11, police officers, firefighters,
first responders, FBI agents, and Fed-
eral officers from across the country
came together in New York. In a ges-
ture of national unity that we have not
forgotten, they stayed, sometimes far
away from home, to help.
Firefighters like Gerry Lynch from
the Bloomfield Fire Department in my
district. Gerry and the Bloomfield fire-
fighters were assigned to help Ladder
105 Engine 219 in Brooklyn because
they were at Ground Zero looking for
their brothers. After being told that
they could go home to Jersey, Gerry
didn’t think twice about what he would
do next. He went down to help on the
bucket brigades at Ground Zero work-
ing with men and women on the line.
Madam Speaker, we now know that
first responders, as well as students,
residents, workers, and business own-
ers of Lower Manhattan were exposed
to toxic fumes in the aftermath of the
attack. What some have called a toxic
soup of mercury, dust, silica, lead, fi-
berglass, benzene, and many other sub-
stances, were pulverized and released
into the air. These victims have devel-
oped cancers, pulmonary disease, res-
piratory disease, and sleep apnea,
among many other ailments.
Those suffering from 9/11-related ill-
nesses include Mike, a firefighter from
New Jersey, who lugged, by hand, the
equipment that his firefighters brought
from New Jersey into Ground Zero.
Mike worked from 7 a.m. through the
next morning, and by the time he was
finished, he was so exhausted that a
human chain had to carry him off the
pile. His feet never hit the ground.
Mike told me that a lot of fire-
fighters, including himself, didn’t want
to come forward. They didn’t want to
admit that they might need help. But
luckily for him, his captain made sure
that they went forward for monitoring,
and so he started that in 2004. Since
9/11, Mike has developed breathing
problems, sleep apnea, and
precancerous cells. He asked me to let
people know how hard the firefighters
worked for us and that we need to do
whatever we can for those who have
fallen sick.
Madam Speaker, we are here tonight
to let Mike and all those suffering
know that we consider it our responsi-
bility and our duty to get this done. We
established the victim compensation
fund in 2011 to provide care for Mike
and all those suffering from health
issues after 9/11.
There are 8,614 New Jerseyans who
have registered for the victim com-
pensation fund, and nearly 4,000 have
submitted claim forms. That is 500 resi-
dents in my district alone. If anyone
thinks this is just a New York-New
Jersey issue, consider that the victim
compensation fund helps Americans
from 434 out of 435 congressional dis-
tricts.
The fund is running out, Madam
Speaker. As my colleagues said, bene-
fits are being slashed by 70 percent and
thousands of claims go unpaid. To let
the fund go broke or give another tem-
porary extension and force our heroes
and their families to worry about the
rug being pulled out from under them
is simply unacceptable. It is embar-
rassing that we would have to fight for
this, that people who are ill cannot
concentrate solely on getting the
treatment they need or seeing the
right doctors.
Firefighters like Mike and Gerry
were the ones who didn’t run away
from the crisis, but ran right into it.
People who have displayed this bravery
and courage need to be taken care of.
They should not be made to feel guilty
that they are asking for help when
they have medical issues related to
their service.
Madam Speaker, I believe in this
country. I believe in our values and
that as a Nation we know that when we
step up and when we take care of our
own, we are helping those people to
whom we owe the most to. We need to
give these first responders and sur-
vivors the peace of mind that their sac-
rifice for this country is recognized and
valued by the rest of America. I call
upon each and every Member of this
Congress to join us and to make the
September 11 Victim Compensation
Fund permanent.
Go Navy.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I will
get back to the gentlewoman in De-
cember on that one. We will see if we
keep the winning streak going.
I thank the gentlewoman again for
her service, for her remarks tonight,
and for running for office. I look for-
ward to working with the gentlewoman
on this.
The next speaker certainly needs no
introduction. He is last but certainly
not least, someone who has been a rock
solid presence, a voice, a leader, a
fierce advocate for all 9/11 victims and
their families, the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, and some-
one who is not just one of the main
three who have been leading this effort
with Congresswoman MALONEY and
Congressman KING, but really right
back to the very beginning, since Sep-

March 7, 2019
of my constituents back home on the
east end of Long Island, for all 9/11 vic-
tims, their families, thank you to
Chairman NADLER for his leadership.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. NADLER),
who is the chair of the House Judiciary
Committee.
b 2030
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
thank Mr. ZELDIN and Mr. ROSE for
holding this Special Order hour on the
importance of reauthorizing the Victim
Compensation Fund and ensuring that
every responder and survivor is made
whole, as Congress intended.
As my colleagues have also discussed,
we have been pushing for more than 15
years to finally address the moral obli-
gations we have to those made ill by
exposure to toxins on September 11 and
in the weeks and months after the at-
tack. It is a two-part moral obligation.
First, the attacks on September 11
were not just attacks on New York or
on Washington, D.C. They were attacks
on America.
In the last few weeks, we have heard
an objection raised to this bill that
New York should handle this issue be-
cause it is a ‘‘New York problem.’’
The World Trade Center stood in my
district. Many of the people who ran
into those towers were my fellow New
Yorkers. The people who fled their
homes and offices to find safety were
my constituents.
But they were Americans, and those
towers fell on that Tuesday morning
not because they stood in New York,
but because they stood in the United
States of America.
While it may have been the brave
men and women of the Fire Depart-
ment of New York and the New York
Police Department and the Port Au-
thority who first rushed to those tow-
ers, to say that the responders and sur-
vivors who are sick today are just in
New York is factually untrue.
There are sick responders and sur-
vivors in every State and in 434 of the
435 congressional districts. This is not
a New York or a D.C. issue; it is a na-
tional issue and deserves a national re-
sponse.
The second moral obligation directly
ties the Victim Compensation Fund to
the Federal Government.
The reason so many survivors and re-
sponders were exposed to the toxins
that made them sick was that they
were told by the Federal Government—
specifically, by Christine Todd Whit-
man, then the Administrator of the
Federal EPA, and then by Mayor Rudy
Giuliani—that the air at Ground Zero
and in Lower Manhattan was safe to
breathe, that they should work for
months to clean up the pile, that they
should go back to work in Lower Man-
hattan, that the air was safe to
breathe.
But it was not safe; it was toxic.
In the rush to get Wall Street up and
running, tens of thousands of people
were sent directly into harm’s way by
the Federal Government.
I went to Ground Zero days after the
attack. We knew even then that the air
was not safe, that the air was thick
with dust and debris, and we had no
idea what was swirling in those clouds
around us as we struggled to breathe.
But the Federal Government said it
was safe.
I think of those responders, first on
the rescue mission. And I don’t be-
grudge anybody who worked on the pile
in the first 3 days when people may
have still been alive who worked with-
out proper respiratory protection to
save lives. But after the first 3 days, it
was a recovery mission; and people
worked, breathing that air, for hours
and days without adequate protection.
I think of the families sent back to
their apartments in Lower Manhattan
and told to wipe away the layers of as-
bestos from their furniture and their
windows with a damp cloth.
I think of the students sitting in
their classrooms at Stuyvesant High
School, blocks from Ground Zero, and
the barges removing debris as trucks
full of asbestos idled below the high
school’s open windows.
The Federal Government bears the
burden to care for and support all those
who went back to Ground Zero because
the Federal Government told them it
was safe when it was not safe.
And since the day the EPA and oth-
ers told people it was safe to go back to
work, to school, and to their homes,
since the day the EPA told those re-
sponders at Ground Zero that it was
safe to work with minimal protection,
I have been fighting alongside my col-
leagues Mrs. MALONEY and Mr. KING to
secure healthcare and support for the
people who became sick because of that
exposure.
We fought for nearly 10 years to get
the first Zadroga Act passed in 2010.
That bill created the World Trade Cen-
ter Health Program and reopened the
Victim Compensation Fund.
But we only authorized the VCF for 5
years. We knew we needed more than 5
years, and we came back in 2015 and
passed the reauthorization bill.
That bill made the health program
permanent—or, at least, until 2090—
which gave much-needed certainty to
those suffering from 9/11 illnesses and
their families. But, again, we author-
ized the Victim Compensation Fund,
the VCF, for just another 5 years.
As those 5 years have gone on, people
have become sicker. More and more re-
sponders and survivors have been diag-
nosed with various cancers, particu-
larly cancers with long latency periods,
and, tragically, more and more have
died from those illnesses.
As people become sicker and pass
away, the VCF has functioned exactly
as Congress directed. It has provided
those individuals, those first respond-
ers, those survivors, and their families
with compensation and resources they
need to get through these difficult
times.
But, just as people are getting sicker,
the VCF is running out of money. Last
month, the Justice Department an-
nounced that, because of the high de-
mand for claims, because the cancers
are more numerous than anticipated,
because more people of the heroes of
9/11 than anticipated are getting sick,
the Department would be forced to cut
awards by 50 percent if they were filed
by February 1 and 70 percent if they
were filed after February 1.
Can you imagine that? You are dying
of stomach cancer, unable to work, un-
able to leave your house for more than
your doctor’s appointments, and wait-
ing for compensation so you can pay
off your house and protect your family
before you die, and the award you an-
ticipated is cut in half or by 70 percent.
Your wife dies after a long struggle
with breast cancer, and you are wait-
ing for your claim to pay her funeral
expenses, and your compensation is cut
in half or by 70 percent.
You have such severe gastro-
intestinal issues that you can only
work part-time. You are waiting for
your award to pay for your child’s col-
lege tuition, and your claim is cut by
70 percent.
That is not the promise we made to
those first responders and survivors.
That is not fulfilling the moral obliga-
tion that pushed us to create the VCF
in the first place.
That is failing Lincoln’s statement of
our duty ‘‘to care for him who shall
have borne the battle and for his widow
and his orphan.’’
That is failing our promise to never
forget 9/11 and failing the brave men
and women who helped us on that day
and who struggle and fight to this day.
But that doesn’t have to happen. If
we pass the Never Forget the Heroes
Act, we can stop these cuts and make
the Victim Compensation Fund perma-
nent, providing responders and sur-
vivors the certainty that, no matter
how sick they get, they will have us at
their backs and the resources they
need.
I thank my colleagues who have been
with us in this fight from the start, and
I thank the 142 bipartisan cosponsors
who have already signed on to this bill.
We will get this done. We must get
this done. We will meet our moral obli-
gations.
We will never forget these heroes.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I
thank Chairman NADLER for his re-
marks tonight and for his leadership
through the years. It is a very impor-
tant voice from New York City, from
Ground Zero, and something that
couldn’t have possibly impacted the
heart of his district any more than
what was the largest attack on our soil
on September 11, 2001.
Yet the silver lining of that attack
was seeing the spirit, the fight, the grit
of his constituents, of my constituents,
of constituents from 433 out of 435 dis-
tricts in our entire country who re-
sponded after September 11, 2001.
A lot of Members of this Chamber
don’t realize that 9/11 first responders
came from almost every single con-
gressional district represented here.

But it was all throughout Chairman
NADLER’s district on September 11,
2001, that we saw people going into
danger while everyone else was running
out, and it reminded us of the strength
of New Yorkers, the pride and strength
and courage of Americans.
There has certainly been great sac-
rifice since but, most importantly, sac-
rifice from those who have been vic-
tims because of September 11, 2001, ei-
ther due to the attack that day or serv-
ice in our military.
As we are here tonight, there are 9/11
first responders who are very sick, and
I just want to, right before we close,
share one quick story.
This is a constituent of mine from
East Hampton. This is a single mother,
a sole provider of her 12-year-old son,
who lived and worked within blocks of
the World Trade Center on 9/11 and dur-
ing the aftermath.
She said: ‘‘My colleagues and I saw it
as our patriotic duty to show the ter-
rorists that they could not destroy our
neighborhood and way of life.’’
I think, many times, people forget
that, in the aftermath of 9/11, we were
not only tending to Ground Zero, but
we were rebuilding the spirit of our Na-
tion.
It is thanks to Americans like this
constituent of mine and her coworkers
and all those who faced the uncon-
scionable horror, who did not cower in
fear, that our Nation rose stronger
than ever.
In late 2017, she was diagnosed with
stage III ovarian cancer, which has
never occurred on either side of her
family.
Her coworker at the time of 9/11 de-
veloped prostate cancer, and three of
her coworkers now have an extremely
rare skin condition.
In response to learning that the fund
is running out of money and would cut
claims by 70 percent, she said: ‘‘I don’t
think I can properly express in writing
how devastated I feel. Even worse, I
feel extremely distraught over the oth-
ers who are in the same situation as
me or who are about to find they are
. . . as they will, too, receive a dev-
astating diagnosis like mine.’’
The one other story is Kevin from
Smithtown. I represent a district that
is just over 50 miles from Ground Zero,
and fighting for my constituents who
were affected by September 11 is my
job, but it is also very personal.
Kevin is a former NYPD officer who
said he ‘‘picked up human remains for
2 days, without any hesitation, because
at the time that is what had to be
done.’’
He continued to work on and around
the pile for close to 12 months.
In January of 2018, Kevin was diag-
nosed with non-Hodgkin’s diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma and underwent 6
months of chemotherapy, which left
him with devastating symptoms that
will stay with him the rest of his life.
He wrote to me about how he missed
many important moments and family
functions with his children and loved
ones. He said: ‘‘To give out awards re-
duced by 70 percent is a slap in my face
and all others that are now suffering,’’
and he is right.
When he was working the pile day
and night for months on end, he wasn’t
thinking about himself or what this
might mean for his future. He was
thinking about our Nation. He was
committed to getting the remains of
victims of 9/11 home to those who sur-
vived them.
Kevin was there for us, and it is im-
portant for all of us to step up to the
plate for him.
Lastly, I thank Congresswoman
MALONEY, Congressman KING, and
Chairman NADLER for taking the lead
on this legislation yet again. I thank
Congressman ROSE for coleading to-
night’s Special Order. Hopefully, it is
the start of something new and that we
will see more often: bipartisan Special
Orders on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
I think our constituents back home
all across America want to see more of
us working together to get good things
done. It makes them feel good that
their government is working for them.
But I will tell you, with regards to
the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, it
is not until this Chamber, the Senate,
and the President signs it that this is
done, fully funded, that we are going to
be able to take credit for anything
good and right, because this needs to
actually get over the finish line.
Tonight is just another positive step.
Everyone signing on as cosponsors is a
positive step. And I hope that everyone
who is watching, whether you are a
Member of this Chamber, you are a
staffer of a Member of this Chamber, or
you are an advocate, that you get in-
volved, cosponsor, to get our numbers
up.
I thank Madam Speaker for her lead-
ership tonight with this effort, for pre-
siding over the Chamber during this
very important hour, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
f
STATUS OF ABORTION IN
AMERICA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker,
today I would like to address the sta-
tus of abortion in America.
In the past 2 months, there have been
two stories that show a significant
shift, I believe, in America regarding
the status of abortion.
In New York, one of our original 13
Colonies, they recently expanded the
right to have abortions up to 9 months
and, as a practical matter, left it to be
okay for a baby born alive not to re-
ceive protection. The Governor of New
York was so proud of this situation
that he lit up the World Trade Center
and people applauded in the Senate
chamber.
In Virginia, another one of our origi-
nal 13 States, the Governor came out
for a bill that also allows 9-month
abortions. The morally bereft Governor
said that, if a baby was born alive, that
baby would only be resuscitated if the
mother wanted.
By the way, I want to point out here
there is this myth out there that late-
term abortions are only for babies who
may not survive.
I once heard a speech from a woman
who quit a late-term abortion clinic in
Ohio. She was there only one day. At
that time, there were six babies deliv-
ered. Five had no health problems
whatsoever, and the other had either
spina bifida—I think it was spina
bifida. And, of course, many people live
productive lives with that disease.
Only 10 years ago, Kermit Gosnell of
Philadelphia was convicted of deliv-
ering babies alive and killing them
after they were born—perhaps hun-
dreds, perhaps thousands.
b 2045
You can read about them in a book
by that name, ‘‘Gosnell.’’ There is a
movie out as well; kind of very inter-
esting to see the mindset of the abor-
tion industry.
But Gosnell was defiant. When they
talked to him after he was convicted,
as a practical matter, put in prison for
life, he said, in the end, he would be
vindicated. And I think when he said
vindicated, he meant in 10 years that
he felt America would come around to
the position that it would be okay to
kill a baby born alive.
Who would dream that less than 10
years later, Gosnell may be on the
verge of being proven right, and that
the moral compass of America had
shifted so much that it would be okay
to allow a born-alive baby to die.
How did we get here? There are a va-
riety of culprits to blame. Part of it, of
course, is the thinly disguised racism
of our old friend, Margaret Sanger,
founder of Planned Parenthood. And I
should point out that even Margaret
Sanger, feminist hero, was opposed to
abortion because as recently as 60
years ago, even among people of that
ilk, that would have been considered
something that you could never be for.
But she did want her organization to
reduce people from races she consid-
ered inferior, and this was typical of
the views of the early progressives.
We also have people viewing it also
as a way to hold down the people that
we consider undesirable.
Justice Ginsberg was quoted in the
New York Times that she thought Roe
was decided, in part, because of a con-
cern about population growth in popu-
lations we don’t want too many of.
Now, she was subsequently allowed to
say that that quote was taken out of
context, but that was the quote that
was listed. They kind of gave her a
chance to try to walk that thing back;
a chance that wasn’t given STEVE KING.
Later, the same point was made by
an article in the Harvard Journal cred-
iting abortion with the reduction in
crime rates.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2579
March 7, 2019
Part of the problem is the usual
weight of promiscuous politicians who
would obviously be for abortion; people
like the Ted Kennedys or Bill Clintons
or Bob Packwoods of the world; and,
obviously, there are a given number of
men who have a vested interest in
making sure abortion is always avail-
able.
Part of the problem is the pernicious
influence of Hollywood. The ‘‘Me Too
Movement’’ has opened up eyes as to
the mindset of powerful people in Hol-
lywood and that, perhaps, is one of the
reasons why the popular culture would
be all largely pro-choice to the extreme
or pro-abortion to the extreme.
But still, why is it in America that
we are such an outlier? John Adams
said that this country—that the Con-
stitution was put together for a mor-
ally and religious people. The Pilgrims
came from Europe to found a more de-
vout country. Yet, in Europe, a much
less religious country than ours, the
norm is no abortions after 12 weeks.
You look around. Germany, 12 weeks;
France, 12 weeks; Italy, 90 days; Por-
tugal, 10 weeks.
How did America wind up, in States
like New York saying, okay for 9
months?
And you look south of the border.
Mexico, most of their states don’t
allow abortion to this day; and it is 12
weeks in the area of Mexico City.
So, we will have to look further why
did this happen.
I had originally felt, with the advent
of the ultrasound, America would be-
come overwhelmingly pro-life. I had
toured abortion clinics when the
ultrasound was a little bit rare, and I
could see the language that was used to
mislead America as to what was going
on.
In the abortion industry, they don’t
use the word ‘‘abortion.’’ They talk
about ‘‘procedures.’’ They don’t even
use the word ‘‘fetus,’’ much less
‘‘baby.’’ They use the word ‘‘tissue.’’
But I felt the ultrasound would over-
come that language that I felt was one
of the reasons abortion was still so
common.
So who else can we blame?
Obviously, politicians have dropped
the ball. Obviously, we have horrible
judges who can look at the Constitu-
tion, a document founded for a moral
and religious people, and claim that
when our forefathers put together that
Constitution, they apparently expected
abortion to be legal, and abortion being
illegal for so much of this country’s
history.
To a certain extent, when you look
at the judges, I think we have to blame
the law schools, you know. Americans,
whatever polls you look at, bounce
back and forth between what people
would say is 50 percent pro-abortion, 50
percent pro-life.
I wonder, in the law schools, the law
school students, the law school faculty,
what those numbers are, which is
maybe one of the reasons why so few of
the judges seem to be able to get the
appropriate answer here.
But where I would like to put the at-
tention is, where are the churches?
You know, it must be kind of dif-
ficult to be a minister or a priest. You
have got to come up with 50 or 52 dif-
ferent topics a year to talk about.
Now, we have a situation going on in
this country where we peaked out at
over a million abortions a year, and we
are still over 600,000. You look what is
going on in Virginia, and you look at
what is going on in New York; and it
seems to me there is fertile ground for
the priest or minister looking for
something to say.
Nevertheless, I have taken to spend-
ing the last few weeks kind of talking
to people at random as to how often in
the past year, when the priests and
ministers are looking for 50 different
topics to talk about, how often they
have addressed the abortion issue.
It is not unusual, as a matter of fact,
I would say the majority of people I
talked to who go to a church, it is not
brought up at all. I mean, I will tell
you, it would be very difficult to come
up with 50 different topics a year. But
how you can come up with 50 different
topics a year, and with 600,000 abor-
tions in this country every year, and
not deal with that?
But I think a lot of the blame has to
lie there. Whenever there are great
tragedies in human history, I think
people expect the clergy to step up and
provide some moral guidance.
So I end this speech by saying three
things:
First of all, I ask the pro-life groups
not to give up.
Secondly, I ask the politicians to
bring forth bills like the Born-Alive
Abortion Survivors Protection Act,
which, by the way, in itself, shows
some weakness, and we have a rel-
atively weak bill. And that is, I guess,
what our pro-life position is today, or
the bill we can bring to the floor.
It is kind of sad that we didn’t even
get a final vote on that in the Senate,
but the bill should be brought up to
educate America on the state of abor-
tion in America right now.
And finally, and most importantly, I
ask the churches to finally step up.
You know, I look on a calendar, and
this June there will be five weekends.
Okay. So your average priest, your av-
erage minister out there is going to
have to think of five topics to talk
about.
So I would like to ask the people of
this country, and any clergy who hap-
pen to hear this speech, to devote at
least one of those 5 weeks in June to
this stain of over 600,000 abortions in
this country every year, and ask your-
self, what is the right or wrong thing
to do?
And if you are one of those clergy-
men who, over the last year has not ad-
dressed this issue—see, I am making
your life easier for you, you only have
to think of four other things to talk
about, rather than the five weekends in
June—I ask you to spend one week in
June addressing this issue and encour-
aging people to finally say no more of
this scourge in the United States.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

MEASURES PLACED ON THE
CALENDAR—H.R. 1271 AND H.R. 1381
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
understand there are two bills at the
desk due a second reading en bloc.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will read the measures by title
for the second time.
The bill clerk read as follows:
A bill (H.R. 1271) to establish in the
Department of Veterans Affairs a pilot
program instituting a clinical observa-
tion program for pre-med students pre-
paring to attend medical school.
A bill (H.R. 1381) to direct the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs to take ac-
tions necessary to ensure that certain
individuals may update the burn pit
registry with a registered individual’s
cause of death, and for other purposes.
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place
the measures on the calendar under the
provisions of rule XIV, I object to fur-
ther proceeding en bloc.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bills will be
placed on the calendar.
f
ANTI-SEMITISM
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, be-
fore I begin, I spoke yesterday about
the evil of anti-Semitism and the re-
cent disturbing invocation of anti-Se-
mitic stereotypes by a Member of the
House Democratic Conference. I took
for granted, as a result, that the House
Democrats would at least—at least—
make good on their plans to symboli-
cally condemn anti-Semitism.
Even as I called for the House Demo-
crats to do more and pass the sub-
stantive foreign policy legislation the
Senate sent them weeks ago, I at least
assumed a few pages of symbolism was
not too much to ask for, but alas, I
spoke too soon. The House has put off
consideration of a resolution to con-
demn anti-Semitism. Apparently, even
nonbinding symbolism—this is all they
were going to do—is too controversial
within their own caucus. Let me say
that again. Apparently, within the
Speaker’s new far-left Democratic ma-
jority, even a symbolic—symbolic—res-
olution condemning anti-Semitism
seems to be a bridge too far.
Well, I expect I and other Members
will have more to say on this subject,
but for today I would let this speak for
itself.
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now on another
matter, already this week the Senate
has confirmed two more well qualified
judicial nominees. Soon, Allison Rush-
ing and Chad Readler will take their
respective seats on the Fourth and
Sixth Circuit Courts of Appeals, and
later today the Senate will vote on
confirmation of Eric Murphy, also to
the Sixth Circuit. Together, these
nominees bring decades of legal experi-
ence, prestigious clerkships, and the
recognition of their peers. They will be
charged with upholding the Constitu-
tion and the rule of law, and each is
well equipped to do exactly that.
Now, my colleagues need no reminder
of Senate Democrats’ historic obstruc-
tion of nominations over the past 2
years. Under this administration, 135
nominations have required a cloture
vote—135 nominations have required a
cloture vote—and five times more were
required during the first 2 years than
in the same period of the last six ad-
ministrations combined—combined.
The final nomination we will con-
sider this week captures what I am
talking about perfectly. John Fleming
was nominated by the President to
serve as Assistant Secretary of Com-
merce for Economic Development on
June 20 of last year. This is an Assist-
ant Secretary of Commerce.
Mr. Fleming has an impressive
record. When the Environment and
Public Works Committee first consid-
ered his nomination last summer, a
significant bipartisan majority voted
to favorably report his nomination.
This is an Assistant Secretary of Com-
merce out of committee on a bipartisan
basis last summer, but partisan ob-
struction ran out the clock. The nomi-
nation was sent back to the President
at the end of the Congress.
So earlier this year Mr. Fleming was
resubmitted, returned to the same
committee, and was favorably reported
by the same bipartisan margin. But the
obstruction still wasn’t finished. Here

on the floor, I had to file cloture to en-
sure he would get a vote. I am pleased
that cloture could be withdrawn yes-
terday, and we will be happy to vote on
the confirmation today, just as hap-
pened last week on another nomina-
tion, but I am sorry these cloture fil-
ings and wasted time were needed for
these uncontroversial and impressive
nominees. I am sorry the case studies
of pointless obstruction just keep on
piling up.
f
H.R. 1
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now on another
matter, this week Democrats in the
House are expected to pass sweeping
legislation I call the Democratic politi-
cian protection act. It aims to give
Washington, DC, vast new control over
elections, give tax dollars to political
campaigns, and give election lawyers
more opportunities to determine the
outcome of our elections.
Today I want to discuss how it would
open up the bipartisan Federal Elec-
tion Commission to a hostile partisan
takeover.
When Congress passed and amended
the Federal Election Campaign Act
after Watergate, the FEC was created
as a six-member body, with an even
number of commissioners and no more
than three from the same party. At
least four votes—four—would be re-
quired to take action—a built-in safe-
guard against one party seizing control
of the FEC.
Well, House Democrats want to get
rid of that. Their Democratic politi-
cian protection act would cut the FEC
to a five-member body with two mem-
bers from each party and a nominal
Independent who, interestingly enough,
would be handpicked by whoever the
sitting President was.
Now, people on both sides of the aisle
used to see right through these kinds
of tricks. Back in 1976 Senator Alan
Cranston—a California Democrat who
was, by the way, the No. 2 Democrat in
the Senate—warned about this. He
said: ‘‘The FEC has such potential for
abuse in our democratic society that
the President should not be given
power over the Commission.’’
As recently as 2 years ago, an out-
going Democratic FEC commissioner—
one of the most active and liberal regu-
lators in the Commission’s history
said: ‘‘I don’t have a problem with the
3–3 split at the commission . . . it was
established that way in order to ensure
that there was not going to be a par-
tisan effort to use investigations
against one political party or an-
other.’’
But now—now—Democrats want to
scrap the neutrality and bring on the
partisan takeover. Democrats respond
by saying this fifth member would have
to be affiliated with neither the Repub-
lican nor Democratic Party. They
would have to be an Independent.
Give me a break. Give me a break.
One current commissioner is nomi-
nally an Independent, except the Wash-
ington Post reports this gentleman
‘‘often votes with the Democrats,’’ and
he happens to be a longtime friend of
former Majority Leader Harry Reid. He
had actually previously worked as an
election lawyer for Senator Reid. This
is the Independent on the FEC now. He
had often worked as an election lawyer
for Senator Reid to help ensure he won
close elections. In fact, Senator Reid
repeatedly slipped and characterized
this gentleman as the Democratic
nominee several times here on the
floor.
This is our current Independent on
the FEC?
So I think we all know what kind of
Independent fifth commissioner a
Democratic President would select—
one who would join with other Demo-
crats and champion the campaigns of
the left, while bringing waves of inves-
tigations, hearings, and subpoenas
against their political opponents and
punishing groups who dared to dis-
agree.
What is more, the Democratic Politi-
cian Protection Act would give the sit-
ting President the chance to name the
Chairperson of the FEC, abandoning
the current practice of rotating Chair-
men, and this person would get broad
new powers, like the sole authority to
issue subpoenas and to compel testi-
mony and the ability to hire and fire
the general counsel with just two more
votes from just one party.
So make no mistake, the Democrats
are envisioning a hostile takeover of
the body that regulates political
speech, designed to tilt the playing
field in their direction. Democrats
claim this is necessary because the cur-
rent structure is ‘‘dysfunctional.’’
Well, let’s look at some of the cur-
rent dysfunction and where it is com-
ing from. Let’s look at the Democrat
who currently serves as the FEC Chair.
She has been a Commissioner for 16
years. In fact, her term ended 11 years
ago, but she has been held over ever
since, and now this seasoned veteran of
the left’s anti-speech crusade has an-
nounced that she will bar the FEC’s at-
torneys from defending the Commis-
sion when liberal watchdogs come after
it in court.
By unilaterally withholding her vote,
she plans to make the FEC essentially
forfeit its legal fights against liberal
groups by simply not showing up. So
the defendants in these matters would
be out of luck unless they happen to
have the financial means to keep up
their own defense.
This Democrat Commissioner has
also indicated that if this trick doesn’t
produce the political outcome she is
after, she is willing to simply ignore
subsequent court orders altogether.
This is a current member of the FEC.
So House Democrats are lecturing
about dysfunction at the FEC, but it is
their ally who is now using her vote to
tie the FEC’s hands behind its back.
Democrats and their allies claim Re-
publicans are keeping the FEC from
enforcing campaign finance laws. That
is their talking point for all of these
radical changes. But let’s take a look
at who is really refusing to work with-
in the law. The Democratic Chair-
woman says she will keep the FEC
from defending itself and is threat-
ening to disobey court orders. That is
my definition of dysfunction.
Democrats aren’t after an FEC that
enforces the law. They want an FEC
that advances their particular ide-
ology. These current words and these
current antics prove it, and the Demo-
cratic politician protection act would
make it much, much worse.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

f
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, for all
of the Senate’s vaunted traditions
about grand debates, we very rarely
practice the actual art—the real back
and forth, the exchange of ideas. For
weeks now, we have heard our Repub-
lican colleagues come to the floor and
rail against the Green New Deal, as the
leader just did. Democrats have simply
been trying to get a few honest answers
out of the Republican leadership about
their position on climate change so
that we might have a real debate.
Yesterday, as Republican after Re-
publican lined up to give speeches
against taking bold action on climate
change, several Democrats tried to
steer the conversation in a more posi-
tive direction by asking our Repub-
lican colleagues simple questions—and
I ask this again of every Republican,
particularly of Leader MCCONNELL: Do
you, Leader MCCONNELL, and our Re-
publican friends believe climate change
is real? Yes or no? Do you believe that
climate change is caused by human ac-
tivity? Yes or no? Most importantly,
do you believe Congress should do
something about it? Yes or no?
If our colleagues believe it is a prob-
lem and agree to that, what is their
plan to deal with climate change? We
know they don’t like the Green New
Deal. They have made that clear. It
doesn’t forward the debate. But what is
their plan?
We might have ruffled some feathers
on the other side. I think my col-
leagues just wanted to give speeches on
the Green New Deal and then leave the
floor. It is a sad state of affairs when
even a little debate, even heated de-
bate, is something unsettling here in
the Senate. But I have to give credit to
the few Republicans who did engage us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1719
March 7, 2019
A few said they did believe in climate
change and offered some examples of
minor legislation where our parties
could work together to begin tackling
this crisis. I give them credit for that.
But here is the problem: When is Lead-
er MCCONNELL going to schedule time
for consideration of this and other cli-
mate change legislation? We Demo-
crats are ready to work. Will Leader
MCCONNELL bring his own Members’
clean energy legislation to the floor?
Others have said that climate change
is happening, but the free market could
take care of it through ‘‘innovation.’’
With all due respect, that doesn’t mean
much. Most of us would agree we live
in an incredible time of innovation and
technology, yet we continue to pour
even more carbon into the atmosphere
than in previous years, not less. Left
alone, the market has proved incapable
of curing climate change for the simple
reason of what economists call
externalities. You run a coal plant; you
make the profits from selling the elec-
tricity that the coal plant produces,
but you don’t pay the price for the car-
bon you put in the air. So it is not
going to happen through the free mar-
ket alone because of what even Adam
Smith recognized: There are
externalities that have to be captured,
and it is government’s job to at least
make sure they are captured.
Another block of Republicans took a
different tack. A few of our Republican
colleagues said yesterday that climate
change was real but only because the
climate has always been changing and
all flora and fauna contribute to it.
‘‘What are we to do,’’ they say, as they
throw up their hands and look to the
sky, ‘‘ban volcanoes?’’
Unbelievable. What an amazing ca-
nard that is. Those who said it—and
there were a few right here yesterday—
would get an F in middle school Earth
science with that kind of reasoning. We
all know—at least we all ought to
know—that human activity, particu-
larly the burning of fossil fuels, has
pushed the amount of carbon in our at-
mosphere to record levels, trapping
more heat than ever before and chang-
ing the climate in ways not seen before
in our history.
Maybe denying or misleading about
climate change is considered accept-
able in the modern Republican Party,
where it has come to be expected, and
we wonder why that is so. Some argue
it is because people don’t believe in
science. Some argue it is because they
just are stuck in the status quo. And
some argue it is because there is a lot
of oil money cascading into the Repub-
lican Party, when you read about all
these multimillionaire and billionaire
new oil magnates who send tons of
money there. Some argue that. You
can’t prove which one is true, but we
do know it leads to terrible, terrible in-
action.
So I would like to see my colleagues
who don’t admit the severity of cli-
mate change go talk to the farmers in
Iowa dealing with drought, the fisher-
men in Alaska and North Carolina, the
homeowners in Florida and the Moun-
tain West. See if denying recent cli-
mate change works there. It sure
doesn’t work on the south coast of
Long Island, where we had Sandy,
which made believers out of many who
were skeptical in the past.
Nonetheless, we made some progress
yesterday. At the very least, my
friends on the other side know they
will not able to execute their standard
playbook. Democrats are not going to
sit around while Republicans come to
the floor and yell about socialism as
they have the past two decades. We are
going to make Republicans answer core
questions about real change. That is
what America wants.
One of the reasons all of these scare
tactics didn’t work in 2018 and the
House is now Democratic and we kept
most of our seats, even in very red
States—I suspect many of my more
reasonable colleagues would prefer
that—a real debate—over ‘‘gotcha’’ pol-
itics that Leader MCCONNELL is so
adept at playing and is playing once
again with this cynical Green New Deal
ploy.
f
VOTING RIGHTS
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on an-
other matter, voting rights, today
marks the 54th anniversary of Bloody
Sunday, the protest march in Selma,
AL, that led ultimately to the passage
of the Voting Rights Act.
It was one of the most noble acts in
American history. The courage of those
who marched across that bridge, in-
cluding our colleague, JOHN LEWIS, will
be remembered centuries from now. It
is a reminder that one thread of the
American story is about how, despite
our founding, our democratic prin-
ciples, there has been a long march to-
ward achieving the franchise.
We had democratic principles in the
beginning. It was brand new. It was
great, but remember, in 1789, in almost
every State, the only people who could
vote were White, male, Protestant
property owners. I would imagine that
would probably leave out even a major-
ity in this Chamber who would be able
to vote.
We have to keep improving that de-
mocracy. No one says we should only
have White, male, Protestant property
owners vote today because it was true
in 1789. We have to move forward. We
have to make voting more available
and easier because the right to vote,
without barriers, is what our soldiers,
for centuries, have died for and what
the people on that bridge marched for.
The march is still not over. In the
wake of the disaster that was the Su-
preme Court’s Shelby decision, 19
States rushed to pass discriminatory
voter restrictions.
In North Carolina, the Republican
State legislature drew up laws that
‘‘targeted African Americans with al-
most surgical precision.’’ How des-
picable. How despicable that the Re-
publican legislature did that. Those are
not my words; those are the court’s
words after looking at the evidence.
Fifty million Americans are now not
registered to vote. Even though we
don’t talk about it enough, we have a
population larger than two States liv-
ing here in Washington, DC, without
full congressional representation. We
Democrats are ready to work.
Again, Leader MCCONNELL gets up,
and he talks about all of this nega-
tivity, exaggeration, hyping, and scar-
ing just like Donald Trump. Why
doesn’t Leader MCCONNELL put some
legislation on the floor? Today, on the
anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I want
to mention three things we could do
right now to bolster voting rights: one,
undo the damage of the Shelby County
decision by restoring the formula for
preclearance; two, automatic voter
registration; three, DC statehood.
Anyone who has been observing the
floor of the Senate will have noticed by
now just how vociferously our Repub-
lican leader opposes H.R. 1, which,
among other things, would make elec-
tion day a Federal holiday and attempt
to get Big Money out of politics. Lead-
er MCCONNELL has gone on to call these
ideas a power grab, labeling the bill the
Democratic politician protection Act.
Leader MCCONNELL, we are proud
that we want more people to vote. Why
are you ashamed of it? Why do you run
away from it?
Leader MCCONNELL, we are proud
that we want to get the influence of
big, special interest money out of poli-
tics. Why do you say that is partisan?
It is the wrong thing to do, and 90 per-
cent of all Americans, Democratic and
Republican, don’t like to see Big
Money cascading into politics. Argue
the merits, Leader.
When you think doing those things
are democratic things, we are proud,
and the Republican Party should be
ashamed that they are not for them
and have to call them names. To say
that allowing more Americans to vote
and getting Big Money out of politics
is bad for Republicans and good for
Democrats, that says a lot right there.
It is a dark day—a dark day—for the
Republican Party if their leader in the
Senate has to argue against more
Americans voting because it would
hurt their party at the polls. Maybe we
should go back to the old days and
have fewer people vote, like in 1789,
when only White, male, Protestant
property owners could vote. Come on.
This idea that having more people vote
is a Democratic power grab, when it is
part of the fundamental root of our de-
mocracy—it is an act of desperation by
the Republican leader.
I don’t think it is a coincidence that
the Republican leader has pledged to
bring up his version of the Green New
Deal for a vote but not H.R. 1. He is
happy to twist words against it him-
self, but he knows voting rights are a
hard thing to argue about.
If he wants to try to bring it up on
the floor, we welcome it. We welcome a

discussion. Make no mistake, Demo-
crats are going to fight to make the

tempts to disenfranchise American
citizens, and get the influence of big
special interest money out of politics.
f
CHINA
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, fi-
nally, on China, news reports continue
to suggest that President Trump is
close to cementing an agreement with
Beijing that, unfortunately for Amer-
ica and for American workers, would
fall far right of expectations.
Earlier this week, the New York
Times reported that China is drafting
new laws on foreign investments to
pacify the United States, but those new
laws do not include any changes to how
China forces American businesses to
transfer technology and know-how as
the cost of doing business.
If our best companies were allowed to
sell to China unfettered, they would
have huge amounts of profit, and they
would employ huge amounts of people
in America more. China doesn’t let
that happen, but they can sell freely
here.
The President was right to target
China. The President was right to im-
pose tariffs on China. The President
will have taken defeat out of the jaws
of an almost victory if he now backs off
for the sake of a photo op or some brief
changes in what China purchases and
forsakes American wealth and Amer-
ican workers, while China is stealing
our wealth and jobs from our workers
every single day.
If President Trump accepts a short-
term purchase of American goods in ex-
change for a reduction in our tariffs
without structural reform to China’s
predatory trade practices, shame on
him. If he thinks that photo op will
help him; it will not. If he thinks a
temporary, little bump in China buying
more soybeans or more steel products
will help; it will not. He will lose be-
cause one of the best things he has
done—something I, many other Demo-
crats, and many other Americans have
praised him for—will be gone. I have
publicly given the President credit
when he has taken on China.
As I said, Americans have lost mil-
lions—trillions—of dollars of wealth
and millions of jobs to Chinese IP
theft. The President has been right to
challenge China on those issues. His
tariffs have brought China to the nego-
tiating table, but now that China is at
the table, President Trump must not
walk away without achieving what he
set out to achieve.
In short, to cut an unacceptable
deal—a weak deal, a photo-op deal—at
this stage would be to squander the
historic moment to put American busi-
nesses, workers, and inventors on a
level playing field at long last, and it
would be viewed as a capitulation by
the President on one of his signature
issues. It would be the inverse of what
he did on North Korea.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

MEDICARE
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I am
sure everyone remembers the Demo-
crats’ ObamaCare promise: ‘‘If you like
your health care plan, you can keep
it.’’ That promise was named
PolitiFacts’ ‘‘Lie of the Year’’ in 2013
after it became clear that millions of
Americans would not, in fact, be able
to keep their healthcare plans. There
are no worries about being deceived on
the question of keeping your insurance
this time around because Democrats
are loudly and proudly announcing
their intention of getting rid of private
insurance with their Medicare for All
plan.
At a CNN townhall in February, the
junior Senator from Vermont was
asked: ‘‘Will these people be able to
keep their health insurance plans,
their private plans through their em-
ployers, if there is a Medicare for All
program that you endorse?’’
The answer of the Senator from
Vermont was no.
Another Democratic candidate for
President, the junior Senator from New
York, was recently asked: ‘‘Should end-
ing private insurance, as we know it,
be a Democratic . . . goal? And do you
think it is an urgent goal?’’
Her response: ‘‘Oh yeah, it is a goal
. . . an urgent goal.’’
If you like your health insurance,
you definitely will not be able to keep
it. In fact, the employer-sponsored in-
surance that you have today would be
illegal under the Democrats’ plan. In
the minds of Democrats, Americans are
supposed to be enthusiastic about
Medicare for All because it would give
them free healthcare. The problem, of
course, is it will not really be free.
Americans are still going to be paying
for healthcare; it will just be in the
form of much higher taxes.
A left-leaning think tank modeled a
version of the Medicare for All plan
proposed by the junior Senator from
Vermont and found that it would cost a
staggering $32 trillion over 10 years. To
put that in perspective, the entire Fed-
eral budget for 2019 is less than $5 tril-
lion. That is Medicare, Medicaid, So-
cial Security, defense spending, edu-
cation spending, law enforcement, in-
frastructure—everything. In other
words, Democrats are talking about in-
creasing Federal spending by more
than 60 percent each year just for
healthcare. One Medicare expert esti-
mates that doubling the amount of in-
dividual and corporate income tax col-
lected would not be enough to cover
the cost of Medicare for All.
I don’t know about my Democratic
colleagues, but I don’t know a lot of
working families who could afford to
have their tax bill literally double. Of
course, this is assuming that the cost
of the program would be limited to $32
trillion. The Medicare for All proposal
the House Democrats released last
week could substantially exceed the $32
trillion estimate because, unlike the
Vermont Senator’s plan, it includes
funding for long-term care, a notori-
ously expensive part of the healthcare
system.
Democrats’ last attempt to have the
government fund long-term care fell
apart before it was even implemented
because the program was not finan-
cially viable.
It is not just the cost of Medicare for
All that is completely unrealistic; the
timeline for implementation is as well.
House Democrats’ proposal would put
every American on Medicare for All
within 2 years. We have 2 years to com-
pletely do away with healthcare as we
know it and create an entirely new
healthcare program to cover almost
every single American.
I am sure most Americans remember
the fiasco that was ObamaCare imple-
mentation. The Obama administration
had 31⁄2 years to get ObamaCare up and
running, and they couldn’t even build a
working website in that amount of
time. The ObamaCare exchanges were
intended only to cover a tiny fraction
of the number of people who would be
covered under Medicare for All. The
idea that the Federal Government
could smoothly transition all Ameri-
cans over to an entirely new govern-
ment-run healthcare program in 2
years is absolutely ludicrous. Making
the attempt would cause Americans an
incredible amount of pain. Every as-
pect of this proposal would cause
Americans an incredible amount of
pain.
There are the heavy taxes that would
be required to even partially pay for

this program and the bureaucracy and
inefficiency that would come with any
government attempt to take over
healthcare.
Then there is the rationing of care
that would inevitably come along.
Democrats are promising that these
would be plans with generous coverage,
but what happens when Democrats
don’t have the money to pay for that
coverage? Well, they can raise taxes
higher, of course.
Yet they will also undoubtedly turn
to the rationing of care that we have
seen in other countries with socialized
medicine. The majority leader noted on
the floor last week that Britain’s Na-
tional Health Service canceled 25,000
surgeries in the first quarter of last
year alone.
I could go on. I could talk about the
long wait times Americans would expe-
rience under Medicare for All. I could
talk about the fact that the Demo-
crats’ proposal would end the prohibi-
tion on government funding for abor-
tion, meaning that your tax dollars
would go toward ending the lives of
preborn babies, whether you want them
to or not.
I can talk about the threat that
Medicare for All represents for seniors
because, make no mistake, this pro-
gram would do away with Medicare as
we know it and the promises that have
been made to seniors in this country.
Seniors would receive care under the
new plan, but it would not be the plan
they signed up for, and there is no
guarantee that they would receive the
benefits the Democrats are promising.
If I went on about all the ways that
Medicare for All is a bad idea, none of
my colleagues would have a chance to
speak for the rest of the day or prob-
ably tomorrow, for that matter, either.
Suffice it to say that Medicare for All
would be a very bad deal for the Amer-
ican people.
Let’s hope that our colleagues across
the aisle halt their mad rush toward
socialism before the American people
get stuck with this government-run
nightmare.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.
NOMINATION OF JOHN FLEMING
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I
rise today in support of Dr. John Flem-
ing’s nomination to be the Assistant
Secretary of Commerce for Economic
Development, otherwise known as the
Administrator of the Economic Devel-
opment Administration, or EDA.
I view this as an opportunity not
only to speak about the qualifications
of a former colleague of mine—we
served in the House together—but also
to highlight the EDA’s work in my
home State of West Virginia.
The EDA did not always play an ac-
tive role in West Virginia, which is
really odd when you consider that we
have no shortage of economic develop-
ment and infrastructure needs and
challenges in our State. Yet, at my in-
sistence and through the collaboration
of my staff, we have turned a corner.
Today, we are beginning to see real in-
vestments that will make a lasting dif-
ference in West Virginia.
To highlight the insignificant
amount West Virginia received before I
became a Senator, in the 2 years prior
to my swearing in—2013 and 2014—the
State received a total of $200,000 from
EDA outside of normal planning
grants. These were mostly for tech-
nical assistance.
When I came to the Senate and real-
ized this, I made it a top priority of
mine to ensure that West Virginia se-
cured more Federal dollars to develop
our economy and create new opportuni-
ties. I made it clear to EDA at the time
that the status quo was absolutely un-
acceptable.
I am glad to say we are now achiev-
ing results, as evidenced by the close to
$30 million that EDA has invested in
West Virginia since 2015. By bringing
everyone to the table and working with
State and local economic development
officials, we were able to foster a re-
newed focus on West Virginia needs to
the benefit of these local projects.
In addition to EDA’s bringing on a
State representative, which was cru-
cial—a State representative to focus
just on our State, to directly interface
with our communities—we are ensur-
ing dollars will go toward projects that
will contribute to the future of West
Virginia.
At a time when my State and other
parts of the country are seeking to re-
orient their economies toward indus-
tries of the future—like technology and
advanced manufacturing—these are the
kinds of projects that the Federal Gov-
ernment should be prioritizing.
Let me give you a few examples. Just
last month, I joined local officials in
Greenbrier County to announce $1.5
million in EDA funding to bring pota-
ble water to 50 homes and a new busi-
ness that will employ over 200 people.
Keep in mind, these are projects that
are collaborative projects. It is not just
solely Federal dollars that go into it.
There are city, county, and private dol-
lars as well.
In November of last year, EDA an-
nounced that it would invest $1 million
in the city of Bluefield for the Exit 1
project, a 15-acre development that
will serve as a catalyst for business
growth and create almost 250 jobs. And
1 year ago in March, the EDA invested
close to $5 million in just 1 day to
make infrastructure improvements at
three separate sites across the State.
This funding will promote job growth
and retention of jobs in these three
counties through added efficiencies in
essential infrastructure.
One of these projects I will talk
about is in northern West Virginia,
where I am originally from, and it will
be to rehabilitate the Wheeling
Corrugating steel plant complex in
Brooke County, all the way near the
top of the northern panhandle. This
project will, at a minimum, create 95
new jobs, retain 45 jobs, and attract
private capital beyond an initial in-
vestment of more than $1 million. This
isn’t funding for a conference of stake-
holders or another study just to sit on
a shelf and collect dust. These are real
dollars going toward real projects. Our
local leaders know what they need, and
many of the local economic develop-
ment officials tell me they have been
‘‘studied to death.’’
I am happy to say that through our
efforts, local and State officials are
getting the help they have been asking
for. Dr. Fleming and I spoke at length
about these efforts when he visited my
office and during his nomination hear-
ing before the EPW Committee. He as-
sured me of his commitment to follow
Congress’s intent to continue the pro-
grams under EDA, as evidenced by the
increased in funding EDA received
through the appropriations process.
As a successful businessman and
former Member of Congress from Lou-
isiana—and as he has made clear in his
conversations with me and through his
testimony—I trust that Dr. Fleming
understands the needs of communities
like those in West Virginia. I look for-
ward to working with him after he is
confirmed, and I invite him, as I have
before, to come to my home State to
see the great work that is being done
with the investments that the EDA has
chosen to make in West Virginia.
When the Federal Government serves
as a willing partner for all parts of the
country, regardless of whether they are
urban or rural, we can promote eco-
nomic growth and opportunities for all
Americans. As chair of the EPW Trans-
portation and Infrastructure Sub-
committee and as a member of the Ap-
propriations and Commerce Commit-
tees, I will continue to advocate for
programs that contribute not just to a
brighter future for my State of West
Virginia but also for the entire coun-
try.
I yield the floor.

TITLE X
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President,
since day one of the Trump administra-
tion, the Republicans have done every-
thing they can to cater to an extreme
rightwing base by undermining wom-
en’s access to the healthcare they need
and the healthcare providers they
trust.
They have moved to roll back re-
quirements that insurance companies
include birth control as an essential
health benefit, which would mean mil-
lions of women would go back to pay-
ing extra for birth control on top of
their coverage. They have held votes
on extreme abortion bans that would
get in between a woman and her doc-
tor. They have jammed the courts,
even the Supreme Court, with par-
tisans who have made clear they share

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1722 March 7, 2019
the extreme and frightening goal of
overturning Roe v. Wade and of taking
away a woman’s constitutional right to
safe, legal abortion in the United
States of America.
Most recently, the Trump adminis-
tration has put forward a deeply harm-
ful rule that would jeopardize access to
affordable reproductive healthcare for
the millions of men and women who de-
pend on title X, our Nation’s family
planning program, which historically
has had bipartisan support. If this rule
goes into effect, providers at health
centers that receive title X funding
will be blocked—gagged—from even
telling patients about where and how
to get a safe, legal abortion as part of
a discussion of reproductive healthcare
options.
The rule would also impose new,
medically unnecessary requirements
that would make it impossible for
Planned Parenthood centers, which
serve 41 percent of the title X patients,
to continue to participate. Four mil-
lion people—disproportionately young
people, low-income women, and women
of color—go to title X-funded centers,
including to Planned Parenthood cen-
ters, for birth control, for lifesaving
cancer screenings, for STD tests, and
more each year, and this rule puts the
care they depend on in jeopardy.
The Republicans here in the Capitol
may have no idea what it would mean
for patients to lose access to the pro-
viders they trust and the affordable
care they need, but that is not because
those patients and their doctors and
their communities have not been
speaking up—they have been. People
across the country—women and men,
doctors, city and county health offi-
cials, religious groups, advocates—told
this administration as it was devel-
oping this rule that they did not want
to see providers at title X barred from
giving them medically sound informa-
tion or have patients be denied access
to providers they trust at Planned Par-
enthood because the Republicans think
they know better.
The final rule the Trump administra-
tion released shows it ignored those
who personally know how much it mat-
ters to have unbiased, quality care at
title X centers, including at Planned
Parenthood. The Republicans might
have ignored those voices, but we
Democrats are not going to. So I am
releasing a memo today that will high-
light statements that were submitted
in strong opposition to this rule by
people from across the country. I want
to make absolutely sure that the Re-
publicans have every opportunity to
hear what patients and providers have
to say. I want to give a few examples.
One patient called her visit to a
Planned Parenthood to get a Pap
smear a ‘‘lifesaver.’’
Another wrote: ‘‘Young people like
me rely on Title X for access to family
planning services at the provider of our
choice.’’
A mother and sister from Nevada
told the Trump administration:
I too have sisters and four daughters. We
are capable, adept, and able to make deci-
sions for ourselves. We want to make in-
formed decisions. . . . Withholding informa-
tion is misinformation and manipulation.
County health officials and
healthcare providers repeatedly urged
the administration that this rule would
‘‘interfere in the doctor-patient rela-
tionship’’ and was ‘‘an infringement on
the ethical principles that medical pro-
viders adhere to’’ with potentially ‘‘ir-
reversible’’ impacts in struggling com-
munities.
Since it, apparently, needs to be said
on the Senate floor, I would like to re-
mind my colleagues that what these
patients, healthcare providers, and
community leaders are saying about
the importance of a woman’s ability to
make her own healthcare decisions is
not controversial. People in this coun-
try overwhelmingly agree that women
should be able to get birth control.
They agree that no matter how much
money you make or where you live,
you should be able to get a cancer
screening that could save your life and,
yes, that women should be able to exer-
cise their constitutional right to safe,
legal abortion.
I challenge the Republicans today to
read the memo I am releasing. Listen
to the women and men whom this rule
hurts and from the people who are
working to help them get the care they
need. Then join the Democrats in
standing up against this dangerous, un-
ethical step backward because, right
now, it is pretty clear, once again, that
the Republicans want to make women’s
health a political battlefield instead of
a serious priority.
Let me be clear. The Democrats are
going to keep standing up for a wom-
an’s right to the care that is right for
her. We are going to continue to stand
up for women’s access to affordable
birth control, for women’s constitu-
tionally protected rights, and against
those who want to put politicians in
the doctor’s office, where they do not
ever belong. If that is a fight the Re-
publicans want to have, we are ready
and so are people across the country,
like the brave ones who spoke up
against this very harmful rule.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I come to
the floor today to talk about what I be-
lieve is a real crisis at the southern
border. I think there is even a case to
be made that we have challenges at the
northern border, but I want to focus on
what the narrative here in the country
has been over the past couple of
months, weeks, or really years since I
have been here—sworn in in 2015.
I think it is very important. We all
know that we have the Executive order
from the President or the emergency
declaration. He clearly believes there
is a crisis at the border—so much so
that he was willing to invoke an au-
thority Congress granted beginning in
1976—the National Emergencies Act—
and then amended throughout the
1980s. He believes he is within his au-
thority to declare an emergency so
that he can get resources down to the
southern border as quickly as possible.
It is no secret that I disagree with
the method the President is using to
provide funding down at the southern
border, but make no mistake about it—
I do believe there is a crisis at the bor-
der, and I take exception to my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
who say the President is manufac-
turing a crisis.
I serve on the Judiciary Committee. I
have since 2015. Yesterday, we got a
briefing from Homeland Security that
was truly startling in terms of the sta-
tistics on the number of crossings—a
record number of crossings; severalfold;
in one case, 10 times—over the past few
months. I believe one of the reasons we
are seeing the increase in illegal cross-
ings is that those who are coming from
countries other than Mexico—who are
the majority of illegal crossings
today—believe that if they get across
the border, there is a very low chance
they will be returned to their country
of origin.
Speaker PELOSI said it is a manufac-
tured crisis. It is not a manufactured
crisis. Take a look at the data. It is a
real crisis. The majority leader said
the same thing. I think it is a crisis on
several levels. One has to do with the
number of people coming across the
border today.
There is something that is very im-
portant that I think was missed by
many people in the committee hearing
yesterday. There were a number of my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
whom I work with—in fact, I worked
with Senator DURBIN on a solution for
the DACA population. I am not nec-
essarily considered a hawk on all
things immigration. But I will tell you
that when I hear the senior Senator
from Illinois say that everyone who is
coming across the border is fleeing a
dangerous situation in their country of
origin, that doesn’t necessarily rec-
oncile with the fact that almost 80 per-
cent—8 out of 10 claims of asylum are
adjudicated not to be valid. Eight out
of ten claims for asylum are adju-
dicated not to be valid. And I don’t
hear anybody on the other side of the
aisle saying that we should change the
standard for an asylum claim. So for
someone to say that everyone coming
from these countries is fleeing a fear of
some sort of harm by staying in their
country or maybe staying in Mexico
while they sort things out—that is sim-
ply not true.
If you take a look at the severalfold
increase in illegal crossings, 80 percent

of them are deemed invalid in terms of
a threat to life or liberty from their
country of origin based on our standard
for asylum. I am not making this up;
this is a matter of court records. These
cases are being adjudicated by officials
who were appointed by Democrats and
Republicans, so it is not as though we
have someone down there setting a dif-
ferent standard for asylum. Eight out
of ten asylum claims for people cross-
ing the southern border are deemed in-
valid.
But now what is happening is that we
are spending so much time adjudi-
cating, detaining, and processing this
influx of illegal crossings that we are
creating a more dangerous situation
because bad actors are getting through.
Our resources are being spent trying to
process this influx of crossings that we
have to stop. How do you stop it? You
stop it by preventing future flows. You
stop it by changing the treatment of a
family who crosses from Mexico being
different from a family who crosses
from Ecuador, El Salvador, or any
other Latin America country. You
treat them all the same. You treat
them respectfully. You try to give
them an opportunity to make their
case, but you also send a clear message
that if you can’t come through the nor-
mal asylum process, which means you
show up and you lawfully request that
your asylum claim be heard, then you
cross the border and you put yourself
and your children at risk.
We have a crisis at the border. I
spent a week—in fact, Senator CORNYN
will be speaking after me. Senator COR-
NYN invited some of us to spend a week
down on the southern border, and it
was very revealing to see what is going
on there—seeing crossings happen right
before us, seeing cane along the Rio
Grande River that prevents border se-
curity from even seeing somebody who
may be 10 feet away as they are snak-
ing through in the middle of the night.
We were on horseback, we were in low-
draft boats, and we were in helicopters.
We saw the crisis at the border in real
time. That was last year. Now we have
severalfold more people coming across
the border.
The crisis has several layers to it.
One of the ones that I think every
American should get behind is that the
crisis is occurring because our re-
sources are being diluted by trying to
police these borders and apprehending
people, 8 out of 10 of whom will ulti-
mately be deemed not to have a valid
asylum claim. While we are tracking
them down, the cartels are smuggling
millions of doses of poison across our
border that are killing people every
year. These are the deaths that have
been reported, and they are reported,
sadly, almost on an annual basis—tens
of thousands of people dying as a result
of drugs coming across the southern
border. Because our resources are
spread so thin, I think this will get
worse if we don’t figure out how to se-
cure the border.
We have deaths of immigrants. Every
year on American soil, we recover
nearly 300 bodies of people who paid
hundreds or thousands of dollars to the
cartels so that they could pass through
the plazas at the southern border.
There is no way you can cross the
southern border without paying a fee
to these organized crime gangs who lit-
erally control the border. In fact, we
were told yesterday in the committee
that it will cost you $500 to put your
foot in the Rio Grande River, and if
you don’t, you are probably going to
die before you ever leave Mexico.
We have no earthly idea of the thou-
sands of people—men, women and chil-
dren—who die trying to cross the bor-
der and can’t pay a toll at the appro-
priate time, or they get caught up in a
conflict between the cartels along the
plazas of the southern border, but I
know thousands of people have died.
Over the last 20 years, nearly 10,000
bodies have been recovered on Amer-
ican soil—men, women, and children—
because this has become one of the
most profitable enterprises for the
human smugglers, human traffickers,
and drug traffickers in Mexico. That is
a crisis, ladies and gentlemen, and it is
a crisis that we need to recognize.
Gang members. Thousands of MS–13
gang members have crossed the border
illegally, and here is the sad reality.
When they successfully cross the bor-
der, they go into Hispanic commu-
nities. They go into communities,
many of them communities where the
majority are legally present, and make
them more dangerous. They hide there.
They coopt them. They actually re-
cruit kids into their gang activities
and use minors to do a lot of the illegal
activities—distributing drugs, traf-
ficking humans, and all the other il-
licit activities that the gangs are in-
volved in. That is a crisis.
The human toll is devastating. When
we were down at the border, we were
told of one massacre—this is one in-
stance—where there was a coyote. That
is a person who is responsible for mov-
ing people through the plazas, ulti-
mately, to cross the border illegally. In
one instance, we had a human traf-
ficker—a human smuggler—who appar-
ently took a lot of the money that
should have been passed back to the
cartels to pay for the passage of these
folks trying to get across the border,
and they didn’t have the money to pay
the cartel.
So what did the cartel do? They or-
dered the massacre of 72 people. This is
one group—one group—of 72 people on
the other side of the border who were
murdered—men, women, and children.
They never got to the United States.
The sad fact is, statistically speak-
ing, after they had spent virtually all
of their life’s belongings, if they had
gotten across the border, 8 out of 10 of
them probably wouldn’t have had a
valid claim to asylum. We have to fig-
ure out a better way to help these
countries, where these folks want to
come to the United States and enjoy
our liberties and enjoy our economic
blessings. Crossing the border illegally
is not the way to do it.
That is why I have consistently sup-
ported any measure to secure the bor-
der. There is no recommendation that
President Trump has made that I
haven’t supported. I supported a pack-
age last year that was nearly $25 bil-
lion for people, technology, and infra-
structure to secure the border—to
build all-weather roads, to build walls
where necessary, or structures, to in-
vest in technology, and to provide
more personnel to secure the border—
not to harm these folks but to help
them, to actually protect people in the
border States, but also to send a very
clear message: Don’t try to come to
this country illegally, where your
claim for asylum is more likely than
not going to be rejected, and the likeli-
hood that you and your children could
be hurt is very high.
So there is a crisis at the border. We
need to fund the President’s priorities.
The President’s immediate priorities
require $5.7 billion to fully fund his 10
key priorities at the border. I support
that. I applaud the President for tak-
ing the steps he did. I am going to do
everything I can to continue to come
down here and send the message to
those who may be contemplating mak-
ing the dangerous trip—from whatever
country where they may be living—
with their children and potentially
being harmed, to not do that. Let’s find
another way to help them and their
country of origin. Let’s find another
way to let them request asylum that
doesn’t involve making the dangerous
trip and then, potentially, being de-
nied.
I also wanted to come to the floor
today to send a very clear message to
the President and to the administra-
tion: I support the border plan. I sup-
port funding the wall, people, tech-
nology, and infrastructure proposals
that the President has made. We just
have to do it in a sustainable way, and
we have to do it in a way that goes far
beyond the $5.7 billion we need right
now to fund the President’s immediate
priorities.
I want to end by thanking Senator
CORNYN. Senator CORNYN said some-
thing yesterday that I think was ex-
tremely important. It is interesting for
somebody in a State, maybe in New
England or far, far away from the bor-
der, to say: There is no crisis. We don’t
have an issue down at the border.
I have to believe that somebody like
Senator CORNYN, who knows this issue,
knows the threat, knows the impact,
and knows the human toll better than
just about any of us, can say: Why
don’t you come down there and spend
some time with me? Why don’t you do
what so many others have done to see
it firsthand?
Now, let’s get out of the politics and
saying that it is a manufactured crisis
the President is acting on. It is a real
crisis. Human lives are at stake. So
many lives have been lost. We have to
stop the carnage, get the politics out of
it, secure the border, and move on to
immigration reform and so many other
things that we should do.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, at the
risk of sounding like the mutual admi-
ration society, let me express my ap-
preciation to the Senator from North
Carolina, who gave an outstanding
presentation, talking about the crisis
that exists at our southern border. I
really can’t improve on it, but I will
try.
Fortunately, Senator TILLIS is one of
those rare Senators who actually has
traveled down to the border at my invi-
tation. As he said, he rode horseback as
we tried to find our way through the
carrizo cane, which obscures visibility
for the Border Patrol, and he saw it for
himself. I appreciate his bringing the
benefit of that experience here to the
floor and adding to this important de-
bate.
I was struck by a hashtag I saw being
used in the House of Representatives.
It is ‘‘FakeEmergency’’—hashtag
‘‘FakeEmergency.’’
Well, let’s mention two sets of par-
ents. For the 7- and 8-year-old boy and
girl who recently died in CBP custody
at the border who made their way from
Guatemala, I don’t think this is a fake
emergency for them. As Customs and
Border Protection Commissioner
McAleenan said, many of these immi-
grants who come all the way from
countries like Guatemala suffer from
exposure, including dehydration. Many
of them are physically or sexually as-
saulted. Then, there is the danger of in-
fectious diseases, because many have
not been vaccinated for common child-
hood diseases that American citizens
would be protected from.
Unfortunately, they are a commodity
to the criminal organizations that
transport people for roughly $5,000 per
person. The cartels—the criminal orga-
nizations—are commodity agnostic.
They will just as soon usher a migrant
from Central America up here who
wants to join a family member and per-
haps find a job. They will just as soon
charge somebody who will ultimately
be trafficked and become the victim of
modern-day slavery, involuntary ser-
vitude, or sex slavery, or they will be
happy to move drugs, heroin, meth-
amphetamine, cocaine, marijuana—you
name it. In fact, 90 percent of the her-
oin that comes into the United States
comes from Mexico, and of the 70,000-
plus Americans who died from drug
overdoses just last year, according to
the Centers for Disease Control, a sub-
stantial portion was from the opioids.
In other words, that came from Mex-
ico—whether they be pills, fentanyl, or
heroin, which is perhaps the cheapest
form of opioid.
The Senator from North Carolina and
I serve on the Judiciary Committee,
and we heard at length from the Com-
missioner McAleenan of Customs and
Border Protection. The picture he
painted was pretty bleak, but it bears
repetition. Unfortunately, around here
it is hard to know when people are lis-
tening. Sometimes you have to say the
same thing over and over and over be-
fore it begins to penetrate people’s con-
sciousness. But this is important. So
we need to emphasize this.
Many migrants make this arduous
journey for days, weeks, or sometimes
for months, traveling without food or
water. When they arrive, they are often
sick and require extensive medical
treatment. Of course, there is, as I in-
dicated a moment ago, the horrific sto-
ries of physical and sexual abuse. The
percentage of women and girls who are
sexually abused en route from their
homes in Central America is revolting,
to use a word.
The Border Patrol spends a vast
amount of their time dealing with the
human needs of children. In other
words, these are law enforcement offi-
cers who are basically trying to supply
diapers and juice boxes to children who
are coming with their families and
overwhelming our capacity at the bor-
der. While the cartels exploit the fact
that the Border Patrol is tied up with
this sort of processing of asylum seek-
ers, the drugs come into the country.
That is part of the cartel’s plan. They
have studied our laws. They know
where there are gaps in coverage. They
know what they can do to distract law
enforcement officers so that drugs and
human trafficking can get through the
border.
Despite all of this and despite the
facts that the Senator from North
Carolina detailed, we still hear our
friends on the other side refusing to en-
gage or offer any solutions whatsoever.
As a matter of fact, one of our col-
leagues on the Judiciary Committee
yesterday said: We need to preserve the
two things that are the biggest obsta-
cles to getting to a solution. We need
to preserve those. In essence, what she
was saying is that we need the Border
Patrol not to secure our border. We
need the Border Patrol to just wave
people on through, like a traffic cop.
As long as we have these gaps in our
asylum laws where we treat people
from noncontiguous countries dif-
ferently than we do from Mexico or
Canada and as long as they can wait
for years before their asylum claim can
be finally adjudicated by an immigra-
tion judge, the criminal organizations
are winning. They have won because
they can successfully place a person in
the United States, notwithstanding our
laws, by overwhelming our resources at
the border and in our interior.
I have talked about the need to in-
crease border security many times on
the floor, and I know I risk sounding
like a broken record, but as long as we
have people in the other body sending
out hashtags on social media calling
this a fake emergency—when President
Obama himself, in 2014, called this a
humanitarian crisis—it is going to be
necessary, I am afraid, to keep telling
the story and talk about what is nec-
essary in order to bring security to our
southwest border.
My State has 1,200 miles of common
border with Mexico. Our relationship
with Mexico is very important because
they are one of our main trading part-
ners. There are a lot of good and impor-
tant things that come back and forth
across the border in terms of people le-
gally visiting the United States and in
terms of commerce and trade. I have
seen one estimate that about 5 million
American jobs depend on trade with
Mexico. It is not just Texas, either. But
the toll that the current status of our
immigration laws has on the lives of
immigrants crossing our border is real,
and the strain it puts on our ability to
engage in legitimate trade and com-
merce to flow freely through our ports
is real as well. All of these need to be
addressed and without delay.
Let me talk a little bit about the
records that have been broken. We saw
last month alone that 76,000 people ille-
gally crossed the border and were ap-
prehended by U.S. Customs and the
Border Patrol—76,000 people. According
to the Commissioner, we are on track
to see 600,000 to maybe 650,000 during
the next calendar year. This is an 11-
year high and averages more than 2,000
people a day. This is not a record we
want to be proud of.
We have seen a growing number of
family units. The reason why the car-
tels and criminal organizations bring
family units is because they know
what our law requires in terms of sepa-
rating the children from the adults and
then placing the children with a spon-
sor in the United States, only to have
them raise their asylum claim in front
of an immigration judge years hence.
As I said, many simply don’t show up
for that, and so game over.
We have seen a growing number of
family units coming across the border,
a 338-percent increase in 2018. The car-
tels have studied our laws. They are
advertising down in Central America,
saying: If you want to come to the
United States, all you have to do is
come as a family unit. We have studied
American law, we know where the gaps
are, and we are going to exploit them.
Already Border Patrol has appre-
hended more family units than in all of
2018, and the border regions of Texas
are feeling the strain. Our local offi-
cials—the mayors, the county judge—
and our medical facilities are just not
designed for this massive influx of hu-
manity. In the Rio Grande Valley, fam-
ily unit apprehensions have increased
209 percent since this time last year.
Here is a staggering figure: In El Paso,
TX, it is a 1,689-percent increase.
As Secretary Nielsen said yesterday,
testifying in front of the House, our
border is at the breaking point. Our ca-
pacity to deal with this influx of hu-
manity is creating a genuine crisis.
These are not just percentage points or
numbers; they illustrate the human

misery and the challenges of the dedi-
cated law enforcement personnel along
the border and also the folks who work
trying to deal with the children,
whether it is providing them medical
care or trying to find them a safe place
to live in the United States. This is not
a manufactured crisis. This is a real
crisis.
In a normal political environment,
these numbers would raise the alarm
bells, and we would take action—we
would actually do something about it—
but we aren’t operating in a normal po-
litical climate, to be sure.
Back in 2006 and 2008, Republicans
and Democrats voted on something
called the Secure Fence Act. It wasn’t
particularly partisan or political. This
year, the Speaker of the House, NANCY
PELOSI, called physical barriers ‘‘im-
moral.’’ The Democratic leader of the
Senate, the Senator from New York,
said not one penny was going to be ap-
propriated for any physical barriers
along the border.
For those who would argue this is a
fake crisis, I would ask them to check
with the Texans who live across the
border and deal with this every day.
I recently got an email from a friend
of mine who has a ranch outside of San
Antonio, my hometown. He said he and
his wife basically have to arm them-
selves, and they have to take pre-
cautions against people coming across
their land because they don’t know
whether it is going to be some hungry
migrant who is just simply looking to
find their way to San Antonio or to
Houston and then north or whether it
is going to be people wearing
backpacks carrying fentanyl and her-
oin. They just don’t know, so they have
to prepare. They basically have to lock
their doors, and they are captives in
their own house.
So what has changed since we talked
about this back in 2006? What has
changed?
My question is more of a rhetorical
one because we know Democrats will
stop at nothing to prevent President
Trump from delivering on his promise
to provide border security, even if it
means turning their backs on some-
thing they have historically supported.
As you might imagine, I have made a
point to spend a lot of time in commu-
nities along the border. I have talked
to the experts—our Border Patrol
agents, sheriffs, mayors, landowners,
and countless others—on how to best
deal with this security and humani-
tarian crisis. These are the people who
know best. They are the experts. They
know how best to secure the border.
They will be the first to tell you that
when it comes to border security, one
size does not fit all. I have mentioned
before my friend Judge Eddie Trevino
from Cameron County. I was in a meet-
ing with Senator CRUZ—my colleague
from Texas—local stakeholders, elect-
ed officials, along with Customs and
Border Protection and Border Patrol.
What Judge Trevino told us then was:
Look, if it is the experts, the Border
Patrol agents, telling us what we need,
we are all in, but if it is people from
Washington, DC, trying to micro-
manage the border, who don’t know
anything about it, then count us as
skeptical.
What we have heard from the experts
is that border security is a combina-
tion of three things: barriers in hard-
to-control places, people, and tech-
nology.
While a physical barrier may work
best in an urban or high-traffic area, it
doesn’t make any sense in places like
Big Bend National Park. Anybody who
has been out west to Texas knows the
cliffs over the Rio Grande River, in
parts, can rise to 30 feet. It doesn’t
make much sense to put a physical bar-
rier there.
The determination of what is needed
and where it is needed should not be a
top-down Federal mandate. It should
come from the experts who know the
threats and the challenges along every
mile of the border and whom we en-
trust on a daily basis to secure it.
We should continue to listen to our
vibrant border communities, which are
the economic engine of the region, and
ensure that we can maintain the flow
of legitimate trade and travel also
through these areas.
Implementing a solution that would
allow our law enforcement experts to
work with the Federal Government on
the right combination of technology,
people, and physical barriers is what
we ought to be focusing our attention
on.
I would add just a footnote to that on
dealing with this problem of people
abusing our laws on asylum. Again, the
cartels have figured this out. I have
worked with my friend HENRY
CUELLAR, who is perhaps one of the last
remaining Blue Dog Democrats in the
House of Representatives. He rep-
resents Laredo, TX. We actually intro-
duced a bill called the HUMANE Act,
which would establish parity of treat-
ment of immigrants coming from non-
contiguous countries like Central
America. Unfortunately, we weren’t
able to get that passed.
We could fix this pretty quickly, but
it requires our Democratic friends to
drop their Trump derangement syn-
drome and come to the negotiating
table in support of something they
have historically been for during this
time of need.
The crisis is staring us in the face,
and it demands action. I can only hope
our colleagues across the aisle will an-
swer that call.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SCOTT of Florida). The clerk will call
the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
FISCHER). Without objection, it is so
ordered.
NOMINATION OF ERIC E. MURPHY
Mr. BROWN. Madam President,
judges are making decisions around the
country right now on voting rights, on
civil rights, on LGBT rights, on wom-
en’s rights, on healthcare, on sen-
tencing, and on corporate power. Sev-
eral times over the last couple of years,
this body has said no even though al-
most every Republican in this body—
all with good, government-paid health
insurance, all with good salaries, all
well-dressed, all of the above—has tried
to repeal the Affordable Care Act or
take away Medicaid or take away con-
sumer protections so that people who
have preexisting conditions would have
their insurance canceled. They all
stood on that.
Do you know what? Because millions
and millions were affected, enough peo-
ple in this country said no and pushed
back and stopped the Republican ma-
jority from taking away the protec-
tions for preexisting conditions, and
they stopped insurance companies from
canceling people’s insurance who got
too sick and too expensive and who
could never get insurance in the first
place.
So do you know what those in the
Republican majority did? They went
through the courts. They voted for and
supported Supreme Court Justices and
district judges and circuit judges who
have put their thumbs on the scales of
justice and have picked corporations
over workers, chosen Wall Street over
consumers, and chosen insurance com-
panies over sick people. Over and over
again, this body tried to do it, but de-
mocracy rose up and said: No, you
aren’t going to take our health insur-
ance. No, you aren’t going to let the in-
surance companies run everything. No,
you aren’t going to let Wall Street run
everything. No, you aren’t going to do
it.
Do you know what? Because they
couldn’t do it through Democratic par-
ticipation and because they couldn’t do
it by going down to MITCH MCCON-
NELL’s office, who is the Republican
leader—they couldn’t walk down the
hall, all of their lobbyists, and stop
that from happening—they decided to
try doing it through the Federal judici-
ary. Remember what I said. They have
put their thumbs on the scales of jus-
tice. They have chosen Wall Street
over consumers. They have chosen in-
surance companies over sick people.
That is what this vote is about. That is
what this judge is all about today.
This body confirmed a judge yester-
day who would limit rights for a gen-
eration. These are judges who are al-
most all inexperienced. These are law-
yers who are in their thirties or early
forties. They are not who we used to
pick. President Obama used to do this;
President Bush often did this; and
President Bush, Sr., used to do this.
They would pick sort of—‘‘prudent’’
would be the word that President Bush,
Sr., would use—wise, prudent lawyers
who believed in public service and
didn’t believe in some far-right agenda

whereby they would put their thumbs
on the scales of justice and hurt work-
ers and hurt consumers. They picked
middle-of-the-road, thoughtful, pru-
dent judges who actually believed in
civil rights—shocking—who actually
believed gay people should have a
chance in this country, and who actu-
ally believed workers should get a fair
shot.
Do you know what? Because they
have picked judges who have put their
thumbs on the scales of justice, we see
the rich are getting richer and richer,
and we see the middle class in New
Hampshire and in Ohio and in Ne-
braska getting squeezed over and over
and over again.
We see what has happened to this
country. We see lobbyists going down
the hall to Senator MCCONNELL’s office,
who is the Republican leader, writing
tax bills. Do you know what that tax
law does that President Trump signed?
Do you know what it does? It says, if a
company shuts down in Lordstown, OH,
which General Motors has done this
week—4,500 people have lost their
jobs—General Motors will pay a tax
rate of 21 percent. Do you know what?
Under the Trump tax law, they can
move south of the border and pay a tax
rate of 101⁄2 percent.
In other words, they get a 50-percent
off coupon. Companies that shut down
production in Omaha or in Manchester
or in Cleveland and move overseas get
a 50-percent off coupon on their taxes.
That is what these fights are about.
These fights are about the special in-
terests that run this Senate, the com-
panies that outsource, and the drug
companies and Wall Street. Heck, the
White House looks like a retreat for
Wall Street.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time
is expired.
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask
for an additional 5 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. BROWN. This issue today we are
about to vote on is about Eric Murphy.
It is about confirming a very young,
very inexperienced lawyer in Cleveland
whose claim to fame is that he argued
against marriage equality in the land-
mark Obergefell v. Hodges case. It is
why Jim Obergefell has spoken out
against his nomination.
Here is what he said. He actually ar-
gued that marriage equality would be
disruptive—disruptive—to our Nation.
Telling people who love each other that
they can marry is disruptive to our Na-
tion? Who does that harm? Why would
it matter? A couple in Atlanta or Deca-
tur or a couple in Sioux Falls or To-
peka or Omaha or Lincoln or Man-
chester or Laconia or Cleveland or
Mansfield—why would it matter? Why
would it be disruptive?
This gentleman whom we are about
to—I know every Republican, except
maybe one courageous one, will vote
for him because that is how we do it
nowadays. You can’t win through the
democratic process; you win through
the back door of the judiciary. That is
what they are going to do. They are
going to vote for a man who said it is
disruptive to allow people who love
each other to marry. He will make de-
cisions on the rights of LGBTQ cou-
ples. Some in this body like to claim
they support people regardless of their
orientation. He has moved to restrict
access to contraceptives for women. We
are going to have women Republicans
vote for somebody like that? He has de-
fended Big Tobacco, as if there is any
defense for addicting our children to
tobacco.
We have had huge public health vic-
tories, but let’s go back. Let’s go back
on voting rights. Let’s go back on sup-
porting public health. Let’s go back on
equal rights for people. Let’s go back
on civil rights. Is that what we are
going to do today?
But maybe most despicable, on this
day today 54 years ago, in Mr. Figures’
State of Alabama—my wife has visited
this bridge five times, crossed it since
then—54 years ago, JOHN LEWIS, our
colleague down the hall—you know,
just on the other side of the special in-
terest majority leader’s office down the
hall—JOHN LEWIS—I think he was 25
years old at that point—got his head
beat in by Alabama State troopers. Do
you know why? Because he wanted peo-
ple to register to vote. He wanted peo-
ple to have their full rights. That hap-
pened 54 years ago today—the day we
are going to vote on Mr. Murphy.
Mr. Murphy defended Ohio’s voter
purge, taking registered voters off the
rolls. He led the efforts to take away
Golden Week in Ohio, passed by a Re-
publican legislature on a bipartisan
basis. He defended restrictive voter ID
and provisional ballot rules.
This weekend, Connie and I walked
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. We
saw foot soldiers who had been beaten
up 54 years ago as they were trying to
cross this bridge. We listened to their
stories. These men and women were
beaten. Many of them were 15, 16, 18, 20
years old. They did that so that in the
future, they and their children would
have the right to vote.
But judges around this country,
judges supported by this majority—
none of whom think for themselves
when it comes to voting on these nomi-
nations—all the way up to the Supreme
Court, they are dismantling these
rights.
I can’t imagine my Republican col-
leagues who came here from Georgia
and Kansas and Nebraska and Mon-
tana—and I think he is going to vote
right—I just can’t imagine they came
here thinking: I am going to take the
oath of office—right in that corner—
and do you know one of the things I am
going to do? I am going to vote to re-
strict voting rights. I am going to vote
to tell gay people they can’t marry. I
am going to vote to take away work-
ers’ rights. I am going to vote for
judges who put their thumbs on the
scales of justice and choose corpora-
tions that outsource jobs over workers.
I am going to choose Wall Street over
consumers. I am going to choose big
health insurance companies, with their
multimillion-dollar salaries for execu-
tives, and hurt sick people.
I can’t believe that is why any of you
came. So please vote no on Murphy.
Please. As the 54th anniversary of
Selma happens right about this time of
day—I think they tried to cross the
bridge around noon—I ask my col-
leagues to vote no.

SHOOTING OF BIJAN GHAISAR
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
want to speak to my colleagues about
two things. One will take less than 1
minute, and the other will take about
5 or 6 minutes. The first one deals with
why I can’t get answers for citizens of
the United States for the murder of a
son.
In 2017, the U.S. Park Police fatally
shot Bijan Ghaisar, after a minor traf-
fic accident led to a police chase in
Virginia. Since then, his family has
been looking for answers, but they
have only encountered silence.
The FBI took over the investigation
but has not shared any findings or even
an update with the family. So last De-
cember, I asked the FBI where things
stand. Even this Senator got silence
from the FBI.
Investigations into the use of deadly
force should be handled in a manner
that reinforces accountability and pub-
lic confidence in law enforcement. The
FBI’s silent treatment is concerning.
The Ghaisar family, Congress, this
Senator, and the public shouldn’t have
to wait years to get an answer from the
FBI.
FILING SEASON
Mr. President, on the subject of
taxes, we are now in our sixth week of
the tax filing season. Over 50 million
Americans have filed their tax returns.
As in previous years, the IRS is moving
forward in the filing season at a pace
very consistent with previous years. In
some aspects, they are exceeding
benchmarks set by last year’s filing
season. This has been one of the most
scrutinized filing seasons I can remem-
ber. In some ways, that is understand-
able.
As I have alluded to, this is the first
filing season after our Tax Code re-
ceived the largest overhaul in three
decades. After the massive tax bill we
passed, you would expect some difficul-
ties. The filing season began shortly
after our government experienced the
longest shutdown in history. So the
longest shutdown in history, added to
the fact that we have a new tax bill,
makes this tax filing season very dif-
ferent. Despite these factors, this filing
season has run relatively smoothly.
Consistent with previous years, the
IRS has processed over 95 percent of
the returns the Agency received, and 80
percent of those returns were sent a re-
fund. Based on data covering returns
filed through February 22 of this year,
over $121 billion in refunds have been
returned to the American taxpayers,
with an average refund of $3,143.
This is up slightly over the 2018 filing
season. I only mention this because
some of the media and some here in the
Congress have been obsessing over the
size of refunds.
As I pointed out many times,
obsessing over the average size of re-
funds is simply wrongheaded and mis-
leading. A week-to-week focus on the
size of tax refunds makes no sense,
given how wildly refunds can vary
early in the filing season.
Recent filing season data makes this
very clear. Within a week, the average
size of refunds went from being down 17
percent to being a little over 1 percent
higher than last year so far this filing
season.
We have over 5 weeks of filing season
to go. I expect there will continue to be
variations in the data. Most impor-
tantly, the size of the tax refund is a
stupid barometer of how taxpayers are
faring this season compared to last—in
other words, whether they had a tax in-
crease or a tax decrease as a result of
the tax bill of December 2017.
A refund merely represents the ex-
tent to which a taxpayer has overpaid
their taxes during the course of the
year. It absolutely provides no insight
into whether a taxpayer’s tax burden
has gone up or, for that matter, down.
I hope the relative silence in the
media about the filing season data re-
leased at the end of last week indicates
that that media and Members of Con-
gress who have complained about it fi-
nally come to understand all of this—
that a refund up or down has nothing
to do with whether you have a tax in-
crease or decrease. Any further swings
up or down will not generate sensa-
tional headlines that only confuse and
misinform taxpayers. Those headlines
have misled the American people.
I hope this recent data will help put
to rest accusations of some of my
Democratic colleagues that the IRS
sought to manipulate withholding ta-
bles to goose paychecks in 2018, be-
cause nothing could be further from
the truth.
The primary objective of the IRS in
updating withholding tables was for a
very sound reason of making sure that
they are as accurate as possible. A re-
port by the Government Account-
ability Office bears this out. In fact,
there is not a single indication in the
GAO report to suggest otherwise.
The IRS followed the same process
and procedures in updating with-
holding tables this year as it has in the
previous years. Moreover, the report
documents the extensive outreach that
Treasury and the IRS conducted to in-
form taxpayers of the changes and to
suggest that taxpayers check their
withholding.
Their outreach included updating and
creating pages on their website using
IRS email LISTSERVs and social
media campaigns and sharing with-
holding materials with partners, in-
cluding tax-related groups, large em-
ployers, employer associations, and or-
ganizations representing small busi-
nesses. So you see, they went to great
lengths to alert the public to observe
changes in the tax tables.
However, no withholding table has
been or ever will be perfect. Common
sense dictates that. Every wage earner
may be affected a little differently
under the new law based on his or her
personal circumstances. Because of
personal circumstances, if there are 157
million tax filings, then, there could be
157 million different answers.
The IRS continues to consider wheth-
er future improvements to the with-
holding structure may be necessary. I
support these efforts and will monitor
the outcome as chairman of the tax-
writing Finance Committee.
If the tables had not been updated,
my guess is that our colleagues on the
other side of the aisle would be singing
a different tune. Instead of criticizing
efforts to ensure that withholding ta-
bles more accurately reflect the new
law, they would be claiming that we
were trying to back-load the tax bene-
fits, tricking taxpayers into believing
their tax cut was larger than it was
through oversized refunds.
This actually may have been the
right thing to do politically, but it
would have been wrong, as a matter of
principle or tax policy, and, quite

frankly, an organization like the IRS,
usually far removed from politics,
would not be involved in a political
scheme like that.
One exception to that is how the IRS,
under Ms. Lerner, treated conservative
organizations during the 2010, 2011, and
2012 years.
The excess tax withheld from pay-
checks throughout the course of the
year doesn’t belong to the government.
That is common sense. That belongs to
the taxpayers who earned it. The gov-
ernment shouldn’t intentionally with-
hold more than necessary.
I am proud of the work my colleagues
did to update the Tax Code last Con-
gress. We delivered meaningful tax re-
lief to middle-income taxpayers and to
job creators. This has contributed to
strong economic growth benefitting all
Americans, hopefully, for years to
come.
The Treasury Department and the
IRS has done good work to implement
the law in a timely fashion. They will
continue that good work to ensure that
Americans receive their refunds as
quickly as possible.
As we progress toward the end of the
filing season in April, the data being
reported will fluctuate as taxpayers
across a range of circumstances submit
their returns. I hope that every time
there is movement in the data, our
friends across the aisle, and, more im-
portantly, the misleading media will
keep in mind two important facts that
I mentioned earlier. First, tracking re-
fund data on a weekly basis makes no
sense, given how widely the data can
vary. Second, and lastly, the focus on
the size of the refunds is wrongheaded
since it provides no indication as to
whether a taxpayer’s tax bill has gone
up or down between 2018 filings and 2019
filings.
Most everyone was oddly silent when
the last batch of good data was re-
leased. So maybe we will not hear any
more of this misleading information
from the media. I hope we can have a
more responsible and accurate discus-
sion in the weeks ahead.
I yield the floor.

ator from Maryland.
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I urge
the Senate to take up legislation to re-
quire universal and complete back-
ground checks for individuals seeking
to purchase a gun. I am pleased that
the House recently passed this legisla-
tion, and it is well past time for the
Senate to act.
Rarely has a month gone by without
a mass shooting, and many commu-
nities are ravaged daily by gun vio-
lence that does not make the news
headlines. Individuals have used fire-
arms to take countless innocent lives
in concerts, churches, and even elemen-
tary schools. By now, these incidents
are etched in our memories: Santa Fe,
Parkland, Las Vegas, Orlando, San
Bernardino, Sandy Hook, Pittsburgh,
and Thousand Oaks.
In Maryland we saw tragedies that
occurred in the Capital Gazette office
in Annapolis. We, as a nation, must act
to stem the tide of bloodshed and the
hatred that drives it. We cannot allow
such massacres to become routine in
our society.
We have the ability to end the tragic
cycle of violence, but it will require us
to come together in full urgency and
honesty. I know we can protect inno-
cent Americans from further senseless
gun violence while still protecting the
constitutional rights enjoyed for hunt-
ing and self-defense. Through common-
sense gun safety reforms that would
make background checks more effi-
cient and close loopholes, I am con-
fident we can do just that.
Let me start with a little history, as
provided by the Brady Campaign. The
Gun Control Act of 1968 established a
framework for legally prohibiting cer-
tain categories of people from pos-
sessing firearms. The list of prohibited
persons has grown over the years and
now includes categories such as felons,
fugitives, domestic abusers, and those
found by the court or other tribunal to
be seriously mentally ill.
Only in 1993, with the passage of the
Brady Handgun Violence Prevention
Act, did Congress provide the public
with a presale process for checking
whether a prospective firearm pur-
chaser is legally able to purchase the
firearm.
Since the Brady Law took effect, it
has blocked more than 3 million pro-
hibited gun sales and processed over 278
million purchase requests. When some-
one goes to a federally licensed dealer
to buy a gun, the retailer contacts the
FBI to run a background check. The
FBI checks the National Instant Crimi-
nal Background Check System to see if
they are a convicted felon, fugitive, do-
mestic abuser, or other prohibited pur-
chaser.
If the system reveals that the buyer
is legally barred from owning a gun,
then, the sale is denied. Simply put,
the Brady Law prevents guns from get-
ting into the hands of dangerous indi-
viduals.
The Brady Law has blocked more
than 3 million gun sales to prohibited
buyers, helping to save countless lives,
but the law doesn’t apply to all gun
sales. Instead, only Federal firearm li-
censees approved by the Bureau of Al-
cohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explo-
sives are required to conduct back-
ground checks on gun sales. The Brady
Act background check requirement ap-
plies only to licensed dealers, allowing
transactions conducted by private, un-
licensed sellers to be completed with-
out any check. Private, unlicensed sell-
ers need not conduct any check under
current law.
However, the Brady Law was enacted
before the rise of the internet. America
has changed, and our Nation’s gun laws
need to change with it. Today, unli-
censed gun sales made online and un-
regulated and unchecked contributed
to one out of every five gun sales. That
is simply wrong. Those sales can avoid
the background check.
Passing legislation to expand back-
ground checks to nearly every gun
sale, including those conducted online
at gun shows and through private
transfers, should be the top priority in
Congress for commonsense gun safety
legislation to save lives.
It is long past time to expand life-
saving Brady background checks to
every gun sale. The public agrees. A
2018 study showed that 97 percent of
Americans support expanding back-
ground checks—97 percent. We don’t
get any higher than that.
The Senate should follow the lead of
the House, which recently passed the
legislation to expand criminal back-
ground checks. In the Senate, I cospon-
sored S. 42, the Background Check Ex-
pansion Act. This bill, which passed
the House, would expand Federal back-
ground check requirements to include
the sale or transfer of all firearms by
private sellers, just as licensed dealers
are required to conduct under the ex-
isting Brady Law.
The bill requires background checks
for sales or transfers of all firearms
from one party to another, even if the
party is not a federally licensed dealer.
This requirement extends to all unli-
censed sellers, whether they do busi-
ness online, at gun shows, or out of
their home.
According to the Brady Campaign, in
any given year in the United States,
more than 120,000 Americans are shot
in murders, assaults, suicides and sui-
cide attempts, unintentional shootings,
or police actions. Of these, 35,000 result
in death. Over 17,000 of those injured or
killed are children and teens. On aver-
age, 34 people in America are murdered
on account of gun violence every single
day.
Mass shootings often shine the spot-
light on the United States and its posi-
tion as a global outlier. The number of
firearms available to American civil-
ians is estimated to be at around 310
million, according to the National In-
stitute of Justice. According to the
Small Arms Survey, the exact number
of civilian-owned firearms is impos-
sible to pinpoint because of a variety of
factors, including arms that go unreg-
istered, the illegal trade, and global
conflict. However, estimates indicate
that Americans own nearly half of the
650 million civilian-owned guns in the
world today. Half are here in the
United States. Our Nation is well
armed.
Americans own the most guns per
person in the world, with about 4 in 10
saying they either own a gun or live in
a home with guns, according to the 2017
Pew Center study, and 48 percent of
Americans say they grew up in a House
with guns. According to the survey, a
majority, 66 percent, of U.S. gun own-
ers own multiple firearms.
The No. 2 country for the world’s
largest gun-owning population per cap-
ita is Yemen, a country that is in the
throes of a years-long civil conflict,

and they trail significantly behind us.
They have 54 guns per 100; we are at 88
guns owned per 100.
When it comes to gun massacres, the
United States is an anomaly. There are
more public mass shootings in America
than in any other country in the world.
The United States makes up less than
5 percent of the world’s population but
holds 31 percent of global mass shoot-
ers. In Australia, for example, four
mass shootings occurred between 1987
and 1996. They decided to do something
about that so they passed sensible gun
safety legislation. Australia has not
had a mass shooting since then.
Gun homicide rates are about 25
times higher in the United States than
other developed countries. According
to the recent study of the American
Journal of Medicine, the United States
has one of the highest rates of death by
firearm in the developed world, accord-
ing to the World Health Organization
data. The calculations based on the
OECD data from 2010 showed that
Americans are 51 times more likely to
be killed by gunfire than people in the
United Kingdom. We need to do some-
thing about this. We can’t sit idly by.
Congress should act today to close
the so-called Charleston loophole. The
Senate should once again follow the
House’s lead here. A particularly tragic
example of the consequences of this
loophole was the racist hate crime
murder of nine people at the Emanuel
African Methodist Episcopal Church in
Charleston, SC, that occurred in 2015.
In that tragedy, the shooter was not le-
gally allowed to possess a firearm due
to drug charges but still was able to ac-
quire his gun from a licensed dealer
who made the decision to transfer,
after the current 3-business day period
expired, despite not having received a
definitive response from the back-
ground check system.
Unfortunately, the sale to the shoot-
er after 3 days fell into what is known
as the default proceed sale, and this
was not an isolated incident. Since
1994, gun sellers proceeded with be-
tween 3,000 and 4,000 such sales every
year simply because the information
has not gotten back on the background
check.
I would note that in most cases, a li-
censed gun dealer receives notification
from the system about a prospective
buyer within a few minutes. In less
than 10 percent of the cases, the exam-
ination may require additional time to
complete the background check if the
information the transferee provided is
incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise
defective. Under current law, a licensed
gun dealer conducting a background
check on a prospective purchaser may
sell the firearm to the purchaser after
3 business days, even if they have not
received a reply in regard to the back-
ground check. This is wrong, and Con-
gress should change the rule as the
House has done.
I agree gun laws alone cannot solve
the problem, but gun laws will make a
difference. Yes, there is no single an-
swer, but we should be united in our
willingness to do what we can to save
lives.
I agree with my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle that we must devote
more resources to mental health prior-
ities to identify young people who may
be about to cause harm to themselves
or others. Let’s attack this problem
from multiple directions. We cannot
raise our hands in the air and give up
because there is no one law that can
solve the problem.
Sitting on the sidelines is not an op-
tion when our children are being
killed—sometimes by other children—
and surrendering to the false logic that
the problem is too big to address falls
well short of what the American people
deserve. We were sent to our Nation’s
capital to make tough decisions and to
do the right thing.
The American public is letting their
voices be heard on this issue. Thoughts
and prayers might console the grieving
for a moment, but action speaks louder
and will have lasting impact.
From my hometown of Baltimore to
many towns across America that have
had their names in the headlines be-
cause of gun-related tragedies or mass
shootings, people are calling on Con-
gress to act.
What we are proposing are logical
next steps to address the deadly prob-
lem that has been festering in this
country far too long. Too many lives
have been lost. Let’s do the right thing
in the Senate and immediately take up
legislation to require universal and
completed background checks for indi-
viduals seeking to purchase a gun.

ator from Wyoming.
NOMINATION OF JOHN FLEMING
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise
in support of the nomination of John
Fleming to serve as Assistant Sec-
retary of Commerce for Economic De-
velopment.
The Assistant Secretary serves as the
Administrator of the Economic Devel-
opment Administration, the EDA. It is
the only Federal Agency focused exclu-
sively on economic development. It
works directly with communities in re-
gions to help them build capacity for
economic development based on local
business conditions as well as needs.
As a physician, entrepreneur, busi-
nessman, military veteran, and four-
term Member of Congress, Dr. Fleming
is incredibly well qualified to lead the
EDA. Dr. Fleming has launched several
companies, which today employ over
500 people in Louisiana. Dr. Fleming’s
nomination has drawn praise from nu-
merous political, educational, and eco-
nomic development leaders in his home
State of Louisiana.
Don Pierson, the Secretary of Lou-
isiana Economic Development, wrote:
Dr. Fleming has been instrumental in the
development and execution of projects,
which have taken root in Northwest Lou-
isiana and spread across the United States.
He goes on to say:
His experience in public policy, business
and his military background serve as the
right attributes for leading economic devel-
opment efforts.
The Environment and Public Works
Committee reported Dr. Fleming’s
nomination favorably to the Senate
with a substantial bipartisan majority,
and we have done it twice, first on Oc-
tober 1, 2018, during the 115th Congress,
and then next on February 5 of this
year, after he was renominated this
Congress. Under normal circumstances,
Dr. Fleming would have been con-
firmed and in office last fall. Instead,
our colleagues on the other side of the
aisle have blocked his nomination ever
since it was first placed on the Senate
Executive Calendar more than 155 days
ago. Now, we had to file cloture and go
through repeated delays on a well-
qualified nominee who was twice re-
ported by a substantial majority of the
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee.
Dr. Fleming’s treatment by our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle is
similar to the obstruction of John
Ryder, whom we finally confirmed last
week to serve as a member of the
Board of Directors of the Tennessee
Valley Authority. He had waited an un-
conscionable 388 days for a vote on the
Senate floor.
In a column last Friday, the Wall
Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel
noted that 388 days is ‘‘100 days longer
than it takes a new human being to
come into the world.’’ She continued:
Even at the last, Democrats were stringing
out the process, refusing unanimous consent
to a floor vote, requiring Republicans to file
for cloture, which entails more delay.
Then she points out that ‘‘after all
that, [Mr. Ryder] was confirmed—by a
voice vote with no audible dissent.’’
Let’s not delay any longer. Let’s stop
this spectacle of obstructing well-
qualified nominees solely for obstruc-
tion’s sake. I urge my colleagues to
vote with me in support of the nomina-
tion of John Fleming to serve as As-
sistant Secretary of Commerce for Eco-
nomic Development and Administrator
of the EDA.
Thank you.

tion of Dr. John Fleming to be Assist-
ant Secretary for Economic Develop-
ment at the Department of Commerce,
I remind my Republican friends that
the pot calls the kettle black once
again.
Whatever harm or abuse has been
done to this nominee or other nomi-
nees pales by comparison to what hap-
pened to one of the most distinguished
judges in America, Merrick Garland,
who was nominated, literally, a year
before the end of the last President’s

never got a vote, no committee—none
of that. There are no clean hands.

Fleming to be our Assistant Secretary
for Economic Development at the De-
partment of Commerce. In that role,
Dr. Fleming would oversee the Eco-
nomic Development Administration—
we call it the EDA. In my home State,
we benefited a great deal from EDA in
recent years. We are grateful for them.
EDA provides money used to leverage
other moneys for economic develop-
ment purposes. If I had more time, I
would be able to give you some good
examples.
When Dr. Fleming was a Member of
the House of Representatives, he voted
repeatedly to eliminate the Economic
Development Administration. That is
why I initially held deep reservations
about his nomination. When Dr. Flem-
ing and I met before his hearing last
year, he assuaged most of my concerns.
In the end, I decided to vote my hopes
over my fears and voted to approve his
nomination out of committee. Today I
will again vote in support of his nomi-
nation.
As the senior Democrat on the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee
in the Senate, I will work to ensure
that EDA programs are protected and
promoted, and I hope Dr. Fleming will
be leading in those efforts. Today I will
be leading the efforts to get him con-
firmed for his post and put him to
work.
The last thing I would say, if I have
a few more seconds—I think I may. One
of the things I do is customer calls, and
I suspect the Presiding Officer does
this back in his home State of Indiana.
I do them often. I visit businesses large
and small. I ask three questions: How
are you doing? How are we doing? What
can we do to help?
One of the questions I asked once
while visiting a large auto dealership
was, how are you doing?
He said: Well, you know, we sell plen-
ty of vehicles, but we have a hard time
attracting and getting people to work
as technicians to maintain the vehicles
we sell.
I said: Maybe you need to pay them
more money.
He said: No, we start people at about
$50,000 and pay them up to $80,000,
$90,000 a year.
I said: You are still having a hard
time attracting people?
He said: Yes, we are.
We worked with EDA to get a Fed-
eral grant to create a center for auto-
motive excellence in the middle of
Delaware, in the Delmarva Peninsula.
They are working with Delaware Tech-
nical and Community College, and a
year from now they expect to open that
Center for Automotive Excellence and
provide the workforce that is needed
not just in Delaware by our auto deal-
ers but by companies that have large
trucks and similar kinds of employers
throughout the Delmarva Peninsula, in
the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Vir-
ginia, and throughout the State of
Delaware. That is the kind of thing
EDA can do to help.
We are excited about this prospect
and looking forward to meeting our
workforce needs and grateful for the
assistance of this Federal Agency,
which Dr. Fleming has been nominated
to head. I hope he will have that oppor-
tunity. We will vote in just a few min-
utes.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO GENERAL RAYMOND
A. THOMAS
∑ Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor my friend, GEN Ray-
mond A. Thomas III, commander of the
U.S. Special Operations Command, for
his dedication to military service in
the U.S. Army. General Thomas will
retire from active military duty on
March 29, 2019, after serving 39 years
defending our national security.
Born in Philadelphia, PA, General
Thomas graduated from the U.S. Mili-
tary Academy at West Point and was
commissioned as an infantry second
lieutenant in 1980. Throughout his ca-
reer, General Thomas has grown as a
well-respected leader and a vital asset
to the special operations community.
Prior to assuming command of U.S.
Special Operations Command, General
Thomas served as commander, Joint
Special Operations Command—JSOC—
Fort Bragg, NC. His other general offi-
cer assignments include Associate Di-
rector for Military Affairs at the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency; commanding
general, NATO Special Operations
Component Command—Afghanistan;
deputy commanding general, JSOC;
Deputy Director for Special Oper-
ations, the Joint Staff in the Pentagon;
assistant division commander, 1st
Armor Division in Iraq; and assistant

Prior to his promotion to brigadier

proudly recognize the remarkable mili-
tary career of GEN Raymond A. Thom-
as III. I wish General Thomas, his lov-
ing wife, Barbara, and their extended
family the very best as they embark on
the next chapter of their journey to-
gether.∑

TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW SHUMAN
∑ Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I
am proud to recognize in the RECORD
the American Legion’s director of the
national legislative division, Matthew
Shuman, who has a long record of serv-
ice to our Nation’s veterans.
Mr. Shuman has not only dedicated
his career to serving veterans, he is a
veteran himself. He served in the U.S.
Army from 2008 to 2012, most notably
as a military police officer. Mr.
Shuman concluded his military career
serving on the Arizona Army National
Guard Honor Guard, providing military
funeral honors for our Nation’s fallen
soldiers.
Mr. Shuman began serving veterans
with the American Legion in 2015,
starting as an assistant legislative di-
rector with the veterans employment
and education portfolio in Washington,
DC. In his current role as director of
the national legislative division, Mr.
Shuman is the chief advocate for the
2-million-member organization, work-
ing with Federal agencies, the White
House, and the media to share what the
American Legion is doing in Congress
on behalf of the 20 million American
veterans.
During his time with the American
Legion, Mr. Shuman had a role in the
creation and passage of significant leg-
islation impacting America’s veterans.
These include the VA MISSION Act,
the VA Appeals Modernization Act, the
VA Accountability and Whistleblower
Protection Act, the Harry W. Colmery
Veterans Educational Assistance Act,
and The American Legion 100th Anni-
versary Commemorative Coin Act.
These efforts have contributed to im-
proving the quality of life and
strengthening healthcare and benefits
for servicemembers, veterans, and their
families.
Today I am honored to pay tribute to
Mr. Shuman for his service to our
country and his steadfast commitment
to advocating on behalf of veterans
throughout his career. Congratulations
to Mr. Shuman on his lasting legacy of
advocacy for veterans, and I wish him
the best in his future endeavors.∑
∑ Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor the service and career of
veteran and dedicated advocate Mat-
thew Shuman.
The American Legion is a corner-
stone in countless American commu-
nities, helping our veterans get the
care, benefits, and recognition they
earned while giving back through

youth programs, scholarship assist-
ance, and grassroots efforts. The Amer-
ican Legion’s membership is robust and
active, and they have been well-served
by Matthew.
Matthew has been a tireless legisla-
tive advocate for American Legion
members and the veteran community
as a whole. In his role overseeing the
American Legion’s legislative efforts,
Matthew has been instrumental in im-
proving VA healthcare and benefits for
our more than 22 million veterans, in-
cluding 2 million Legionnaires around
the world.
Matthew served in the U.S. Army
from 2008 to 2012. He served as a mili-
tary police officer and concluded his
military career as a member of the Ari-
zona Army National Guard Honor
Guard, memorializing our fallen sol-
diers by providing military funeral
honors.
Following his military service, Mat-
thew attended Grand Canyon Univer-
sity and participated in the Reserve Of-
ficer Training Corps, ROTC, at Arizona
State University. He graduated from
Marymount University in Arlington,
VA, with a B.S. in criminal justice. He
established his passion for public serv-
ice by working for two different Mem-
bers of Congress, as well as working on
the 2012 election cycle.
Matthew’s career with the American
Legion began in 2015, when he started
as an assistant legislative director fo-
cused on veterans’ employment and
education in their Washington, DC,
headquarters. In January 2017, Mat-
thew began his tenure as the director
of the American Legion’s national leg-
islative division. In that role, Matthew
has been the American Legion’s chief
advocate before Congress, the White
House, and the Department of Vet-
erans’ Affairs. Matthew has helped lead
an organization that has always been
at the forefront of advocating for vet-
erans and securing the resources,
healthcare, and benefits veterans have
earned.
As ranking member of the Senate
Veterans’ Affairs Committee, it has
been a joy to work with Matthew and
the American Legion on important leg-
islation like the Veterans Appeals Im-
provement and Modernization Act, the
VA Accountability and Whistleblower
Protection Act, the Harry W. Colmery
Veterans Educational Assistance Act—
also known as the Forever G.I. Bill—
several reforms and subsequent over-
haul of the VA’s healthcare system,
and the current implementation of the
VA MISSION Act. All the while, I have
been impressed with Matthew’s cha-
risma, kindness, and humor.
These bipartisan bills, all of which
were signed into law, serve as a testa-
ment to Matthew’s dedication and
leadership on behalf of veterans. Fu-
ture generations of veterans will be
able to look at these bipartisan re-
forms as examples of Matthew’s advo-
cacy on behalf of all veterans.
It is my honor to recognize Mat-
thew’s outstanding military service
and continued service to our
servicemembers, veterans, and their
families. As Matthew begins a new
chapter, I have no doubt that he will
continue to be a voice for those in
need.
To Matthew, on behalf of myself and
a grateful nation, I extend my greatest
appreciation to you for your enduring
bravery, service, sacrifice, and advo-
cacy.∑

REMEMBERING JACK COGHILL
∑ Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President,
today I speak in memory of an Alaska
pioneer, a pillar of the community of
Nenana, signer of the Alaska Constitu-
tion, legendary Alaska legislator and
our 6th Lieutenant Governor, Jack
Coghill, who died in February at the
age of 93.
Long before statehood, the name
Coghill was synonymous with the town
of Nenana. Jack’s father, William A.
Coghill, Sr., emigrated from Scotland
to Canada and then to Alaska in March
1907. He landed in Valdez, hiked to the
interior over the course of 10 days, and
went to work delivering the Fairbanks
Daily News-Miner.
In 1916, Bill relocated about 60 miles
down the road to Nenana, which was at
the time a boom town. It was home to
the Alaska Engineering Commission,
which was building the railroad, a
bridge, and a large dock. Along with a
partner, Bill converted an existing
business into Coghill’s Store, which
continues to exist today.
In the 1930s, Jack and his brothers,
Bill, Jr., and Bob, began learning the
business from the ground up. They
were hauling freight, stocking shelves,
assisting customers, and delivering the
groceries. Jack served in the Army in
World War II. He was a staff sergeant
in the U.S. Army Alaska Command,
fighting in the Aleutians. Following
the war, Jack moved home to Nenana.
When Bill, Sr., died in 1947, Jack and
his brother Bob, along with their moth-
er, took over the store. Later the busi-
ness included a movie theatre, fuel dis-
tribution, and a roadhouse.
Public service was an important part
of Jack Coghill’s life since the late
1940s. He served on the Nenana School
Board, and he was mayor of Nenana for
23 years. He was elected to the Alaska
Territorial Legislature in 1952 and re-
elected in 1956. At age 30, he was se-
lected as one of 55 delegates to the
Alaska Constitutional Convention.
Jack participated in the drafting of the
Alaska Constitution in 1956 and was
the third individual to sign it. Post-
statehood, he served in the Alaska
House of Representatives and the Alas-
ka Senate. In 1990, he was elected Lieu-
tenant Governor on a ticket with
Wally Hickel. Unable to stay away
from service, Jack returned to the
Nenana City Council when his term as
Lieutenant Governor concluded. Until
his death, Alaskans of all generations
looked to Jack for advice.
Jack and his wife Frances were par-
ents to six children. Next to family,
Jack characterized his service on the
Alaska Constitutional Convention as
his greatest achievement. Of course,
that was far from Jack’s only recogni-
tion. He held an honorary doctorate
from the University of Alaska and was
elected to Junior Achievement’s Small
Business Hall of Fame.
One of Jack’s six children is John
Coghill, a friend whom I served with in
the Alaska Legislature and who serves
as a member of the Alaska State Sen-
ate today. John remembers his father
as ‘‘a firm believer in utilizing Alaska’s
natural resources to build a strong
economy and provide good paying jobs
for Alaska . . . He had the same pas-
sion for Alaska, even at 93.’’
With the passing of Jack Coghill,
only one of the signers of the Alaska
Constitution, Victor Fischer, remains
alive today. While it is sad to part with
a pillar of Alaska’s history, an indi-
vidual who was instrumental in Alas-
ka’s growth from its frontier, terri-
torial days to today’s modern State, we
were blessed to have his leadership for
so many years.
It is an honor to share just a brief
glimpse of the story of Jack Coghill
with my colleagues here in the U.S.
Senate.∑

‘‘(ii) The service provider is not required to
perform services exclusively for the service
recipient or payor.

treated as an employee by the service recipi-
ent or payor for substantially the same serv-
ices during the 1-year period ending with the
date of the commencement of services under
the contract described in subsection (d).
‘‘(iv) The service provider is not com-
pensated on a basis which is tied primarily

‘‘(3) ALTERNATIVE REQUIREMENTS WITH RE-
SPECT TO SALES PERSONS.—In the case of a
service provider engaged in the trade or busi-
ness of selling (or soliciting the sale of)
goods or services, the requirements of this
paragraph are met with respect to any serv-
ice provided in the ordinary course of such
trade or business if—

lowing:

taxes, on compensation payable pursuant to
the contract.
‘‘(E) A statement that the contract is in-

in this subsection.
The contract shall not fail to meet the re-
quirements of this paragraph merely because
the information described in subparagraph
(A) is collected at the time payment is made
for the services and not in advance, or be-
cause the contract provides that an agent of
the service recipient or payor will fulfill any
of the responsibilities of the service recipi-
ent or payor described in the preceding sub-
paragraphs.
‘‘(2) The term of the contract does not ex-
ceed 2 years. The preceding sentence shall

termines that the significant and serious dis-
ciplinary infraction of which the inmate was
found guilty is of such an egregious and vio-
lent nature that a longer sanction is appro-
priate and approves a longer sanction,

cial housing unit if the inmate has never be-
fore been found guilty of a similar signifi-
cant and serious disciplinary infraction; or

S. 725
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. CAPTAIN HUMAYUN KHAN POST OF-
FICE.
Section 1(a) of Public Law 115–347 (132 Stat.
5054) is amended by striking ‘‘180 McCormick
Road’’ and inserting ‘‘2150 Wise Street’’.
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself
and Ms. COLLINS):
S. 726. A bill to amend the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to en-
sure the safety of cosmetics; to the
Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
am introducing bipartisan legislation
with Senator COLLINS today to improve
safety standards on products that af-
fect every single American household.
Most people assume that the personal
care products they use every day,
whether it is shampoo or shaving
cream, lotion or make-up, hair dye or
deodorant, have up-to-date Federal
oversight.
In reality, however, the Food and
Drug Administration’s authority to do
so is sorely outdated. In fact, even
though research continues to better in-
form us on the safety of ingredients
used in products that we absorb
through our bodies, skin and even our
nails, regulation of these ingredients
have not kept up and little has changed
over the past eight decades on how we
conduct oversight of these products. It
is time to modernize our safety over-
sight and correct this problem.
Over the last several years, Senator
COLLINS and I have worked with a wide
group of stakeholders that represent
both industry and consumer groups.
Together, we have drafted the Personal
Care Products Safety Act with the sup-
port of many companies, health ex-
perts, and consumer organizations to
put commonsense measures in place.
One of the most critical components
of this legislation is a process for the
FDA to review the safety of ingredients
in personal care products. The FDA
may limit the quantity of an ingre-
dient, require specific screening pro-
tocol to ensure dangerous contami-
nants aren’t present, or require warn-
ing labels when needed to alert con-
sumers. If an ingredient is simply un-
safe for use under any conditions, the
FDA can require that it be banned
from use in all personal care products.
Just this week, the FDA announced
finding asbestos in several different
types of make-up marketed to children
and teens at the popular store, Claire’s.
This is a serious concern that high-
lights the need for Congress to move
quickly to give FDA the tools they
need.
Under our bill, the FDA could imple-
ment new screening protocols for con-
taminants like asbestos. Companies
would be required to register, so it
would be easier to know where prod-
ucts were coming from. FDA would
have mandatory recall authority for
personal care products like they do for
food, and companies would finally be
required to report adverse health
events.
The Personal Care Products Safety
Act is the result of many diverse
groups working together with the com-
mon goal of modernizing the Federal
oversight system to ensure the safest
products possible are on the market.
These stakeholders include small and
large companies, doctors, consumer ad-
vocates, patient advocates, scientists,
and the Food and Drug Administration.
This legislation recognizes the needs
of businesses of all sizes to support
their growth while not sacrificing high
safety standards that will keep con-
sumers safe and raise the bar for indus-
try standards. Many companies are
taking voluntary steps to do the right
thing, but it is time for this to be a
uniform requirement.
Another shocking example of concern
is the ongoing use of formaldehyde,
also called methylene glycol when in
liquid form. It is used in the popular
hair straightening treatment called a
Brazilian blowout. During this beauty
treatment, formaldehyde is released
into the air and can cause shortness of
breath, headaches, and dizziness in the
short-term. Exposure to formaldehyde
long-term has even been linked to can-
cer.
I am also greatly concerned about
safety of salon professionals, who are
exposed daily to a variety of chemicals.
In addition to reviewing the safety of
chemicals they may be exposed to, this
legislation ensures that the salon prod-
ucts they use are properly labeled with
ingredients and warnings.
This bill will require the Food and
Drug Administration to evaluate at
least five ingredients per year for safe-
ty and use in personal care products. In
addition to reviewing the latest sci-
entific and medical studies, the agency
will consider how prevalent the ingre-
dient is, the likelihood to exposure, ad-
verse event reports, and information
from public comments.
Public input will be critical to the
review process. There will be opportu-
nities for companies, scientists, con-
sumer groups, medical professionals,
and members of the public to weigh in
on not only the safety of particular in-
gredients but also which ingredients
should be a priority for review.
After review, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration may deem an ingredient
safe, unsafe, or safe under certain uses
or under certain conditions. The agen-
cy will also have the authority to re-
quire warning labels as needed for cer-
tain ingredients and limit the amount
of an ingredient that may be used in
personal care products. For example,
some ingredients may only be safe for
use by adults or when used by profes-
sionals in a salon or spa setting.
The Personal Care Products Safety
Act will also require companies to pro-
vide the Food and Drug Administration
with a list of their products’ ingredi-
ents and attest to their safety.
The bill recognizes the unique nature
of the American handmade cosmetic
industry and meets their needs to en-
courage growth and innovation. This
legislation provides flexibility for
small businesses, particularly those
making low-risk products. And this bill
would not increase taxpayer obliga-
tions because it is paid for by user fees
from the cosmetic industry.
I am pleased to have the support of a
broad coalition, including Environ-
mental Working Group, Endocrine So-
ciety, National Alliance for Hispanic
Health, National Women’s Health Net-
work, American Autoimmune Related
Diseases Association, March of Dimes,
Handmade Cosmetic Alliance, and the
following companies that together rep-
resent over 90 brands of products: The
Estee Lauder Companies, Procter and
Gamble, Revlon, Unilever, L’Oreal,
Johnson and Johnson, Beautycounter,
Makes 3 Organics, SkinOwl, Silk
Therapeutics, and S.W. Basics.
I want to thank Senator COLLINS for
her support and hard work on this im-
portant legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to join us in supporting this
much needed legislation to modernize
our outdated regulatory system for
personal care products, and I hope the
Senate will pass this long overdue leg-
islation this year.

Governmental Affairs:
S. RES. 99
Whereas Congress has the authority to es-
tablish post offices and post roads under
clause 7 of section 8 of article I of the Con-
stitution of the United States;
Whereas the United States Postal Service
is a self-sustaining, independent establish-
ment that relies on revenue derived from the
sale of postal services and products, not on
taxpayer funds;
Whereas more than 503,000 career employ-
ees work for the United States Postal Serv-
ice, including more than 105,000 military vet-
erans;
Whereas the United States Postal Service
is at the center of the mailing industry,
which generates $1,400,000,000,000 annually
and employs approximately 7,500,000 individ-
uals in the United States;
Whereas the United States Postal Service
serves the needs of approximately 157,000,000
business and residential customers not fewer
than 6 days per week, maintains an afford-
able and universal network, and connects the
rural, suburban, and urban communities of
the United States;
Whereas the United States Postal Service
is consistently the highest-rated agency of
the Federal Government in nonpartisan
opinion polls;
Whereas the United States Postal Service
is the second largest employer of veterans in
the United States;
Whereas the employees of the United
States Postal Service—
(1) are dedicated public servants who do
more than process and deliver the mail of
the people of the United States; and
(2) serve as the eyes and ears of the com-
munities of the United States and often re-
spond first in situations involving health,
safety, and crime in those communities; and
Whereas the privatization of the United
States Postal Service would—
(1) result in higher prices and reduced serv-
ices for the customers of the United States
Postal Service, especially in rural commu-
nities;
(2) jeopardize the booming e-commerce sec-
tor; and
(3) cripple a major part of the critical in-
frastructure of the United States: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate
that Congress should take all appropriate
measures to ensure that the United States
Postal Service remains an independent es-
tablishment of the Federal Government and
is not subject to privatization, in whole or in
part.

SENATE RESOLUTION 101—SUP-
PORTING THE GOALS OF INTER-
NATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY
Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Ms. COL-
LINS, Mr. MURPHY, and Ms. BALDWIN)
submitted the following resolution;
which was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 101
Whereas, as of March 2019, there are ap-
proximately 3,700,000,000 women in the world;
Whereas women and girls around the
world—
(1) have fundamental human rights;
(2) play a critical role in providing and car-
ing for their families;
(3) contribute substantially to food secu-
rity, economic growth, and the prevention
and resolution of conflict; and
(4) must be empowered to more fully par-
ticipate in the political, social, and eco-
nomic lives of their communities in order to
accelerate the growth of healthier, more sta-
ble societies;
Whereas the advancement and empower-
ment of women and girls around the world is
a foreign policy priority for the United
States;
Whereas the National Security Strategy of
the United States, published in December
2017—
(1) declares that ‘‘societies that empower
women to participate fully in civic and eco-
nomic life are more prosperous and peace-
ful’’;
(2) supports ‘‘efforts to advance women’s
equality, protect the rights of women and
girls, and promote women and youth em-
powerment programs’’; and
(3) recognizes that ‘‘governments that fail
to treat women equally do not allow their
societies to reach their potential’’;
Whereas the United States National Action
Plan on Women, Peace, and Security, revised
in June 2016, states, ‘‘Deadly conflicts can be
more effectively avoided, and peace can be
best forged and sustained, when women be-
come equal partners in all aspects of
peacebuilding and conflict prevention, when
their lives are protected, their voices heard,
and their perspectives taken into account.’’;
Whereas there are 79 national action plans
relating to the empowerment of women
around the world, 11 regional action plans,
and several additional national action plans
known to be in development;
Whereas the joint strategy of the Depart-
ment of State and the United States Agency
for International Development entitled ‘‘De-
partment of State & USAID Joint Strategy
on Countering Violent Extremism’’ and
dated May 2016—
(1) notes that women can play a critical
role in identifying and addressing drivers of
violent extremism in their families, commu-
nities, and broader society; and
(2) commits to supporting programs that
engage women ‘‘as key stakeholders in pre-
venting and countering violent extremism in
their communities’’;
Whereas, according to the Bureau of Inter-
national Narcotics and Law Enforcement Af-
fairs of the Department of State, the full and
meaningful participation of women in secu-
rity forces vastly enhances the effectiveness
of the security forces;
Whereas, despite the contributions of
women to society, hundreds of millions of
women and girls around the world continue
to be denied the right to participate freely in
civic and economic life, lack fundamental
legal protections, and are left vulnerable to
exploitation and abuse;
Whereas, every year, approximately
12,000,000 girls are married before they reach
the age of 18, which means that—
(1) nearly 33,000 girls are married every
day; or
(2) nearly 23 girls are married every
minute;
Whereas, according to the International
Labour Organization, 71 percent of the esti-
mated 40,300,000 victims of modern slavery in
2016 were women or girls, with girls rep-
resenting 3 out of every 4 child trafficking
victims;
Whereas, according to UNICEF—
(1) approximately 1⁄4 of girls between the
ages of 15 and 19 are victims of physical vio-
lence;
(2) approximately 15,000,000 girls between
the ages of 15 and 19 have experienced rape or
other forced sexual acts; and
(3) an estimated 1 in 3 women around the
world has experienced some form of physical
or sexual violence;
Whereas, according to the 2018 report of
the United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime entitled ‘‘Global Report on Traf-
ficking in Persons’’, 72 percent of all de-
tected trafficking victims are women or
girls;
Whereas, on August 10, 2012, the United
States Government launched a strategy enti-
tled ‘‘United States Strategy to Prevent and
Respond to Gender-Based Violence Glob-
ally’’, which is the first interagency strategy
that—
(1) addresses gender-based violence around
the world;
(2) advances the rights and status of
women and girls;
(3) promotes gender equality in United
States foreign policy; and
(4) works to bring about a world in which
all individuals can pursue their aspirations
without the threat of violence;
Whereas, in June 2016, the Department of
State released an update to that strategy,
underscoring that ‘‘preventing and respond-
ing to gender-based violence is a cornerstone
of the U.S. Government’s commitment to ad-
vancing human rights and promoting gender
equality and the empowerment of women
and girls’’;
Whereas, according to the United Nations
Entity for Gender Equality and the Em-
powerment of Women (commonly referred to
as ‘‘UN Women’’), peace negotiations are
more likely to end in a peace agreement
when women and women’s groups play a
meaningful role in the negotiation process;
Whereas, according to a study by the Inter-
national Peace Institute, a peace agreement
is 35 percent more likely to last at least 15
years if women participate in the develop-
ment of the peace agreement;
Whereas, on October 6, 2017, the Women,
Peace, and Security Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C.
2152j et seq.) was enacted into law, which in-
cludes requirements for a government-wide
‘‘Women, Peace, and Security Strategy’’ to
promote and strengthen women’s participa-
tion in peace negotiations and conflict pre-
vention overseas, enhanced training for rel-
evant United States Government personnel,
and follow-up evaluations of the effective-
ness of the strategy;
Whereas, on October 25, 2018, Ambassador
Jonathan Cohen, United States Deputy Per-
manent Representative to the United Na-
tions, stated in the United Nations Security

March 7, 2019
Council Annual Open Debate on Women,
Peace and Security that—
(1) ‘‘promoting women’s equal and mean-
ingful inclusion and participation across ef-
forts to restore security, promote democracy
and good governance, and support economic
development are not women’s issues; they
are vital national security issues’’;
(2) ‘‘our experience shows that women
often have the best understanding of the
needs of their communities’’;
(3) ‘‘the United States believes strongly
that countries with high rates of gender in-
equality are more likely to experience insta-
bility and deadly conflict . . . [m]eaningful
participation of women at all levels of secu-
rity work, including in uniform, can help
counteract this worrying trend’’;
(4) ‘‘empowering women economically
starts with ensuring girls have access to edu-
cation . . . [g]irls suffer most when there are
attacks on schools or when combatants mis-
use schools to support combatant oper-
ations’’;
(5) ‘‘if we hope to prevent conflicts and
build lasting peace, promote better govern-
ance, and advance sustainable economic
growth, we must empower women as full and
equal partners at every step’’; and
(6) ‘‘women are half the population . . .
[i]t’s only right that they be full partici-
pants in the discussions and decisions that
shape our present and those that will shape
our futures’’;
Whereas, despite the achievements of indi-
vidual female leaders—
(1) women around the world remain vastly
underrepresented in—
(A) high-level positions; and
(B) national and local legislatures and gov-
ernments; and
(2) according to the Inter-Parliamentary
Union, women account for only 24.1 percent
of national parliamentarians and 18.3 percent
of government ministers;
Whereas the ability of women and girls to
realize their full potential is critical to the
ability of a country to achieve strong and
lasting economic growth, self-reliance, and
political and social stability;
Whereas, although the United Nations Mil-
lennium Project reached the goal of achiev-
ing gender parity in primary education in
most countries in 2015, more work remains
to be done to achieve gender equality in pri-
mary and secondary education, and particu-
larly in secondary education worldwide as
gender gaps persist and widen, by address-
ing—
(1) discriminatory practices;
(2) cultural norms;
(3) inadequate sanitation facilities;
(4) child, early, and forced marriage; and
(5) other factors that favor boys or devalue
girls’ education;
Whereas women around the world face a
variety of constraints that severely limit
their economic participation and produc-
tivity and remain underrepresented in the
labor force;
Whereas women’s economic empowerment
is inextricably linked to a myriad of other
human rights that are essential to the abil-
ity of women to thrive as economic actors,
including—
(1) living lives free of violence and exploi-
tation;
(2) achieving the highest possible standard
of health and well-being;
(3) enjoying full legal and human rights,
such as access to registration, identification,
and citizenship documents, and freedom of
movement;
(4) benefitting from formal and informal
education;
(5) benefitting from equal protection of and
access to land and property rights;
(6) receiving access to fundamental labor
rights;
(7) the implementation of policies to ad-
dress disproportionate care burdens; and
(8) receiving business and management
skills and leadership opportunities;
Whereas closing the global gender gap in
labor markets could increase worldwide
gross domestic product by as much as
$28,000,000,000,000 by 2025;
Whereas, pursuant to section 3(b) of the
Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic
Empowerment Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–
428), it is the international development co-
operation policy of the United States—
(1) to reduce gender disparities with re-
spect to economic, social, political, edu-
cational, and cultural resources, wealth, op-
portunities, and services;
(2) to strive to eliminate gender-based vio-
lence and mitigate its harmful effects on in-
dividuals and communities including
through efforts to develop standards and ca-
pacity to reduce gender-based violence in the
workplace and other places where women
work;
(3) to support activities that secure private
property rights and land tenure for women in
developing countries, including—
(A) legal frameworks that give women
equal rights to own, register, use, profit
from, and inherit land and property;
(B) improving legal literacy to enable
women to exercise the rights described in
subparagraph (A); and
(C) improving the capacity of law enforce-
ment and community leaders to enforce such
rights;
(4) to increase the capability of women and
girls to fully exercise their rights, determine
their life outcomes, assume leadership roles,
and influence decision making in households,
communities, and societies; and
(5) to improve the access of women and
girls to education, particularly higher edu-
cation opportunities in business, finance,
and management, in order to enhance finan-
cial literacy and business development, man-
agement, and strategy skills;
Whereas, according to the World Health
Organization, global maternal mortality de-
creased by approximately 44 percent between
1990 and 2015, yet approximately 830 women
and girls continue to die from preventable
causes relating to pregnancy or childbirth
each day, and 99 percent of all maternal
deaths occur in developing countries;
Whereas the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees reports that
women and girls comprise approximately 1⁄2
of the 68,500,000 refugees and internally dis-
placed or stateless individuals in the world;
Whereas it is imperative—
(1) to alleviate violence and discrimination
against women and girls; and
(2) to afford women every opportunity to
be full and productive members of their com-
munities; and
Whereas March 8, 2019, is recognized as
International Women’s Day, a global day—
(1) to celebrate the economic, political,
and social achievements of women in the
past, present, and future; and
(2) to recognize the obstacles that women
face in the struggle for equal rights and op-
portunities: Now, therefore, be it

f
SELF-INITIATION TRADE
ENFORCEMENT ACT
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I know
that American small businesses can
outcompete anybody in the world; how-
ever, they deserve to have a level play-
ing field. All too often, foreign coun-
tries engage in unfair trade practices—
like dumping and countervailing du-
ties—that make it harder for small and
midsized businesses to compete in the
global marketplace.
This is especially true in my home
State of Michigan, where businesses,
from family farms to auto part sup-
pliers and other small manufacturers,
face unfair competition from foreign
competitors whose products are sub-
sidized by their governments.
Michigan’s cherry growers have expe-
rienced these unfair practices first-
hand. In Traverse City, which is home
of the National Cherry Festival, Michi-
gan cherry growers struggled to sell
their products after Turkey dumped ar-
tificially priced cherry juice into the
American markets. As a result, many
of Michigan’s cherry growers are facing
dire financial situations.
Late last year, the Commerce De-
partment revoked the duty-free status
of cherry juice from Turkey, but
Michigan cherry growers had to wait
far too long for the government to step
up. Small businesses and agricultural
producers don’t have the resources to
employ an army of international trade
lawyers like larger corporations and
other industries do. As a result, they
are often defenseless against illegal
trade practices that undercut Amer-
ican businesses and American workers.
We must use our expertise and strength
to stand up for these small businesses
and give them a fair fight.
Under current law, the Commerce
Department has the authority to start
their own investigations into these
harmful trade practices, but unfortu-
nately they rarely do. That is why last
week, I introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion with Senator BURR to address un-
fair trade practices.
The Self-Initiation Trade Enforce-
ment Act will strengthen protections
for small businesses and their workers
by creating a permanent task force
dedicated to proactively identifying il-
legal trade practices that unfairly tar-
get small businesses and small indus-
tries.
Last year, I attended a bipartisan
trade policy meeting with President
Trump and Commerce Secretary Ross,
and I discussed this commonsense leg-
islation with both of them. They both
expressed their strong support. I will
continue to work with the administra-
tion and my colleagues in Congress to
get this legislation signed into law.
Michigan workers and businesses de-
serve a fair chance to compete, and I
will keep fighting to enforce fair trade
rules and give Michigan’s small busi-
nesses a level playing field. I urge my
colleagues to support the Self-Initi-
ation Trade Enforcement Act to help
small businesses and family farms
across Michigan and the United States
successfully compete and ultimately
succeed.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f

POSTAL FACILITY DESIGNATED

RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN
WELDING SOCIETY ON THEIR
100TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate the American Welding
Society on their 100th anniversary, and to
commend them on their exemplary service to
not only the global welding industry as a
whole, but also our community in South Flor-
ida.
The American Welding Society (AWS) was
founded in 1919 when leaders within the in-
dustry joined forces to advance the science,
technology, and application of welding on both
a national and international scale. Initially, the
AWS was composed of 286 members and had
one section, located in Philadelphia, PA.
Today, the AWS is headquartered in Miami,
FL and offers services for over 70,000 mem-
bers worldwide. In line with their mission to
offer professional development, the AWS pro-
vides a number of certification programs for
welders, including the Certified Welding In-
spector program, which was established in
1976, and has since certified over 97,000
welding inspectors.
Having had the privilege to work with the
AWS on a number of occasions during my
time in Congress, I know firsthand the level of
commitment and dedication that the entire or-
ganization has for the industry and its mem-
bers. In its one hundred years of activity, the
AWS has continued to make monumental
strides in assisting and advancing welders
around the world. Notably, the organization
has done an exceptional job in expanding the
welding network through educational opportu-
nities and research programs, which, in turn,
has led to immense growth throughout the in-
dustry.
I am proud that a well-respected and com-
mitted organization like the AWS is not only
headquartered in our great state, but also
Florida’s 25th District. By celebrating its 100th
anniversary and reaching this significant mile-
stone, the AWS has proven that their mission
of bettering the welding industry not only pro-
vides significant results, but is also essential
for its continued growth.
Madam Speaker, I am honored to pay trib-
ute to the American Welding Society for its
significant contributions to the industry and I
ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing
this remarkable organization for its dedicated
work in the local and global welding commu-
nity.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Brendan Ar-
cher-Jones for receiving the Arvada Wheat
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
Brendan Archer-Jones is a student at Ar-
vada West High School and received this
award because his determination and hard
work have allowed him to overcome adversi-
ties.
The dedication demonstrated by Brendan
Archer-Jones is exemplary of the type of
achievement that can be attained with hard
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of
their education and develop a work ethic
which will guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Brendan Archer-Jones for winning the Arvada
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth
award. I have no doubt he will exhibit the
same dedication and character in all of his fu-
ture accomplishments.

RECOGNIZING THE 31ST ANNIVER-
SARY OF MASSACRES AGAINST
ARMENIANS IN SUMGAIT
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the thirty-first anniversary of the po-
groms against people of Armenian descent in
Sumgait, Azerbaijan.
In late February of 1988 the Armenian peo-
ple of Nagomo Karabakh, more commonly
known by its people and descendants as
Artsakh, rose up in peaceful protest to de-
mand their right to self-determination. This
courageous call for equality and human dignity
was met with murderous riots beginning on
February 27, 1988, which lasted for three
days. Scores of Armenians were killed, hun-
dreds were wounded, and thousands were
forced to leave their homes and livelihoods
behind.
Undeterred by this oppression, the Arme-
nian community and its dedication to demo-
cratic self-determination sparked a movement
that finally helped bring an end to the dictator-
ship of the Soviet Union. The courage dem-
onstrated by the people of Artsakh in demand-
ing their rights even after all their adversity is
admirable and should never be forgotten. The
people of Artsakh continue to exhibit this
strength and courage in the twenty-first cen-
tury as they stride towards creating a better
tomorrow.
On behalf of the thousands of Armenian
Americans living in my congressional district, I
ask my colleagues to stand with the people of
Artsakh in remembering the lives lost during
this tragic conflict. May their memory serve as
a reminder for each and every one of us to
continue advocating for human rights and
democratic freedoms around the world.

IN RECOGNITION OF WORLD
LYMPHEDEMA DAY
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York.
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to World
Lymphedema Day. World Lymphedema Day is
committed to increasing awareness of a dis-
ease that affects up to 10 million Americans
and as many as 200 million people worldwide.
Lymphedema is an extremely understudied
yet common disease that occurs when the
body’s natural lymphatic drainage system is
underdeveloped, blocked, or damaged. The
lymphatic fluid, unable to properly drain, be-
comes trapped in a particular area of the body
like the arms, legs, torso, head, or neck. The
resulting swelling can hinder mobility and im-
pair proper bodily functions. In many cases,
the swelling can cause extreme pain dramati-
cally reducing quality of life.
Stanford University estimates that 10 million
Americans are affected by Lymphedema; how-
ever, Lymphedema research continues to be
chronically underfunded. This has led to an
unfortunate number of misdiagnoses and
under-treatment of the disease, which add sig-
nificant costs to patients and the healthcare in-
dustry.
Lymphedema can be inheritable or result
from a trauma or health complication later in
life. Secondary Lymphedema is reported to
develop after health experiences such as can-
cer treatment, radiation therapy, major sur-
gery, and severe burns. Combat injuries sus-
tained by the brave men and women who
serve our country significantly increase the
risk of developing Lymphedema.
Lymphedema affects an estimated 15 per-
cent of all cancer survivors and 40 percent of
all breast cancer survivors. This is particularly
concerning as one in eight women will be di-
agnosed with breast cancer at some point in
their lives.
In 2016, the New York State legislature be-
came the first legislative body in the world to
recognize March 6 as Annual World
Lymphedema Day and the U.S. Senate com-
memorated the day in the last Congress.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing the amazing dedication and
strength of the advocates, patients, and health
care providers calling for increased awareness
of and research funding for Lymphedema as
we mark World Lymphedema Day.

IN HONOR OF THE AMERICAN PEA-
NUT SHELLERS ASSOCIATION’S
100 YEAR ANNIVERSARY
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it
is my great honor to extend a heartfelt con-
gratulations to the American Peanut Shellers
Association (APSA) as it celebrates 100 years
in leading the effort to expand and advance
the American peanut industry. The APSA will
be celebrating this great milestone on Friday,
April 5, 2019, during the Industry Spring Con-
ference at the Bindery at Oakland Library in
Leesburg, Georgia.
The APSA was established by commercial
peanut shellers and crushers from Georgia,
Alabama, and Florida who began operations in
early 1918 as the Southeastern Peanut Asso-
ciation (SPA). Approximately a year later, on
April 5, 1919, a group of commercial peanut
farmers representing their home states con-
vened in Atlanta to officially charter the South-
eastern Peanut Association. On November 30,
1993, the Southeastern Peanut Association of-
ficially changed its name to the American Pea-
nut Shellers Association to incorporate other
shelling companies from other states. The cur-
rent APSA headquarters in Albany, Georgia
was completed in 1986 and has been the offi-
cial hub of this renowned association since it’s
relocation from Americus, Georgia in the early
in 1960s.
For the past 100 years, Georgia peanut
farmers through the APSA have been suc-
cessful in improving the profitability of peanuts
and peanut products by working to promote
and increase consumption. In 1965, the APSA
co-sponsored first USA Peanut Congress—the
largest meeting of all segments of the peanut
industry. Today, the APSA is the oldest orga-
nized group in the peanut industry boasting 10
active member shelling companies and 145
associate members who handle 90 percent of
the peanuts grown in the United States.
I take much pride in the fact that Georgia
leads the nation in production of peanuts with
nearly 50 percent of the annual peanut crop.
Georgia has 14,000 farms with peanuts and
about 4,500 active farmers. Approximately 200
businesses in Georgia are peanut-related.
Two million bags of peanuts are distributed
annually and the industry contributes more
than 50,000 jobs and an estimated $2 billion
to the economy of the state of Georgia.
Since George Washington Carver discov-
ered the many uses for the peanut in the early
twentieth century, peanuts have become a
household food staple and a source of dietary
fiber, protein, and other healthy nutrients. Al-
though peanuts are produced in other parts of
the country, I am a firm believer that no pea-
nuts are of higher quality or more delicious
than Georgia peanuts.
On a personal note, I would like to thank
John Powell, Executive Director of the Amer-
ican Peanut Shellers Association, and the rest
of the wonderful staff as well as Chairman
Ralph Johnson and all those who serve on the
Associate Board of Directors. Their hard work
and dedication have contributed to the suc-
cess of the APSA in many ways.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the residents
of Georgia’s Second Congressional District,
the state of Georgia, and all those nationwide
and worldwide who enjoy our tasty American
peanuts, I ask my colleagues to join me today
in paying tribute to the American Peanut Shell-
ers Association for their exemplary services
and dedicated efforts to support our Nation’s
peanut industry over the past 100 years.

TRIBUTE TO MR. SHAY D. ASSAD
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I wish to
honor a Massachusetts constituent, Mr. Shay
Assad, who will be retiring this year after near-
ly 25 years of combined military and federal
service to our country.
He graduated with distinction from the U.S.
Naval Academy; thereafter, he served two
tours of duty aboard U.S. Navy destroyers and
won recognition as the Outstanding Junior Of-
ficer, Fifth Naval District. He is an Aegis
Weapons system and Arleigh Burke class
plank owner having served as the Naval Pro-
curement Officer who procured the Navy’s first
Aegis system for DDG–47 at the Naval Sea
Systems Command. He commenced federal
government civil service as the assistant Dep-
uty Commandant, Installations and Logistics
for Contracts at headquarters, the Marine
Corps, Washington, D.C., serving as the sen-
ior civilian contracting official for the U.S. Ma-
rine Corps. Mr. Assad joined the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD) in April 2006.
During his tenure in OSD, Mr. Assad first
served as the Director, Defense Pricing and
Acquisition Policy (DPAP). As such he was
the recognized functional leader of a work-
force of 27,000 contracting and pricing profes-
sionals responsible for the procurement of ap-
proximately $300B in goods and services an-
nually.
In addition, from January 2009 through June
5, 2011 he concurrently served in other Acqui-
sition, Technology & Logistics (AT&L) leader-
ship positions. For a period of time he served
as the Acting Deputy Under Secretary of De-
fense for Acquisition and Technology. He also
performed the duties of the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Acquisition. In June
2011, he left his role as Director, DPAP to
serve in the newly established position of Di-
rector, Defense Pricing. In August 2017
through December 2018, he served as Acting
Director, DPAP, concurrent with his duties as
Director, Defense Pricing. His combined senior
executive experience in the Defense industry
(where Mr. Assad served for 25 years prior to
joining OSD) and in Government was without
peer among members of the Senior Executive
Service.
Among his most significant accomplish-
ments for the Department of Defense, Mr.
Assad led the development and implementa-
tion of the largest and most expansive plan in
the Department’s history that focused on im-
proving both the size and quality of the acqui-
sition workforce. This plan, known as the De-
fense Acquisition Workforce Development
Force (DAWDF) initiative, still serves today as
the cornerstone for improving the quality of the
acquisition workforce. In addition, Mr. Assad
developed and implemented the Department
of Defense Contract Peer Review process
which oversaw every sole source procurement
in excess of $500 million dollars, as well as
every significant competitive source selection
within the Department of Defense over the
past twelve years. The peer review process
has been recognized to have enabled the sav-
ings of billions for the taxpayers through im-
proving the quality of the Department’s con-
tract business dealings.
Mr. Assad also led the OSD peer review
team that oversaw the successful conduct of
the largest single source selection in the De-
partment’s history—the KC–X tanker program
resulting in saving billions for the taxpayers.
He led the Department of Defense mediation
and developed the successful strategy to re-
solve litigation associated with the Depart-
ment’s Space Launch Program, enabling an
increase in the security posture of the United
States, while saving hundreds of millions for
the taxpayers.
Over his tenure of federal service, Mr.
Assad was the most decorated contracting
and pricing professional in the career civil
service having received numerous federal
service awards. Principal among those awards
were: 1) the Distinguished Service Medal with
Bronze Palms; 2) the Distinguished Service
Medal; 3) the Secretary of Defense Meri-
torious Service Medal; 4) the Secretary of De-
fense Exceptional Service Medal; 5) a Distin-
guished Presidential Rank Award; 6) a Meri-
torious Presidential Rank Award; 7) the De-
partment of Defense Inspector General Jo-
seph H. Sherick Award (the highest honor be-
stowed on non-OIG employees); and 8) the
David Acker Award for Acquisition Excellence.
He was inducted into the Defense Acquisition
University (DAU) Hall of Fame in recognition
of his leadership in the acquisition profession
and for the establishment of the DAWDF initia-
tive. He has been the Department’s leading
advocate for increasing employment opportu-
nities for the blind and severely disabled; and
has received numerous awards to include the
E. Richard ‘‘Dick’’ Alley Career Achievement
Award (Ability One Program’s highest recogni-
tion) and the Osbourne ‘‘Oz’’ Day Award for
those efforts.

IN RECOGNITION OF STATE REP-
RESENTATIVE EDDIE DAY
PASHINSKI, THE WILKES-BARRE
FRIENDLY SONS’ MAN OF THE
YEAR
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Pennsylvania State Rep-
resentative Eddie Day Pashinski, who will re-
ceive the Man of the Year Award at the
Wilkes-Barre Friendly Sons’ annual St. Pat-
rick’s Day celebration on Friday, March 15,
2019. Eddie has been a dedicated public serv-
ant for more than four decades, first as a
music teacher, then as a state representative.
Eddie is a native Northeastern Pennsylva-
nian. He received a Bachelor of Science de-
gree in music education from Wilkes Univer-
sity and has a master’s equivalency. For 38
years, Eddie served as music teacher and
choral director in the Greater Nanticoke Area
School District. He was an active member of
the union, the GNA Education Association,
where he advanced the profession of teaching
and ensured that students receive a quality
education from highly qualified and equitably
treated educators. Always motivated to serve
at the highest level, Eddie took on leadership
roles such as chief spokesperson, vice presi-
dent, and president.
Driven by his civic minded sensibility, out-
going personality, and desire to create sus-
tainable change for the community at large,
Eddie ran for the 121st Legislative District seat
to represent Wilkes-Barre City, Fairview Town-
ship, Wilkes-Barre Township, Ashley Borough,
Hanover Township, and Laurel Run Borough
in the state house in Harrisburg. He handily
won the 2006 election and has held the office
since.
Eddie found great success as a state legis-
lator. He is an ardent supporter of health care
reform and has spearheaded a task force of
regional experts to offer recommendations to
improve our health care system to make it
more affordable and accessible. In the wake
of the devastating flooding in 2011, Eddie in-
troduced a legislative package to help home-
owners and small businesses rebuild and re-
cover. His exceptional efforts on behalf of
Pennsylvanians have earned him the title of
Legislator of the Year from several organiza-
tions.
Though no longer a music teacher, Eddie
Day continues to bring the joy of music to the
people of Northeastern Pennsylvania with his
band, The Starfires. With his late wife, Millie,
Eddie is the proud father of four children and
grandfather to seven grandchildren.
It is an honor to recognize State Represent-
ative Eddie Day Pashinski as he accepts the
Man of the Year Award from the Wilkes-Barre
Friendly Sons. His public service career is ad-
mirable and unparalleled, and I thank him for
his leadership in our community and in Harris-
burg. May he continue to be extraordinarily
successful in his work for greater good of our
commonwealth.

CELEBRATING THE FIRST ANNUAL
HARRIET TUBMAN DAY HOSTED
BY THE NEW YORK STATE
EQUAL RIGHTS CENTER
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
recognition of the first annual Harriet Tubman
Day hosted by the New York State Equal
Rights Center (NYS Equal Rights Center) in
Auburn, New York. Harriet Tubman is an
American icon, whose courageous activism
helped strengthen civil and women’s rights.
Her legacy runs deep in Central New York
and still influences the local community today.
Born a slave in Dorchester County, Mary-
land, Harriet Tubman escaped to freedom in
1849. She arrived in Philadelphia but quickly
returned to Maryland to rescue the rest of her
family. Successful in guiding her family and
many other slaves to their freedom, Harriet
Tubman became a well known figure on the
Underground Railroad. Notably, she never lost
an escaped slave she was guiding to freedom
during her service as a conductor on the Un-
derground Railroad.
Harriet Tubman joined the Union when the
Civil War broke out in 1861, first serving as a
nurse and then as a scout. She possessed
knowledge of stealth travel from her time on
the Underground Railroad, a skill she passed
along to Union scouts to evade detection by
Confederate forces. This skill proved ex-
tremely helpful during the Combahee River
Raid, when she and her fellow Union scouts
sabotaged Confederate supplies. This raid
was also significant because Harriet Tubman
became the first woman to lead an armed as-
sault during the Civil War. After the war, Har-
riet Tubman moved to Auburn to care for her
family who settled there.
Women’s suffrage became a priority for Har-
riet Tubman during her later life. She became
very active in the movement, traveling
throughout the northeast to participate in dem-
onstrations and working alongside suffragist
leaders like Susan B. Anthony and Emily
Howland. While Harriet Tubman passed away
in 1913, her role in the suffrage movement
helped pave the way for full women’s voting
rights in 1920.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
House to join me in celebrating the first annual
Harriet Tubman Day hosted by the NYS Equal
Rights Center. Harriet Tubman’s contributions
to civil and women’s rights in our society is
unparalleled. The NYS Equal Rights Center
pays tribute to her activism, serving as a re-
minder for Central New Yorkers to treat every-
one in the community equally and respectfully.
I ask my fellow Representatives to honor Har-
riet Tubman’s legacy and never forget her role
in creating a more equal America for all.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 6, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 1) to expand
Americans’ access to the ballot box, reduce
the influence of big money in politics, and
strengthen ethics rules for public servants,
and for other purposes:
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, H.R. 1,
the ‘‘For the People Act of 2019’’ addresses
many significant challenges to our democratic
institutions and the conduct of federal elec-
tions. The very foundation of our democracy
depends on ensuring that our elections are
fair, accurate, and freely accessible to all
American citizens. We have witnessed in the

a time I had truly hoped would remain in the
past. We must continue to be vigilant against
anything that would impede the right to vote.
We must also protect our democratic institu-
tions for the people, and not just for a few
wealthy interests.
The U.S. election system is complex and
highly decentralized, encompassing approxi-
mately 10,000 local, county, and state election
offices. States and local jurisdictions face a
number of challenges in their administration of
federal elections, including outdated and inse-
cure technology. Most of us are on screens all
day long and have become accustomed to the
convenience. There are probably some young
people that don’t like to read on paper at all.
However, when it comes to electronic voting
systems, these same conveniences may be
subject to technical malfunctions as well as
significant cybersecurity risks that have al-
ready been shown, in real elections, to under-
mine Americans’ constitutional right to vote.
The last major voting legislation was passed
almost two decades ago. It created several
new responsibilities for the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) to work
with the Election Assistance Commission,
election administrators, and manufacturers on
voting systems technology standards develop-
ment. The Science Committee was active in
the development of that language.
Today’s bill, H.R. 1, makes an effort at ex-
panding NIST’s role in voting and elections
technology. While I support H.R. 1 overall, I
do have some concerns with the proposed
new scope of activities for NIST. NIST’s core
mission is measurement science and stand-
ards. Most people have never heard of NIST
and don’t understand what it does, but NIST
plays a central and unique role in advancing
U.S. competitiveness as well as in cybersecu-
rity across the public and private sector. The
agency has no regulatory authority, which al-
lows it to win the trust of and work closely with
industry and all kinds of stakeholders in the
standards development process. The Science
Committee has worked very hard to preserve
this standards development function of NIST.
NIST expressed concern to us that some of
the language in this bill may compromise the
agency’s ability to work closely with states and
counties on elections technology. In addition,
while other provisions in the bill are better
aligned with NIST’s mission and worthy of
support, we must ensure there is additional
funding for NIST to accomplish these impor-
tant goals. As this bill moves through the leg-
islative process, I look forward to working with
my colleagues in the House and Senate to ad-
dress both of these issues.
Election and voting integrity and security are
important to everyone in this Chamber on both
sides of the aisle, and my colleagues on the
Science Committee are eager to present legis-
lative ideas for the role of NIST in voting and
elections technology, as well as recommenda-
tions for sufficient levels of support to ensure
the agency can succeed in this mission.
Mr. Chair, I support H.R. 1 and urge its pas-
sage.

Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor a distinguished and
staunch advocate for our nation’s military, and
dear friend of longstanding, Mr. W. Parker

Woodbridge Parker Greene, Sr. was born
on December 3, 1932, to the union of the late
Woodbridge and Mildred Parker Greene in
Thomaston, Georgia. A product of the Upson
County Public School System, he graduated
from Robert E. Lee High School in 1951 and
went on to attend the Georgia Institute of
Technology. He later served in the U.S. Army
from 1953 to 1955. During that time, he was

where he made safety presentations to
schools and civic groups. He was also part of
President Eisenhower’s Georgia security de-
tail. After honorably serving his country, Mr.
Greene continued his studies at the University
of Georgia, majoring in Business Administra-
tion, and at Northwestern University, where he
attended business seminars. He spent the
next 29 years of his career as a regional man-
ager for Rhodes Furniture Company.
Mr. Greene’s dedication to the military con-
tinued after his retirement. He was the first
Squadron Commander of the ‘‘White Knuckle’’
Squadron, a unit formed by local civic leaders
who have received orientation flights in Moody
Air Force Base (AFB) aircraft. In 1991, he
helped establish the Moody Support Group,
which was instrumental in strengthening the
relationships between the local community and
the Air Force. As the Executive Director of the
group, he helped protect Moody AFB from clo-
sure. In 2000, he was appointed to the Geor-
gia Military Affairs Committee by then Gov-
ernor Roy Barnes.
In conjunction with his professional accom-
plishments, Mr. Greene was heavily involved
in his community, serving as the Chairman
(1972–85) of the Military Affairs Committee
and Vice President (1978–79) of the Valdosta/
Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce; on
the Board of Directors for the Valdosta State
College/University Foundation; and as an ac-
tive member of the ACC Commander’s Air
Power Support Group, the National Civic
Leader Group for the U.S. Air Force Chief of
Staff, Rotary International, the Kiwanis Clubs
of America, the Boy Scouts of America, the
Young Men’s Christian Association, the Moody
AFB Red Carpet Committee, the University of
Georgia Gridiron Society, and the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon Alumnae organization. In addi-
tion to his extensive community involvement,
he was also a faithful member of the First
United Methodist Church in Valdosta, where
he once served on the Administrative Board.
Mr. Greene received several prestigious
awards for his dedicated civic service, includ-
ing the Distinguished Citizen award from the
Alapaha Area Boy Scout Council (2000); the
first-ever Chief of Staff of the Air Force Award
for Exceptional Public Service (2007); and the
Air Force Distinguished Public Service Award
(2009), the highest honor the Air Force can
bestow upon a civilian. Additionally, a portion
of Bemiss Road from Valdosta to Moody AFB
(W. Parker Greene Highway, 2005) and
Moody AFB’s headquarters (W. Parker
Greene Base Support Center, 2007) were
named in his honor.
Mr. Greene achieved much in his life, but
none of it would have been possible without
the love and support of his loving wife, Lucy;
his children, Sharon and Woodbridge Jr.; and
a host of family and friends who will miss him
deeply.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ‘‘Life’s
most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What
are you doing for others?’ ’’ Mr. Greene un-
doubtedly lived by this philosophy. From his
extensive work with the development of
Moody AFB to his efforts to provide a bridge
between the military and civilians, his work
made a tremendous impact on the lives of
many.
On a personal note, I was privileged to work
with Parker for over 26 years in behalf of
Moody AFB and have not encountered a more
committed citizen to his community and Na-
tion.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more
than 730,000 people in Georgia’s Second
Congressional District in paying tribute to Mr.
W. Parker Greene, Sr. for a life well lived and
in extending our deepest sympathies to his
family, friends, and loved ones during this dif-
ficult time of bereavement. Moreover, we pray
that they will be consoled and comforted by an
abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days,
weeks, and months ahead.

just a model citizen—she has become a pillar
of our community. Her warmth, deep sense of
compassion, and ethic of community service
are extraordinary, and I feel lucky to count her
as a role model and a friend.
For many years, Toula served as a District
Governor for the Daughters of Penelope Ilios
Chapter No. 51. In this organization, Toula
has done more than just uphold and carry on
important traditions for the Greek community—
she has also brought our Greek traditions to
our broader Manchester community, helping
make our city more inclusive and open.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-

thank Toula for her decades of dedication to

counties in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Bernie
was also instrumental in establishing the
Lackawanna Heritage Valley Authority. Under
his direction, the Lackawanna River Conserva-
tion Association acquired sections of railbed
that are now incorporated into the Lacka-
wanna Heritage Trail. As Vice President of the
Rail Trail Council, his work resulted in the ac-
quisition of 40 miles of D&H railbed. As Exec-
utive Director for Lackawanna Valley Conser-
vancy, he was successful in protecting 18
properties totaling 200 acres.
He is also a great supporter of the arts. Ber-
nie is an active member of the Mulberry Poets
and Writers Association. A lifelong learner,
Bernie satisfies his intellectual curiosity and
takes it upon himself to study different dis-
ciplines, including geology, history, ecology,
and various aspects of engineering.
It is an honor to recognize a fellow environ-
mentalist and public servant for all the great
work he has done. May he continue to work
for the good of the natural world and our com-
munity. I wish Bernard the best as he accepts
the Paul ‘‘Hook’’ O’Malley Man of the Year the
Award.

HONORING SAINT THOMAS MID-
TOWN HOSPITAL ON ITS 100TH
ANNIVERSARY
HON. JIM COOPER
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. COOPER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital in
Nashville, Tennessee on the occasion of its
100th anniversary.
Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital is the larg-
est faith based nonprofit hospital in Middle
Tennessee, providing spiritually centered, ho-
listic care that sustains and improves the
Nashville community.
With its 683 licensed acute care beds, more
than 2,000 employees, 1053 physicians, and
425 allied health providers on staff, Saint
Thomas Midtown Hospital delivers world class
care and makes a tremendous impact on
Nashville and the surrounding counties every
day.
Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital provides a
wide variety of vital inpatient and outpatient
services. The clinical programs and medical
facilities are continuously updated to meet
both the changing needs of the community
and the challenges posed by new discoveries
and innovations in technology.
Saint Thomas Midtown began its healing
ministry in Nashville as Protestant Hospital on
March 20, 1919. The ownership of Protestant
Hospital was transferred to the Tennessee
Baptist Convention in 1948 and became Mid-
State Baptist Hospital. The name was later
changed to Baptist Hospital on December 17,
1964. In January 2002, Baptist Hospital joined
Saint Thomas Health’s regional health system
and became a member of Ascension, a
Catholic Health System that is the largest non-
profit, faith based health system in the United
States. In 2013, the name was changed from
Baptist Hospital to Saint Thomas Midtown
Hospital.
Despite its evolution and many name
changes over the years, one thing has re-
mained constant. Saint Thomas Midtown Hos-
pital has always been dedicated to improving
the health of our entire community, especially
the poor and most vulnerable.
We are fortunate to have a ministry like
Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital providing
compassionate care in the great state of Ten-
nessee for the past 100 years. I hope that
Nashville is lucky enough to have Saint Thom-
as Midtown Hospital caring for our citizens for
100 more years to come.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE UNITED NEGRO
COLLEGE FUND, INC.
HON. BRADLEY BYRNE
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
recognition of the 75th Anniversary of the
founding of the United Negro College Fund,
Inc. (UNCF). In it’s 75 years of existence,
UNCF has helped thousands of students at-
tend colleges and universities throughout the
country; Through their work, they have created
leaders and proud members of our commu-
nities whose contributions to the United States
are immeasurable.
The UNCF was founded in 1944 to help in-
crease the total number of black Americans
enrolled in college. UNCF traces its founding
to Frederick Douglass Patterson, who wrote
an open letter in the Pittsburgh Courier to
presidents of other private black colleges in
1934 urging them to ‘‘pool their small monies
and make a united appeal to the national con-
science.’’
Today, UNCF is a strong organization with
a profound mission to build a robust and na-
tionally-recognized pipeline of under-rep-
resented students who, because of UNCF
support, become highly-qualified college grad-
uates. UNCF also seeks to ensure their net-
work of 37-member Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs) is a respected
model of best practice in moving students to
and through college and then into the work-
force .
As co-Chair of the Bipartisan HBCU Cau-
cus, I am proud to represent the many HBCUs
in Alabama and advocate for the betterment of
all HBCUs across the country. I have appre-
ciated working with UNCF to accomplish this
mission.
Since its founding, UNCF has raised more
than $4.8 billion in scholarship aid for stu-
dents. Each year, UNCF awards scholarships
and internships to more than 10,000 students
at 1,100 colleges and universities nationwide.
Overall, more than 445,000 students have
earned college degrees due to the support
provided by UNCF.
It is impossible to measure the legacy and
contributions of UNCF. Madam Speaker,
please join me in commemorating the constant
investments by UNCF in our low-income, first
generation college students and HBCUs, and
all of the immeasurable good they have done
for our students and our nation.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E269
March 7, 2019
On Tuesday, December 11, 2018, the
Bearcats won the state championship game
against the Warner Robins Demons (47–41) in
triple overtime. This historic victory marked the
second state football title in Bearcat history
and the first since 1982. The team has played
both their lowest-scoring and highest-scoring
games of the season against the Demons,
scoring zero points in October of 2018 and 47
points at the state championship game in De-
cember.
Their victory in this year’s AAAAA state
championship embodied decades of frustra-
tion, hard work, and determination bursting
forth into an unbelievable season of athletic
excellence and teamwork. The Bainbridge
Bearcats is the first team in Georgia since
1992 to go from a .500 winning percentage or
below to state champions. The team traveled
over 1,853 miles and went on to defeat five
consecutive top ten opponents for the first
time in school history, won four consecutive
state playoff road wins for the first time in the
school’s history, and finished with a 10+ win
season for only the 6th time in school history.
The Bainbridge Bearcats finished their sea-
son with a seven-game winning streak, five of
which were on the road. The team also set
school records for interceptions returned for
touchdowns, sacks, and blocked kicks and
punts. Additionally, the team’s seniors com-
pleted their high school career with an aston-
ishing 36–16 record, the best for any senior
class in school history.
I cannot put into words the amount of pride
that the citizens of Bainbridge, and indeed in
the entire Second Congressional District, has
in being able to call this outstanding team of
athletes its own. They have accomplished an
incredible feat, one that could not have been
possible without the tireless leadership and
encouragement from their head coach, Jeff
Littleton and his staff, as well as their families,
classmates, and members of the community
who believed in their ability to bring home a
state championship title.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more
than 730,000 constituents of Georgia’s Sec-
ond Congressional District in recognizing
these hardworking young men who have per-
severed, made sacrifices, and developed the
character that will help them to succeed in
other aspects of life, and in congratulating
them on their historic achievement.

COMMEMORATING THE 1988
SUMGAIT POGROMS AGAINST
THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY
HON. BRAD SHERMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I stand in
solidarity with the Armenian American commu-
nity in commemorating the February 1988
Sumgait Pogroms. Thirty-one years ago in the
Azerbaijani town of Sumgait, peaceful Arme-
nian residents were brutally targeted on the
basis of their ethnicity and subjected to un-
speakable crimes. In March 1988, The Econo-
mist reported the atrocities and documented
the murder and mutilation of pregnant Arme-
nian women and newborn babies in a mater-
nity hospital. Other mainstream media reports
from the time speak of Azerbaijani mobs hunt-
ing down Armenian families and committing
murder, rape and property theft.
The Sumgait Pogroms were the beginning
of an escalation of violence against the Arme-
nian minority, with a wave of anti-Armenian vi-
olence spreading to Kirovabad in November
1988 and to Baku in January 1990, which cul-
minated in the forcible expulsion of 390,000
Armenians from Azerbaijan and the 1991–94
war over Artsakh (the former Nagorno
Karabakh).
In response to the Sumgait and Kirovabad
pogroms, Nobel Prize-winning dissident, nu-
clear physicist and human rights activist,
Andrei Sakharov, appealed to the international
community to condemn the atrocities and pre-
vent further violence by stating: ‘‘Armenian
people are again facing the threat of genocide.
The events in Sumgait and Kirovabad may be
its beginning. This must not be allowed to
happen!’’ (November 26, 1988, The New York
Times)
The government of Azerbaijan must be held
accountable by the international community for
the pogroms committed against its minority Ar-
menian population, and I will continue to work
in Congress to shed light on and learn the les-
sons of such atrocities.

IN MEMORY OF SEAMAN FIRST
CLASS EARL PAUL BAUM
HON. AL LAWSON, JR.
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, it
is with great personal sadness that I rise today
to honor the life and legacy of Seaman First
Class Earl Paul Baum, who was killed in ac-
tion on December 7, 1941, when his battle-
ship, the USS Oklahoma, was attacked in
Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii. He was 19 years
old. Seaman First Class Baum served his
country admirably with courage and dedica-
tion. It was a tragedy that he was taken from
us so young. Many brave and dedicated indi-
viduals who serve our country every day are
faced with life threatening challenges, and
when we lose one of them, their loss is felt
throughout our nation.
Seaman First Class Baum joined in the U.S.
Navy when he was 18 years old, leaving be-
hind his parents, a brother and three sisters in
Chicago for a naval base 4,000 miles away.
He served on the USS Oklahoma as a printer
when the ship was struck by seven torpedoes,
capsized and sank within ten minutes. Four
hundred and twenty-nine sailors and marines
perished, from a total crew of 1353.
Madam Speaker, his legacy provides an ex-
traordinary example for other young men and
women who aspire to serve.
I hope it is a comfort to his sisters Emily
Golz and May Gresh, his twelve nieces and
nephews, and numerous great and great,
great nieces and nephews, to know that so
many in our community and around our nation
respected and admired Seaman First Class
Baum and thank him for his ultimate sacrifice.

IN MEMORY OF ANN L. O’NEAL
HON. AL LAWSON, JR.
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 7, 2019
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life and legacy of Ann
L. O’Neal, a dear friend, a beloved daughter of
Florida A&M University (FAMU), the Tallahas-
see community and, indeed a great Floridian.
Ann had a tremendously vibrant presence in
and around the Florida A&M campus, where
she was widely known as ‘‘Auntie Ann’’. She
was a tremendous advocate for FAMU and
was a tireless force for the betterment of the
university, its students, and victory for all its
athletic teams.
Ann truly took that line from the FAMU alma
mater to heart—‘‘on gridiron, diamond, track
and field, I will fight whatever the battle be
. . .’’ Ann was a fixture at every single foot-
ball, basketball, softball, baseball game on
campus for over 50 years, and her enduring
loyalty to the University was infectious.
I can remember my time as a Rattler bas-
ketball player, Ann would always sit in the
stands, right behind the team bench cheering
us on. She would offer us encouragement
when we needed it, and if you messed up or
made a bad shot, she’d let you know that too.
But it was all in love and Ann loved hard. And,
I can say with great certainty that no one
loved the Rattlers as Ann did.
In her professional life, Ann O’Neal broke
barriers as the first female Space Analyst in
FAMU’s Division of Facilities Planning, where
she worked for more than 30 years. She did
her job well, and with pride. She was recog-
nized by the Florida Board of Regents, which
preceded the Florida Board of Governors,
which oversees Florida’s public universities, as
the best Space Analyst in the state. For a
time, she knew every inch of Florida A&M and
its buildings and made sure that its space was
allocated properly and accounted for.
Ann O’Neal was always full of enthusiasm,
for all things FAMU and for life in general. In
our sadness at her sudden passing, we re-
member that Ann loved the Lord, and Ann
loved FAMU. She seized every opportunity
and enjoyed every moment that she was
given. I hope it is a comfort to Ann’s family
and friends that so many people mourn their
loss and are praying for them during this sad
time.
