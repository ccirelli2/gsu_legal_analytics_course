UNITED STATES, FOR HIGH
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS
SPEECH OF
HON. JAHANA HAYES
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, my commit-
ment has always been to be honest and trans-
parent with the people of Connecticut’s 5th
District on my thinking and the decisions I
make. Impeachment is not a course I wanted
to pursue. I came to Congress to make a dif-
ference, not to impeach a President.
After extensive review of the articles of im-
peachment and the available evidence, I will
vote in favor of impeaching the President of
the United States. I do not take this action
lightly and understand the gravity of the mo-
ment.
As the impeachment discussion progressed,
I remained committed to not weighing in pub-
licly, believing it was important that everyone
had the chance to examine the case for them-
selves. As the investigation proceeded, I delib-
erately chose not to comment without having
had a chance to review all the evidence and
study the full articles as drafted.
I have now had the chance to thoroughly
consider all the evidence and the articles of
impeachment being considered on the floor of
the House of Representatives. It is clear to me
that the President attempted to use the Office
of the President to demand a foreign leader
investigate an American citizen for political
gain.
As I listened to the testimony, I became
more concerned about the actions of the
President. While some may argue these ac-
tions do not merit impeachment, to do nothing
and normalize this behavior would be a dere-
liction of my oath of office. This is a moment
where I must lead, and I will vote yes when
the articles of impeachment are brought to the
floor of the House.

HONORING STEVE GRADOWITZ
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 23, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Steve Gradowitz, who is retir-
ing from an illustrious career as a radio per-
sonality in Bakersfield, California, which I have
the honor of representing in this Chamber.
Born and raised in Bakersfield, Steve grad-
uated from East Bakersfield High School be-
fore joining the active ministry. Upon leaving
the ministry in 1968 he began what would be-
come a lifelong career in broadcasting. And
after a brief stint working in Honolulu, Hawaii,
Steve returned home to California with his wife
Jan to begin their family.
Despite being best known as Bakersfield’s
morning voice, Steve also has a successful
entrepreneurial background. In 1975 he and
Jan founded Christian Building Maintenance, a
janitorial service; and sold the successful com-
pany in 1984 while he moonlighted at KAFY.
They also became top agents for Century 21
Real Estate. In 1986 Steve began working at
KUZZ, where he would go on to spend 33
years with the Buck Owens Productions sta-
tion as Bakersfield’s premier morning person-
ality.
As any member of the Bakersfield commu-
nity will attest, we are tremendously lucky and
grateful to have had Steve help us wake up
and get going every weekday morning for so
many years. His on-air excellence during his
tenure at KUZZ earned him numerous acco-
lades including: the Bakersfield Californian’s
reader’s poll Favorite Morning Personality, the
Billboard Personality of the Year, and the
Academy of Country Music’s Air Personality of
the Year.
I have had the pleasure of getting to know
Steve over the years, and he is as good a
person as he is a radio personality. In fact, in
typical Steve fashion, when I asked him to
emcee the Merle Haggard Post Office Dec-
laration last April, he generously agreed. And
as with anything Steve does, the event was
better off with him being there. Steve’s unique
and insightful style of broadcasting will be
greatly missed by his countless dedicated lis-
teners, but I join legions of his listeners in
wishing he and Jan nothing but the best in re-
tirement. On behalf of California’s 23rd Con-
gressional District, I want to congratulate
Steve on his admirable career, and thank him
for his dedicated service to the residents of
Bakersfield, California.

CELEBRATING THE FILIPINO LA-
DIES ASSOCIATION OF GUAM
(FLAG) FOR THEIR 59TH INDUC-
TION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS
OF GUAM
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 23, 2019
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the Filipino Ladies As-
sociation of Guam (FLAG) in celebrating the
59th Induction of Executive Officers and Board
of Directors. I extend my sincerest congratula-
tions to FLAG for an outstanding event in
celebration and recognition of the triumphs of
each Member, past and present Elected Offi-
cers and Board of Directors.
The Filipino Ladies Association of Guam
was established in the year of 1962 and has
since been clear in its mission to help our
community thrive by working together effort-
lessly, encouraging unity amongst Filipino
women; enriching the Filipino culture and tra-
ditions, and strengthening their relationships
with the people of Guam.
The association received a BANAAG Award
from the Commission of Filipino Overseas or-
ganization for their efforts in assisting and pro-
viding benefactions to overseas Filipino com-
munities. They persevered in giving back to
our island through their accomplishments in
education, charities, and scholarships. Their
desire to support local organizations such as
the Guam Memorial Hospital and Governor
Joseph Flores Memorial Park are examples of
achievements to celebrate.
I express my deepest gratitude to the Fili-
pino Ladies Association of Guam’s outgoing
President, Lorie Castelo, for her leadership
throughout the year and the newly elected
President, Ma. Cristina Bansil, as she now up-
holds the extraordinary reputation of FLAG, as
well as each member, past, and present for
your untiring commitment and the promise it
holds to our community.
Again, congratulations to the Filipino Ladies
Association of Guam for a prosperous year,
and I look forward to their continued success.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GRAIL
DAWSON
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 23, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in memory of Grail Dawson, who
passed away on November 21, 2019, at the
age of 99 after a lifetime devoted to serving
his country and community.
The youngest of four siblings, Mr. Dawson
was born in Washington, D.C. in June 1920.
He attended George Washington University
and obtained a degree in Chemistry. Mr. Daw-
son volunteered for military service in the
United States Navy shortly after the start of
World War II. He completed officer training at
the Naval Academy in Annapolis, and received
a commission of Lieutenant, assigned to duty
on landing ships in the South Pacific Theater.
Mr. Dawson served in combat as a Landing
Ship Officer at Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Iwo
Jima, and the Philippines. In Bougainville, he
served as Beachmaster for a landing under
fire. Mr. Dawson received both the Asiatic-Pa-
cific Area Campaign Medal with 5 Battle Stars
and the Philippine Liberation Medal.
Upon his return from active duty, Mr. Daw-
son served a 30-year career as a Federal gov-
ernment employee, working for the Bureau of
Reclamation in Washington, D.C., Idaho, Mon-
tana, and Sacramento. While stationed in
Boise, Idaho, he met his wife Laverne, who he
was married to for 30 years and with whom he
had his two daughters. Following his wife’s
death in 1977, Mr. Dawson moved to
Mendocino County to be closer to his daugh-
ters. It was there that he met Betty Barber,
who was his life partner for the next 42 years
until his death.
In Mendocino, Grail immersed himself in
civic activities, working as a reporter for the

Mendocino News service for seven years and
serving eight years on the Board of Directors
of the Mendocino City Community Services
District. Mr. Dawson was an active member of
the Mendocino Citizen’s Advisory Committee
and was the primary author of the first
Mendocino Town Plan, working tirelessly to
help preserve the small-town character and
historical value of Mendocino.
Mr. Dawson was an active volunteer in nu-
merous community groups, including the Fort
Bragg Food Bank, Fort Bragg Library and the
Grey Panthers. His crowning achievement was
the revitalization of the Mendocino Land Trust
with his partner Betty Barber. Mr. Dawson
served for nearly 20 years on the board of
trustees and a cumulative six years as presi-
dent of the board. His commitment and dedi-
cation to the organization took the Land Trust
from a small kitchen table organization to a
highly effective conservation organization that
counted among its successes the restoration
and conservation of more than 7,000 acres
along the Big River estuary.
Mr. Dawson was a dedicated public servant
whose life exemplified the values of civic en-
gagement and service. He is survived by his
daughters Daney Dawson and Debra Dawson,
his partner Betty Barber, her daughters Terry
and Lisa, and grandsons Allegro D’Albert,
Dylan Nicolle, and Micah Cooper. He had a
son, David Dawson, deceased, by his first
wife, and he leaves two grandchildren from
this marriage, Sean Dawson and Shannon
Dawson Westphal of Maryland, and three
great grandchildren. While Mr. Dawson will be
greatly missed, his legacy will live on through
the positive impact he and his work had on
the lives of his friends, family, and the
Mendocino Coast.

IMPEACHING DONALD JOHN
TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, FOR HIGH
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS
SPEECH OF
HON. DIANA DeGETTE
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 18, 2019
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, on De-
cember 18, 2019, due to presiding over the
House of Representatives, I was unable to
speak on the House floor during the debate
for House Resolution 755—the Impeachment
of Donald John Trump for high crimes and
misdemeanors.
This is a sad and solemn day in our nation’s
history. None of us came to Congress to im-
peach a president but, when we assumed of-
fice, every one of us took an oath to uphold
the Constitution. The evidence shows clearly
that President Trump abused his power, put
our national security at risk and sought to un-
dermine the integrity of our elections. When
he was caught, he tried to cover it up.
When a president decides to violate the
public’s trust by putting his own self-interests
ahead of the country’s—as President Trump
has done—the House of Representatives has
a duty to act. As our nation’s top constitutional
experts have opined, President Trump’s con-
duct is precisely what our founders feared. It’s
why they gave Congress the power to remove
a president from office, if necessary.
No one in this country is above the law; and
President Trump, by his own actions, left us
no choice but to approve the articles of im-
peachment against him.

RECOGNIZING PRIME MINISTER
MODI’S EFFORTS TO PROMOTE
PEACE WITHIN JAMMU AND
KASHMIR
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 23, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to highlight the current situation in Jammu and
Kashmir within the greater context of the Indo-
Pakistani conflict.
Just recently, the Indian Parliament passed
legislation that changed the status of Jammu
and Kashmir by modifying provisions that im-
peded economic development and affording
the people of Jammu-Kashmir the same rights
as the people of India.
Article 370, an outdated provision of the law
that governed Jammu-Kashmir, is no more.
Article 370 and the polarized political environ-
ment that it created resulted in the loss of
thousands of innocent lives within the region.
Pakistani-based terrorist organizations such
as Lashkar-e-Taiba have conducted terrorist
attacks that have disrupted the society and
economy of Jammu-Kashmir. They have at-
tacked innocent women and children, and ag-
ricultural workers.
Prime Minister Modi has made it clear that
this change was necessary to facilitate peace
and economic prosperity. I applaud Prime Min-
ister Modi and the Parliament for their leader-
ship on ensuring the stability of Jammu-Kash-
mir.
Madam Speaker, I would also like to com-
mend the Trump Administration’s continued
work with Prime Minister Modi to ensure
peace within the region.

IN HONOR OF HIGHLAND ELEMEN-
TARY SCHOOL’S ‘‘ANITA NEW-
MAN WAY’’
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 23, 2019
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize former Highland Elementary
School principal Anita Newman. Principal
Newman served as an educator in the
Daviess County Public Schools district for 36
years before she retired in 2012. She began
her career as a teacher at Masonville Elemen-
tary School and joined Highland Elementary
School as a teacher in 1978. After a stint as
principal of Utica Elementary School, she re-
turned to Highland Elementary School as prin-
cipal in 1989. Principal Newman is a distin-
guished graduate of both Kentucky Wesley
College and Western Kentucky University. I
know that the new ‘‘Anita Newman Way’’ at
Highland Elementary School, dedicated this
month, will be a reminder of her lasting legacy
on the hearts and minds of young Daviess
County students. I thank Principal Newman for
her service.

DAUGHTERS OF PENELOPE 90TH
ANNIVERSARY
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 23, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Daughters of Penelope, in
honor of the upcoming 90th anniversary of the
organization. The Daughters of Penelope pro-
motes the ideals and traditions of Hellenism in
America, focusing on service to one’s commu-
nity.
For nearly a century, they have remained
steadfast in promoting the rich traditions of
Hellenism, civic responsibility, and family
through their philanthropic and educational ef-
forts. The Daughters of Penelope have not
only maintained these traditions within the
Greek community, but also shared them with
our larger communities and without a doubt
made them a better place for everyone to
work and live.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
thank the Daughters of Penelope for the dec-
ades of commitment to our shared ideals. I
hope they all enjoy celebrating this exciting
milestone.

CORRECTING THE RECORD ON
MOTIONS TO TABLE
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 23, 2019
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I am
kind of a stickler for details and accuracy in
terms of some of the things that have been
said here, because these debates are going to
be enshrined in the RECORD and they will be
there forever. But I want to go back to some-
thing said about the votes on impeachment: I
repeat, nobody, nobody, Democrat or Repub-
lican, has had an opportunity to vote on Arti-
cles of Impeachment. And contrary to what
has been said, voting to not table does not
mean you get an automatic vote on the im-
peachment.
I will give you an example. On November 6,
2007, the House rejected a motion to table a
Representative Kucinich resolution to impeach
Vice President Cheney, and then moved to
adopt a motion to refer the resolution to the
Judiciary Committee. And that is what most of
us had in mind.
So I can’t say everybody, but I can say that
it is just inaccurate to say that people would
have automatically voted for impeachment or
that voting not to table would mean a vote—
an automatic vote on impeachment. I think it
is important for the RECORD to be clear.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA
AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. BARBARA LEE
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 19, 2019
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
discuss the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement also known as USMCA or NAFTA
2.0.
Due to Speaker PELOSI and the negotiators’
tireless work, this USMCA is better than the
current NAFTA and what the Trump Adminis-
tration presented in the original agreement.
USMCA will establish labor specific enforce-
ment measures and an independent review
body to ensure that Mexico is complying with
labor obligations.
However, after careful consideration, I will
vote NO on the passage of USMCA.
I am disappointed by the lack of strong envi-
ronmental protections. Our planet is feeling
the effects of climate change every day, and
the lack of strong environmental protections is
something I cannot abide.
What’s more, USMCA does not contain any
binding climate standards. In fact, the deal
barely mentions climate change at all.
Finally, USMCA supports dirty fossil fuels,
allows oil and gas corporations to run ramp-
ant, and fails to address toxic pollution.
This is a shame in a time when our planet—
and our trade deals—deserve better.
Without stronger protections, this trade deal
will have catastrophic consequences to the
environment for many decades to come.
In order to meaningfully act upon our chang-
ing climate, to address our warming planet be-
fore it is too late, and to save future genera-
tions from a climate emergency.
I know that this bill will pass, so I pledge to
continue work to address climate issues relat-
ing to globalization and trade policy.
