PRAYER
Reverend Michael Wilker, Lutheran
Church of the Reformation, Wash-
ington, D.C., offered the following
prayer:
O God, with a mighty hand, You
bring people out of slavery and death
and into freedom and new life. While
Congress is in recess, as Jews celebrate
Passover, Christians celebrate the res-
urrection of Jesus, and others gather
for spring ceremonies.
Be with those whose sacred places
have been destroyed and desecrated.
We lament that the freedom to worship
in this land is constrained by racism
and xenophobia, and we are sorry when
our disrespect for people of other reli-
gions has harmed them and made us
slow to come to their aid.
We pray for our civic leaders and
servants who are called to defend the
freedom to worship.
Out of the ashes of despair, kindle
hope. Counter the winds of hate with
the breath of peace. From wintry soil
cause new seeds to spring forth. Let
justice roll down like waters and right-
eousness like an ever-flowing stream.
Amen.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud students
Angel Martinez, Laisha Campos and Veronica
Moncada for earning the Rookie of the Year
Award for their creative and unique mobile ap-
plication (app) as part of the 2019 Congres-
sional App Challenge.
As first-time participants in the challenge,
this team from the Northglenn STEM Launch
School built an app titled ‘‘Immigration Help’’
to assist members of the community with im-
migration resources allowing the community to
be a welcoming environment for new constitu-
ents.
The students of STEM Launch School spent
countless hours and used numerous tools to
learn about coding, further advancing their
STEM education. Each team built their app in
less than three months which shows their per-
severance and dedication to this challenge
and exemplifies the character and determina-
tion the faculty instills in the students at the
school.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
these students for their hard work on this
project. I am certain these students will exhibit
the same dedication and character in their fu-
ture accomplishments.
IN RECOGNITION OF JAMIE
NICHOLAU ADAMS
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Jamie Adams who is receiving the Cit-
izen of the Year and Community Care Award
from the Associated Parents’ Group of
Hillsborough for her tireless work improving
the lives of our children.
As the principal at West Hillsborough School
from 2009 to 2015 and the principal at Crock-
er Middle School from 2015 to the present,
Ms. Adams has served Hillsborough with a
dedication to students, a sense of community
and forward-thinking leadership. She has al-
ways been open to feedback and input while
remaining grounded in her principles which
focus on what is best for all students, not only
each individual student. In her own words, she
strives to ‘‘uphold high academic standards,
support innovative instruction, and build a
sense of community among students, teach-
ers, staff and parents on a daily basis.’’
Ms. Adams had devoted her entire career to
education and the betterment of others. Origi-
nally from Marysville, California, she earned
her BA in Sociology at UC Berkeley and her
MA and Ed. D from Mills College. After col-
lege, she worked at a rehabilitation hospital in
San Francisco before starting her family. She
married her husband Griffith Adams 44 years
ago and they have two children, Nicholau and
Elizabeth. Her family, she says, is her greatest
love and accomplishment.
Ms. Adams has worked at a private school
for three years and in the Piedmont Unified
School District for 17 years. To this day, she
volunteers for the Piedmont Minor Offender
Program, a program supporting minors who
made poor choices and who are engaging in
positive restitution for growth and develop-
ment.
In her ten years at HCSD, Ms. Adams has
achieved a long list of innovations and accom-
plishments. In 2011 and 2012, West was
awarded the distinguished Kent Award for
peer coaching and for ‘‘Operation Risk.’’ Oper-
ation Risk encouraged teachers to innovate
even at the risk of failure. The program was
so successful that the school district asked her
to expand it and made it one of five district-
wide initiatives. She also brought a mindful-
ness program to all grades, introduced flexible
classroom environments and desks to promote
learning and innovation, and empowered stu-
dents to establish the Principals Advisors Pro-
gram.
Ms. Adams was the first principal at HCSD
to create open forums to solicit both positive
and negative feedback from parents. This
openness to listening and trying new ideas
rapidly improved the input from parents and
the district subsequently adopted the model at
all elementary schools.
Ms. Adams understands that the success of
a child cannot be measured solely by test
scores. She is an advocate of the whole child
perspective which in some cases makes it ac-
ceptable for test scores to drop for the better-
ment of the whole child. She oversaw the
building of the environmentally friendly kinder-
garten wing, formalized the student council
election process, and created other opportuni-
ties for students interested in leadership roles.
In 2014, West was named a California Distin-
guished School.
When she started her tenure at Crocker
Middle School in 2015, she worked her magic
there. She immediately brought calm and con-
fidence to teachers and staff. She also imple-
mented science into the daily schedule.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to rise with me to honor Jamie
Adams for her exemplary service to all chil-
dren and families in Hillsborough. Her vision,
wisdom and leadership have helped shape the
educational system in the entire Hillsborough
City School District.

HONORING NELSON CARBONELL
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Nelson Carbonell, who has dedicated
many years to The George Washington Uni-
versity (GWU), especially as the Chair of its
Board of Trustees for the past six years.
Carbonell’s service to GWU has been a
labor of love. Carbonell first walked through
the university’s Professor’s Gate as a teen-
ager in the fall of 1981 during his freshman
year as a scholarship student. He was eager
to learn and fulfill his ambitions to become an
engineer. From those first years as an under-
graduate to his later years as a highly suc-

has only grown. There is no part of the univer-

Among his many contributions to GWU,
Carbonell and his wife, Michele, have estab-

Together, they established the Nelson and

Carbonell was instrumental in helping GWU

state-of-the-art Milken School for Public
Health. Carbonell spearheaded the largest
philanthropic campaign in GWU’s history,
which will empower the university to produce
consequential graduates and ideas for genera-
tions.
Carbonell’s pervasive positive influence on
both GWU and the greater D.C. community
stems not only from his abiding affection for
the university, but also from his intellectual cu-
riosity, generosity of spirit, entrepreneurial
drive and his considerable leadership skills. As
a leader, Carbonell demonstrated his keen
ability to bring various members of the com-
munity together so each person’s individual
talents and role were utilized in service of the
greater good.
I ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing Nelson Carbonell for his
leadership and selfless service during his time

IN RECOGNITION OF SUSANNE
KIRTLAND DIETRICH’S 90TH
BIRTHDAY
HON. DIANA DeGETTE
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today on the occasion of her 90th birthday, to
recognize Susanne Kirtland Dietrich, one of
the great women business leaders of her time
and a true icon in the fields of fashion, adver-
tising and cosmetics.
Susanne was born on April 26, 1929 in Nor-
folk, Virginia. After having worked in a variety
of retail and fashion positions in New York and
Philadelphia, in 1955, Susanne was named a
fashion editor at Look Magazine, where she
worked with some of the era’s top photog-
raphers, including Milton Greene, Tony
Vaccaro, and Lillian Bassman; and covered
some of the most ground-breaking fashion
trends of post-war America.
During this time, Susanne covered some of
the era’s top international icons, including
Richard Burton, Marilyn Monroe, and Sophia
Lauren; and worked closely with some of
America’s leading designers, such as Geoffrey
Bean and Norman Norrell. Despite her many
successes, some would still argue that one of
the things Susanne is best known for is having
challenged designer Rudi Gurnreich to design
the first topless bathing suit for women, which
he did—and eventually released in 1964.
One day, while at a photo shoot in Milton
Greene’s studio on the East Side of Manhat-
tan, Susanne met a Danish immigrant and
commercial artist by the name of Kurt Dietrich,
whom she would later marry. Susanne and
Kurt would go on to have three children—two
boys, Gregg and Mark, and a daughter, Alli-
son.
In those days, there was no such thing as
paid maternity leave—or any maternity leave
at all for that matter. A woman would have to
save up and use vacation time to give birth to
a child. And when they did return to work,
these new mothers were often treated as if
nothing had ever happened.
Susanne’s experience was no different, but
it was how well she was able to manage both
the constant demands of motherhood, while
continuing to pursue her highly-successful ca-
reer, that made her unique.
After the birth of her third child, Susanne
decided to shake things up. She left the pub-
lishing business entirely to pursue a new ca-
reer in advertising as a copywriter at AC&R.
While there, Susanne worked on multiple
memorable advertising campaigns, from Greek
Tourism to the Wool Bureau, before eventually
helping to launch Estee Lauder’s newest prod-
uct line, Clinique.
During this time, Susanne, a working mother
with three young children, suddenly found her-
self as one of the trend-setting jet setters of
the post-war era. She spent years traveling
the globe, frequently visiting far-flung locales,
such as London, Greece and the Caribbean—
again, all while raising her three kids.
Eventually, Susanne’s success with Clinique
led to a role at Revlon where she worked
closely with the company’s founder, Charles
Revson, and its president, Paul Woolard, to
develop some of the most memorable fra-
grances and advertisements of the day, in-
cluding ‘‘Charlie!’’ and ‘‘Jontue.’’ Not only were
these campaigns a success, they empowered
women—especially young working women—to
throw out the old rules and embrace their
womanhood in a new era.
Susanne’s success at Revlon eventually
caught the eye of Leonard Lauder, who ap-
proached her one day and asked her to come
work for him in-house at Estee Lauder. She
spent the next 24 years working on products
and campaigns for Clinique, Prescriptives and
Estee Lauder International, before retiring in
2003 at the age of 74.
Susanne’s impressive record of achieve-
ment is one that any of us would be proud of,
but what makes it extra special is how she
was able to do it all while raising a family.
Susanne has never considered herself a
pioneer of anything, but she was—and she
continues to serve as a role model for women
around the world who, like her, seek to live
their lives to the fullest while successfully bal-
ancing the demands of career, family and trav-
el.
Despite her hectic schedule and the con-
stant demands on her time, Susanne and her
husband, Kurt, made it all work. They re-
mained married for more than forty years, until
Kurt’s death in 1999, and together they cre-
ated a beautiful home for their family in New
York.
Susanne, now a grandmother to five beau-
tiful grandchildren, always said the key to her
success was never taking life too seriously. In
fact, to fully understand the way Susanne em-
braces life, just look at the lyrics of the original
1973 jingle created for her Charlie campaign:
‘‘kinda young, kinda free, and kinda wow!’’
That’s Susanne.
Today, at the age of 90, Susanne continues
to take that advice to heart, whether she’s
whipping through the New York Times Sunday
crossword puzzle, enjoying her occasional
martini, or sharing some laughs with the ones
she loves the most.
I am honored to pay tribute to Susanne,
who continues to inspire us all. And I wish her
a very happy 90th birthday.

HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, I rise in recognition of a truly great
American. Coach Allan Trimble had a football
coaching career spanning 3 decades, includ-
ing 22 seasons at Jenks High School, piling
up 242 wins and 13 state championships.
Those statistics alone are impressive, but
Coach Trimble’s leadership follows him off the
football field. His strength of character is visi-
ble in everything he does.
Coach Trimble always strived to be a posi-
tive influence not only to his players, but to the
entire student population. He still works as a
mentor for our youth today, training up the fu-
ture leaders of our community and state. He
does this with the Trimble Strong foundation,
whose mission is to bring faith, hope, and love
into the lives of every person they interact
with.
Coach Trimble takes to heart our calling
from God to be the salt of the earth. Every
person who has crossed paths with Coach
Trimble can feel the impact of his faith and
leadership.
Even after his diagnosis with ALS in 2016,
Coach Trimble continued to be a pillar of
strength, courage, and hope for his community
and the students that he works with.
I congratulate Coach Trimble on a truly
spectacular career and thank him for the im-
pact he has had on not only Jenks, but all of
Oklahoma.

LEE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL—25TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAUMA
CENTER
HON. FRANCIS ROONEY
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize Lee Memorial Hospital
as they celebrate the 25th anniversary of their
trauma center. Serving as the only trauma
center on the Gulf Coast of Florida and cov-
ering five districts with nearly 1 million resi-
dents, the trauma center has provided life-
saving care to over 42,000 critically injured pa-
tients.
Trauma is Florida’s leading cause of death
for residents between the ages of 5 and 46.
Studies have shown that patient mortality is
significantly reduced when treated in a trauma
center. Last year, Lee Memorial Hospital’s
trauma center treated more than 2,500 resi-
dents and visitors.
I congratulate Lee Health and the Lee Me-
morial Hospital team on providing Trauma
Care to our community over the past quarter
century. The contributions made to our region
are priceless. I am proud to extend best wish-
es to those observing Trauma Awareness
month during May, 2019.

IN MEMORY OF JEAN ANN
FOWARD
HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I wish to
pay tribute to the memory of a dear friend and
a remarkable woman from my community in
Dayton, Ohio, Mrs. Jean Ann Foward, who
passed away on April 11, 2019. Jean was the
wife of Dr. Derrick L. Foward, president of the
Dayton chapter of the NAACP, the second
largest NAACP chapter in the State of Ohio.
Jean was born in Springfield, Ohio on De-
cember 2, 1958. She spent most of her life in
Dayton and attended Dayton Public Schools.
She was highly recognized for her Spelling
Bee talent at Jackson Elementary School.
Jean graduated from Wilbur Wright High
School in 1976 and pursued a degree in Busi-
ness Management at Ohio University.
Jean married the love of her life, Derrick L.
Foward, on July 11, 1998. Together they
raised four wonderful children: Jayme, Letoia,
Troy Jr., and Donte. Jean was a devoted wife
and mother known throughout the community
as the ‘‘Wind beneath Derrick’s Wings’’—as
she supported him throughout his community
service career. She was sweet, mild man-
nered, and loved dearly by her family and
friends. She catered and hosted several fam-
ily, community, and political gatherings at their
home, where she welcomed everyone with a
smile.
Jean and her husband shared a passion for
the cause of justice and civil rights for all
Americans. She was an equal partner and an
inspiration to her husband in the fight for
human rights and equality for all people. She
was more than just Derrick’s wife, she was a
leader in her own right.
Jean was an exemplary community servant
and role model. She took pride in her neigh-
borhood and was a member of the Northern
Hills Neighborhood Association. Moreover, she
participated in the annual Back-To-School,
Stay-In-School school supplies event.
Jean loved volunteering for the City of Day-
ton Feast of Giving, where she served food to
hundreds of people on Thanksgiving Day. She
also participated in WDAO Radio’s annual
Feast of Love to feed the homeless and oth-
ers during the Christmas holiday season.
Jean served for 13 years as Advisor of the
Littlejohn Junior NAACP Youth Council. Be-
cause of her sound financial stewardship, the
Littlejohn Junior NAACP Youth Council had a
budget surplus from 2005 to 2018. Due to her
commitment to youth development, the
Littlejohn Junior NAACP Youth Council re-
mains the only active NAACP Junior Youth
Council in the State of Ohio.
Jean contributed greatly to the lives of many
young people throughout the Dayton region.
She exemplified phenomenal leadership in
mentoring, training, and developing our youth
ages 1 through 13. She encouraged them to
be humble leaders and faithful community
servants. During her tenure as Youth Advisor,
she had the distinct honor of richly depositing
hope, respect, integrity, discipline, and char-
acter into the lives of over 510 youth who
joined the organization under her leadership.
Because of her outstanding community
leadership, Jean was the recipient of numer-
ous awards that include: the International Ap-
ostolic University of Grace and Truth (IAUGT)
Appreciation Award (2002); the Dayton Unit
NAACP President’s Award (2011); the Youth
Empowerment Award (2013) the Stellar At-
tendance Awards (2010 through 2017); the
General Membership Award (2018); and the
Christian Women Coalition Senior Citizen
Trailblazer Award (2018).
I am deeply saddened by the loss of a long-
time personal friend and outstanding public
servant whose many contributions to the com-
munity she loved will always be remembered.
The Dayton region was blessed to have bene-
fited from the good deeds of this exceptional
mother, wife, mentor, and civil rights cham-
pion. Let us remember Jean by following her
example and committing ourselves to spread-
ing love, serving our communities, and work-
ing with our neighbors to achieve equal oppor-
tunity and justice for all Americans.
Madam Speaker, I offer my heartfelt condo-
lences and prayers to Dr. Derrick Foward
upon the loss of his beloved wife Jean Ann
Foward, and their children, family members,
and their many friends. I ask that my col-
leagues join me in honoring her memory.

HONORING VICTORIA HINOJOS FOR
RECEIVING THE GIRL SCOUT
GOLD AWARD
HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Brownsville, Texas native Victoria
Hinojos, who has earned the Girl Scouts of
the USA Gold Award.
Victoria joins a selective group of scouts,
and she should be proud of this recognition.
The Girl Scouts of the USA Gold award sym-
bolizes outstanding accomplishments in lead-
ership, community service, career planning,
and personal development. The award is con-
tingent upon earning four interest project
patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Sen-
ior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and com-
pleting the Senior Girl Scout Challenge. A
scout must also complete a Gold Project, in
which scouts identify and lead a project on a
pressing issue in the community.
For her Gold Project, Victoria assisted fami-
lies affected by domestic violence in the Rio
Grande Valley. I am impressed with her efforts
to provide the Friendship of Women Shelter in
Brownsville with additional resources. She
went above and beyond the expectations, rais-
ing awareness in the community and collabo-
rating with partners, local organizations, and
fellow Girl Scout Gold Awardee—Hannah
Edelstein.
In addition to her personal development
within the Girl Scouts, Victoria excels at Saint
Joseph Academy in Brownsville, Texas, earn-
ing second honors since freshman year. She
is an active member of the National Art Hon-
ors Society, Rotary Interact Club, and the Var-
sity Dance team. Additionally, she teaches tap
dance classes at the Brownsville Dance Cen-
ter, highlighting her leadership skills outside of
the classroom.
It is a great honor to recognize Victoria. Her
work and service make our district a better
community, and I am confident that the skills
and life lessons she learns through Girl Scouts
will prove to be invaluable in her future en-
deavors. I ask my colleagues to join me in
recognizing her achievements, work, and serv-
ice.

solid foundation is essential to creativity be-
cause it provides a place to return to after ex-
ploring new ideas. Mr. Freeman truly loves
learning and teaching. He cares deeply about
his students and made them better equipped
to handle the world around them. In fact, his
work with students has given them the tools to
shape the world around them. He is a com-
passionate person and I am so proud to have
had him as an instructor.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE,
LEGACY, AND SERVICE OF
CLINTONVILLE POLICE CHIEF
JAMES BEGGS
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Chief James Beggs’ 44
years of service in law enforcement.
Chief James Beggs began working for the
Clintonville Police Department as a full-time
Patrol Officer in September of 1975. Through
hard work and dedication, he rose up in the
ranks of the department from Patrol Lieutenant
to Police Patrol Captain, a position he held for
22 years. In 2016, Beggs was promoted to
Police Chief, a position he served in for three
years.
Throughout his career, Chief Beggs served
his community in capacities that went far be-
yond his role as Police Chief. During his 44
years of service with the Clintonville Police
Department, Chief Beggs served as a firearms
instructor for the Clintonville Police Depart-
ment, served 13 years with the Clintonville
Area Ambulance Service, and 14 years on the
Waupaca County SWAT Team. Outside of his
work with the Clintonville Police Department,
Chief Beggs achieved a number of academic
successes, including an Associates Degree in
Police Science. He also attended the FBI Law
Enforcement Executive Development School
where he was trained in emergency manage-
ment, crisis negotiations, internal affairs, and
first level leadership, as well as Homeland Se-
curity-Weapons of Mass Destruction.

went above and beyond to serve and protect
his community. His dedication to and his lead-

Chief Beggs leaves large shoes to fill and
the impact that he has had on his community
will not soon be forgotten. There is no doubt
that Chief Beggs will be missed by the officers
he worked with and by the community to
which he dedicated his career. As Chief
Beggs steps down to pursue other interests, I
have no doubt he will continue to serve as a
leader for Clintonville and the surrounding
area.

body to join me in commending Chief Beggs
for his 44 years of service with the Clintonville

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LABOR-
MANAGEMENT COUNCIL OF
GREATER KANSAS CITY
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the Labor-Manage-
ment Council (LMC) of Greater Kansas City’s
fortieth year serving the Greater Kansas City
Area. Since the LMC was founded in 1979,
they have grown to include membership from
eighty organizations, including corporations,
unions, governments, and nonprofits within the
local area.
In 1979, members of the Kansas City busi-
ness community who all cared deeply about
the labor and management process came to-
gether to form the Labor-Management Council
of Greater Kansas City. During the ensuing
years, Bob Jacobi Jr. provided steadfast and
enthusiastic service as Executive Director of
the LMC through his leadership and his pas-
sion for public service. It has been my honor
and pleasure to partner with the LMC on var-
ious occasions as they sought to create an
open and equal collaboration between local
government and organizations of all sizes in
our city.
As a trailblazer in the Greater Kansas City
area since their founding, the Labor-Manage-
ment Council (LMC) has focused on providing
the tools for employees to successfully nego-
tiate with their employers for better benefits.
The LMC developed the statuary framework of
collective bargaining where employees could
advocate for things like better healthcare and
reduction of employment uncertainty. The
LMC supported legislative proposals to pro-
vide relief via safety net hospitals for workers
and Medicaid coverage for the newly unem-
ployed and the uninsured. They continue to
advocate for a system where every citizen can
have their voice heard, and inclusion in the
workplace becomes a reality. As a friend and
collaborator with the LMC, I am inspired by
the work they accomplished in the forty years
since their genesis. My collaboration with the
LMC has been one of the more rewarding as-
pects of my career, and I am honored to have
served alongside this remarkable organization.
Throughout the years, the Labor-Manage-
ment Council of Greater Kansas City has op-
erated upon the pillars of their values and their
dedication to a larger social responsibility. Re-
fining the concept of collective bargaining,
they used this tool of broad consensus to fight
for equity and inclusivity in the larger eco-
nomic and social issues present within our
community. Together with their numerous part-
ner organizations, the LMC provides a forum
for community leaders and employees to work
together on civic and economic issues. Exam-
ples of their noteworthy contributions to the
community include their active support for ac-
cessible healthcare coverage, better public in-
frastructure, and broader citywide public trans-
portation.
Madam Speaker, please join with Missouri’s
Fifth Congressional District in honoring the
Labor-Management Council of Greater Kansas
City for their achievement of forty years of
service in the community and their indelible
mark on our society. I urge all my colleagues
and fellow citizens across the country to join
me in showing our appreciation to Labor-Man-
agement of Greater Kansas City for their
undeterred commitment to civic service and
worker advocacy in our region.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF MAUDE FORD LEE
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today with a heavy heart to honor my dear
friend, Maude Ford Lee. Maude was a long-
time civil rights activist and truly one of a kind.
A native of Tallahassee, Maude spent her life
advocating for equality. She participated in a
bus boycott in her hometown in the 1950s.
That action led Tallahassee to desegregate its
public transit. She moved to West Palm Beach
in the 1960s and spent decades working as a
manager of county social programs. Among
her many accomplishments, she was the first
black candidate elected to the Palm Beach
County Commission, where she served for ten
years. Her husband, the late Percy Lee, ran
the Urban League of Palm Beach County.
Maude lobbied for the creation of commis-
sion districts as the only way for a black can-
didate to win a seat in a mostly white county.
Through her efforts, single-member districts
were created, expanding opportunities for Afri-
can Americans to run and win in those dis-
tricts.
After stepping away from politics, Maude
became president of the West Palm Beach
chapter of the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People (NAACP). In
that role, she continued her advocacy for the
needs of the African American community,
working to address inequities locally and na-
tionwide. She reveled in another first, the 2008
election of Barack Obama as president. ‘‘This
is our greatest accomplishment,’’ she told the
Palm Beach Post at the time.
Madam Speaker, if there was such a thing
as a community servant, than Maude Ford
Lee was it. She will always be remembered
for her tireless efforts to bring resources to
Florida and the African American community.
Her legacy of public service speaks for itself,
and she will be dearly missed by all who knew
her. I offer my deepest condolences to
Maude’s family, during this extremely difficult
time.

Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the life of Chen Ling
Kou, a devoted wife, mother, and dedicated
community member who passed away after
battling cancer on April 6, 2019, at the age of
55.
Chen Ling was born to En Kai Chang and
Shu Chuan Yang Chang on November 5,
1963 in Cheongju-si, South Korea, the fifth of
six children. Chen Ling was a brilliant student
and a member of an elite study group in
Seoul, South Korea, before immigrating to Los
Angeles, California, with her family in 1982.
She would go on to attend California State
University, Fullerton and would later marry Mr.
Ming Shin Kou on February 8, 1987 in Ana-
heim, California. Approximately 1,200 people
attended the wedding.
Chen Ling was an active member of the
community of Palos Verdes Estates in my
congressional district, devoting her time to var-
ious charitable causes but she was most
proud of her three children and all their ac-
complishments. Dow Li was the first student in
the history of Marymount High School to win
the state of California Mock Trial competition
and went on to graduate from the University of
California, Berkeley.
Dow Yi obtained degrees from the Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley and the National
Taiwan University, and went on to work for
Fox Entertainment. Dow Ken recently grad-
uated from the Brentwood School, and has
been accepted to the University of Southern
California. A fighter throughout her life, Chen
Ling bravely fought her battle with cancer for
four years, accepting experimental cancer
treatment in the hopes that it would help oth-
ers suffering from cancer.
Chen Ling is survived by her husband and
their three children. She was truly a beautiful
person inside and out. She will forever be re-
membered for her selflessness, incredible
bravery, and meaningful impact on her com-
munity.

TRIBUTE TO BILL GOSSARD
HON. JIM JORDAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to commend to the House the life and
career of Billy L. Gossard of Harrod, Ohio,
who passed away last month at age 84.
Bill was born in Hardin County, Ohio, in
1934. Following his service in the Army, he
worked for many years as a trucking salesman
for a variety of area companies.
Bill was a proud resident of the Village of
Harrod, where he opened Bill’s World Famous
Barbershop in 1964. He was soon elected to
the Harrod Village Council, on which he
served for nearly three decades.
For twenty years, starting in 1976, Bill
served as mayor of Harrod. He cited his work
to fund and install a village-wide sewer system
as his biggest accomplishment in office. He
also took great pride in acquiring land for Har-
rod’s Railroad Heritage Park, which com-
memorates the village’s history as a major rail
town. The village recognized his many

CONGRATULATING OWENSVILLE
HIGH SCHOOL STEM TEAM
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in
congratulating the Owensville High School
STEM team for winning the 2019 Samsung
‘‘Solve for Tomorrow’’ technology contest.
The Solve for Tomorrow contest, which this
year was held aboard the USS Intrepid aircraft
carrier in New York City, invites students from
across the nation to engineer technical solu-
tions for today’s common problems.
Owensville students Paige Tayloe, Jonah Hoff-
man, and Trey Fisher put their minds together
to focus on school safety. Under the super-
vision of engineers from LMI Aerospace in
Washington, Missouri the team developed a
door latch that will keep classroom doors
closed in the event of a security threat even
when the door lock is broken. The Gasconade
County School District has already committed
to using the new latches.
For winning the contest Samsung is award-
ing the school district $100,000 in technology
and classroom supplies, which will be an in-
credible resource for our students. More im-
portantly, with their invention Paige, Jonah,
and Trey have made their fellow students
much safer and given parents added peace of
mind. As their representative in Congress I am
very proud of their success, but as a father
and grandfather I am even more grateful for
their dedication and ingenuity.
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Paige Tayloe, Jonah Hoffman, Trey
Fisher, and Owensville High School for a job
well done!

HONORING THE LEGACY OF FRED-
ERICK DOUGLASS IN NEWARK
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, Frederick
Douglass was born into slavery but laid to rest
in power. His legacy touched countless lives in
countless communities across this country, in-
cluding Newark, New Jersey.
Throughout Newark’s history, its residents
fought for the abolition of slavery and suffrage
for Black people. People like the King family,
whose house in Newark was part of the Un-
derground Railroad, and people like Thomas
Thompson, a black stagecoach driver who
helped move people to freedom, were
undeterred in the fight for Black freedom. It
was leaders like them who arranged, in April
of 1849, for Frederick Douglass to visit New-
ark and speak about Black freedom, justice,
and empowerment.
Frederick Douglass’ speech at the First Afri-
can Presbyterian Church on Plane Street was
an historic moment in the city’s long history of
Black self-realization, a history Newark is still
writing. Plane Street, now University Avenue,
is the heart of Rutgers University—Newark. It
is a fitting tribute that Rutgers—Newark re-
named its field on University Avenue the Fred-
erick Douglass Field.
Rutgers—Newark has, for generations,
helped empower students from Newark to
seek justice and freedom through education. I
am proud to represent Rutgers—Newark in
Congress and commend them for recognizing
Frederick Douglass’ legacy in our city.

Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise

in Littleton, Colorado on April 20, 1999.
Saturday marks 20 years since that horrific

to campus and opened fire, killing 12 of their
fellow classmates and one teacher, and
wounding another 20 more.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E478 April 18, 2019
The images we saw that day will live with us
forever. And for those who were at the school
that day when these horrific events unfolded,
or who lost loved ones as a result, the pain
and sadness they feel today is just as real as
it was 20 years ago.
As time goes on, the memories of those we
lost that day will never be forgotten. They
were sons and daughters, sisters and broth-
ers, friends and loved ones.
Each with their own story to tell. Each with
their own goals and ambitions. And each with
their own group of loved ones who still miss
them terribly.
Cassie Bernall, who was 17 years old, was
a dedicated member of her church youth
group and wanted to eventually be a doctor.
Steven Curnow, at age 14, was a talented
soccer player and avid Star Wars fan who had
hoped to one day pilot an F–16 fighter jet.
Corey DePooter, age 17, loved fishing, and
was working at a local golf course to earn
enough money to one day buy his own boat.
Kelly Fleming, age 16, was a skilled writer
who loved to read and dreamed of one day re-
cording her own stories for others to read.
Matthew Kechter, age 16, was a straight-A
student, who was on his way to becoming a
starting linemen on the school’s football team.
Daniel Mauser, age 15, was also a straight-
A student and a valued member of the
school’s cross-country and debate teams.
Danny Rohrbough, age 15, would save all
the money he earned working at his family’s
business to buy Christmas presents for his
loved ones at the end of the year.
William ‘‘Dave’’ Sanders, age 47, was a be-
loved teacher and coach, who sacrificed his
own safety that day to help more than 100
students flee to safety.
Rachel Scott, age 17, was an inspiring writ-
er and actress who had written her diary be-
fore the attack about the importance of reach-
ing out to those who are being picked on by
others.
Isaiah Shoels, age 18, was a budding
keyboardist who had dreamed of following in
his father’s footsteps by becoming a record
producer.
John Tomlin, age 16, loved spending time
with his church youth group, and planned on
serving in our nation’s armed forces after
graduation.
Lauren Townsend, age 18, loved animals,
and when she wasn’t leading the girls varsity
volleyball team, you could find her working
after school at the local animal shelter.
Kyle Velasquez, age 16, loved ice cream
and always wore a big smile. He, too, had
hoped to enlist in the military one day, just like
his father.
The shooting that took place at Columbine
20 years ago this weekend was, at the time,
the deadliest high-school mass shooting in our
nation’s history; and it would likely have been
much worse had it not been for the bravery
shown by all those who responded to the
scene that day.
The selflessness and courage many of our
first responders exhibited that day, in the face
of such grave danger, saved countless lives.
And, while it may have been 20 years ago, we
are still extremely grateful for their efforts.
We’re also thankful for all those who helped
our community come together in the wake of
a tragedy.
People like Columbine’s principal, Frank
DeAngelis, whose outstanding leadership
helped students, teachers and parents, alike,
overcome a tragedy.
I’ll never forget watching Frank lead hun-
dreds of students back to campus for the first
time, just four months after the shooting. They
were all wearing t-shirts with the words ‘‘We
are Columbine’’ written across the front.
We. Are. Columbine. It was just three little
words—but the message it sent was as pow-
erful as any I’ve ever seen.
Sadly, in the 20 years since the tragic
events that unfolded at Columbine that day,
we have seen similar tragedies play out again
and again across this country.
We can and must do more to protect our
communities from the threat of gun violence.
As hundreds of friends and neighbors come
together in Columbine on Saturday to honor
those who were lost as a result of this trag-
edy, I hope we, as a nation, can also come to-
gether and recommit ourselves to enacting the
commonsense solutions that we all know are
needed to better protect the ones we love.
Because, as those students said 20 years
ago: We are Columbine. We are all Col-
umbine.
And we all have a responsibility to act to en-
sure that another tragic shooting—such as the
one we saw at Columbine—never happens
again.

INTRODUCTION OF THE MARI-
JUANA IN FEDERALLY ASSISTED
HOUSING PARITY ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Marijuana in Federally Assisted
Housing Parity Act. My bill would permit the
use of marijuana in federally assisted housing,
including public housing and Section 8 hous-
ing, in compliance with the marijuana laws of
the state where the property is located.
Individuals living in federally assisted hous-
ing should not be denied admission, or fear
eviction, for using a legal product. Adult use
and/or medical marijuana is currently legal in
33 states and the District of Columbia, and
over 90 percent of Americans support legal-
ized medical marijuana. Under current federal
law, the users of drugs that are illegal under
federal law, including marijuana, are prohibited
from being admitted into federally assisted
housing. Moreover, federal law allows land-
lords to evict residents of federally assisted
housing for drug use. Even the Food and Drug
Administration has recently supported approv-
ing certain medication made from cannabis,
including Eipdiolex, which would be adminis-
tered as a syrup. Eipdiolex is used to treat
children who suffer from seizures. Notably, the
drug does not contain tetrahydrocannabinol, or
THC, the psychoactive component in can-
nabis.
For the last several years, Congress has
prohibited the Department of Justice (DOJ)
from using federal funds to prevent jurisdic-
tions from implementing their medical mari-
juana laws. This bill would similarly allow indi-
viduals to use marijuana in federally assisted
housing in compliance with the state’s mari-
juana laws.
Under my bill, the Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) must also develop
regulations that restrict smoking marijuana in
federally assisted housing in the same manner
and to the same locations as the Secretary re-
stricts smoking tobacco in federally assisted
public housing.
HUD, like DOJ, should not be allowed to en-
force federal marijuana laws where states
have taken action to legalize marijuana. The
Marijuana in Federally Assisted Housing Parity
Act states that a person may not be denied
federally assisted housing based on the use of
marijuana in compliance with the marijuana
laws of the state where the property is lo-
cated.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.

IN RECOGNITION OF KIM

HON. BEN CLINE
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise along-
side Rep. MICHAEL BURGESS and Rep. VAN
TAYLOR to honor Kim Frankson, Jess Johnson,
and Laurie Ortel of Ashley Elementary School
in the Frisco Independent School District. At
the end of last year, these North Texas school
administrators used quick thinking and team-
work to help save a life 1,200 miles away.
In December 2018, Ashley Elementary
School principal Kim Frankson, assistant prin-
cipal Laurie Ortel, and counselor Jess John-
son received a concerning message from a
student via the STOPit app, an online platform
designed to allow students and parents to
send anonymous reports of bullying to school
officials.
The North Texas educators soon discovered
that the student was in Waynesboro, Vir-
ginia—more than 1,000 miles from Frisco—
and sprang into action. As Laurie Ortel said in
an interview with the Dallas Morning News:
‘‘We didn’t know her, but in that moment, she
became ours.’’
In spite of the distance, Jess Johnson
began communicating with the student, who
was threatening suicide, on the STOPit app.
At the same time, Kim Frankson and Laurie
Ortel attempted to contact the Waynesboro
Police Department and administrators at the
student’s school, which already had closed for
winter break. Thanks to the efforts of the
North Texas teachers, local authorities in Vir-
ginia were able to locate the endangered teen-
ager and provide lifesaving assistance.
Thankfully, the student’s message for help
reached the right people.
On February 14, 2019, the Dallas Morning
News published an article telling their story. In
recognition of their lifesaving efforts, Kim
Frankson, Laurie Ortel, and Jess Johnson
were honored at the Frisco ISD board meeting
on April 8, 2019. They were presented the in-
augural Helping Hands Life Saver Award from
the makers of the STOPit mobile app, and
have received well-earned praise from Ameri-

VETERAN OF THE MONTH—PAUL
ANDERT
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to share the work and
life of my April Veteran of the Month, Tulsa’s
Paul Andert.
Mr. Andert, a World War II veteran and
Tulsa icon, has devoted the recent years of
his life to telling his story to keep alive the
memories of the men and women who fought
and bravely served our country.
He’s lent his wisdom to countless student
groups, veterans organizations and churches
around the country. He appeared on Glenn
Beck, authored the book ‘‘Unless You Have
Been There,’’ about his war experience, and
was an advisor on the 2014 World War II film
Fury.
Mr. Andert dropped out of school at the age
of 17, lying about his age in order to join the
army. By the time the United States joined
World War II, he was leading his own infantry
platoon. Mr. Andert led by example, knowing
that he could not ask his soldiers to do any-
thing he wouldn’t do himself.
Spending three years on the frontlines of
the war, Mr. Andert had enough near misses
with death to fill a book—one he plans to
write.
At 96 years old, Mr. Andert is still running
full steam ahead, pressing forward with his
mission to share the stories of those who pro-
tected our country.
I am grateful for the sacrifices Mr. Andert
made to serve our country, and the work he
does to preserve the memory of his fellow vet-
erans. Tulsa, and all of America, is better off
because of his dedication.

IN RECOGNITION OF LAUREL
BLACKETT MIRANDA
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Laurel Miranda who is receiving the Cit-
izen of the Year and Community Care Award
from the Associated Parents’ Group of
Hillsborough for her tireless work improving
the lives of children of all abilities.
For twelve years, Laurel was instrumental in
shaping the Hillsborough City Student District
Special Education Program to include parent
representation, field trips and a science over-
night. It is an inclusive educational experience
with opportunities on par with the General
Education Program. In addition, she was ac-
tive in all other aspects of school life, including
the parent group boards at South and Crocker
schools and Art in Action. She served as
president of both the Hillsborough Schools
Foundation and the Associated Parents’
Group of Hillsborough.
Laurel’s intelligence, thoughtfulness, gen-
erosity and practicality have earned her the
admiration and respect of teachers, staff, par-
ents and students alike. She knows how to get
things done.
In her advocacy for children of all abilities,
she co-founded Special Kids Parents Group of
Hillsborough and was president for three
years. The group worked collaboratively with
the superintendent, the school board, the
Hillsborough Schools Foundation, and APG to
provide a welcoming, supportive school and
community environment for families with chil-
dren of all abilities. They helped launch three
annual signature events: Special Kids Parents
Group Kick-Off Coffee, High School Night for
Parents of Special Learners, and 5th Grade
Transition Coffee for Parents of Special Learn-
ers. They improved recreational opportunities
with Hillsborough Recreation. And they rep-
resented HCSD to San Mateo County SELPA
to share ideas and strategies across school
districts. In short, Special Kids Parents Group
could not have been a more effective advo-
cate.
Originally from Columbus, Ohio, Laurel
came to California and attended Miramonte
High School in Orinda. While working as a
camp counselor at John’s Hopkins Center for
Talented Youth in 1987, she met her husband
Steve Miranda. In 1990, Laurel earned her BA
in Quantitative Economics and English from
Stanford University and in 1997, she earned
her JD/MBA from UC Berkeley.
Laurel and Steve were married at Stanford
Memorial Church in 1993. She had a success-
ful career at Oracle, Wells Fargo, and Charles
Schwab. In 2000, with the birth of Robert Mi-
randa, Laurel fully devoted her time to family,
advocacy for children and school activities.
Isabel Miranda was born three years later and
diagnosed with a rare form of epilepsy at the
age of eight months. There wasn’t a group
Laurel wasn’t involved in or a board she didn’t
serve on. Advocacy and community engage-
ment are part of her DNA. In her current role
as a board member of CuriOdyssey, she is
promoting exclusive hours and programming
for kids with special needs and their families
Madam Speaker, I ask the members of the
House of Representatives to rise with me to
recognize the long-lasting contributions Laurel
Miranda has made to the Hillsborough City
School District. She is a remarkable commu-
nity leader who is effecting change in every-
thing she touches.

HONORING HANNAH EDELSTEIN
FOR RECEIVING THE GIRL
SCOUT GOLD AWARD
HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 18, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Hannah Edelstein, who has earned the
Girl Scouts of the USA Gold Award.
Hannah joins a selective group of scouts,
and she should be proud of this recognition.
This accolade symbolizes outstanding accom-
plishments in leadership, community service,
career planning, and personal development.
To receive the award, a scout must first obtain
four interest project patches, the Career Ex-
ploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership
Award, and complete the Senior Girl Scout
Challenge. Awardees also complete a Gold
Project, in which scouts identify and lead a
project on a pressing issue in the community.
Hannah’s project focused on the needs of
families affected by domestic violence in the
Rio Grande Valley. I applaud her research ef-
forts and ability to provide necessary re-
sources at the Friendship of Women Shelter in
Brownsville, Texas. She went above and be-
yond the expectations, raising awareness in
the community and working with partners,
local organizations, and fellow Girl Scout Gold
Awardee—Victoria Hinojos.
A Brownsville native, Hannah leads her
peers by example, excelling in academics and
community service. She works with the Uni-
versity of Texas—Rio Grande Valley faculty to
promote the conservation of the region’s na-
tive Red Crowned Parrot, serves as president
of the Health Occupation Students of America,
and leads the Varsity Volleyball team. Despite
these extracurricular endeavors, Hannah ranks
number one in her class at Veterans Memorial
Early College High School, Brownsville.
It is a tremendous honor to recognize Han-
nah Edelstein. Our district is very proud of her
service, and our community benefits greatly
from her leadership. I ask my colleagues to
join me in congratulating her for her work,
service, and accomplishments.

ginia—more than 1,000 miles from Frisco—
and sprang into action. As Laurie Ortel said in
an interview with the Dallas Morning News:
‘‘We didn’t know her, but in that moment, she
became ours.’’
In spite of the distance, Jess Johnson
began communicating with the student, who
was threatening suicide, on the STOPit app.
At the same time, Kim Frankson and Laurie
Ortel attempted to contact the Waynesboro
Police Department and administrators at the
student’s school, which already had closed for
winter break. Thanks to the efforts of the
North Texas teachers, local authorities in Vir-
ginia were able to locate the endangered teen-
ager and provide lifesaving assistance.
Thankfully, the student’s message for help
reached the right people.
On February 14, 2019, the Dallas Morning
News published an article telling their story. In
recognition of their lifesaving efforts, Kim
Frankson, Laurie Ortel, and Jess Johnson
were honored at the Frisco ISD board meeting
on April 8, 2019. They were presented the in-
augural Helping Hands Life Saver Award from
the makers of the STOPit mobile app, and
have received well-earned praise from Ameri-
cans in North Texas, Virginia, and around the
country.
As Members of Congress representing Fris-
co, Texas and Waynesboro, Virginia, we ex-
tend our sincere gratitude to these North
Texas educators for their extraordinary work
and dedication. There is no doubt that they
have touched the lives of students in Frisco,
Waynesboro, and beyond.
