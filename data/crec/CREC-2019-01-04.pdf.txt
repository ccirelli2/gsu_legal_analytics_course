PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:
Loving God, we give You thanks for
giving us another day.
We thank You for the joy, excite-
ment, and ceremony of yesterday when
the 116th Congress was convened. It
was a celebration of the ongoing Amer-
ican experiment of participatory de-
mocracy.
Today begins, if not in full force, the
work of the Congress, when the dif-
ficulties facing our Nation, and some
communities especially, come into
focus.
We ask again an abundance of Your
wisdom for the Members of the people’s
House.
May we be forever grateful for the
blessings our Nation enjoys and appro-
priately generous with what we have to
help those among us who are in need.
May all that is done this day be for
Your greater honor and glory.
Amen.

THE JOURNAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair has examined the Journal of the
last day’s proceedings and announces
to the House her approval thereof.
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker,
pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a
vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s ap-
proval of the Journal.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the Speaker’s approval

present.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8, rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-

Pledge of Allegiance.
Mr. HASTINGS led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
f
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER
PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will entertain up to five requests
for 1-minute speeches on each side of
the aisle.
f
GUN VIOLENCE
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, as
I did my very first speech in 2013, and
again in 2017, I rise today to sound a
clarion call for the urgent action by
this new Congress to address the sense-
less gun violence that continues to
claim too many innocent lives across
our country.
Sadly, since my first speech 6 years
ago, Americans continue to be gunned
down in schools, workplaces, houses of
worship, community gatherings, and
even while sitting comfortably in their
own homes.
Time and again, Congress pauses for
the standard moment of silence and
yet, so far, has failed to take real ac-
tion.
Newtown, Parkland, Las Vegas,
Mother Emanuel AME, Tree of Life
synagogue, the Capital Gazette—these
names are but a few of the grotesquely
long list of mass shootings and lives
cut violently short. And for every mass
shooting that captures the headlines,
countless other victims are killed or
maimed in shootings across our coun-
try each and every day.
But as we turn the page on this new
Congress, I have hope, hope that this
year we will finally take action to
make our community safer: actions
such as passing universal background
checks, banning high capacity maga-
zines, and making trafficking of weap-
ons across State lines a Federal crime.
We have the power to save lives. Let
us now find the courage to act and
build a safer future for our children.

U.S.-POLAND DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, 2019 marks the 100th
anniversary of diplomatic relations be-
tween Poland and the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H220 January 4, 2019
As praised by Ambassador Piotr
Wilczek:
It has been a century of solidarity, under-
standing, but most of all friendship. Our
bond is stronger than ever, and we look for-
ward to the next 100 years to come.
In 1795, imperial Russia and Prussia
occupied the Polish nation, ending its
official existence for 123 years.
The Washington Times recounted:
In 1918, the Versailles Conference restored
an independent Polish state. Freedom was
lost once more in 1939 as Nazi Germany in-
vaded from the west and Soviet Russia from
the east. Subjugation continued until 1989,
with the end of the Soviet-backed com-
munist rule.
Free and democratic Poland today is
a valued member of NATO and the Eu-
ropean Union.
Poland has achieved 25 years of unin-
terrupted economic growth, now con-
tinued by President Andrzej Duda.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
f
HONORED TO SERVE IN THE 15TH
DISTRICT IN THE 116TH CONGRESS
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today, on the
second day of the 116th Congress, to
represent Pennsylvania’s 15th Congres-
sional District.
The 15th Congressional District en-
compasses 14 counties, 24 percent of the
land mass of Pennsylvania, and in-
cludes all of Armstrong, Cameron,
Clarion, Clearfield, Elk, Forest, Indi-
ana, Jefferson, McKean, Venango, and
Warren counties. It includes parts of
Butler, Cambria, and Centre counties,
including my hometown of Howard.
Madam Speaker, I take great pride in
my service to the people of the 15th
Congressional District, and I work hard
to earn their trust, help solve their
problems, and be a diligent Representa-
tive.
When not in Washington, I spend my
days on the road in the district, trav-
eling to meetings and events. I work to
connect with my constituents and
truly be a voice for each community I
represent.
Madam Speaker, I also appreciate
the opportunity to speak here, as I did
219 days in the 115th Congress, to be a
strong voice for the citizens of the 15th
District.
The challenges before us remain
great, but it is my hope that we will
tackle these challenges head-on. It is
the American way.
f
RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBU-
TIONS AND LIFE OF THE HONOR-
ABLE PAUL ELIZONDO, JR.
(Mr. HURD of Texas asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize the incredible
life and contributions of the Honorable
Paul Elizondo, Jr., of San Antonio.
Paul’s dedication to service was a
lifelong commitment, beginning with
his time in the United States Marine
Corps.
Following his military service, he at-
tended St. Mary’s University in San
Antonio, graduating with a degree in
music education in 1957. He then spent
16 years in the public school system,
encouraging the musical talents of
countless young people, before being
elected to the Texas State Legislature
in 1978.
Paul first assumed the role of Bexar
County commissioner for precinct 2 in
1983 and has been a fixture and force in
the Bexar County government ever
since.
Paul Elizondo, Jr., passed away on
December 27, 2018, leaving behind an
extraordinary legacy and an amazing
family. While we mourn the loss of this
great man, his dedication to fiercely
advocating for the West Side has made
an incredible impact that will continue
for generations to come.
I would like to extend my most sin-
cere condolences to Commissioner
Elizondo’s family during this difficult
time, and I am proud to recognize all
that he did for the great State of Texas
and our hometown of San Antonio.
f
HONORING THE LIFE OF TYLER
TRENT
(Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life
of Tyler Trent, a remarkable young
Hoosier from Carmel, Indiana, who lost
his battle to bone cancer at only 20
years.
Tyler Trent is a name known in
households across the Nation for his
love of Purdue football and his inspir-
ing passion and energy as a fan.
Tyler always dreamed of becoming a
Boilermaker and refused to allow can-
cer to get in his way. After beating
cancer once and being diagnosed again
in 2017, Tyler started school at Purdue
on a presidential scholarship, as
planned, in the fall of ‘17. He would
drive home on weekends for treatment.
Even still, Tyler would show up to
cheer on his Boilermakers every
chance he got.
The Purdue superfan was featured on
ESPN and named the honorary team
captain when they won the Old Oaken
Bucket game this past year. He re-
ceived the Sagamore of the Wabash and
formed an organization which helps
families affected by cancer, called
Teens With a Cause.
In December, he won Disney’s Wide
World of Sports Spirit Award. When he
received that award, he said: ‘‘There is
always a light at the end of the tun-
nel.’’
It is with that optimistic and posi-
tive outlook on life that Tyler inspired
the Nation. He has united Americans
far and wide to be Boilermakers, and I
hope we can all continue to be grateful
and live every day as he did—Tyler
strong.
f
ADOPTING THE RULES OF THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
FOR THE 116TH CONGRESS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 5,
proceedings will now resume on the
resolution (H. Res. 6) adopting the
Rules of the House of Representatives
for the One Hundred Sixteenth Con-
gress, and for other purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. When
proceedings were postponed on Thurs-
day, January 3, 2019, the portion of the
divided question comprising title I had
been disposed of.
Pursuant to section 2 of House Reso-
lution 5, the portion of the divided
question comprising title II is now de-
batable for 1 hour.
The gentleman from Florida (Mr.
HASTINGS) and the gentleman from
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) each will control
30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Florida.
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H. Res. 6, Title II—Select Com-
mittee on the Modernization of Con-
gress.
Title II establishes a bipartisan Se-
lect Committee on the Modernization
of Congress to investigate, study, make
findings, hold public hearings, and de-
velop recommendations to modernize
and improve the way Congress oper-
ates.
This institution has a responsibility
to the people—to our constituents—and
to this country to build a Congress
that works for everyone, not just those
at the top. This is not something that
will happen on its own. It is going to
take hard work, but it is worthwhile
work.
This is not the first time Congress, as
an institution, has wrestled with how
to be more effective and efficient.
Three times in the 20th century—in
1945, in 1965, and again in 1992 when Ms.
LOFGREN and I came to Congress—we
established joint committees to exam-
ine various aspects of the legislative
process in an effort to improve effi-
ciency and promote transparency.
Madam Speaker, today we are at a
similar crossroads. Last Congress, we
witnessed the Republicans lead the
most closed Congress in the history of
our country. Republicans blocked ev-
erything from immigration reform and
infrastructure to gun safety and low-
ering prescription drug costs.
Last November, many of the Amer-
ican people demanded a new direction.
Part of that new direction includes
making the House of Representatives
an institution that debates big ideas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H221
January 4, 2019
We are at a moment where the chal-
lenges we face as a country are so
great—everything from the opioid epi-
demic that is devastating communities
across the country to the immense eco-
nomic and human cost the world will
incur as a result of climate change—
that we must come together as a body
in a deliberate and transparent way.
b 0915
The select committee will provide a
venue for Members to consult outside
experts, academics, and this institu-
tion’s own Members in an effort to ana-
lyze, debate, and adopt those ideas that
will help us improve how we do the
people’s business.
This select committee, along with
the bipartisan rules package that
passed on the House floor yesterday, is
proof that we stand ready, willing, and
able to protect not only this institu-
tion’s prerogative but the interests of
the American people.
With public trust in Congress at his-
toric lows, House Democrats are taking
transformational steps that will mod-
ernize Congress, restore regular order,
and bring integrity back to this insti-
tution. This comprehensive and delib-
erate approach will undoubtedly im-
prove the overall function of this great
institution that we all have the privi-
lege and honor to serve in.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise as the des-
ignee of the Republican leader, and I
thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
HASTINGS), my good friend, for yielding
me 30 minutes.
For the third time in 2 days, Madam
Speaker, my good friends from the
Democratic side of the aisle and I are
here to debate part of the Democratic
rules package for the House of Rep-
resentatives. Unlike the first two
times, I find myself in agreement with
what the Democrats are proposing
today.
We are here today on title II of the
rules package, which establishes a Se-
lect Committee on the Modernization
of Congress. While I think improve-
ments can be made to what my friends
are proposing, I am pleased to say I
think that this proposal is an excellent
idea.
I know my good friend also men-
tioned the last Congress, and I want to
take just a second to defend that Con-
gress. Frankly, it was the last Congress
that gave us the first tax moderniza-
tion overhaul and tax reduction in 31
years. It was the last Congress that
began the opioid initiative that we
worked on in a very bipartisan way. It
was the last Congress that did more de-
regulation than any Congress in Amer-
ican history. It was the last Congress,
working with my friends on the other
side, that did historic work in human
trafficking. It was the last Congress
that also did historic work, again, in a
very bipartisan way, with my friends
on the veterans’ issues. Finally, it was
the last Congress that began rebuilding
the American military after 8 years of
neglect. We will see if this Congress
has a record that matches that in the
next 2 years.
Having said that, as my friend laid
out, the proposed select committee
would be charged with investigating,
studying, and making recommenda-
tions for modernizing Congress, includ-
ing improvements to rules; to proce-
dures, including the schedule and the
calendar; to staff recruitment, diver-
sity, and retention; and to technology.
I am especially pleased that this se-
lect committee will be equally divided
between Democrats and Republicans
and that the makeup of the committee
will include two members of each part
from the Rules Committee, the House
Administration Committee, and two
freshmen.
Most importantly, the select com-
mittee is required to produce a report
with their recommendations by a two-
thirds supermajority by the end of Con-
gress. Those are all excellent proposals
by my friends, and I wholeheartedly
endorse them.
Madam Speaker, there is a lot to like
in this proposal. I think we can all
agree, no matter which party you be-
long to, that Congress needs to be mod-
ernized and its processes improved. I
am especially happy that my friends
have done so in a way that is bipar-
tisan and, hopefully, will be above poli-
tics.
The proposal isn’t quite perfect, of
course. Personally, I would have pre-
ferred to have seen the House take up
this responsibility in coordination with
our colleagues in the Senate. I am sure
the bulk of my conference and probably
the bulk of my friend’s conference
would probably tell you that, if any
body in Congress needs improvement,
it is undoubtedly the one on the other
side of the Capitol rotunda. On that, we
can have a bipartisan agreement with-
in this Chamber.
Of course, Congress works best when
the House and the Senate work to-
gether, and that includes the need to
improve processes and modernize Con-
gress as an institution, as a whole. The
majority would have done better to
have found a way to work with the
Senate on developing a joint com-
mittee made up of Members from both
houses of Congress that would be
charged with making improvements to
the House, the Senate, and to Congress,
as a whole.
That aside, this is certainly a very
good and serious proposal, and I look
forward, with a great deal of optimism,
as the select committee does its work
this Congress.
Madam Speaker, I urge support of
the measure, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
MCGOVERN), chairman of the Rules
Committee and my good friend.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
HASTINGS), for yielding to me and for
his leadership on the Rules Committee.
I am looking forward to working with
him as a member of the majority in
this Congress.
Madam Speaker, we started an im-
portant conversation about how to im-
prove this House as the rules package
was developed. Members on both sides
of the aisle brought forward ideas.
Many of them were included in the
final package. But these rules
shouldn’t be the end of the dialogue.
They should be only a start.
I know that there are many Members
who will have even more good ideas in
the coming weeks and months, and this
Select Committee on the Moderniza-
tion of Congress is a unique oppor-
tunity to continue the conversation.
It is a truly bipartisan way to con-
sider ideas on how to promote a more
modern and efficient Congress and pro-
cedures to develop the next generation
of leaders, increase staff diversity, and
improve technology and innovation. It
is also a way for this Congress to hold
ourselves accountable, to ensure our
work to reform this House is delivering
on behalf of the American people.
I especially thank Representatives
KILMER, LIPINSKI, and SARBANES, as
well as the New Democrat Coalition,
for this idea. It is a step that this
House can take, and it is a step that
this House, quite frankly, should take.
Madam Speaker, finally, I just want
to say, as the gentleman from Okla-
homa pointed out, this select com-
mittee is truly bipartisan, and the
ideas that come out of this select com-
mittee will be truly bipartisan.
We can improve the way this House
is run. We can improve the way we do
things here. I think the American peo-
ple are hoping we will move in that di-
rection, and I think we have an oppor-
tunity to do that.
I say to the gentleman from Okla-
homa, I really appreciate his tone and
his support for this initiative. We all
talk about new beginnings and about
ways to make things better, and I
think we are off to a good start. For
that, I thank the gentleman from Flor-
ida.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I echo my friend’s
comments, to some degree.
First, I thank him personally, and I
thank his fellow members on the
Democratic Rules Committee, for pre-
senting this proposal. It is a genuinely
excellent and bipartisan effort, and it
suggests that the language we heard
about trying to change the way in
which we operate was very sincere and
well motivated. It is much appreciated
on our side of the aisle.
While we certainly had our dif-
ferences yesterday, I appreciate the
way, frankly, that was handled by both
sides. I am pleased that we are ending
this on a point of agreement and a bi-
partisan commitment to actually im-
prove the nature of our institution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H222 January 4, 2019
Again, I expect this committee to ac-
tually produce really substantive pro-
posals. I don’t know yet, obviously,
who the members on either side will be,
but I know the leadership on both sides
takes this very seriously. I think there
is a genuine commitment to try to
open up the process a little bit to make
it, if you will, more Member-friendly,
whether you are Members in the major-
ity or the minority, and that is to be
commended on the part of my friend.
Again, this is a good start, as my
friend Mr. MCGOVERN said, and I look
forward to playing my part in partici-
pating as we make progress in this di-
rection.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Washington (Mr. KIL-
MER), my friend, a member of the Ap-
propriations Committee.
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise
in support of title II of this resolution
to establish a new Select Committee on
the Modernization of Congress, and I
start by thanking Chairman MCGOVERN
and the Speaker for their collaboration
over the past several months as they
formed this plan.
Let me say something that the
American people know to be true, and
that is that this House is a fixer-upper.
Every time the American people feel
like they don’t have a say and nothing
gets done, or every time a bill is writ-
ten behind closed doors and passed
without debate, the American people
lose their faith in the ideal that formed
this body, the idea that they have the
ability to shape the outcome of what
happens here.
It is time to rebuild this institution
so it lives up to the motto that serves
as this Nation’s motto that hangs in
this room: E pluribus unum, out of
many, one.
Now, every 20 years or so, there has
been an effort to reform and modernize
this House. There has been an acknowl-
edgment that like any other functional
organization, it is worth diagnosing
what is working and what isn’t, and de-
termining how to have it perform bet-
ter.
This committee that is established
with today’s vote will empower Mem-
bers to help Congress to work better
and to be more responsive to the Amer-
ican people, a Congress that will lead
to the advancement of shared goals be-
tween the parties, and a reform system
that allows the 435 people lucky
enough to work here to have meaning-
ful outcomes to show for their work, to
produce solutions.
Look, we are on the cusp of a new
era. We need to rise to the challenge by
modernizing this legislative body so
that we can fulfill the priorities of the
Nation that elected each one of us to
represent them. I truly believe that
this select committee will help us
chart a better course, one where con-
sensus is not only sought but actually
achieved, where we can finally make
progress on our Nation’s greatest chal-
lenges by developing proposals with
broad bipartisan support and allowing
them to move through regular order,
looking at key issues like the use of
technology, looking at how to cul-
tivate leadership, and looking at oper-
ational changes to this body.
I believe that modernizing this insti-
tution is the key to settling our di-
verse country’s most pressing chal-
lenges and restoring the public’s faith
in Congress.
Again, I commend Chairman MCGOV-
ERN and the Speaker for leading the
way forward by establishing this com-
mittee. I also take a moment to thank
some of the folks behind the scenes
who have worked really hard to bring
this plan to fruition, people like Don
Sisson and the Rules Committee Demo-
cratic staff, and Jamie Fleet and the
House Administration Committee
Democratic staff, who spent countless
hours working to bring us to today.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this resolution so
that this committee and Congress can
finally get to work.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I have an
additional speaker on the way, I hope,
but, right now, I don’t have anything
additional to add personally.
Madam Speaker, I continue to re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SAR-
BANES), my good friend and a member
of the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce and the Committee on Oversight
and Reform.
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise up in support
of the rules package being put forward
by the Democratic majority. In par-
ticular, I applaud the decision to estab-
lish a Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress, and I thank
Chairman MCGOVERN, Speaker PELOSI,
and all those who made this a priority.
We know that the best motives of
Members on both sides of the aisle are
too often frustrated by dysfunction in
the legislative process, which then
makes it difficult for us to deliver on
the promises that we give to our con-
stituents and to the Nation. Dimin-
ishing congressional resources and, at
times, overly centralized decision-
making have empowered outside inter-
ests in the legislative process, and
those are interests who don’t always
have the public interest in mind.
Of course, we know that modern-day
campaigning demands are running
Members ragged. We are increasingly
unable to study the material and build
the relationships necessary for a
healthy legislative institution.
We have a responsibility to the peo-
ple to build a Congress that serves the
people well. This is not something that
is going to be easy, and it is not some-
thing that is going to happen until we
make it happen. It will take work, but
it is work that needs to be done.
The challenges we face as an institu-
tion are not entirely new, as my col-
league, Congressman KILMER, just said.
For much of modern congressional his-
tory, Congress has continuously wres-
tled with how to be more effective as
the first branch of government.
In the past, when the challenges
grew, we have come together as a body
to explore reforms to our rules and to
institutional design, congressional ca-
pacity, and the matter of resources.
b 0930
In 1945, in 1965, and again in 1992,
Congress convened Joint Committees
to study the functioning of Congress
and to propose comprehensive, expert-
guided reforms.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentleman an additional 30
seconds.
Mr. SARBANES. Such a moment is
before us again. It will be a challenge.
After all, Congress is complicated and
messy by design. Modernizing its oper-
ation is no simple task, but that is ex-
actly the role that the proposed Select
Committee can play. It can create a
space for Members of Congress from
across the ideological spectrum, rep-
resenting different parts of the coun-
try, different world views and different
backgrounds, to come together to work
through the challenges and think
through the remedies. It will be a place
for experts, historians, and academics
to present their views and help us wres-
tle with how to self-improve; and it
will signal to the American people that
we are earnest in our efforts to make
Congress work better.
I strongly support the rules package
before us, and I look forward to the
work of the Select Committee on the
Modernization of Congress.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the resolution,
and I yield the control of the remain-
der of my time to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LOFGREN), the dis-
tinguished chairwoman of the Com-
mittee on House Administration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California will control
the remaining time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the creation of the Select Com-
mittee on the Modernization of Con-
gress, and I encourage all of the House
to do the same.
There is precedent for Select Com-
mittees like this one. During 1973, in
the 93rd Congress, the House created
the Select Committee on Committees.
And although the Select Committee’s
mission was to study the structure and
operation of House committees, it ulti-
mately made several recommendations

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H223

to improve House-wide administrative
and technology functions.
Among the improvements and mod-
ernization steps, the Select Committee
suggested that the House form a Com-
mission on Information and Facilities,
tasked with responding to the growing
number of issues Congress faced, but
with limited access to information and
analysis.
The Commission also tackled the
problem of growing staff needed to sup-
port an increased workload, but with
limited physical space to accommodate
them. The result was an installation of
a system of 30 computer terminals for
Members of Congress and committees
of legislative research.
Now, this seems trivial now, espe-
cially when information is in our pock-
ets, in our iPhones, but at the time it
was revolutionary for the Congress to
be able to get this information on its
computers. This is just one example of
how a Select Committee made Con-
gress work better.
Following the Select Committee
came the election of the Class of 1974.
Fueled by the Watergate scandal, the
new Members did much to change the
Congress. They decentralized power.
They invigorated our oversight respon-
sibilities. They began a conversation
that would change how we do business
forever.
For example, televising the floor pro-
ceedings; the 1976 Government in the
Sunshine Act. The process they started
opened up our democracy to the Amer-
ican people and created a lasting
record for history.
This Select Committee has a broad
mandate to study how our Congress has
changed and is changing. That begins
with our changing workforce. We need
to invest in our workforce, and that is
why the proposal we passed in the rules
package yesterday to create the Office
of Diversity and Inclusion was so im-
portant. This Select Committee will be
tasked with studying how we can bet-
ter recruit, retain, and compensate our
staff.
We also must be responsible stewards
of public money, and this Select Com-
mittee will help us minimize waste and
maximize value in how we operate the
House.
Now, as has been mentioned, one of
the virtues of the Select Committee is
its composition. It will be composed of
members of the House Administration
Committee who have firsthand experi-
ence with the details of House adminis-
tration. There will be members of the
Rules Committee, experts in process
and procedures who know what works
and what doesn’t when it comes to an
efficient legislative process, and the
Select Committee will feature Mem-
bers in their first term who bring a new
perspective and great energy to the
House.
Shortly after her election, my home
State colleague from California, Rep-
resentative KATIE PORTER said: ‘‘Con-
gress wasn’t built for Members like
me.’’ And unfortunately, I think KATIE
is right. But we can change that, and
we will change that. We can give the
people’s House back to the people.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, my addi-
tional speaker has not yet arrived, so I
am prepared to close whenever my
good friend is.
Ms. LOFGREN. Well, I do have an ad-
ditional speaker. I yield 5 minutes to
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPIN-
SKI).
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of title II of H.
Res. 6, which creates a Select Com-
mittee on the Modernization of Con-
gress.
Before I was elected to Congress, I
was a political science professor. I
studied and taught American Govern-
ment, and my specialty was Congress.
Whenever I was teaching a class on
Congress, I would start by showing the
old Schoolhouse Rock video ‘‘I’m Just
a Bill.’’ In this video, Bill taught how
a bill becomes a law. It was a great
way of introducing, not just kids
watching Saturday morning cartoons,
but also teaching college students how
a bill goes through the process in Con-
gress to become a law. This was a 3-
minute video from 40 years ago.
Unfortunately, if the song was up-
dated today, it would need to be much
longer than 3 minutes, with the addi-
tion of many more verses that ex-
plained how difficult it is for a bill to
become a law.
Over the years, Congress has become
increasingly dysfunctional. When I
taught American Government, I would
always point out that the Constitution
established Congress in Article I, be-
fore the executive and judicial
branches, because the drafters under-
stood the critical importance of Con-
gress leading in our representative de-
mocracy.
Congressional dysfunction increas-
ingly turns more power, however, over
to the President and to the courts,
which takes power away from the
American people. So Congress needs re-
form so it can function as it was in-
tended and return this power to the
American people.
Since 2016, I have introduced legisla-
tion with my friend and colleague, Mr.
LAHOOD, to establish a Joint Com-
mittee on the Organization of Congress
so we could have a mechanism to study
and enact reform proposals to improve
the operations of the House and Sen-
ate. I advocated for this committee be-
cause we need a forum for the holistic
examination of the rules and proce-
dures essential to effective legislating.
We need to hold up a magnifying
glass to Congress and to push for com-
prehensive reforms to make the insti-
tution more efficient, effective, and ac-
countable to all Americans. We need to
find new ways to empower all Members
to participate in the legislative proc-
ess, debate ideas, advance their ideas,
and get laws enacted.
As Ms. LOFGREN talked about,
through the history of Congress, we
have had these committees that have
brought important changes to the way
that this body operates. With the start
of this new 116th Congress, I am happy
to see that this call for reform has been
heeded with the inclusion in the resolu-
tion creating a Select Committee on
the Modernization of Congress.
While the Select Committee does not
contain all the elements of the legisla-
tion we had introduced, notably, it
doesn’t include Senate reform; this is
an important step forward that we can
achieve today, immediately, through
House rules. The Select Committee
will be able to make recommendations
on a wide range of issues affecting
work in Congress, including procedural
reform, leadership development, staff
recruitment and retention, technology,
innovation, and administration. And
the committee gives both parties an
equal say in the process of developing
the package of reforms.
I am grateful to my party’s leader-
ship, especially Speaker PELOSI and in-
coming Rules Committee Chairman
MCGOVERN, for making this a part of
the House rules package for the 116th
Congress.
Madam Speaker, I look forward to
continuing to work to restore public
trust in this institution by making
Congress more transparent and effec-
tive. And by doing this, we will return
power to the American people, and we
can have lawmaking just as explained
by Bill in his Schoolhouse Rock video,
with power going to the people through
their representatives in the House.
I ask my colleagues to support this
resolution.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I again
want to advise my friend I am prepared
to close whenever she is.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
am prepared to close.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
In closing, while I normally would
stand here and be in opposition to what
my good friends, Mr. HASTINGS, Mr.
MCGOVERN and Ms. LOFGREN would be
proposing, in this case I fully support
the measure that they are bringing be-
fore us.
The proposed Select Committee on
the Modernization of Congress is a seri-
ous, well-intentioned proposal to cre-
ate a bipartisan committee to produce
a bipartisan product aimed at improv-
ing the way Congress functions now
and into the future. And while this idea
could have been improved if it incor-
porated the Senate and insured that
both houses were working together on
improving the overall institution, it is
still, nonetheless, a very worthy en-
deavor.
I, for one, thank my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle, and I think that
this is an issue that they could and
should support in a bipartisan fashion.
Frankly, I want to thank my friends;
having been on the losing side of every
vote yesterday, it will be nice to be on
the winning side today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H224 January 4, 2019
So, Madam Speaker, I want to urge a
‘‘yes’’ vote on the underlying measure,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Congress is a creature of precedent,
but we must never be captive to the old
ways. The House, the people’s body,
must continually update and renew
itself to meet the challenges facing the
Nation and to respond to the needs of a
new generation of representatives. This
Select Committee on the Moderniza-
tion of Congress is a way this Congress
can identify and address the challenges
of tomorrow, and will assist us in bold-
ly meeting these challenges.
The Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress is a way to deal
with problems facing this body right
now, today. The Select Committee is a
way to make sure that my colleague,
KATIE PORTER, works in a Congress
built for her and all our new Members.
It is long past time to chart a path
forward and to address the problems we
must face. I look forward to working
with all the members of the Select
Committee and congressional stake-
holders in transforming the House for
the better on a bipartisan basis.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE TO GUN
VIOLENCE
(Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, the new
Democratic majority in this House will
not limit its response to mass shoot-
ings to just thoughts and prayers. We
will listen to gun violence survivors,
not gun company lobbyists. We finally
will respond to the demands of more
than 90 percent of Americans who want
stronger background checks.
In the 9 years since the Supreme
Court’s disastrous decision in Citizens
United, gun companies and other
wealthy special interests have been
able to dump unlimited money into our
elections. In 2016, the NRA spent more
than ever before and watched can-
didates they help elect ignore the gun
violence crisis: nearly 40,000 Americans
killed in 2017 and horrific mass shoot-
ings in Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, Thou-
sand Oaks, and Parkland.
To release the grip of wealthy special
interests on Congress, Democrats have
introduced historic reforms as our top
priority in H.R. 1, to make it easier to
vote, to get money out of politics, to
end corruption, and to call for a con-
stitutional amendment to overturn
Citizens United.
Mr. Speaker, no matter what the
issue—climate change, healthcare, the
economy, or gun violence—it is time
for Congress to start working for the
people. This week, that work has
begun.

guided priorities of the new majority in

and address the very real crisis at our
southern border, the new Democrat
House leadership signaled that all they
really want to do is to continue their
fight with this President.
By totally dismissing what career
professionals at the Department of
Homeland Security have said, that
they actually need to impede the flow
of criminals, gangs, human traffickers,
and drug dealers into our country, the
new leadership has signaled to the
country that the new majority has
been co-opted by the most extreme and
hyperpartisan voices of the far left who
are so far outside the mainstream and
are so blinded by their animosity to-
ward this President that they have be-
come willing to place the interests of
illegal immigrants ahead of the inter-
ests of the American people.
They would rather turn a blind eye to
lawlessness. They would rather com-
promise public safety and allow crimi-
nal gangs and drugs to flood across our
borders than even negotiate with this
President.
In their meeting with the White
House earlier this week, the Democrats
refused to even listen to a briefing of
the Secretary of the Department of
Homeland Security about the threats
we face from an unsecured border.
This is a matter of national security.
It is time for Congress to put the safe-
ty of the American people over open
borders and political games.

ognized.
f
MEASURES PLACED ON THE
CALENDAR—S. 1, S. 21, AND S. 24
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
understand there are three bills at the
desk due for a second reading en bloc.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the bills by title for
the second time.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A bill (S. 1) to make improvements to cer-
tain defense and security assistance provi-
sions and to authorize the appropriation of
funds to Israel, to reauthorize the United
States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of
2015, and to halt the wholesale slaughter of
the Syrian people, and for other purposes.
A bill (S. 21) making continuing appropria-
tions for Coast Guard pay in the event an ap-
propriations act expires prior to the enact-
ment of a new appropriations act.
A bill (S. 24) to provide for the compensa-
tion of Federal and other government em-
ployees affected by lapses in appropriations.
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place
the bills on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I object to further
proceedings en bloc.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bills will be
placed on the calendar.
f
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President,
later today, I will join President
Trump, the Democratic leader, the new
Speaker of the House, and our congres-
sional colleagues down at the White
House.
The meeting represents the latest in
the President’s ongoing efforts to per-
suade Democrats that appropriate
funding for border security is a better
outcome than persisting in this partial
government shutdown. I hope that this
time around my friends across the aisle
will come prepared to engage much
more seriously on the issue at hand.
We may have entered a new Congress
since our last meeting, but the basic
steps that are needed to end this unfor-
tunate standoff really haven’t changed
at all. We are in the same place. As I
have said on several occasions and as
the administration has affirmed, any
viable compromise will need to carry
the endorsement of the President be-
fore it receives a vote in either House
of Congress. Under these conditions,
the package presented by the House’s
new Democratic leaders yesterday can
only be seen as a time-wasting act of
political posturing. It does not carry
the support of the President—in fact,
the administration indicated yesterday
that the President would actually veto
it—and it cannot earn the support of 60
of my colleagues over here in the Sen-
ate.
My friends across the aisle under-
stand the ground rules perfectly well.
They know that a solution will need to
be palatable to House Democrats and
Senate Republicans alike. They know
that making laws takes a Presidential
signature. We all learned that in grade
school. In fact, the Democratic leader
himself insisted ‘‘the President must
publicly support and say he will sign
an agreement before it gets a vote in
either Chamber.’’ That is the Demo-
cratic leader who said that.
Everyone understands what we need
to move forward and successfully make
policy instead of simply staging polit-
ical theater. Everyone should under-
stand just how urgently the situation
on our Nation’s border demands our at-
tention—the situation that has been
accurately described by the Commis-
sioner of the CBP—the Border Patrol—
as a ‘‘border security and humani-
tarian crisis.’’ This shouldn’t be taken
lightly. It should not be viewed as an
opportunity for the new House Demo-
cratic majority to prioritize political
performance as an art form ahead of
the public interest.
I urge our Democratic colleagues to
approach our meeting today with a
willingness to join the administration
and the men and women of Customs
and Border Protection to work to pro-
tect our border and bring this partial
shutdown to an end.
f
THE MIDDLE EAST
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
another matter, while these discus-
sions continue, the Senate will also be
taking up other important work.
Yesterday, the senior Senator from
Florida introduced a package of four
bills that pertain to U.S. policy in the
Middle East. I am a proud cosponsor of

SENATE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S26 January 4, 2019
this legislation, along with the chair-
man of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee to be, Senator RISCH, and Sen-
ator GARDNER. It speaks directly to
some critical American interests in
that part of the world—our security co-
operation with key partners, Israel and
Jordan, and the ongoing humanitarian
and security catastrophe of the Syrian
civil war.
First, this legislation recognizes the
growing threat Iran, Syria, Hezbollah,
Hamas, and other terrorist groups pose
to the State of Israel, and it aims to
strengthen key elements of our rela-
tionship with our closest partner in the
Middle East.
It affirms that the United States
needs to ‘‘walk the walk,’’ and it au-
thorizes military assistance, coopera-
tive missile defense, as well as loan
guarantees.
It encourages closer U.S.-Israel tech-
nological cooperation to better address
21st century threats, and it clearly
states that it is official U.S. policy to
help Israel preserve its qualitative
military edge over those who might
wish it harm.
The legislation also recognizes the
security, economic, and humanitarian
challenges the ongoing conflict in
Syria poses to the people and Govern-
ment of Jordan, and it reauthorizes im-
portant legislation aimed at deepening
our defense cooperation with this im-
portant regional partner.
In addition, the bill contains a bipar-
tisan provision from Senators Rubio
and Manchin to combat the BDS move-
ment, an aggressive and hostile at-
tempt to delegitimize and economi-
cally boycott the State of Israel.
This legislation gives State and local
governments across America more
flexibility to limit their own business
relationships with entities that sup-
port this horrible effort to hurt our
ally. In effect, this provision allows ju-
risdictions to boycott the boycotters—
let me say that again: ‘‘to boycott the
boycotters’’—and make sure they don’t
send taxpayer dollars to companies
that embrace this anti-Israel posture.
Now, with respect to the ongoing
conflict in Syria, there are, certainly,
differing views about the role of the
U.S. military with respect to threats
emanating from Syria. There is no
question that we continue to face seri-
ous challenges from al-Qaida and ISIS
in Syria, as well as from Iran, Russia,
and the Assad regime itself, and I an-
ticipate this body will debate U.S.
military strategy toward Syria in the
coming weeks, as it conducts oversight
over the administration’s, apparently,
ongoing review of its Syria policies.
Admittedly, there are no easy solu-
tions in Syria. I hope the administra-
tion and Congress will be deliberate
and sober as we consider the risks of
various approaches to the endgame of
the fight against the physical caliphate
of ISIS. After all, American lives, crit-
ical national security interests, and
the future of a turbulent yet critical
region are all at stake. The debate is
forthcoming. I imagine it could be con-
tentious.
There should be little debate, how-
ever, about the Caesar Syria Civilian
Protection Act, which has over-
whelming bipartisan support and the
endorsement of the administration.
This bill, which is included in this
package, speaks to the human tragedy
of the Syrian civil war. It provides non-
military tools for responding to the
atrocities conducted by the regime of
Bashar al-Assad. It will hold account-
able those responsible for the torture
and murder of countless Syrian civil-
ians and provide more leverage for dip-
lomats to end the conflict through
peaceful negotiations that are con-
sistent with the demands of U.N. Secu-
rity Council Resolution 2254.
Unless the Syrian regime changes
course, ends its brutality against the
Syrian people, and negotiates a peace-
ful end to the civil war, the butchers of
Damascus will find their key financial
institutions and industries sanctioned
by the United States.
This bill will not bring back the hun-
dreds of thousands of Syrians who have
been murdered or tortured by the re-
gime, but it will be another arrow in
the quiver of diplomats who are seek-
ing to end this awful war and stabilize
a region of critical importance to the
United States and its allies. So I am
proud to cosponsor the package of leg-
islation that Senator RUBIO introduced
yesterday.
I am clearing the way for the bill, S.
1, to be debated and voted on here on
the Senate floor as early as next week,
and I look forward to voting to pass
this important bill.

REMEMBERING CHARLES LIN
∑ Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, it is
an honor to remember the selfless and
inspirational life of Sifu Charles Lin.
A lifetime master, Sifu Lin began
studying the martial arts in his home-
land of Taiwan.
He studied under many masters of
the martial arts, earning the title
‘‘Master’’ or Sifu.
Sifu Lin moved to New Mexico in 1974
at the age of 23, with only $200 in his
pocket.
For more than 40 years, Sifu Lin
taught New Mexicans meditation and
self-defense through the martial arts of
Ch’i Kung, Tai Chi, and Chuan Kung Fu
at Lin’s Martial Arts Academy.
He and his wife also ran the Chinese
Culture Center in Albuquerque, a place
for the city’s Chinese population to
build community, learn Chinese lan-
guage, and celebrate their culture.
The fireworks, martial arts dem-
onstrations, and dancing dragons in
the center’s annual Chinese New Year
festival put Chinese culture on display.
My thoughts are with his family dur-
ing this time of mourning.
The lessons Sifu Lin imparted on all
of his students will not be forgotten.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. MCCONNELL:
S. 28. A bill to reauthorize the United
States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act
of 2015, and for other purposes; read the
first time.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the text of
the bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 28
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United
States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Exten-
sion Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) In December 2011, Congress passed sec-
tion 7041(b) of the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2012 (Public Law 112–74; 125 Stat.
1223), which appropriated funds made avail-
able under the heading ‘‘Economic Support
Fund’’ to establish an enterprise fund for
Jordan.
(2) The intent of an enterprise fund is to
attract private investment to help entre-
preneurs and small businesses create jobs
and to achieve sustainable economic devel-
opment.
(3) Jordan is an instrumental partner in
the fight against terrorism, including as a
member of the Global Coalition To Counter
ISIS and the Combined Joint Task Force -
Operation Inherent Resolve.
(4) In 2014, His Majesty King Abdullah stat-
ed that ‘‘Jordanians and Americans have
been standing shoulder to shoulder against
extremism for many years, but to a new
level with this coalition against ISIL’’.
(5) On February 3, 2015, the United States
signed a 3-year memorandum of under-
standing with Jordan, pledging to provide
the kingdom with $1,000,000,000 annually in
United States foreign assistance, subject to
the approval of Congress.
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) Jordan plays a critical role in respond-
ing to the overwhelming humanitarian needs
created by the conflict in Syria; and
(2) Jordan, the United States, and other
partners should continue working together
to address this humanitarian crisis and pro-
mote regional stability, including through
support for refugees in Jordan and internally

By Mr. SCHUMER:
S.J. Res. 2. A joint resolution dis-
approving the President’s proposal to
take an action relating to the applica-
tion of certain sanctions with respect
to the Russian Federation; to the Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on De-
cember 19, as Congress was preparing
to leave for the holidays, the Treasury
Department notified Congress of its in-
tent to terminate within 30 days a set
of Russia sanctions imposed on En+
Group plc (‘‘En+’’), UC Rusal plc
(‘‘Rusal’’), and JSC EuroSibEnergo
(‘‘ESE’’). Each of these firms were
sanctioned because they were owned or
controlled by Oleg Deripaska, a noto-
rious Russian oligarch and trusted
agent of Vladimir Putin. As Treasury
noted when it sanctioned him:
‘‘Deripaska has been investigated for
money laundering, and accused of
threatening the lives of business rivals,
illegally wiretapping a government of-
ficial, and taking part in extortion and
racketeering. There are also allega-
tions that Deripaska bribed a govern-
ment official, ordered the murder of a
businessman, and had links to a Rus-
sian organized crime group.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S28 January 4, 2019
In its notification letter, Treasury
argued it had secured an agreement
with Deripaska, the companies and
other stakeholders involved to signifi-
cantly restructure the companies and
make corporate governance changes.
Under the agreement, Deripaska will
remain sanctioned, and his property
will remain blocked. The Treasury De-
partment proposes to remove the three
firms, including the huge Russian alu-
minum producer Rusal, from the sanc-
tions list in the belief that the agree-
ment will effectively separate the com-
panies from Deripaska, eliminating his
control over them and sharply limiting
his influence. The proposal also report-
edly places limits on any family mem-
bers of Deripaska who are also signifi-
cant investors in the companies.
I noted in December that Treasury’s
decision raises critical questions that
the Administration must answer about
whether the structural and governance
changes made by these companies are
sufficient to ensure that Deripaska is
no longer directing or even influencing
these firms. I have also said that it re-
mains to be seen whether Treasury’s
approach can succeed in Putin’s Rus-
sia. Serious questions remain about
whether Treasury can monitor and en-
force the agreement even with the
monitoring mechanisms proposed.
The timing of Treasury’s notice com-
pressed an already tight 30-day review
timetable provided for in sanctions
law, giving Congress until January 17
to make its own independent assess-
ment of whether it adequately protects
US economic and national security, es-
pecially with respect to Russia. The
Congressional review provisions of
CAATSA were designed for precisely
this kind of circumstance. They were
imposed by Congress after serious ques-
tions had arisen about President
Trump’s relationship with Russia.
Members on both sides of the aisle
wanted an opportunity to independ-
ently assess the Administration’s ac-
tions to lift, terminate or issue licenses
on Russia-related sanctions. Those
questions still linger, and have become
even more pronounced in recent days.
The formal review process is under-
way. The Banking and Foreign Rela-
tions committees are assessing the
terms of the agreement, and the docu-
ments that have been provided by
Treasury. But time is short, and if we
did not introduce a resolution today we
would have been overtaken by events,
since any resolution must be pending
in committee for ten days before it is
subject to discharge to the full Senate.
So today I am introducing such a reso-
lution. I do so not because I have con-
cluded that Congress should act to dis-
approve this agreement—I have not
made that determination yet—but to
preserve the procedural option of mov-
ing to bring up such a resolution at the
end of the review process, if necessary,
for expedited review and a vote by the
full Senate.
I intend to consult with my col-
leagues on the Banking, Foreign Rela-
tions, and Intelligence Committees,
and others, before making a judgment
on whether to call for consideration,
under expedited procedures provided
for in CAATSA, of this disapproval res-
olution. I know my colleagues will
carefully review the proposal, and I
look forward to hearing their conclu-
sions once that assessment is complete.
I ask unanimous consent that the
Treasury Department’s report provided
pursuant to section 216 of CAATSA be
printed in the RECORD.
Mr. PRESIDENT. Without objection,
so ordered.
DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,
Washington, DC, December 19, 2018.
Hon. SHERROD BROWN,
Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Hous-
ing & Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Wash-
ington, DC.
DEAR RANKING MEMBER BROWN: With this
letter, we wish to provide you with notifica-
tion that Treasury intends to terminate the
sanctions imposed on En+ Group plc
(‘‘En+’’), UC Rusal plc (‘‘Rusal’’), and JSC
EuroSibEnergo (‘‘ESE’’) in 30 days. En+,
Rusal, and ESE have agreed to undertake
significant restructuring and corporate gov-
ernance changes to address the cir-
cumstances that led to their designation, in-
cluding reducing Oleg Deripaska’s direct and
indirect shareholding stake in those entities
to below 50 percent; overhauling the com-
position of those entities’ boards of direc-
tors; taking restrictive steps related to their
corporate governance; and agreeing to un-
precedented transparency by undertaking ex-
tensive, ongoing auditing, certification, and
reporting requirements. As part of this
agreement, half of En+’s restructured board
of directors will be comprised of U.S. or UK
nationals and Rusal’s current board chair-
man will step down. Deripaska will remain
sanctioned. All of Deripaska’s property and
interests in property, including entities in
which he owns a fifty percent or greater in-
terest, will remain blocked, and foreign per-
sons will continue to be subject to secondary
sanctions should they knowingly facilitate a
significant transaction for or on behalf of
Deripaska or entities in which he owns a
fifty percent or greater interest. None of the
transactions to be undertaken to divest
Deripaska of his interests in these companies
will allow Deripaska to obtain cash either in
return for shares relinquished in, or from fu-
ture dividends he may receive from, En+,
Rusal, or ESE. OFAC reserves the right to
relist any or all of these companies should
the change in circumstances represented by
their implementation of the agreement with
OFAC be reversed, including by a material
breach of the terms of the agreement.
1. BACKGROUND
On April 6, 2018, OFAC designated seven
Russian oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska,
and 12 companies they own or control. This
action also targeted 17 senior government of-
ficials as well as a state-owned Russian
weapons trading company and its subsidiary,
a Russian bank. The April 6 action aggres-
sively targeted Russian oligarchs and elites
that further the Kremlin’s global malign ac-
tivities, including its attempts to subvert
Western democracy, its support for the
Assad regime, its malicious cyber activities,
its occupation of Crimea, and its instigation
of violence in Ukraine. This sanctions action
was one of many that the Treasury Depart-
ment has taken to target Russia’s malign be-
havior. Under this Administration, Treasury
has sanctioned 256 Russia-related individuals
and entities, including 150 individuals and
entities under Ukraine/Russia-related sanc-
tions authorities codified by the Countering
America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions
Act (CAATSA).
Among the 12 companies targeted on April
6, OFAC designated En+ for being owned or
controlled by, directly or indirectly,
Deripaska, and placed En+ on its list of Spe-
cially Designated Nationals and Blocked
Persons (‘‘SDN List’’) pursuant to Executive
Order 13661 of March 16, 2014, ‘‘Blocking
Property of Additional Persons Contributing
to the Situation in Ukraine’’ (‘‘E.O. 13661’’)
and Executive Order 13662 of March 20, 2014,
‘‘Blocking Property of Additional Persons
Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine’’
(‘‘E.O. 13662’’). OFAC also designated Rusal
for being owned or controlled by, directly or
indirectly, En+; Deripaska has a 0.01 percent
direct ownership interest in Rusal, and his
involvement was not a basis for the designa-
tion of Rusal. OFAC also designated ESE for
being owned or controlled by, directly or in-
directly, En+ and Deripaska. As with En+,
OFAC placed both Rusal and ESE on the
SDN List pursuant to E.O. 13661 and E.O.
13662.
The action on April 6 was among the most
impactful targeted sanctions actions ever
taken by OFAC and included many of the
globally integrated companies the oligarchs
rely on to generate their wealth. The des-
ignation of Rusal, the world’s second largest
aluminum producer, was felt immediately in
global aluminum markets. The price of alu-
minum soared in the weeks following the
designation, and Rusal subsidiaries in the
United States, Ireland, Sweden, Jamaica,
Guinea, and elsewhere faced imminent clo-
sure without limited sanctions mitigation in
the form of OFAC general licenses.
2. EN+, RUSAL, AND ESE PETITION OFAC FOR
DELISTING
As stated publicly by Treasury Secretary
Steven T. Mnuchin, the designations of En+,
Rusal, and ESE, as well as the follow-on col-
lateral consequences, were not the primary
aim of the April 6 sanctions against
Deripaska. Rather, En+, Rusal, and ESE
were designated due to their entanglement
with Deripaska. Economic sanctions, includ-
ing those in E.O. 13661 and E.O. 13662, are de-
signed to change behavior. In this case, the
objectives of the sanctions were to reduce
Deripaska’s ownership in and sever his con-
trol of these entities.
Upon their designation on April 6, 2018,
En+, Rusal, and ESE (collectively, the ‘‘Peti-
tioners’’) approached the U.S. Department of
the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Con-
trol (OFAC) to petition for delisting pursu-
ant to 31 C.F.R. § 501.807. The Petitioners, led
by Lord Gregory Barker, the former Minister
of State for Energy and Climate Change for
the United Kingdom, have engaged in nego-
tiations with OFAC extensively during the
past eight months, while OFAC evaluated
whether Petitioners were credibly able to
make material changes in the structure and
composition of the companies such to be eli-
gible for delisting. Petitioners conducted
themselves throughout in a cooperative and
transparent manner. Petitioners submitted
proposals whereby they would sever the own-
ership and control of Deripaska over Peti-
tioners. Throughout the negotiations, OFAC
pressed for terms that were targeted towards
further restricting Deripaska. Ultimately,
OFAC and the Petitioners were able to settle
on terms acceptable to OFAC and
implementable by Petitioners. As a result,
Petitioners have agreed to undertake signifi-
cant restructuring and corporate governance
changes to address the circumstances that
led to their designation, including signifi-
cantly reducing Deripaska’s direct and indi-
rect shareholding stake in Petitioners; over-
hauling the composition of their boards of

directors; taking other restrictive steps re-
lated to their corporate governance; and
agreeing to undertake extensive, ongoing au-
diting, certification, and reporting require-
ments.
3. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES WITH RESPECT
TO EN+, RUSAL, AND ESE
Since their designation and following
months of detailed negotiations with Treas-
ury, OFAC has secured from Petitioners a
binding agreement that severs Deripaska’s
control over these critical revenue-gener-
ating entities and reduces his ownership in
these entities below 50 percent, thereby un-
tangling and protecting these companies
from the controlling influence of a Kremlin
insider. The agreement between OFAC and
the Petitioners is subject to approval by a
number of stakeholders. Furthermore, the
agreement reached between OFAC and the
Petitioners will create an unprecedented
level of transparency for the U.S. govern-
ment into these global companies, along
with the other substantial concessions ob-
tained from them.
With the change in circumstances that led
to the original designations of Petitioners,
including Petitioners’ ongoing substantial
commitments, this letter serves as notifica-
tion of Treasury’s intention to terminate the
sanctions imposed on En+, Rusal, and ESE in
30 days. Treasury also assesses that this ac-
tion—a removal based on a change in factual
circumstances that is in line with long-
standing U.S. sanctions precedent and prac-
tice designed to change behavior—is not in-
tended to significantly alter U.S. foreign pol-
icy.
We stress that Deripaska will remain sanc-
tioned and on OFAC’s SDN List. All of
Deripaska’s property and interests in prop-
erty, including entities in which he owns a
fifty percent or greater interest, will remain
blocked. The result of OFAC’s conditions for
delisting is that Deripaska’s investment in
En+ is isolated and frozen. En+ is the
linchpin underlying the designations of these
companies, since Deripaska has virtually no
direct ownership stake in Rusal, and none at
all in ESE. Specifically, Deripaska’s stake in
En+ will be reduced from approximately 70
percent to 44.95 percent, and his stake can-
not be increased in the future. Pursuant to
the agreement, Deripaska’s stake in En+ will
be reduced through corporate restructuring
transactions that do not involve the transfer
of funds directly or indirectly to Deripaska,
as well as by a donation of shares to a chari-
table foundation. None of the transactions to
be undertaken consistent with the agree-
ment will allow Deripaska to obtain cash ei-
ther in return for his shares or from future
dividends issued by En+, Rusal, or ESE. Fu-
ture dividends to which Deripaska may be
entitled due to his diminished ownership in-
terests will be placed into a blocked account.
Furthermore, foreign persons will be subject
to secondary sanctions under section 228 of
the CAATSA should they knowingly facili-
tate a significant transaction for or on be-
half of Deripaska. Finally, OFAC has made it
clear to the Petitioners that it reserves the
right to relist any or all of the Petitioners
should the change in circumstances rep-
resented by their implementation of the
agreement with OFAC be reversed, including
by a material breach of the terms of the
agreement.
4. DETAILS OF THE RESTRUCTURING AGREED TO
BY EN+, RUSAL, AND ESE
The significant restructuring and cor-
porate governance changes agreed to by Pe-
titioners have been documented in a ‘‘Terms
of Removal,’’ which is a binding agreement
between Petitioners and OFAC that remains
in effect as long as Deripaska is on the SDN
List. The foundation of this agreement is the
role of En+ in the restructuring and cor-
porate governance changes. Deripaska will
have no direct ownership stake in ESE and
will retain only a 0.01 percent direct owner-
ship stake in Rusal. En+ will own and con-
trol Rusal and ESE, which operates to iso-
late and freeze Deripaska’s indirect owner-
ship in Rusal and ESE. Through the Terms of
Removal, Petitioners agreed to implement
the following:
Deripaska’s ownership in En+ brought well
below 50 percent. Deripaska’s stake in En+
will fall from approximately 70 percent to
44.95 percent, and his stake cannot be in-
creased. Pursuant to the Terms of Removal,
VTB Bank or another non-SDN assignee ap-
proved by OFAC (‘‘VTB Bank’’) will take
ownership of a block of Deripaska’s shares in
En+ pledged as collateral for previously
issued obligations of entities controlled by
Deripaska issued by VTB Bank. Deripaska’s
ownership interest in En+ will fall further as
a result of a restructuring transaction
whereby the Swiss company Glencore, or its
subsidiary, swaps shares in Rusal for a direct
ownership interest in En+. The end result of
these corporate transactions will be a sig-
nificant fall in Deripaska’s ownership of
En+, none of which involve the transfer of
funds directly or indirectly to Deripaska.
Deripaska will also donate a block of shares
to a charitable foundation. None of the
transactions to be undertaken consistent
with the agreement will allow Deripaska to
obtain cash either in return for his shares or
from future dividends issued by En+, Rusal,
or ESE.
Limited voting rights in En+. Deripaska
will not be able to vote more than 35 percent
of En+ shares, as Deripaska will assign any
voting rights above 35 percent of En+ shares
to a voting trust obligated to vote in the
same manner as the majority of shares held
by shareholders other than Deripaska. Fur-
thermore, OFAC has identified several share-
holders with professional or family ties to
Deripaska. In all such cases, En+ has agreed
to assign the voting rights under these
shares to an independent third party with no
personal or professional ties to Deripaska.
Furthermore, VTB Bank will reassign voting
rights associated with the shares it takes
ownership of to an independent third party.
Independent board of directors for En+.
En+ agreed to create a board of 12 directors
with a majority of independent directors.
Eight of the directors will be independent of
Deripaska and selected through an agreed-to
process that utilizes an executive search
firm to select members with no business,
professional, or family ties to Deripaska or
any other designated person. With these
changes, half of the En+ board will now be
U.S. or UK nationals with extensive business
expertise. OFAC has vetted the entire slate
of the proposed new board members. Prior to
designation, En+’s board was not majority-
independent and consisted of 12 directors, of
whom only three were independent non-exec-
utive directors. Deripaska will have the
right to nominate no more than four direc-
tors. Replacements for these eight will be se-
lected through the same process, with an op-
portunity for further review by OFAC. En+
has agreed that Directors nominated by
Deripaska will not be permitted to sit on the
Audit or Nominations committees.
Further extinguishment of control. To fur-
ther extinguish potential avenues of control
by Deripaska, Deripaska is required by the
Terms of Removal to provide a deed letter to
En+ that includes a number of binding legal
commitments severing his ability to control
En+. Specifically, the deed letter provides
that En+ and Deripaska explicitly agree not
to act in any manner or to enter into any ar-
rangement, whether by contract, trust, or
otherwise, that directly or indirectly pro-
vides Deripaska with the ability to exercise
a controlling influence over the management
or policies of En+ or any entity owned or
controlled by En+, including Rusal and ESE.
En+ also has agreed to certify that, besides
the right to nominate four directors, it has
not granted Deripaska or any of his relatives
any rights beyond those of ordinary share-
holders with respect to En+ and any entity
owned or controlled by En+.
Ongoing transparency through auditing,
certification, and reporting. The Petitioners
have agreed to provide OFAC with an un-
precedented level of transparency into the
management and operation of these compa-
nies. En+ and Rusal agreed to comply with
ongoing auditing, certification, and report-
ing requirements, including: (i) auditing
En+’s and Rusal’s engagements with and ob-
ligations to Deripaska and any entities con-
trolled by Deripaska as well as certifications
that such engagements have been terminated
or do not constitute control by Deripaska;
(ii) providing OFAC monthly certifications
of compliance with the agreed upon Terms of
Removal; (iii) providing OFAC quarterly
company reports for En+ and Rusal; (iv) pro-
viding OFAC board minutes for En+ and
Rusal; (v) immediately notifying OFAC of
any change in the composition of the inde-
pendent En+ board and certifying that any
such change is consistent with the selection
process outlined in the Terms of Removal;
(vi) immediately notifying OFAC of any an-
ticipated changes to the identity of any inde-
pendent third party assigned voting rights in
relation to En+ and certifying that such in-
dividual has no business, professional, or
family ties to Deripaska or any other SDN;
(vii) immediately notifying OFAC of any an-
ticipated change in ownership of shares of
En+ related to the Terms of Removal and
certifying, inter alia, that the change is con-
sistent with the Terms of Removal and that
Deripaska’s ownership shall not rise above
44.95 percent; (viii) immediately notifying
OFAC of any anticipated changes to the con-
stituent documents of any of the Petitioners
and certifying the anticipated changes are
consistent with the Terms of Removal.
In all cases, notifications and certifi-
cations required to be made under the Terms
of Removal are designed to ensure that
Deripaska cannot obtain increased influence
over En+ or Rusal by changes in the manage-
ment or ownership of En+. Furthermore, En+
has agreed that no entity owned or con-
trolled by En+, including En+ and Rusal, will
change its place of incorporation to Russia
from any other jurisdiction without an af-
firmative vote of the new En+ board and cer-
tifications to OFAC.
En+ has agreed to respond fully and expe-
ditiously to any request for information
from OFAC regarding the Terms of Removal
or general sanctions compliance. OFAC will
continue to actively monitor the Peti-
tioners’ compliance with the Terms of Re-
moval for any information suggesting that
Deripaska, any entity in which he owns a 50
percent or greater interest, or any other
blocked person seeks to influence the Peti-
tioners. All of the information provided and
certifications En+ is required to make under
the Terms of Removal will be directed to
OFAC’s Office of Global Targeting, the office
that develops evidentiary packages to des-
ignate individuals and entities and which
manages the delisting process.
Additional commitments with respect to
Rusal. OFAC designated Rusal for being
owned or controlled by En+. Therefore,
through the same binding agreement with
OFAC, Rusal and En+ agreed that En+, once
it is no longer subject to sanctions, shall
continue to control Rusal through a 56.88
percent stake and that En+ shall retain its
right to nominate the CEO of Rusal.

S30 January 4, 2019
Deripaska will only retain a direct
shareholding interest in Rusal of 0.01 percent
and any dividends from this interest would
be placed in a blocked account. En+ has com-
mitted to use its majority control of Rusal
to create a board of 14 members, and a ma-
jority of those board members (eight) will be
independent non-executive directors who
have no business, professional, or family ties
to Deripaska, or any other SDN. The Chair-
man of the Board of Rusal will be one of the
independent non-executive directors, and the
current Chairman of Rusal (Matthias
Warnig) is stepping down as a condition of
the delisting of Rusal and further will no
longer be a member of the Rusal board. The
other six directors will likewise have no
business, professional, or family ties to
Deripaska, or any other SDN, other than
their professional backgrounds as employees
of Rusal or En+. Deripaska will have no
right to appoint any board members of
Rusal. Prior to designation, Rusal’s board
was not majority-independent and consisted
of 18 directors, of whom only six were inde-
pendent non-executive directors. OFAC has
vetted the current slate of directors for
Rusal’s board, will review any future inde-
pendent director candidates, and will mon-
itor all director appointments to ensure
Rusal’s ongoing compliance with the Terms
of Removal. Rusal has also agreed to exten-
sive certification and reporting requirements
similar to those agreed to by En+. Further-
more, En+ has agreed that it will use its ma-
jority control of Rusal to provide ongoing
auditing and monitoring of potential
Deripaska involvement in Rusal.
Commitments with respect to ESE. OFAC
designated ESE for being owned or con-
trolled by En+ and Deripaska. ESE is a Rus-
sian power company and a wholly owned sub-
sidiary of En+. It does not have an inde-
pendent board of directors, and day-to-day
management is the responsibility of the Gen-
eral Director, who is appointed and overseen
by the En+ board of directors. The change in
ownership and control of En+ described
above would also extinguish Deripaska’s con-
trol of ESE. Deripaska will not have any di-
rect shareholding interest in ESE. Further-
more, ESE’s General Director will provide
OFAC with monthly certifications that he or
she is not acting for or on behalf of
Deripaska, or any other SDN, and that con-
trol over ESE rests with the General Direc-
tor of ESE and En+. As a wholly owned sub-
sidiary of En+, the reporting and certifi-
cation requirements that En+ committed to
will necessarily encompass ESE operations
and management.
5. ONGOING OFAC MONITORING AND
ENFORCEMENT
OFAC will continue to enforce its sanc-
tions on Deripaska aggressively, including
by closely monitoring the Petitioners’ com-
pliance with the Terms of Removal (‘‘TOR’’).
Should one or all of the Petitioners fail to
abide by the binding TOR, OFAC will con-
sider all remedies at its disposal, including
re-designating the offending entity.
Enforcement through complete trans-
parency. The TOR agreed to between OFAC
and Petitioners require unprecedented trans-
parency. The Petitioners must regularly pro-
vide OFAC with information and certifi-
cations about their compliance with the
TOR. This will supplement and be confirmed
with the U.S. Government’s own informa-
tion.
The Petitioners are required to provide
OFAC monthly certifications regarding inde-
pendence from Deripaska and any other des-
ignated person; En+ and Rusal, which make
extensive commitments in the TOR, are re-
quired to certify monthly to their compli-
ance with respect to all elements of the TOR.
En+ and Rusal are required to submit to
OFAC copies of their quarterly reports,
board minutes, and audit reports related to
Deripaska’s or other designated persons’ po-
tential collateral involvement in En+ and
Rusal.
En+ and Rusal are required to give OFAC
notice of and an opportunity to respond to
anticipated changes in the composition of
their boards, as well as of anticipated
changes to third parties assigned voting
rights pursuant to the commitments in the
TOR.
En+ and Rusal are required to commit to
respond in full and on a timely basis to any
additional questions from OFAC related to
compliance with the TOR.
En+ and Rusal are required to agree that if
OFAC provides En+/Rusal with information
that bears on the compliance of En+/Rusal
with any of the elements of the TOR—includ-
ing with respect to the independence of any
of the eight non-Deripaska appointed direc-
tors of En+ or with respect to any of the
eight independent non-executive directors of
Rusal—En+/Rusal will report to OFAC
promptly on any actions that will be under-
taken to remediate the issues identified by
OFAC and will provide OFAC with an oppor-
tunity to respond or object to those actions.
OFAC reserves the right to relist any or all
of the Petitioners to the extent that the
change in circumstances represented by Pe-
titioners’ entering into and adhering to the
TOR is reversed, including by a material
breach of the TOR.
Additional mechanisms for enforcement.
Over and above the TOR, OFAC retains broad
authorities to potentially designate or bring
an enforcement action for direct or indirect
dealings with Deripaska or any other des-
ignated person in the course of dealing with
the Petitioners.
Notwithstanding the delisting of the Peti-
tioners, Deripaska remains sanctioned.
OFAC, therefore, has the authority to des-
ignate any person for providing, directly or
indirectly, material support to Deripaska,
including, for example, an ‘‘independent’’ di-

REMEMBERING JOHN C. CULVER
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
come to the Senate floor to pay my re-
spects and to pay tribute to a fellow
Iowan. This fellow Iowan served for 6
years right here in the U.S. Senate. In
fact, the Iowan who brings me to the
floor today is my predecessor, the Hon-
orable John C. Culver.
I was sorry to learn that Senator Cul-
ver passed away the day after Christ-
mas. I have no doubt that his spirit of
public service and his commitment to
civic engagement will carry on for gen-
erations to come. I will come back to
this legacy in just a moment.
John and I had our differences, as he
was a Democrat and I a Republican,
but we shared a commitment to public
service and to working to advance the
interests of the people of the great
State of Iowa. We both had the privi-
lege of serving Iowans in both Houses
of Congress. For a decade, John rep-
resented Iowa’s Second District in the
House of Representatives, from 1965 to
1975. I represented Iowa’s Third Dis-
trict from 1975 to 1980. Then we both
had the opportunity to represent the
State of Iowa here in the U.S. Senate.
John made the decision to pursue a
life of public service early in his life.
After graduating from Franklin High
School in Cedar Rapids, Senator Culver
headed east to Boston, MA. He earned
his undergraduate degree in American
Government from Harvard University.
He also played fullback for the Crimson
football team. He was brawny and had
a big build. In fact, he was even drafted
to the NFL, but John punted a career
on the gridiron and answered the call
to a different vocation, and that was to
public service.
First, he served for 3 years in the
U.S. Marine Corps. Then, after earning
his law degree from Harvard Law
School, he returned home to Iowa and
ran for public office.
When Senator Culver was serving in
the U.S. House of Representatives, I
was serving in the Iowa statehouse. Al-
though we shared a passion for public
service, we didn’t share the same space
on the political spectrum, but our con-
stituents expected their elected office-
holders to bring Iowa integrity to that
job.
In politics, family is often a uniting
factor. Senator Culver’s son, Chet,
served as the Governor of Iowa from
2007 to 2011. In fact, the last time I saw

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S31
January 4, 2019
John was at Governor Culver’s inau-
gural ball. I had the chance to tell Sen-
ator Culver, ‘‘I know how proud you
are of your son.’’ That is a feeling I
know well, as my grandson is serving
his seventh term in the Iowa House and
serves as chairman of the Appropria-
tions Committee—a committee I once
chaired.
Senator Culver and I then knew the
importance of family and were fortu-
nate to have family who value public
service.
When Senator Culver won election to
the U.S. Senate in 1974, he won the seat
left open with the retirement of an-
other towering political figure in
Iowa—the man from Ida Grove. That is
also the title of a book about former
Iowa Governor and U.S. Senator Harold
Hughes.
Here in the Senate, he served with
his longtime friend and liberal lion,
Senator Ted Kennedy. Senator Culver
served on the following committees:
Armed Services, Judiciary, Environ-
ment and Public Works, and Small
Business.
That brings me to another similarity
Senator Culver and I share from our re-
spective service in this institution—
our assignments on the Senate Judici-
ary Committee and our interest in
helping at-risk juveniles avoid a life of
crime.
Senator Culver chaired the Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee to Investigate
Juvenile Delinquency. He convened
oversight hearings to examine the 1974
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Pre-
vention Act, now widely known as the
JJDPA.
At a hearing in 1977, Senator Culver
pointed out that in our State of Iowa,
8,400 juveniles were processed through
the courts in 1965. Then, by 1974, at the
time of these hearings and the passage
of this legislation, the number had in-
creased to 20,200—highlighting the need
for reforms like those in the Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention
Act.
John’s leadership on the sub-
committee helped make sure that this
sweeping, new law, passed just 3 years
before, worked to help keep young peo-
ple on the right track and away from a
life of crime. His focus on helping
youth lead productive lives became a
mission that he pursued long after he
left the U.S. Senate.
Four decades later, the JJDPA is as
necessary as ever. Again, going back to
statistics from Iowa, in 2015—50 years
after the figure I gave you of about
8,000—Iowa had 14,837 violations of law
by a minor that were adjudicated in
our State.
That same year, I held a congres-
sional hearing to raise awareness about
the need to reform and renew that law
so it works effectively to help at-risk
youth in the 21st century. The JJDPA
had not been updated or reauthorized
since 2002. As chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee, I was pleased to cham-
pion a successful bipartisan, bicameral
effort to update and reauthorize that
act. The updates emphasize substance
abuse and mental health services.
These efforts helped at-risk young peo-
ple obtain an education and, of course,
accept more responsibility because it
had stronger accountability measures
to protect taxpayers and to better
serve youth who come into contact
with the juvenile justice system.
Another part of Senator Culver’s
work was his work on the Commission
that bore his name, the Culver Com-
mission. He deserves great recognition
for this. I am told the audit was the
first of its kind to review the Senate’s
legislative and administrative oper-
ations. Senator Culver said the Senate
needed ‘‘a careful and probing study of
the whole central nervous system of
the Senate and its institutional well-
being.’’ As the newly chosen Senate
President pro tempore and as officer of
the Congressional Accountability Act,
I also want this institution to run as
efficiently and effectively as possible
for the American people.
In 1980, Senator Culver and I faced off
in an election for the U.S. Senate. He
was a very formidable opponent and
ran a very solid campaign. Ultimately,
I won that election. While I am sure
that wasn’t the outcome Senator Cul-
ver wanted, John was very gracious. I
will never forget his grace and good
wishes after that 1980 election.
After his departure from the Senate,
Senator Culver continued an extraor-
dinary career, practicing law until 2009.
He was a gifted athlete and a gifted
public speaker. He became an author, a
guest lecturer, and a visiting professor,
carving an extra-wide path with extra-
broad shoulders to inspire generations
of young Americans to engage in civic
life, in service, and in politics. His list
of achievements and awards reflect a
tireless devotion to public service and
to country.
Since 1975, he served on the Senior
Advisory Committee of the Institute of
Politics at Harvard University’s John
F. Kennedy School of Government.
In 2013, he became chair emeritus. In
2012, Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School
of Government created the John C.
Culver Scholarship. In 2008, Senator
Culver was presented with the Norman
E. Borlaug Lifetime Achievement
Award for Public Service. In 2010, he
was presented with the Congressional
Joint Leadership Foundation’s Leader-
ship Award for his work encouraging
young Americans.
He received six honorary degrees. In
2010, Simpson College in Indianola, IA,
partnered with Senator Culver to
launch the John C. Culver Public Pol-
icy Center. The nonpartisan policy in-
stitute is designed to educate and to
inspire participation in our democracy.
It seeks to encourage young people to
consider public service as their life’s
work.
John’s life reminds all of us that a
life spent in the service of others is a
life well-lived. John’s tireless efforts to
serve his country and the people of
Iowa will be long remembered and
serve as an example to all who honor
his memory.
Barbara and I extend our deepest
condolences to the entire Culver fam-
ily. May God bless them in their time
of bereavement, and may God bless
Senator Culver.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
f
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as we
near the third week of the Trump shut-
down, the impacts on the American
people are getting worse with each
passing day. Nearly 400,000 Federal
workers have now been furloughed.
Food safety inspectors, vital to our
health and safety, are working without
pay and with limited resources. Amer-
ican farmers can’t get loans from the
USDA. Working families trying to buy
a home are finding out their FHA loans
are on hold.
I just heard from a constituent of
mine in the capital region, near Al-
bany—a fire police dispatcher, whose
wife is pregnant. They closed on their
first house, joyously, last week. But
now their loan is delayed until the gov-
ernment reopens. That story can be re-
peated over and over again.
Our Federal courts are running out of
money. Our national parks are suf-
fering; we have seen the piles of debris
and garbage in these beautiful places.
Maybe most ironically of all, as the
President is talking about making the
border more secure, his shutdown is
making it less secure. Border Patrol
agents are going without pay. E-Verify
is offline. Immigration cases are on
hold. New immigration judges are not
being hired. So with all the talk that
the President has about making the
border more secure, the Trump shut-
down is making it less secure.
We have provided a way for him to
continue to debate this wall issue but
keep the government open. All of this
means that we should be doing every-
thing we can to bring this Trump shut-
down to a swift end.
My friend, the Republican leader,
quoted me this morning. So let me now
quote my friend, the leader. He has
said repeatedly: ‘‘Nobody likes a shut-
down.’’
Leader MCCONNELL has shown him-
self to be an adept negotiator during
previous shutdowns. Why is he abdi-
cating his responsibility now? Why is
Leader MCCONNELL shuffling off to the
sidelines, pointing his fingers at every-
body else, and saying that he will not
be involved? Probably because he real-
izes this President—President Trump—
is erratic, unreliable, and sometimes
even irrational. In sum, President
Trump is a terrible negotiator.
Given the unfortunate traits that re-
side in our President, I understand
Leader MCCONNELL’s reluctance to get
involved. But in truth, they are all the
more reason for him to get involved.
America needs Leader MCCONNELL to
get involved to stop this shutdown. He
can’t keep ducking this issue.
Left to his own devices, President
Trump can keep the government shut
down for a long time. The President
needs intervention, and Leader MCCON-
NELL and Senate Republicans are just
the right ones to intervene.
Fortunately, we have a way to end
this shutdown with the help of our Re-
publican friends in the Senate. Last
night, as expected, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed two pieces of legis-
lation to end the Trump shutdown—a
six-bill package to provide appropria-
tions for eight shuttered Cabinet De-
partments and a 30-day continuing res-
olution for the Department of Home-
land Security. Both bills received bi-
partisan support in the House.
The logic behind those two pieces of
legislation is very simple. We have dis-
agreements on how to best secure the
border. President Trump wants an ex-
pensive and ineffective border wall. He
promised that Mexico would pay for it
but now demands that American tax-
payers should foot the bill.
Democrats believe that a border wall
is an obtuse public policy and that we
have much better, more effective, less
wasteful ways of securing the border.
We don’t have to have eight unre-
lated Cabinet Departments closed
while we sort out our differences. We
can reopen the 25 percent of the gov-
ernment now closed and continue to
debate our border security. That is why
we split the bills in two—one to reopen
the government and another to keep
DHS running short term while discus-
sions continue about the border.
Neither piece of legislation should be
controversial, and the House major-
ity—I give them credit and Leader
PELOSI credit—went out of its way to
avoid controversy. They didn’t send
over a bill with lots of poison pill rid-
ers, lots of things our colleagues here
wouldn’t like. They sent the very bills
that Republicans crafted and voted for.
The majority went out of its way to
avoid controversy by choosing the leg-
islation crafted and supported by Re-
publicans.
Let me emphasize that. The six ap-
propriations bills passed by the House
last night are the same bills—the very
same bills; they have not changed a
bit—that Republicans here in the Sen-
ate drafted—they were in charge—and
approved. Four of them passed this
Chamber by more than 90 votes, and
the other two passed nearly unani-
mously in committee. Leader MCCON-
NELL voted for every one of them and
spoke glowingly about their passage
last year.
So there is nothing—I repeat, noth-
ing—in the six appropriations bills that
Leader MCCONNELL and Senate Repub-
licans oppose. There is nothing—abso-
lutely nothing, I repeat—about a con-
tinuing resolution for Homeland Secu-
rity that now Leader MCCONNELL and
Senate Republicans refuse to put on
the floor—because that was Leader
MCCONNELL’s idea. He put it on the
floor, and it passed the Chamber unani-
mously last Christmas.
Now we are seeing some real cracks
in the Republican wall. Some of my
friends in the Senate on the other side
of the aisle in this body, to their cred-
it, are already saying that we should
take up and pass these two bills. Seven
House Republicans, newly elected,
under huge pressure not to, voted with
these bills. Every Democrat voted for
the bill; there is no dissension there.
But a handful of Republicans did too.
It is time for Leader MCCONNELL and
President Trump, who is the ultimate
reason we have this shutdown—it is
time for Leader MCCONNELL and Presi-
dent Trump to support this package of
bipartisan legislation and reopen the
government.
In a short time, Speaker PELOSI and
I will head to the White House to meet
with President Trump and congres-
sional leaders about the government
shutdown. I will be joined by my very

able colleague, Senator DURBIN. Sen-
ator MCCONNELL will be joined by Sen-
ator THUNE. Speaker PELOSI will be
joined by Leader HOYER and, of course,
Leaders MCCARTHY and SCALISE will be
there as well.
At the meeting, we Democrats hope
to convince the President and Leader
MCCONNELL to take up and pass the
two House-passed bills, both of which
have already been approved by Senate
Republicans. That is the quickest,
least controversial way out of the
Trump shutdown. It separates the fight
on the wall from the government shut-
down.
President Trump is holding hostage,
using as leverage, hundreds of thou-
sands of Federal workers and millions
and millions of other Americans, like
the gentleman and his spouse in Al-
bany, who can’t get their FHA mort-
gage approved. That story, in many
ways, can be repeated over and over
again.
So I say to my Republican friends:
Don’t let President Trump hold hos-
tage all of these fine people who have
done nothing wrong themselves. Don’t
let him use the government shutdown
to try and get his way. That is not how
it should work, and that is not what is
going to happen.
Instead, let’s reopen the government,
start paying our food safety inspectors,
park Rangers, air traffic controllers,
Federal courts, and our Border Patrol
agents, so they can do the work they
are supposed to do for the American
people. All we have to do is take up
legislation that Senate Republicans al-
ready support.
I yield the floor.

HONORING PASTOR KENNY
FOREMAN
HON. ZOE LOFGREN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 4, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Pastor Kenny Foreman, who
passed away on December 16, 2018. I spoke
three years ago on the impact he made on
Santa Clara County and it saddens me that he
has left us so soon. He was a beloved mem-
ber of our community whose passing is deeply
felt.
Pastor Kenny Foreman dedicated his life to
the ministry. He started to travel the country at
age seventeen as an evangelist minister. With
his wife, Shirley, he continued his commitment
to his beliefs and established the Cathedral of
Faith in 1965. Since then Pastor Foreman was
a pillar in our community’s spiritual life. He has
touched thousands of lives with a congrega-
tion of more than 12,000 members with over
70 ministries.
As his life’s work, the Cathedral of Faith,
serves the spiritual needs of the community
and gives help to those in need. One of the
ministries, ‘‘Reaching Out,’’ is a food assist-
ance program that operates one of the largest
and most efficient food programs in the State
of California. Their mission is to serve the low-
income, disadvantaged, and homeless in
Santa Clara County. Other ministries serve
those recently released from incarceration,
give support to those with addiction, and aid
parents with children who have special needs.
These programs are just a few that support
our community and are emblematic of Pastor
Foreman’s life-long service to others.
I first met and worked with Kenny Foreman
nearly forty years ago. I know personally of his
love for God and his dedication to our commu-
nity and especially to those in need. He was
a remarkable man and someone I was privi-
leged to consider a friend.
Pastor Kenny Foreman is survived by sons,
Ken and Kurt; their mother, Shirley; four
grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; and
countless friends. Mr. Speaker, our Santa
Clara County community mourns his passing,
but we are grateful for his life, his generosity,
and contributions. He has left our world a bet-
ter place and will be dearly missed.

HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 4, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I was not

Res. 6. Had I been present, I would have
voted NAY on Roll Call No. 6.
CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF FORMER CONGRESSMAN
LESTER WOLFF—THE OLDEST
LIVING MEMBER OF CONGRESS
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 4, 2019
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, today is
former Congressman Lester Wolff’s 100th
birthday, the oldest living former member of
Congress.
Lester was born in New York City in 1919.
He served his country during World War II,
achieving the rank of Colonel in the Civil Air
Patrol.
In 1964, Lester was elected to Congress
and went on to serve the people of New York
for 16 illustrious years. In 2014, he was
awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the
highest civilian award.
As a Congressman, he is remembered for
playing an active role in foreign affairs, but on
Long Island he is also remembered for stand-
ing up to powerful interests to protect the envi-
ronment.
In 1967, the New York State Legislature—at
the insistence of then Governor Nelson
Rockefeller and master planner Robert
Moses—authorized a bridge across the Long
Island Sound.
Lester immediately saw that this bridge
would despoil the pristine and precious re-
source of the Long Island Sound and soon
found himself at the center of an enormous
political fight.
Lester eventually won this fight and the
Oyster Bay Wildlife Refuge was born. Lester’s
efforts in 1968 are an important part of our na-
tion’s environmental history.
In recognition of his monumental contribu-
tions to the preservation and protection of our
environment, especially on Long Island’s
beautiful North Shore, I am proposing the re-
naming of the Oyster Bay National Wildlife
Refuge to the Congressman Lester Wolff Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge.
These precious wetlands—at Congressman
Lester Wolff’s urging—were protected in 1968.
Last Congress, the House passed H.R.
6064 with 385 votes in favor. In this new Con-
gress, I ask for my colleagues continued sup-
port to rename to the Lester Wolff National
Wildlife Refuge.
On behalf of the institution he served, and
all his colleagues, past and present, I wish
Lester a happy 100th year and many more.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
KAREN SAKATA
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 4, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Karen Sakata for her dedi-
cated and passionate service to our commu-
nity.
A third generation Japanese-American,
Karen was born in San Francisco and cur-
rently lives in Alamo with her husband, Shima.
Karen graduated from the University of Cali-
fornia Berkeley with a Bachelor’s degree in
psychology and received a Master’s degree in
speech pathology from San Jose State Univer-
sity.
Karen has proudly worked in the education
field for the past 44 years, including 15 years
in general education and 26 years in special
education. Karen has worked as both an ad-
ministrator and an educator, holding positions
such as Speech Language Pathologist, Re-
source Specialist-Auditory Processing, Early
Childhood Specialist, Program Administrator,
Elementary Principal, Associate Super-
intendent, and Deputy Superintendent.
In 2014, Karen was elected to serve as
Contra Costa Superintendent of Schools. Over
the past four years, she created programs for
students with disabilities and students who are
incarcerated or expelled. Her ‘‘Attendance
Awareness Campaign’’ strove to improve aca-
demic success by fighting chronic absence.
Karen also initiated the creation of resources
to help school administrators communicate
with employees, parents, and students about
inclusivity and respect.
Karen’s work as Superintendent was in
service of her goal to find and build upon the
strengths of each individual child. For the past
four years, she has been a strong and inspir-
ing leader for 177,000 public school students
and 18 school districts in Contra Costa Coun-
ty. Karen Sakata has left a positive impact on
Contra Costa County’s public school system,
its students, and the community at large. I am
thankful for Karen’s service and friendship,
and I wish her the best in her future endeav-
ors.

Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today in recognition of the impor-
tant work done by the Rotary Club of Boca
Raton and to congratulate the recipients of
their Outstanding People and Leaders (OPAL)
awards. This year’s honorees are Charles

Sally Struhl, and Art and Glorianne Polacheck.
In addition, I would like to congratulate the re-
cipients of the Boca Raton Rotary Club’s Life-

Through their philanthropy, service, and
selfless sacrifices, each honoree has touched
countless lives and made a lasting impact on
our South Florida community. The work they
do and the time they have put in is truly de-
serving of these awards.
I extend my most sincere congratulations to
all of tonight’s honorees. As we begin this new
year, I am confident that the Rotary Club of
Boca Raton will continue to be a cherished in-
stitution in South Florida that betters our com-
munity. I greatly appreciate the Club’s work
