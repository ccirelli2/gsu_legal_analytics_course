HONORING DR. STANLEY J.
DUDRICK
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 19, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and admiration that I rise today
to recognize Dr. Stanley J. Dudrick and his
many contributions to the field of medical
science and to his home community in North-
east Pennsylvania.
Dr. Dudrick grew up in Nanticoke, a small
Pennsylvania coal mining town, and through
hard work and dedication, grew to become a
prominent figure in the medical profession. His
research led to the development of a tech-
nique that revolutionized patient care—the
practice of total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
TPN allows individuals who are unable to ob-
tain adequate nutrition through the digestive
tract to receive much-needed nutrition intra-
venously. The TPN method has helped save
an estimated 10 million children and has been
acknowledged as one of the most important
advancements in surgery of the past century.
Dr. Dudrick’s contributions to the medical
profession extend beyond his pioneering re-
search. He has published over 700 works re-
lated to the care and management of surgical
patients and has authored or co-authored over
2,500 scientific referenced citations—the most
for any general surgeon. In addition to serving
the residents of Pennsylvania’s Ninth Con-
gressional District as the medical director of
the physician assistant program at
Misericordia University and professor of sur-
gery at The Commonwealth Medical College,
Dr. Dudrick is chairman emeritus in the De-
partment of Surgery and director emeritus of
Program in Surgery at Saint Mary’s Hospital,
and professor emeritus of surgery at the Yale
University School of Medicine.
Advancements in medical research have al-
lowed us to make important strides in increas-
ing the quality of life for individuals who suffer
from a variety of medical conditions, finding
more effective and less invasive treatments,
and most importantly, saving more lives. Dr.
Dudrick is a pioneer in this regard, and his in-
genuity, scientific prowess, and dedication to
the human condition has made him a fixture in
the medical community.
Dr. Dudrick, through his creative thinking
and ground-breaking invention, has improved
the health of millions around the world and
contributed to the survival of countless more.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join
me in recognizing and thanking Dr. Dudrick for
his many contributions to the medical commu-
nity.
RECOGNIZING GARY NEAL
HON. GREG WALDEN
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 19, 2019
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize my good friend, Gary Neal, for
his many years of hard work and dedicated
service to the Port of Morrow, Morrow County,
and Eastern Oregon. Gary has served as Port
Manager for nearly 30 years, and I would like
to pay tribute to his leadership in the region.
After five years as the Manager at the Port
of Clarkston, Gary was hired in 1989 to man-
age the Port of Morrow. Since that time, and
thanks to Gary’s leadership, the Port has
grown to be the second largest Port in the
state of Oregon.
The Port now houses facilities for everything
from value-added agriculture processing to
high tech data centers. It serves the area as
an economic powerhouse. In 2017 alone, the
Port generated $2.7 billion of economic output
and created nearly 8,500 jobs either directly or
indirectly. From 2008 to 2013, the second
worst economic downturn this country has ex-
perienced, the Port grew by 88 percent. All of
this was driven by Gary’s visionary leadership
of the Port.
Despite the multitude of successes, Gary is
humble about these achievements. While all
the above mentioned statements are fact,
Gary often refuses credit, and instead points
to his commissioners and the community
when explaining the success of the Port.
This focus on community is also evident in
the Port’s countless efforts to support commu-
nity development projects. Whether it is parks,
schools, or athletic facilities, the Port never
hesitates to contribute to the growth of the
community.
In addition to his commitment to the Port,
Gary has served the community in many other
ways. He currently serves on the board for
The Bank of Eastern Oregon; Pacific North-
west Waterways Association; is past president
of the Oregon Public Ports Association; served
on the Infrastructure Finance Authority Board
for the State of Oregon for eight years, and is
an active committee member with several
other groups.
This breadth of experience and involvement
has made Gary a great asset to me on a vari-
ety of issues affecting the Port and the sur-
rounding area. On everything from issues with
the Navy’s Boardman Bombing Range and the
Army’s Umatilla Chemical Depot, to river
transportation and renewable energy, I’ve
leaned upon Gary’s experience and ideas as
we navigated toward solutions.
As Gary begins his well-earned retirement, I
know he is looking forward to spending time
with his family. Gary and his wife Kathy have
been married for 45 years and have two chil-
dren. Their daughter Rochelle is married and
works for Nike. Their son Ryan is taking over
as the Manager of the Port of Morrow. The
apple didn’t fall far from the tree.
Congratulations to my good friend Gary
Neal on a much respected and successful ca-
reer. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing
him well as he pursues his next adventure.

CONGRATULATING THE ROCK EN-
ERGY COOPERATIVE ON 83-
YEARS OF SERVICE TO ITS MEM-
BERS
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 19, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Rock Energy Cooperative for
celebrating 83 years of service. Since they
were founded, they have only continued to
grow and expand their services.
The Rock Energy Cooperative’s articles of
incorporation were first filed in 1936 and has
been bringing electricity to homes across our
region ever since. Starting out with 199 mem-
bers, it has since expanded to draw in thou-
sands of members. In 2007, Rock Energy Co-
operative expanded their operations to Illinois
when they acquired South Beloit Water, Gas &
Electric from Alliant Energy. Following this ad-
dition to their service, the membership in-
creased by ten thousand and now reached
across two states, Wisconsin and Illinois.
However, electricity is not the only service
they deliver as they also provide natural gas
to people across Illinois. Throughout all of
their years of service and powering homes
across our region, they have consistently met
their member’s needs, especially those living
in rural areas.
It is because of businesses such as the
Rock Energy Cooperative that I am especially
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to again
formally congratulate the Rock Energy Coop-
erative on its 83 years of service to the com-
munity.

RECOGNIZING SECOND BAPTIST
CHURCH OF ELGIN
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 19, 2019
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to honor Second Baptist Church of
Elgin, a spiritual pillar of the Elgin, Illinois Afri-
can-American community for over 150 years.
During Black History Month, I want to cele-
brate the beginnings of this vibrant congrega-
tion and the important contributions it has
made over its long and rich history.
The first African-American residents of
Elgin, former slaves who sought shelter with
Union Troops after the battle of Shiloh, arrived
in 1862. These newly freed citizens, regarded
as ‘‘contraband’’ property seized by Union ar-
mies, were sent north in Union railway cars.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E190 February 19, 2019
With the assistance of clergy from First Baptist
Church of Elgin, they settled in the area to
form the cornerstone of a new African-Amer-
ican community. Desirous of having a place of
worship they could call their own, the new-
comers founded Second Baptist Church of
Elgin on December 2, 1866.
Under the leadership of Reverend Dr. Na-
thaniel Edmund, affectionately known as Pas-
tor Nate, Second Baptist Church honors the
determination and courage of its founders with
its sacred presence and community involve-
ment. The church is a spiritual home to thou-
sands of worshipers, and in 2008 expanded its
capacity to serve with the construction of an
award-winning multi-purpose building adding
classrooms, a nursery, a welcome center, and
a recreation and performance auditorium to its
campus. In recent years, Second Baptist
Church has broadened its reach through initia-
tives including the Prison Ministry, the ‘‘Oper-
ation Joshua’’ street ministry, and the SAFE
Ministry to break the cycle of domestic vio-
lence. The church partners with Sheridan Ele-
mentary School and Larsen Middle School to
mentor and tutor students identified as at-risk
youth and has hosted numerous summits on
issues of concern to the community. And em-
blematic of the church’s outward focus, Pastor
Nate has served on boards or in other capac-
ities for a variety of important organizations in
the Elgin area, including the Alignment Col-
laborative for Education, Advocate Sherman
Hospital, the United Way of Elgin, Judson Uni-
versity, U–46 School District, the NAACP of
Greater Elgin, and the African-American Chris-
tian Ministers Alliance of Elgin.
The ministry of Second Baptist Church is
not limited to the local community, and an im-
portant part of its mission is to provide comfort
and support wherever the need is most ur-
gent. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,
Second Baptist Church rallied to aid families
rendered homeless by the storm’s devastation
and adopted survivors who resettled in the
Elgin area. In 2007, as part of its effort to sup-
port the ongoing ministry of World Vision, the
church extended its generosity and compas-
sion to a community in Tanzania, helping to
build a housing complex for teachers and
pledging continuing monetary support to over
130 Tanzanian children.
I believe the newly emancipated founders of
Second Baptist Church would be deeply grati-
fied by the congregation they established, now
spanning three centuries of service. Madam
Speaker, I want to recognize this profoundly
American story of faith, determination, and
good works, and acknowledge the tireless
service of Second Baptist Church of Elgin to
our community in the 8th Congressional Dis-
trict, as well as to all in need throughout the
world.
INTRODUCING A BIPARTISAN RES-
OLUTION EXPRESSING SUPPORT
FOR ADDRESSING THE ARAB-
ISRAELI CONFLICT IN A CONCUR-
RENT TRACK WITH THE ISRAELI-
PALESTINIAN PEACE PROCESS
AND COMMENDING ARAB AND
MUSLIM-MAJORITY STATES
THAT HAVE IMPROVED BILAT-
ERAL RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 19, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce a bipartisan resolution sup-
porting the concurrent-track approach to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process. I want to ac-
knowledge and thank my colleagues, House
Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman ELIOT
ENGEL, and Representatives DAVID
SCHWEIKERT and ROB WOODALL, for intro-
ducing this resolution with me today.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict presents an
immensely difficult challenge—a challenge to
which there are no easy answers. Successive
United States Presidential administrations
have pursued peace agreements between the
parties for over three decades, from the 1982
Reagan Plan for Middle East Peace to the
1993 Oslo Accords, Camp David Summit,
Clinton Parameters, Annapolis Conference,
and efforts to restart the peace process under
the Obama Administration. President Donald
Trump has announced that he too will soon
unveil a plan for peace.
Despite a lack of progress on a formal
agreement, Israel and some of her Arab
neighbors have worked quietly and behind the
scenes to improve bilateral relations in recent
years. Common threats posed by Iran and vio-
lent extremism allowed for new dialogue to
take root, and today, Israel enjoys closer rela-
tions to many of its neighbors in the region.
These efforts represent an opportunity to im-
prove security, stability, and prosperity in the
Middle East. The concurrent-track approach—
where Arab and Muslim-majority states work
to improve their bilateral relations with Israel
as Israel and the Palestinian Authority work
concurrently to advance the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process—should be embraced by our
government as a new paradigm for the region.
The resolution I am introducing today ex-
presses support for this approach and com-
mends Arab and Muslim-majority states that
have already taken steps to improve their bi-
lateral relations with Israel.
I, like nearly all of my colleagues in Con-
gress, continue to support a two-state solution
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, negotiated
between the State of Israel and the Pales-
tinian Authority, and resulting in two states for
two peoples, living side-by-side in peace, se-
curity, and mutual recognition. This is the only
way to ensure that both the Israeli people and
the Palestinian people can have sovereign
homelands. The inability to achieve a two-
state solution threatens the State of Israel’s
security and identity as the democratic home-
land of the Jewish people, just as it impedes
the well-being and self-determination of the
Palestinian people.
I look forward to working with my colleagues
to ensure passage of this resolution.

CONGRATULATING FIDENCIO HOO-
PER-CAMPOS ON HIS RETIRE-
MENT
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 19, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Fidencio Hooper-Campos on his
retirement. Mr. Hooper-Campos has been a
steelworker and member of the United Steel-
workers Local 63 for 45 years.
Fidencio Hooper-Campos has much to cele-
brate following a stellar career as a steel-
worker and a public servant. Mr. Hooper-
Campos began his career as a steelworker at
the age of 19 at Northwestern Steel & Wire
prior to continuing his work at Sterling Steel in
the town where he was born. However, Mr.
Hooper-Campos’ work went beyond that as he
took on leadership roles within the community,
including service on the Whiteside County
Board, Whiteside County Health Clinic Gov-
erning Council and the NCI Works Board. Mr.
Hooper-Campos committed himself to civic ac-
tivism and always worked to improve the com-
munity around him throughout his accom-
plished career. In addition, Mr. Hooper-
Campos enjoys music, kickboxing and martial
arts and I wish him well as he begins his well-
earned retirement.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
Fidencio Hooper-Campos that I am especially
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to again
formally congratulate Fidencio Hooper-
Campos on his retirement after 45 years as a
steelworker.

squadron. He flew 27 successful missions
over Europe as an officer and navigator.
In 1944, his bomber was shot down under
heavy enemy fire, and Mr. Firestone sustained
serious injuries. He and his crew spent six
days wandering through the Austrian Alps be-
fore being captured by local police and taken
to a Nazi POW camp near the German-Polish
border. As a prisoner of war, Mr. Firestone
persevered despite access to little food, ade-
quate clothing, heat and other basic neces-
sities.
When his captors interrogated Mr. Firestone
and asked him why he bombed Austria, he re-
sponded simply: ‘‘Ich bin Juden (I am a Jew).’’
During a relocation march, Firestone and
several other prisoners managed to escape
and reunited several days later with American
soldiers.
After returning home to the United States in
1945, Mr. Firestone studied at Northwestern
University and became a certified public ac-
countant. He married, had children and raised
his family in Highland Park. He suffered life-
long repercussions of his internment as a
POW, seeking medical assistance from Hines
VA Hospital near Chicago.
He is an active member of the American Le-
gion, Jewish War Veterans, and Veterans of
Foreign Wars. He also published a nonfiction
book in 2002 about his experience in the war.
As he celebrates his 100th birthday, it is my
great honor and privilege to recognize Nathan
Firestone for his service to our country during
World War II and his deep involvement in our
community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDMUND
JEFFERSON DANZIGER, JR.
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 19, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
tribute to the life of Edmund Jefferson
Danziger, Jr. of Sylvania Township, Ohio. Pro-
fessor Danziger passed from this life at the
age of eighty years on January 8, 2019. He
was memorialized at Epworth United Meth-
odist Church in Toledo on February 16, 2019.
Edmund Danziger was born in Newark, New
Jersey and spent his childhood with brother
Doug tramping through the outdoors near their
Hillside home. After graduating from high
school in 1956, he felt a call to ministry. How-
ever, he found a different call to history and
research while a student at the College of
Wooster, graduating in 1960. He went on to
receive his doctorate from the University of Illi-
nois. Along the way he married his wife, Mar-
garet, and together they raised two children,
John and Anne. They moved to Bowling
Green Ohio, where he began his 46 year
teaching career at Bowling Green State Uni-
versity.
A noted researcher and expert on Ohio and
Native American history, Professor Danziger’s
work led to the publication of books including
Indians and Bureaucrats: Administering the
Reservation Policy during the Civil War and
Regeneration: Detroit’s American Indian Com-
munity along with many scholarly articles. He
became chair of the BGSU History Depart-
ment, receiving teaching and faculty excel-
lence awards and a special university achieve-
ment award for excellence. In 1995, BGSU
Trustees named him ‘‘distinguished teaching
professor,’’ only the seventh in the school’s
history.
Admired and respected by colleagues and
students, Edmund Danziger explained, ‘‘A
master teacher will ignite a flame with his or
her students—a flame which will guide them in
further academic studies and more generally
along life’s challenging path.’’ This philosophy
sums up Professor Danziger’s career. He took
students on field trips to Fort Meigs, Walpole
Island First Nation, and hiking the Appalachian
Trail. He guided graduate students through
theses and dissertations. A former student
now an assistant professor of history himself
said, ‘‘He was the kind of person who elevated
everybody he was around. He genuinely cared
about humanity. He cared about students.’’
What better reflection of a life well lived?
We send our heartfelt sympathy to the
Danziger family. We hope they find some
comfort in the gift of his life, those he touched
and those who were made better by knowing
Edmund Jefferson Danziger. Godspeed.

HONORING DR. ROBERT ATLAS
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 19, 2019
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I honor
the distinguished career and retirement of Dr.
Robert Atlas.
Dr. Atlas has served our nation for more
than 40 years as a federal employee. He re-
tires as the Director of NOAA’s Atlantic
Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory
(AOML), where he has transformed AOML into
a world class scientific organization focused
on NOAA’s mission and national needs.
Dr. Atlas received his Ph.D. in Meteorology
and Oceanography in 1976 from New York
University. Throughout his career, he has
served our nation as head of the NASA Data
Assimilation Office and as Chief Meteorologist
at NASA GSFC. He was also a key member
of the team that first demonstrated the signifi-
cant impact of quantitative satellite data on nu-
merical weather prediction.
Dr. Atlas has been committed to diversity,
inclusion and equal opportunity, and under his
leadership, AMOL has received several NOAA
awards and is the most diverse of all NOAA
laboratories.
I have had the pleasure of working directly
with Dr. Atlas to inform the public of the up-
coming Hurricane Season each year. His pro-
fessionalism is unmatched, and I am grateful
for his unwavering commitment to keeping
Americans safe.
I am proud today to honor his leadership
and wish him and his family well on his retire-
ment.

RECOGNIZING JACOB JOSEPH ON
HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 19, 2019
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Mr. Jacob Joseph, a World
War II veteran and member of the greatest
generation, ahead of his 100th birthday, which
he will celebrate on April 3.
Mr. Joseph grew up in Knox, Indiana as one
of five children. At age 17 he moved to Chi-
cago and took a job working the soda fountain
in the lobby of the Hotel Sherman, where he
met an Army Lieutenant who encouraged him
to enlist.
Mr. Joseph completed his basic training at
Fort Sheridan in the Tenth District, and then
was stationed in North Carolina and New York
before shipping out to Europe. He served in
the Seventh Army, which was the first U.S.
field army to experience combat in World War
II, as a Staff Sergeant in the 682nd Ordinance
Ammunition unit. The Seventh advanced over
1,000 miles in nine months of continuous fight-
ing, capturing Palermo and Messina, and liber-
ating Marseilles and other cities during the
course of the War.
Joseph worked supplying food to the armed
forces. He received several awards for his
service, including the Bronze Service Arrow-
head and a Good Conduct Medal.
After the war ended, Mr. Joseph returned to
Indiana and soon married his late wife, Bea-
trice. The couple then moved to Chicago,
where they opened ‘‘Jake’s,’’ an innovative
burger joint on Armitage Avenue. ‘‘Jake’s’’ be-
came a hometown favorite, and Mr. Joseph
opened several other locations in the Chicago-
land area and in the Tenth District, as well as
launched a retail line of frozen foods.
Eventually, Mr. Joseph and his wife moved
to Northbrook to raise their two children. In
Northbrook, Mr. Joseph continued to exercise
his entrepreneurial spirit, receiving patents for
designs of a paper towel holder and a napkin
holder. He still enjoys creating and building
replica models and spending time with his two
grandchildren.
As he approaches his 100th birthday, it is
my great honor and privilege to recognize
Jacob Joseph for his service to our country
and allies during World War II and his contin-
ued contributions to the Tenth District commu-
nity.
