DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY C.
‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, Jr. to act as Speaker pro

NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by
the majority and minority leaders for
morning-hour debate.

f
RECOGNIZING CARBONDALE
COMMUNITY ICONS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, last weekend
Southern Illinois University and the
larger Carbondale community lost two
icons, Harvey Welch and Seymour
Bryson.
Harry Welch, a native of Centralia,
was the first Black athlete to earn a
basketball letter at SIU, playing from
1951 to 1954. He was also the first Black
student to complete the ROTC program
at the university. Harvey went on to a
20-year career in the Air Force, and he
was the first of three Black officers to
be promoted to colonel.
After retiring from the Air Force,
Harvey came back to Carbondale and
SIU in 1975. He served as the first
Black dean of student life at SIU and
then as vice chancellor from 1987 to
2000.
Seymour Bryson of Quincy, a fellow
basketball standout, received three de-
grees from SIU. He was one of three Af-
rican Americans to progress from as-
sistant professor to full professor at
SIU. He was also the first African
American associate dean of the college
and the second of three African Amer-
ican deans. Seymour was active in the
Carbondale NAACP, Jackson County
Mental Health Board, and Carbondale
United Way.
Harvey Welch and Seymour Bryson
are members of the SIU Saluki Hall of
Fame. They will be dearly missed.
RECOGNIZING KODY VANFOSSAN
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
not only as a Member of Congress, but
also as a former firefighter to recog-
nize Kody Vanfossan of Christopher, Il-
linois. Kody, a 24-year-old firefighter,
passed away in the line of duty early
Sunday morning.
Kody grew up around the fire station
and comes from a family with deep tra-
ditions of public service. His dad,
Brent, is a captain on the Christopher
force. His grandfather is Christopher’s
mayor but was also a firefighter at the
Valier Fire Department.
Kody’s family instilled in him a pas-
sion for helping others, despite the
risk. Now his community will remem-
ber him as a hero.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Kody for his
service, and may he rest in peace.
f
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
last night at a rally in Florida, the
President referred to me as ‘‘that
man.’’
Mr. Speaker, I love my country, and
still I rise. And I rise today to address
the comment that the President made
in referring to me as ‘‘that man.’’
Mr. Speaker, the video of what I said
speaks for itself. The President indi-
cates that I said the only way to get
him out of office is to impeach him,
but the video speaks for itself.
But I do want to share with the
President that he is right; I am ‘‘that
man.’’ I am ‘‘that man,’’ a liberated
Democrat, a liberated Democrat in the
spirit of Shirley Chisholm. I am
unbought and unbossed.
Mr. President, you finally encoun-
tered at least one person that your
money can’t buy and your power
doesn’t scare.
You have a date with destiny, Mr.
President. Your fate is in the hands of
435 Members of Congress. You are not
above the law. No one is.
Impeachment is in the hands of this
Congress. ‘‘That man,’’ Mr. President,
is a Member of this Congress.
Mr. President, I assure you that the
long arm of the law is reaching out for
you. In this country, we will not allow
you or any other person to hold your-
self out as being above the law.
You have an appointment with his-
tory in this House of Representatives.
If no one else will bring you to justice,
I will, Mr. President.
Lawsuits and delay tactics will not
deter me. You will not engage in the
paralysis of analysis, as Dr. King put
it. You won’t engage in this paralysis
of analysis such that we will put this
off until the next election.
Mr. President, your case will be
brought before this House. It is just a
matter of time, Mr. President; it is just
a matter of time.

RECOGNIZING BUCKS COUNTY
COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEN’S
GOLF TEAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise to recognize the Bucks County
Community College men’s golf team
for their strong performance this sea-
son, their first year competing as a Di-
vision II athletic program.
While golf season for most Americans
is just underway, the Bucks County
Community College men’s golf team
has been playing since March. Earlier
this month, the team secured a bid to
the 2019 NJCAA Division II Men’s Na-
tional Golf Championship after win-
ning their regional golf championship
at Cumberland Country Club in Mary-
land with a combined team score of 320.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to particu-
larly recognize golfer Chris Benvenuto
and Coach Scott Bradshaw for their
work in guiding this team to such suc-
cess. We wish them and all Bucks
County golfers all the best of luck as
they move on to compete in Indiana
and beyond. Our entire Bucks County
community is incredibly proud of each
and every one of these team members
and Bucks County Community College.
TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker,
this week is Teacher Appreciation
Week, and I rise to recognize an out-
standing school faculty member from
Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
Jeff Klein, a guidance counselor at
Tamanend Middle School in War-
rington, was recently named the win-
ner of the Unsung Heroes Award, spon-
sored by the Pennsylvania State Edu-
cation Association and the Council for
the Advancement of Public Schools. In
addition to his work counseling stu-
dents, Jeff serves as a coach and works
to give students additional learning op-
portunities both inside and outside of
the traditional classroom.
With this prestigious honor comes a
$2,000 grant, which Jeff says will be put
toward the painting of a mural in the
Tamanend gym that honors the basket-
ball tournament he conducts to
fundraise for the Kelly Anne Dolan Me-
morial Fund, a nonprofit organization
in Montgomery County that assists
families raising children with disabil-
ities.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor
Jeff, and I thank him for his service to
our community.
I would also like to thank the Kelly
Anne Dolan Memorial Fund, PSEA,
and Tamanend Middle School and their
principal, Dr. Brian Caughie, for all
they do to educate our youth and to
serve all those in need in our commu-
nity.
TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker,
this week is Teacher Appreciation
Week, and I rise today to recognize a
dedicated educator from Bucks County,
Pennsylvania.
Andrea Mangold, a teacher at the
Holland Elementary School, was re-
cently named an Outstanding Earth
Science Teacher for the State of Penn-
sylvania by the National Association of
Geoscience Teachers. These awards are
given to educators who contribute
greatly to students’ interest in earth
science at the precollege level. In June,
Andrea will be recognized by her peers
at the National Association of Geo-
science Teachers’ Eastern Section
Meeting.
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for
Andrea’s work and appreciate her dedi-
cation for instilling a passion for
science and learning in our commu-
nity’s youth.
I would also like to recognize Holland
Elementary School Principal Joe
MacClay and the National Association
of Geoscience Teachers for all they do
to educate and inspire our next genera-
tion of leaders.
f
MOURNING ANDREW ‘‘AJ’’ FREUND
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for 5 minutes.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, on
Friday, May 3, I attended the visita-
tion of 5-year-old Andrew ‘‘AJ’’
Freund. His mother and father are
awaiting trial for his murder.
Our community is in mourning. AJ’s
death is heartbreaking, and so is the
system that failed him. But one key
part of the foster care system is
stretched beyond capacity.
In the county where AJ lived, 40 per-
cent of children must leave the county
to be placed in foster homes, which can
have adverse impacts. The need for fos-
ter care in Illinois grew by 20 percent
between 2017 and 2018, while the num-
ber of foster homes is decreasing at the
fastest rate in the country.
Local agencies are reviewing the
policies surrounding AJ’s death, but
Congress must act as well. Here are
two things that I am doing and that
our colleagues can do as well to pre-
vent another tragedy like AJ.
First, join me as a member of the
Congressional Foster Youth Caucus to
support people to become foster par-
ents and to place children into stable
homes. Second, seek data-informed so-
lutions.
This week, I championed a bipartisan
amendment to the Child Abuse and
Treatment Act, CAPTA, to study the
effect of parental substance use dis-
orders on children removed from a fam-
ily.
I hope my colleagues will join me in
supporting foster youth and families
across this country. We must all work
to ensure tragedies like AJ’s death
never happen again.
f
RECOGNIZING MRS. CATHERINE
ROSALIE MCFADDIN BEATY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize a truly great Amer-
ican, Mrs. Catherine Rosalie McFaddin
Beaty, who passed away on April 27,
2019, at the age of 94.
Mrs. Beaty was born in Rock Hill,
South Carolina, and was the daughter
of the late Roy D. McFaddin and the
late Eulalie Boykin Cook McFaddin.
She was also preceded in death by her
husband, Cherry Beaty, and brother,
First Lieutenant Robert Eli McFaddin,
who was killed in action during World
War II.
Mrs. Beaty was a 1941 graduate of
Rock Hill High School, where she was a
member of the following clubs: the Na-
tional Honor Society, the Glee Club,
the Public Speaking and Drama Club,
and the Latin and French Club. She
was a junior assistant of the Bearcat
publication.
She graduated from Winthrop College
in 1945, where she received a bachelor’s
degree in business and, later, a teach-
ing degree.
Upon graduation from Winthrop, she
first worked as a paralegal and sec-
retary before beginning her career as a
teacher, where she taught at Rock Hill
High School, Ebinport Elementary,
Riverview Elementary, Fort Mill Ele-
mentary, McCelvey Elementary, and
Richmond Drive Elementary.
During her teaching career, she was a
member of the NEA and the SCEA as a
representative of Richmond Drive Ele-
mentary School and Delta Kappa
Gamma International Society of
Teachers, along with Alpha Delta
Kappa, where she served for over 30
years.
Mrs. Beaty was a dedicated member
of Oakland Avenue Presbyterian
Church, volunteering for the Provi-
dence Presbytery for over 20 years in
the resource library.
b 1015
She rang handbells in the Memorial
Handbell Choir and sang in the Chancel
Choir for over 59 years.
In recognition of her dedicated and
tireless service to the church, Mrs.
Beaty was awarded the Presbyterian
Woman of the Year in 2015.
Rosalie Beaty was an icon with the
very people who knew her the best, her
family. She delighted in family gath-
erings, where she would provide bottled
Coke, hot tea, and cheese rings for ev-
eryone who attended.
She had the uncanny ability to re-
member family birthdays and anniver-
saries with cards and special memen-
tos.
Rosalie Beaty will be remembered for
her fierce independence, her sharp

mind, her amazing memory, and her
loyalty and strict attention to detail.
During her memorial service held on
May 1, 2019, the description stated by
Reverend Jeff Bryan was that she was
simply the mother of Cathy Rose, and
the legacy left behind by her life was
epitomized by these words: While she
was alive, she lived, and the 94 years
she lived on this Earth were spent serv-
ing her God, her family, and her fellow
man, in that order.
The indelible mark she left on her
family and community will remain for
years to come. The world is truly a bet-
ter place by having the person of Rosa-
lie McFadden Beaty as a shining exam-
ple of dedication to a higher calling
and, truly, a life well lived.

RECOGNIZING 2019 ILLINOIS
TEACHER OF THE YEAR SUSAN
CONVERSE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs.
Susan Converse, who was recently
named the 2019 Illinois Teacher of the
Year by the Illinois State Board of
Education.
Mrs. Converse teaches functional life
skills at Edwardsville High School in
my district. She takes a personal inter-
est in her students, ensuring they have
all the tools they need to succeed in
the classroom and beyond.
If you ask her, she will tell you that
the work she does every day is a dream
come true.
As a functional life skills teacher,
Mrs. Converse manages the Tiger Den
at Edwardsville High School. It is a
coffee shop staffed and run by students
with disabilities.
Her students take the orders and
work the register, teaching them con-
sumer service skills and equipping
them with vocational training to pre-
pare them for life after they exit the
school system.
As a father, I know the difference a
teacher can make in the lives of our
kids, and Mrs. Converse certainly has
made a profound impact on each and
every one of her students.
I am proud to recognize her today as
one of the best educators in not just
the State of Illinois but the entire
country.
I congratulate Susan. It was great to
see her out here in Washington last
week, and I look forward to seeing her
back home very soon.
RECOGNIZING AUDREY EPHRAIM WOMEN’S
CENTER
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
Audrey Ephraim Women’s Center in
Carlinville, Illinois, and Pastor Don
and his wife, Deneane, who run this
great facility.
As the southern Illinois site for
Adult & Teen Challenge Illinois, this
center is a critical resource in pro-
viding effective care to women who
struggle with life-controlling problems.
Audrey Ephraim Women’s Center is a
residential program with a one-of-a-
kind approach to caring for women in
need of treatment.
For some, this program is a last
chance before serving time in jail. For
others, they come at their own will for
help in seeking a road to recovery.
When I visited the center, I spoke
with three women who told me that,
upon their arrival, they had found a
path to bettering their lives and find-
ing purpose. For so many women, this
center is a safe haven. It is a place for
hope and a promise of a brighter to-
morrow.
I am proud to represent facilities like
the Audrey Ephraim Women’s Center
that provide this life-changing care to
women who are in their most desperate
times.
To all those at the center, I thank
them for all they do. I am going to con-
tinue to pray for each and every one of
them.
I really want to thank my new
friends—Katrina, Alicia, and Rhonda—
who were not just an inspiration to me
and my team but are an inspiration to
this entire institution and our great
country. I look forward to seeing them
again.

PRAYER
Imam Omar Sulieman, Yaqeen Insti-
tute for Islamic Research, Irving,
Texas, offered the following prayer:
In the name of God, the most com-
passionate, the most merciful; our sus-
tainer, our guide; ever present, never
unaware, infinitely able, Your servants
in Your loving care; guide us to pure
convictions that inspire in us the cour-
age to match those convictions.
We pray for peace, not war; love, not
hate; benevolence, not greed; unity,
not division. And we commit ourselves
to not betraying our prayers with ac-
tions that contradict them.
Let us be for truth, no matter who or
for is against it; and justice, no matter
who or for it is against; and hope, no
matter what obstacles lie ahead.
Let us not be deterred by the hatred
that has claimed the lives of innocent
worshipers across the world, but
emboldened by the love that gathered
them together to remember You and
gathered us together to remember
them.
Let us not be overcome by the dark-
ness of evil nor the slumber of indiffer-
ence that turns human beings into
hashtags and neighbors into enemies.
Let us be the light that we seek from
You.
Guide the deliberations of our Mem-
bers of Congress to just decisions, and
guide our Nation to the abode of rec-
onciliation. May we honor one another,
glorify You together, and inspire the
world to be better.
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God,

SULIEMAN
The SPEAKER. Without objection,

Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam

Sulieman for offering the opening
prayer before the House of Representa-
tives and to recognize the commence-
ment of Ramadan, the Muslim holy
month of fasting and spiritual renewal.
He offers counsel and religious guid-
ance to many Muslims in my district
and throughout the north Texas region.
We are fortunate to live in a nation
that embraces religious diversity and
interfaith understanding. I am proud to
have introduced a resolution to recog-
nize the commencement of Ramadan
and to commend the Muslim commu-
nity in the United States and through-
out the world for their faith.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
(English translation of the statement
made in Spanish is as follows:)
Mr. TAKANO. On Mother’s Day, I
have a message for all the mothers who
were separated from their children at
our border after enduring a long and
dangerous journey to provide their
children with a better life:
The American people and I are with
you.
Thousands of children were separated
from their parents. And hundreds are
still separated from their families.
That’s unacceptable.
The President’s anti-immigrant ac-
tions are cruel, inhumane, and a viola-
tion of the human rights of families es-
caping violence.
We are not a country that closes its
doors on immigrants and families seek-
ing asylum.
We must reunite all the mothers with
their children and fight for comprehen-
sive immigration reform.
Este dı́a de las madres, tengo un
mensaje para todas las mamás que
fueron separadas de sus hijos en
nuestra frontera después de hacer un
viaje largo y peligroso con la esperanza
de darles una mejor vida a sus hijos:
El pueblo americano y yo estamos
con ustedes.
Miles de niños fueron separados de
sus padres. Y cientos de ninõs siguen
separados de sus familias.
Eso es inaceptable.
Las acciones antiinmigrantes de este
presidente son crueles, son inhumanas,
y son una violación de los derechos
humanos de las familias que están
escapando violencia.
No somos un paı́s que cierra sus
puertas a los inmigrantes ya a las
familias pidiendo asilo.
Tenemos que reunir a todas las
madres con sus hijos y luchar por una
ref orma migratoria.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California will provide the
Clerk a translation of his remarks.
f
RAISING MENTAL HEALTH
AWARENESS
(Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to raise mental health
awareness during Mental Health
Month.
According to the National Alliance
on Mental Illness, about 164,000 Mon-
tanans have a mental health condition.
Unfortunately, mental healthcare is
not available to many Montanans. In
fact, over 50 percent of Montanans live
in an area where there is a shortage of
mental health professionals.
I recently brought together pro-
viders, leaders, and advocates in Mon-
tana to discuss how we can improve
mental healthcare, substance abuse
treatment, and suicide prevention.
They told me about the challenges
they face to provide care and of their
promising progress. They told me
about resources, like telemedicine,
that could improve treatment and help
fill coverage gaps.
Individuals impacted by mental ill-
ness can lead healthy, fulfilling lives.
Access to treatment, though, is crit-
ical.
Let’s work together in a bipartisan
way to address mental healthcare. Our
communities depend on it.
f
DEMOCRATS PROVIDE ACCESS TO
HEALTHCARE
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, 2
years ago, our Republican friends voted
to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They
brought in cases of beer to celebrate.
They piled into luxury buses that
ferried them to the White House, where
they had a second party with the Presi-
dent to celebrate their attempt to kick
millions of Americans off their health
insurance.
Fortunately, we stopped them. That
bill never became law.
But 2 years later, they are up to the
same old tricks. The President is ask-
ing a Federal court to strike down not
just protections for more than 130 mil-
lion Americans with preexisting condi-
tions, but the entire Affordable Care
Act.
Talk about not getting the memo.
The American people sent a message to
President Trump in November and to
my Republican colleagues on the other
side of the aisle. They want govern-
ment to stop working for special inter-
ests and start working for the people
again. That is why House Democrats
are about to pass legislation to
strengthen protections for folks with
preexisting conditions, H.R. 986.
While President Trump continues his
assault on the Affordable Care Act,
Democrats are going to continue our
work for the people by passing legisla-
tion to make sure every American has
access to the quality, affordable
healthcare they deserve.
f
HONORING MITCH TITUS
(Mr. BANKS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of volunteer
firefighter Mitch Titus.
Over 15 years ago, Chief Titus took
the helm as chief of the Winona Lake
Fire Department. While he worked a
full-time job in excavation, he was also
a very dedicated public servant.
In the wake of his tragic passing on
Sunday, Chief Titus has been described
by fellow colleagues and friends as
‘‘very dedicated and loyal,’’ ‘‘a fire-
man’s firefighter,’’ and ‘‘a great guy, a
great leader, a great fire leader.’’ It is
people like Mitch Titus who embody
the very best that our Nation has to
offer.
While all of Kosciusko County and
the rest of Indiana mourn his loss, his
endless dedication to his county and to
his fellow people will be remembered
for many years to come.
I offer my deepest condolences to his
three children and his family and
friends as we mourn the loss of Chief
Titus.
f
TACKLING OPIOID ADDICTION
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker, I
rise today because I have heard from
too many parents and siblings in up-
state New York who have lost a loved
one to overdose from opioids.
I rise because overdose fatalities are
the leading cause of death for Ameri-
cans under 50.
I rise because addressing the opioid
crisis means understanding and treat-
ing addiction. We must see addiction
for what it is: not a weakness, but a
disease that requires treatment.
I am proud to have introduced legis-
lation to address this crisis, H.R. 2482,
the Mainstreaming Addiction Treat-
ment Act. This bipartisan bill would
end a redundancy in Federal law that
restricts health providers from pre-
scribing buprenorphine, a proven treat-
ment for addiction.
To tackle this crisis, we must go be-
yond taking the needed steps of hold-
ing Big Pharma accountable and cre-
ating more drug courts. We must treat
the addiction.
Madam Speaker, we cannot let the
wrongheaded stigmatization of addic-
tion undermine our capacity or our
commitment to treating it.
Let’s pass H.R. 2482.
f
BILLY JOEL’S 70TH BIRTHDAY
(Mr. ZELDIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to wish a very happy 70th birth-
day to Billy Joel, a resident of the
greatest congressional district in
America, the First Congressional Dis-
trict of New York.
He has sung about Allentown; he has
sung about Vienna; but he never forgot
where he came from. It is important,
whether you are in politics, music, or
business, to never forget where you
come from.
He would sing songs about our bays,
our beaches, our boaters, our fisher-
men, our restaurants, our media. He is
someone who, to this very day, looks
at Long Island as his home.
He has a concert tonight celebrating
his 70th birthday with so many fans.

Happy birthday to Billy Joel.

HONORING LARRY HANLEY
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker,
it is with great sadness that I note the
passing of Larry Hanley, the inter-
national president of the Amalgamated
Transit Union.
He was a big man with a big heart
and a passion for transportation—not
just for what it meant for his members;
although, he was their tireless cham-
pion. He had a bold vision for what his
union meant, to enrich tens of millions
of lives every day for people who use
transit and another hundred million
who benefit, even if they don’t ride.
He started as a bus driver and rose
through the ranks to become not just
the Amalgamated Transit Union presi-
dent, but one of the finest of American
labor leaders.
We are sad for the loss for Larry’s
wife, Thelma; his daughter, Monica;
son, Larry, Jr.; and almost 200,000 of
his members.
We are grateful for the enormous
contributions he made to enrich the
lives of us all.

LEGISLATION TO KEEP AMERICA’S
AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY MOVING
(Mr. PENCE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of H.R. 2460, the first
piece of legislation I have introduced
as a Member of Congress and one that
reduces the regulatory burden on the
hardworking men and women of Indi-
ana and America’s transportation and
agriculture community.
The Modernizing Agricultural Trans-
portation Act of 2019 will ensure our
truckers, farmers, and producers have
the flexibility needed to keep Amer-
ica’s agriculture industry moving.
The bill ensures that transportation
and agriculture stakeholders are in-
cluded in the rulemaking process so
that relevant stakeholders can share
their experiences and knowledge.
I am proud to lead this bipartisan ef-
fort with House Agriculture Committee
Chairman COLLIN PETERSON of Min-
nesota.
Improving our infrastructure is not a
partisan issue, and it is time that we
act. Sixth District Hoosiers sent me to
Washington to get things done, and
that is exactly what I am doing.
I ask my colleagues to support H.R.
2460.

DELIVERING BETTER HEALTH-
CARE ACCESS TO CONSTITUENTS
(Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Madam Speaker, I rise to call atten-
tion to the challenges rural commu-
nities face to access basic healthcare.
In New Mexico, I have seen, first-
hand, health challenges these areas
face. They include expectant mothers
who have to drive for hours, often
across State lines, for every single pre-
natal appointment.
They include veterans who have to
get on the bus in the middle of the
night for a doctor’s appointment in Al-
buquerque the next day.
It includes teenagers in crisis facing
a long waiting list for a much-needed
mental health appointment.
And it includes rural and community
hospitals on the verge of closing their
doors. This is what rural America
faces.
Even with these hardships, we are
often the first to be forgotten when
legislators and healthcare experts dis-
cuss healthcare quality, access, and af-
fordability.
So as Congress begins discussing how
to decrease the cost of healthcare in-
surance, to lower the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs, to provide mental
healthcare, and protect millions of
Americans with preexisting conditions,
I urge consideration of the pressure
points that rural communities face.
That is how we deliver better
healthcare access to all our constitu-
ents.
f
ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE
HEALTHCARE IS A FUNDA-
MENTAL RIGHT
(Mr. CARSON of Indiana asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, May 4 marked 2 years since
House Republicans passed their
TrumpCare legislation to dismantle
the Affordable Care Act. If passed, this
reckless bill would have ripped away
healthcare from millions. Thanks to
Americans’ tireless activism, this bill
did not become law. But that wasn’t
the end of the crusade to protect our
care.
This administration continues to
sabotage the Affordable Care Act, im-
plementing rules and gutting programs
in a very cruel conspiracy to under-
mine it; and people with preexisting
conditions are some of the most vul-
nerable in a very dangerous game.
Madam Speaker, the Affordable Care
Act, with its strong protections, helped
many of these Americans obtain health
insurance for the very first time. But
now, this administration is using a
back-door guidance to allow junk in-
surance plans the ability to deny cov-
erage to people with preexisting condi-
tions.
That is why I am glad the House
plans to vote on H.R. 986, which will
stop this move and protect Americans
living with preexisting conditions.
I will proudly vote for this bill.
GREAT LAKES RESILIENCY
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to urge that any long-term
infrastructure agreement reached be-
tween Congress and the President must
invest in the resiliency of coastal com-
munities.
Lake Ontario is already over 11
inches higher than average, and as rain
falls and water levels continue to
climb, my community and others like
it are bracing for yet another season of
devastating flooding.
We must take proactive steps to ad-
just to changing weather patterns, the
impacts of Plan 2014, and improve our
community’s ability to withstand, re-
cover, and adapt to weather-related
events.
The Army Corps of Engineers will
soon be conducting a study to develop
a coastal resiliency plan, and it is im-
perative that any long-term infrastruc-
ture agreement include significant in-
vestments in these findings.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues towards a comprehensive in-
frastructure package that makes these
investments a reality and better pro-
tects my district and the Great Lakes
coastline.
f
QUESTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW
AND THE CONSTITUTION
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
this week the Nation has seen this Con-
gress deal with the questions of the
rule of law and the Constitution. But
this Congress believes that our work is
for the people and, at the same time,
our oversight on issues of national se-
curity are immense and important.
Yesterday, I raised a question of
military presence off the shores of
Iran; for no explanation has been given
to the United States Congress on the
need for that presence.
And having been a Member of Con-
gress during the Iraq war and, cer-
tainly, during the war in Afghanistan,
committed to the men and women of
the United States military, only Con-
gress can declare war. This administra-
tion must advise and seek consent of
Congress. But those of us who are con-
cerned about national security, with
the jurisdictional committees, must be
briefed, and must be made aware to
protect the American people.
So I stand here today to say the rule
of law is important, but the national
security of this country is important.
No war without the involvement and
engagement of the United States Con-
gress.
We believe in peace and diplomacy.

tlewoman from Florida is recognized

Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS),
pending which I yield myself such time
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-

GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida?
There was no objection.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, on
Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and
reported a rule, House Resolution 357,
providing for consideration of H.R. 986,
the Protecting Americans with Pre-
existing Conditions Act, under a struc-
tured rule.
The rule makes in order 12 amend-
ments. The rule provides 1 hour of de-
bate equally divided and controlled by
the chair and the ranking member of
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce.
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 2157, the Supplemental
Appropriations Act, under a structured
rule. The rule self-executes a man-
ager’s amendment and makes in order
10 amendments to H.R. 2157.
Finally, the rule provides 1 hour of
debate equally divided and controlled
by the chair and ranking member of
the Committee on Appropriations.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the two bills in this rule, H.R.
986, the Protecting Americans with
Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019, and
H.R. 2157, the Supplemental Appropria-
tions Act.
H.R. 986 will ensure that the patient
protections and benefits of the Afford-
able Care Act are protected. It will pre-
vent this administration from doing
administratively what they failed to do
legislatively, make health insurance
inaccessible for the, at least, 52 million
Americans who live with preexisting
conditions.
The administration is trying to coax
States, through misuse of the 1332 in-
novation waivers, to make available
plans that don’t cover all of the essen-
tial health benefits that the ACA re-
quires, or don’t cover preexisting con-
ditions, possibly with tax credits. This
is consumer fraud. It is a misuse of tax-
payer money.
The administration would make it
possible for plans to deny coverage or
charge higher premiums based on
health status. Under their guidance,
plans could have lifetime or annual
limits. They would be able to charge
higher rates to older people than the
ACA allows and are not required is
cover essential health benefits.
It will hurt consumers who think
they are buying comprehensive health
insurance and then find out that their
plan doesn’t cover whatever health cri-
sis they may be facing.
The guidance from the administra-
tion is a back door to destroying the
Affordable Care Act. H.R. 986 makes
sure that that will not happen.
b 1230
I also rise to support H.R. 2157. The
disaster supplemental will provide $17.2
billion in disaster relief to commu-
nities across America, including my
own State of Florida.
The House passed a similar bill in
January, which the Senate failed to
take up. Since January, there have
been floods in the Midwest and torna-
does in Alabama, and we have included
additional money to fund those disas-
ters.
No American should wait for assist-
ance while Congress squabbles. Seven
months have passed since Hurricane
Michael devastated the panhandle in
Florida, including completely leveling
Tyndall Air Force Base. It is time to
pass both of these bills.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding me
the customary 30 minutes, and I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, today, we are con-
sidering a bill that appropriates a little
over $17 billion for disasters affecting
all parts of the United States.
As Members of Congress, we are
elected to serve the people, and part of
that duty is providing emergency aid
when disaster strikes. I am supportive
of disaster relief, and we certainly
could have provided this crucial aid
months ago. At this time, our commu-
nities are still in need.
This is the third time that the House
will consider a relief bill to address the
same set of disasters.
On 20 December 2018, the House of
Representatives passed a continuing

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3511

resolution to fund the government
through February 8 that also included
almost $8 billion of disaster relief fund-
ing, but this bill did not become law.
On January 16, 2019, the House passed
a supplemental appropriations package
that would have provided a little over
$12 billion in aid. But at the last
minute, during Rules Committee de-
bate, Democrats added a short-term,
full-government continuing resolution
through a manager’s amendment that
did not include President Trump’s re-
quest for border security funding. As a
result, the government remained closed
without providing a resolution to the
problem.
It has now been 4 months since the
House last considered providing dis-
aster aid, long enough that additional
disasters have struck our country, ne-
cessitating an increased number.
The bill before us seeks to provide re-
lief funding for Hurricanes Michael and
Florence, as well as continued support
for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and
Maria. The wildfires in California will
be included in this supplemental, as
well as the severe storms and flooding
in multiple States, including Texas;
the Alaska earthquake; Typhoons Yutu
and Mangkhut in the Northern Mar-
iana Islands and Guam; Tropical Storm
Gita in American Samoa; volcanic
eruptions in Hawaii; and devastating
floods across the Midwest.
This third iteration of disaster relief
legislation is similar to a bill passed by
the House in January of this year, with
an additional $500 million for the De-
partment of Agriculture’s Emergency
Conservation Program to rehabilitate
damaged farmland; $1.5 billion for the
Army Corps of Engineers for projects
and flood mitigation; and $1 billion for
the Community Development Block
Grant Disaster Recovery account for
rebuilding houses, businesses, and pub-
lic infrastructure. The bill also in-
cludes $600 million for disaster nutri-
tion benefits in Puerto Rico as that is-
land recovers from Hurricane Maria.
The President has expressed concern
about Puerto Rico’s management of
the billions of disaster aid the island
has already received. Senate Repub-
licans are negotiating with the White
House on a compromise, but Democrats
have decided to continue pushing this
legislation forward without engaging
the other two parties that would be re-
quired in order for the bill to become
law.
This bill also includes language pro-
hibiting any funds from being used for
the construction of a border wall. The
crisis on our southern border is not a
natural disaster; it is a humanitarian
and security disaster, one that we can
stop and take steps to prevent in the
future. But the Democrats refuse to ac-
cept that our Customs and Border Pro-
tection and Immigration and Customs
Enforcement officers are overwhelmed,
that our Office of Refugee Resettle-
ment facilities are near capacity, and
that our immigration judges are facing
years of backlogged cases.
This is a disaster that we can do
something about now. Rather than ne-
gotiate in good faith, Democrats have
chosen once again to bring up a bill
that will not pass the Senate.
I am disappointed that these con-
troversial provisions are included in
the bill. It does beg the question: When
are we going to get back to the busi-
ness of legislating?
As an aside, I would note that the
House adjourned yesterday at 2 o’clock
in the afternoon, plenty of time to con-
tinue working on some of these prob-
lems. For whatever reason, we decided
not to do that.
The second bill under consideration,
H.R. 986, is supposed to protect Ameri-
cans with preexisting conditions. It has
a very catchy title. Despite that
catchy title, the bill does nothing to
enhance preexisting condition protec-
tions under the Affordable Care Act.
The first vote that Republicans
called this Congress was a motion to
require legislation protecting individ-
uals with preexisting conditions. Rath-
er surprisingly, the Democrats voted
against that previous question, block-
ing the motion.
In 2017, as part of the proposed re-
placement for the Affordable Care Act,
Republicans included legislation that
would have preserved access for those
with preexisting conditions. Again,
this was not supported by House Demo-
crats.
H.R. 986 eliminates healthcare
choices for States by infringing upon
the authority that was given to the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices under the Affordable Care Act.
Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act
established the Waiver for State Inno-
vation. This allowed States to waive
certain ACA regulations in order to
provide flexible coverage through new
State healthcare programs.
The Secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services was re-
quired to promulgate regulations for
the granting of these waivers, main-
taining that new State health pro-
grams stay within the guardrails pro-
vided by law.
My constituents of north Texas are
consistently concerned about not hav-
ing access to affordable healthcare. I
take meeting after meeting with fami-
lies who say they are suffering from
the high cost of healthcare and pre-
scription drugs, deductibles, and
copays. Texans are struggling to afford
their health insurance, and I am sure
we are not the only ones experiencing
these premiums and deductibles.
What good is health insurance if you
are afraid to use it because you cannot
afford your deductibles and copays?
This is an issue that I would like to see
us tackle, yet we are here today dis-
cussing a bill with a very misleading
title that would take flexibility away
from States.
During the Rules Committee hearing
on Tuesday, we discussed innovative
strategies for providing high-quality
and affordable health insurance, ex-
panding consumer choice, and some of
the positive results for States that
have implemented these waivers. In no
way did we discuss removing ACA pro-
tections for people with preexisting
conditions. In fact, I pointed out that
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services’ Administrator Seema Verma
stated in her remarks at the CMS Na-
tional Forum on State Relief and Em-
powerment Waivers that ‘‘a waiver
cannot be approved that might other-
wise undermine these protections.’’
Yet Democrats have titled this bill
‘‘Protecting Americans with Pre-
existing Conditions Act of 2019.’’ This
is clearly an attempt to coerce Mem-
bers of Congress into voting for a bill
that actually scales back the guidance
recently issued for the application of
State innovation waivers.
Energy and Commerce Committee
Ranking Member GREG WALDEN offered
an amendment to more appropriately
title the bill ‘‘This Bill Has Nothing to
do with Protecting Americans with
Preexisting Conditions Act.’’ I hope
this amendment will alert Members to
the partisan wordplay of the Demo-
crats when we should be focusing on
improving the health insurance mar-
ketplace.
Taking flexibility away from States
is one step closer to a single-payer,
government-run healthcare system.
This single-payer, government-run
healthcare system would only further
deteriorate our Nation’s healthcare.
The Affordable Care Act was one step
in that direction. While it is clear that
the Affordable Care Act has proven to
be nothing like affordable for Ameri-
cans, section 1332 waivers would have
allowed States the flexibility to em-
ploy innovation that works for their
citizens.
To date, eight States—Alaska, Ha-
waii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New
Jersey, Oregon, and Wisconsin—have
approved State innovation waivers, and
seven have created their own reinsur-
ance programs. Premiums in these
States—and this is important—pre-
miums in these seven States were al-
most 20 percent lower, on average, in
the first year of enactment. Maryland
saw the greatest percent change, with
the average individual market pre-
mium coming down by more than 40
percent, 43.4 percent, to be precise.
Again, section 1332 of the Affordable
Care Act explicitly gives the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services
the authority to provide guidance sur-
rounding these innovation waivers. As
more States submit applications, the
administration has learned more about
what hurdles States must traverse in
order to obtain these waivers.
One limit to a State’s ability to
apply for an innovation waiver is that
the State must have already enacted a
State law establishing authority to
pursue and implement the waiver. For
a State like Texas, where the State
legislature meets only every 2 years,
this can be a substantial barrier.
The recent Trump administration
guidance provides clarity, stating that,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3512 May 9, 2019
in certain circumstances, existing
State legislation coupled with a duly
enacted State regulation or executive
order could satisfy this requirement.
This guidance, the 1332 guidance, re-
moves some hurdles while maintaining
the integrity of the coverage guardrails
established by law. Those statutory re-
quirements maintain that coverage
must be as comprehensive as coverage
would have been absent the waiver,
provide cost-sharing to protect against
excessive out-of-pocket spending, cover
a comparable number of residents, and
not increase the Federal deficit.
I would like to reiterate that this is
a misleading bill title and that H.R. 986
will restrict healthcare choices for
States.
Once again, we are using the valuable
time on the floor of the United States
House of Representatives to debate
something that will not solve the
issues of affordability in our Nation’s
healthcare system and really has no
chance of becoming law. It is unfair to
patients who are not going to the doc-
tor because, on top of their monthly
premiums, their deductible is so high
that they cannot afford the visit.
We need a comprehensive solution to
address the high patient out-of-pocket
costs in our system. This bill moves us
in the wrong direction. It will inhibit
innovation and much-needed flexibility
in our State insurance markets.
As a physician, I cannot support such
a piece of legislation, so I will urge op-
position to the rule.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR), a distin-
guished member of the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam
Speaker, I thank my colleague and
friend from Florida for yielding the
time.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the rule and the two very im-
portant bills the House of Representa-
tives will consider.
The first is H.R. 986 by my colleague,
Representative KUSTER from New
Hampshire, that will work to protect
our neighbors who have preexisting
health conditions, like cancer or heart
disease.
Unfortunately, the Trump adminis-
tration is trying to weaken those pro-
tections. They are doing so in the
courts and through Congress. So it is
very important that the House of Rep-
resentatives pass into law protections
for our neighbors with preexisting con-
ditions.
In fact, the name of the bill is ‘‘Pro-
tecting Americans with Preexisting
Conditions Act.’’ Passing this bill will
help keep healthcare accessible and af-
fordable for all Americans.
The second bill is also very impor-
tant, H.R. 2157. It provides about $17
billion in disaster relief to Americans
who need it, who have suffered through
horrendous natural disasters.
It was October 10, 2018, when Florida
took a direct hit from Hurricane Mi-
chael. It was one of the most powerful
storms to make landfall in the United
States. It slammed into the panhandle
and caused tremendous damage and de-
struction.
To help meet disaster needs, the
House of Representatives, the Demo-
cratic-led House, one of the first bills
we passed was a disaster relief package
on January 16, 2019. It passed by a wide
margin with a bipartisan vote. Unfor-
tunately, it ran into opposition from
the Senate and the White House.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues now to come back together in a
bipartisan way and use this bill to
break the logjam in the Senate and
keep the focus on our fellow Americans
who need disaster assistance.
Disaster relief used to be bipartisan.
We need to return to those days and
pass it in a timely manner.
b 1245
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, just
a point of clarification. While our last
vote was just after 2 p.m. yesterday,
the House actually adjourned a little
after 3 p.m. I did want to make that
correction.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
MEUSER).
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to speak against H.R. 986.
I think everyone in this Chamber can
agree that individuals with preexisting
conditions should be protected and
that the American people should have
access to affordable and quality
healthcare. This bill falls short of
achieving, or even making progress to-
wards, these important goals.
This bill showcases a fundamental
misunderstanding of section 1332 waiv-
ers, which allow States to pursue more
creative and innovative strategies to
provide their residents with access to
high-quality health insurance. This bill
actually rolls back the ability of
States to innovate lower costs and ex-
pand coverage options for patients and
families.
Additionally, this bill is disingenuous
in suggesting that it is protecting indi-
viduals with preexisting conditions
when section 1332 waivers already re-
quire States to do so. Rather than call-
ing this the ‘‘Protecting Americans
with Preexisting Conditions Act,’’ this
bill would be more appropriately
named the ‘‘Don’t Let States Innovate
Act.’’
Not surprisingly, this bill also ne-
glects to address the grievous short-
comings of ObamaCare.
In my district, not a day goes by that
I don’t hear from constituents about
the untenable costs of ObamaCare. It is
no secret that ObamaCare has led to
skyrocketing premiums and
deductibles, offering anything but af-
fordable care to the American people.
However, the data clearly shows that
States using section 1332 waivers to
create their own reinsurance programs
saw premiums drop by an average of
nearly 20 percent.
We must make our country’s
healthcare system work better by sup-
porting choice, access, and afford-
ability. This bill forces our country on
a pathway towards one size fits all, Big
Government-centered healthcare. And
this Democrat vision of a top-down
healthcare system is one that I abso-
lutely cannot support.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule and
the underlying bill.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentlewoman from Florida
for yielding, and I thank her for her
leadership.
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple will insist that this legislation
passes. My Republican friends, since
my time in helping to pass the Afford-
able Care Act, have never offered a
plan to ensure that America’s wonder-
ful citizens have good healthcare and
that those with preexisting conditions,
such as many of us, including myself
and many of my constituents in Hous-
ton, Texas, are able to access
healthcare.
Let me be clear on what this legisla-
tion does, as I thank Representative
KUSTER for her leadership.
H.R. 986, of which I am strongly in
support of, is a saving grace. What it
does is it stops the Trump administra-
tion in their tracks from watering
down an opportunity of flexibility, sec-
tion 1332.
Here is what is going to happen if we
do not pass this legislation:
We will stop the coverage of pre-
existing conditions, period;
There will be no protections;
You will see a rise in costs in
healthcare;
Short-term plans will be thrown to
the people and other plans that will de-
stabilize the risk pool;
It will limit access to comprehensive
coverage because the Trump guidance
says: Just give access and don’t worry
about if the plan even allows you to be
admitted into a hospital;
And finally, it will reduce benefits
like maternity coverage, mental
healthcare, and coverage of prescrip-
tion drugs.
Is that what Americans want?
Every day, in my district, I am see-
ing people desperate for healthcare.
There has been not one proposal com-
ing here.
I rise as well to support the supple-
mental appropriations, because I have
been to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Vir-
gin Islands. We need these resources.
But I have also seen the devastation
of victims impacted by Hurricane Mi-
chael in Alabama, Florida, and Geor-
gia; the damage in Nebraska, Missouri,
South Dakota, Iowa, Kansas, and now
in Houston, 10 inches of rain and flood-
ing and more rain coming. I know that
people who were impacted by Hurri-
cane Harvey are still suffering.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3513
May 9, 2019
This particular legislation, appro-
priations, is important. It is impor-
tant, in particular, to ensure that we
add more funding and that we shore up
the infrastructure.
I submitted amendments that cov-
ered the idea of improving FEMA so
that it would stay longer and it would
have oversight to know whether it is
helping people; to increase energy serv-
ices so that we don’t black out so that
people are suffering; and to make sure
we have the right kind of water.
There are many other elements to
the appropriations bill which I hope to
debate at a later time, but this rule
should be supported.
Let me additionally go back to the
H.R. 986 legislation and indicate that
preexisting diseases cover things like
sickle cell, which 1 in 13 African Amer-
ican babies are born with; triple nega-
tive breast cancer, which is the most
deadly and causes immediate or short-
term life to White women, Black
women, Asian Pacific Islander, Amer-
ican Indian, and Alaska Native women;
diabetes; and HIV/AIDS.
This is why H.R. 986 is important,
Madam Speaker, and why the appro-
priations bill is important.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong and un-
equivocal support for the rule governing de-
bate on H.R. 986, the ‘‘Protecting Americans
With Pre-Existing Conditions Act of 2019’’ as
well as the underlying legislation and ask all
Members to join me in supporting these legis-
lative initiatives that combat the Trump Admin-
istration’s ongoing efforts to take away health
care from more than 100 million Americans
and to make health care dramatically less af-
fordable for those fortunate enough to be in-
sured.
Another reason I strongly support this rule is
that it makes in order H.R. 2157, the ‘‘Supple-
mental Appropriations Act of 2019,’’ which pro-
vides much needed and long overdue relief to
Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands still suffering from the ravages of Hur-
ricanes Maria and Irma, as well as relief to
victims of Hurricane Michael which struck Ala-
bama, Florida, and Georgia in October 2018
and to the victims of the Midwestern floods
that have caused so much damage in Ne-
braska, Missouri, South Dakota, Iowa, and
Kansas.
H.R. 986, rescinds this damaging, dan-
gerous guidance immediately, and reinforces
the ACA’s vital protections for people with pre-
existing conditions.
It also prevents the Secretaries of HHS and
Treasury from promulgating any substantially
similar guidance or rule in the future.
Section 1332 of the State Innovation Waiv-
ers included in the ACA has a clear statutory
directive that states must maintain the level of
benefits, affordability, and coverage provided
to state residents by the ACA.
This Administration’s 2018 Guidance allows
states to simply demonstrate that a com-
parable number of residents will have access
to comprehensive and affordable coverage, re-
gardless of whether they actually enroll in that
coverage, thereby allowing the Secretaries of
HHS and Treasury to approve waivers that do
not provide coverage that is as affordable or
as comprehensive as under the ACA.
The ‘‘Protecting Americans with Pre-Existing
Conditions Act’’ is a vital legislative measure
that emphasizes the importance of not limiting
coverage for individuals with pre-existing con-
ditions or imposing lifetime limits on access to
care.
Predatory practices such as this will prove
to be devastating to communities across the
nation, many of which, who will be affected
are disproportionately communities of color.
The people receiving the life-sustaining
medical protections under this provision will be
cast aside and left with no way to cover the
exorbitant healthcare costs that would other-
wise be covered in through the Affordable
Care Act.
Relenting on this protection will put a great
number of my constituents and various com-
munities across the nation at terrible risk.
Specifically, in the 18th Congressional Dis-
trict many of my constituents are
disproportionally affected by several pre-exist-
ing conditions such as:
Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) affects approxi-
mately 100,000 Americans and occurs among
about 1 out of every 365 Black or African-
American births.
SCD occurs among about 1 out of every
16,300 Hispanic-American births.
And 1 in 13 Black or African-American ba-
bies is born with sickle cell trait (SCT).
During 2005, medical expenditures for chil-
dren with SCD averaged $11,702 for children
with Medicaid coverage and $14,772 for chil-
dren with employer-sponsored insurance.
About 40 percent of both groups had at
least one hospital stay.
The most common cancer in women, no
matter your race or ethnicity.
The most common cause of death from can-
cer among Hispanic women.
The second most common cause of death
from cancer among white, Black, Asian/Pacific
Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native
women.
Diabetes is at an all-time high in the U.S.
and continues to increase exponentially every
year.
The CDC’s Division of Diabetes Translation
states that over 30 million Americans are living
with Diabetes, over a quarter undiagnosed.
This trend continues in the state of Texas,
where Diabetes is the 6th leading cause of
death.
Nearly 12 percent of Texas is living with di-
agnosed Diabetes.
According to a collaboration report between
the nonprofit Texas Health Institute, the State
Demographer’s Office and Methodist
Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, one in
three adult Texans are either diagnosed with
diabetes, have diabetes but have not yet been
diagnosed, or are at high risk for developing
the disease within a decade.
Approximately 1.1 million people in the U.S.
are living with HIV today.
About 15 percent of them (1 in 7) are un-
aware they are infected.
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) esti-
mates that the decline in HIV infections has
plateaued because effective HIV prevention
and treatment are not adequately reaching
those who could most benefit from them.
These gaps remain particularly troublesome
in rural areas and in the South and among
disproportionately affected populations like
blacks/African Americans and Hispanics/
Latinos.
The overall prevalence of CKD in the gen-
eral population is approximately 14 percent.
High blood pressure and diabetes are the
main causes of CKD.
Almost half of individuals with CKD also
have diabetes and/or self-reported cardio-
vascular disease (CVD).
More than 661,000 Americans have kidney
failure. Of these, 468,000 individuals are on
dialysis, and roughly 193,000 live with a func-
tioning kidney transplant.
Kidney disease often has no symptoms in
its early stages and can go undetected until it
is very advanced.
For this reason, kidney disease is often re-
ferred to as a ‘‘silent disease.’’
What is also concerning is the over-
whelming number of constituents plagued by
these diseases, are people of color, African
American, Latino, and Native American.
H.R. 986 stopped the Trump Administration
in its tracks from taking away health care from
vulnerable Americans.
Madam Speaker, the Trump administration
cannot be trusted to act in the best interests
of the American people that is why I offered
two amendments to H.R. 986, which would ex-
tend the prohibitions of the bill to (1) ban life-
time limits with respect to persons with pre-
existing conditions and (2) prevent the Secre-
taries from taking any action that would re-
duce the affordability of comprehensive cov-
erage for children under 26 with pre-existing
conditions who are covered under their par-
ents’ policies.
I will soon be introducing legislation that will
achieve these important objectives and protect
vulnerable Americans from an uncaring Ad-
ministration that is unceasing in its efforts to
take away health care from vulnerable Ameri-
cans.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2157, the ‘‘Supple-
mental Appropriations Act of 2019,’’ provides
much needed and long overdue relief to Amer-
icans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands still suffering from the ravages of Hurri-
canes Maria and Irma, as well as relief to vic-
tims of Hurricane Michael which struck Ala-
bama, Florida, and Georgia in October 2018
and to the victims of the Midwestern floods.
I support this legislation and offered an
amendment that would have provided addi-
tional funding for electricity delivery and nec-
essary expenses related to the consequences
of Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, Irma, and Super
Typhoon Yutu including technical assistance
related to electric grids.
As the representative of the Eighteenth
Congressional District of Texas, which was
ground zero for Hurricane Harvey, I regularly
hear from constituents expressing their con-
cern with ineffective and inadequate FEMA
mechanisms put in place to help rectify the
damage caused by natural disasters.
That is why I also offered an amendment to
H.R. 2157 that would prohibit funds in the bill
from being used to prevent the FEMA Admin-
istrator from monitoring the response given to
disaster victims in order to ensure quality con-
trol or becoming aware of complaints regard-
ing the response given to disaster victims and
having in place a mechanism to address such
complaints.
A third Jackson Lee amendment to H.R.
2157 would have provided a minimum of $1
million for wastewater and drinking water treat-
ment works and facilities impacted by Hurri-
canes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
Hurricane Sandy inflicted more than $70 bil-
lion in damages in 2012, and Matthew cost

the U.S. about $10.3 billion in 2016. With Har-
vey, an estimated 13 million people were af-
fected, nearly 135,000 homes damaged or de-
stroyed in the historic flooding, and up to a
million cars were wrecked.
Hurricane Harvey ranks as the second-most
costly hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since
1900, causing more than $125 billion in dam-
age.
Our residents need more money than for
single-family home repairs, whether it is dis-
aster recovery or general housing dollars and
I will continue to stride on behalf of the neigh-
borhoods and on behalf of hard-working
homeowners who deserve these funds, so
they can continue on with their lives and re-
turn to their homes.
Victims of natural disasters are entitled to
know who to contact when issues related to
FEMA arise and to be assured that their ques-
tions are answered, and complaints ad-
dressed.
Allocating funding for measures such as
Electricity Delivery for necessary expenses re-
lated to the consequences of Hurricanes Har-
vey, Maria, Irma, and Super Typhoon Yutu, is
vital to negate the effects of these catastrophic
events from significantly worsening.
Hospitals, first-responders, and a number of
other vital institutions that help our commu-
nities recover from the after-effects of natural
disasters need access to electricity.
Moreover, with the severity of natural disas-
ters and the ranging of their locations we must
be proactive in our preparation for recovery.
Alternatively, water is the most essential re-
course known to man.
A human can go for more than three weeks
without food—Mahatma Gandhi survived 21
days of complete starvation—but water is a
different story.
At least 60 percent of the adult body is
made of it and every living cell in the body
needs it to keep functioning.
Under extreme conditions an adult can lose
1 to 1.5 liters of sweat per hour and if that lost
water is not replaced, the total volume of body
fluid can fall quickly and, most dangerously,
blood volume may drop.
We do not have the luxury of not preparing
for hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, mudslides,
tornados or other natural disasters.
With these events it is not a question of if,
but when.
For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to
support the rule and the underlying legislation.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself 30 seconds to respond be-
fore I yield to the gentleman from
Iowa.
Madam Speaker, last Congress passed
the first comprehensive, stand-alone
sickle cell bill for as long as I can re-
member. There was a partial reauthor-
ization in 2004, signed by President
Bush, that was part of a tax bill.
But DANNY DAVIS’ bill passed through
our committee, passed through the
Senate, and passed on the floor of the
House in the previous Congress last
year; and as a consequence, for the
first time in four decades, new sickle
cell therapies are coming through the
National Institutes of Health.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING).
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I
appreciate the gentleman from Texas
yielding to me.
Madam Speaker, I came to the floor
to highlight the disasters that we have
in the Midwest.
I recall back in 2011 when the Mis-
souri River was 11 miles wide at its
widest and 5 to 6 miles wide most ev-
erywhere else, all the way through
Iowa and down across Missouri. It was
a secret flood because you couldn’t
drive there. You had to fly over to see
it.
We have some of these similar cir-
cumstances this spring, although it has
gotten a little more of the press. We
had more water come down below Gav-
ins Point than ever before. It wiped out
a lot of ag land on the Iowa side and
more so, even, on the Nebraska side.
We have critical infrastructure that
has got to be reconstructed. We have
got to protect some of these commu-
nities that have been nearly wiped out.
This Corps of Engineers, in particular,
has 41 breaches on the levees just on
the Iowa side of the river.
I urge that we get to a conclusion
and adoption of a final package on this
disaster relief.
But I would point out, Madam Speak-
er, that this message from the White
House said that Congress should not
use natural disasters as a pretext to
engage in unnecessary spending outside
the agreed upon discretionary spending
caps.
I am hopeful that this gets worked
out between the House and the Senate.
We need the relief, and we need it very
soon.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I happen to live and be in the area of
the Texas Children’s Hospital. I have
obviously supported the legislation of
DANNY DAVIS.
The point is that people with pre-
existing conditions, including sickle
cell, will not have access to healthcare
under the Trump guidance.
I am standing here not about the re-
search, which is certainly beneficial,
but about the fact that I am standing
for those with sickle cell, which is a
preexisting condition, to not be
blocked from having good healthcare.
That is why I rise to support H.R. 986,
in order to ensure access to healthcare
and not stopping preexisting conditions
from being covered.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Mexico (Mr. LUJÁN), the Assistant
Speaker.
Mr. LUJÁN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to support the rule because, for
the past 2 years, the Trump adminis-
tration has relentlessly sabotaged the
Affordable Care Act and attacked my
constituents’ access to care.
My Republican colleagues use a lot of
smoke and mirrors to talk about these
plans, so today I want to read straight
from the Texas Department of Insur-
ance website, texas.gov. This page is ti-
tled: ‘‘What You Need to Know About
Short-Term Health Insurance.’’
Right there, the Texas Department of
Insurance says: ‘‘Know what the plan
covers. It is important to ask what’s
covered and what’s not. For example,
short-term plans might not cover
emergency care, maternity care, pre-
scriptions, or certain other services.
They might not cover care for acci-
dents or health issues.’’
Listen closely to this: ‘‘These plans
also do not have to cover preexisting
conditions. If a company sells you a
plan, it may deny a claim if it deter-
mines you had a related condition in
the past.’’
There it is in black and white on the
Texas Department of Insurance
website. These Trump junk plans dis-
criminate against people with pre-
existing conditions.
Let me continue, because it gets bet-
ter, to the third point, ‘‘Other costs.’’
Here the State of Texas specifies that
‘‘short-term health plans often have
lower premiums, but other costs may
be higher.’’
Let me translate. These Trump junk
plans might be cheaper for us up front,
but you will pay more money for less
coverage on the back end.
That is why, today, I stand proudly
with my Democratic colleagues for
standing up to the Trump administra-
tion’s harmful policies and for acting
to protect healthcare for the 50 percent
of Americans who have a preexisting
health condition.
The Trump administration’s destruc-
tive policies will force the American
people to pay more money for less cov-
erage. If you don’t believe me, just go
to the website yourself. This is unac-
ceptable.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and
‘‘yes’’ on ANN KUSTER’s bill, H.R. 986.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself 2 minutes for the purposes
of a response.
First of all, I am grateful that the
Texas Department of Insurance does
provide that disclosure and trans-
parency. That is a good thing. In fact,
Chairwoman ESHOO, the chairwoman of
the Health Subcommittee, when we
were hearing bills on limited-duration
plans, actually had a bill that would
require such disclosure. For whatever
reason, it was pulled from the markup
that we had that day. I was perfectly
prepared to support it, but, again, for
whatever reason, the chairman of the
committee pulled the bill and we did
not get to have that debate or markup.
I also need to point out that our dis-
cussion today is not on limited-dura-
tion plans. I rather expect that there
will be an opportunity to debate lim-
ited-duration plans. It may come up as
early as next week, and I look forward
to that debate. But it is also important
to point out that these plans in Texas
were permitted under the previous ad-
ministration for the duration of 1 year.
So, again, the State commissioner of
insurance is exactly right. He put those
caveats up there so people can know
what they are purchasing. I do believe

that is important. I think that is an
important aspect of the job of the
Texas Commission of Insurance. I wish
other State commissioners of insur-
ance would behave in a similar fashion.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT), a distinguished
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee.
b 1300
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker,
after so many failed attempts to repeal
our access to healthcare, Trump and
his Republican cohorts are finding new
ways to take away coverage from mil-
lions of Americans who suffer with pre-
existing conditions.
Now, Republicans have hijacked the
mechanism that was designed to pro-
mote State healthcare innovation to
subvert that very innovation.
What they call ‘‘innovation’’ is find-
ing new ways to destroy protections for
preexisting conditions and to promote
junk insurance plans that cover—well,
they cover what you don’t need most.
If you really need it, if it is for your
medical condition, they are unlikely to
cover it.
How outrageous.
A waiver of Federal regulations de-
signed to encourage innovation that
just waves goodbye to the safeguards
that an estimated 40 percent of Texans
with preexisting conditions really
need.
So, while Trump continues to hide
his tax returns, he cannot hide the fact
that he is sabotaging the healthcare
protections for millions of Americans.
After bankrupting his own businesses
and leaving creditors at a loss for dec-
ades, Trump would bankrupt families
with serious medical needs.
And it is almost a joke that he tells
us he’s got a great plan to solve all of
our healthcare needs—he said it again
at the White House this morning—but
he is going to wait until after the next
election to show us what his secret
plan is, which sounds a lot like the
failed plan that he advocated in the
last election.
Let’s just pass this bill and tear down
the wall that Trump and his cohorts
want to build between too many Amer-
icans and their doctors.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself 2 minutes.
Madam Speaker, I want everyone to
be clear here. This bill today is actu-
ally repealing part of the Affordable
Care Act.
Look, I didn’t vote for the Affordable
Healthcare Act. I argued against it,
passionately—articulately, I might
add—but what does the Affordable Care
Act say?
Well, it describes the object of to-
day’s legislation, the so-called section
1332 waiver.
Section 1332 is a section of the Af-
fordable Care Act. And section 1332 is
titled ‘‘Waiver for State Innovation. In
general, a state may apply to the sec-
retary for the waiver of all or any re-
quirements described.’’
And this is interesting. ‘‘With respect
to health insurance coverage within
that State for plan years beginning on
or after January 1, 2017.’’
The way the law was written, none of
these waivers were given during the
years that President Obama was Presi-
dent.
They only became eligible—the Sec-
retary only became able to provide
these waivers January 1, 2017, which
was the last 3 weeks of President
Obama’s administration.
So when people say, the comparison
between the waivers given in the
Obama years and the waivers given in
the Trump years are vastly different,
well, it is true because no waivers were
available prior to January 1, 2017.
Look, the Secretary of Health and
Human Services has heard the angst
that people have trying to deal with
the high premiums—premiums, $600,
$700, $800 a month for an individual, a
deductible of $6,000 to $7,000, and the
coinsurance, which runs the bills up so
that their annual out-of-pocket costs
may be somewhere between $10,000 and
$20,000.
Many people point out to me, they
spend more for health insurance—not
using anything, but just for the insur-
ance—than they spend for their mort-
gage payment—not their mortgage in-
surance, but their mortgage payment.
But, please, let’s do remember, 1332 is
part of current law.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
am delighted to hear a Member of the
other party defend the Affordable Care
Act by defending 1332, the waivers.
Let me say this: We are not elimi-
nating the waivers. We are simply ob-
jecting to the guidance that was issued
by the Department of Health and
Human Services, arguing, essentially,
that it is inconsistent with the con-
gressional intent when the waivers
were created.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD a letter signed by 24 health or-
ganizations, including the Cancer Ac-
tion Network, the American Lung As-
sociation, the American Heart Associa-
tion, the Susan G. Komen Foundation,
and others, urging Members to support
H.R. 986.

Re Letter of Support from 23 Patient and
Consumer Advocacy Organizations for
H.R. 986.
Hon. ANN MCLANE KUSTER,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE KUSTER: Our 24 or-
ganizations, representing the interests of the
millions of patients and consumers who live
with serious, acute, and chronic conditions,
have worked together for many months to
ensure that patient voices are reflected in
the ongoing Congressional debate regarding
the accessibility of health coverage for all
Americans and families. Today, we write in
strong support of your legislation to protect
people with pre-existing conditions who re-
ceive coverage in the individual market-
place. The Protecting Americans with Pre-
existing Conditions Act of 2019, H.R. 986,
would require the Administration to rescind
its Section 1332 State Relief and Empower-
ment Waivers Guidance, released on October
22, 2018 (1332 guidance). We are concerned
about the impact that this guidance could
have on the people we represent and applaud
your introduction of this bill.
In March 2017, we identified three over-
arching principles to guide and measure any
work to further reform and improve the na-
tion’s health insurance system. Our core
principles are that health insurance coverage
must be adequate, affordable, and accessible.
Together, our organizations understand what
individuals and families need to prevent dis-
ease, manage health, and cure illness. Our
organizations are deeply concerned about
how the new 1332 guidance will affect the in-
dividual marketplace’s stability in states
that choose to pursue some of the policies al-
lowed under this guidance, including those
that promote short term plans and other
substandard coverage. We are pleased that
this legislation represents a significant and
meaningful step towards protecting all
Americans from coverage that does not cover
what they need to promote their health and
well-being.
As you know, the 1332 guidance substan-
tially erodes the guardrails governing cov-
erage that people with pre-existing condi-
tions such as cystic fibrosis, lung disease,
cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, rare
disorders, pregnant women, and many others
rely on in the individual marketplace. Of
particular concern, the new guidance would
allow states to let individuals use advanced
premium tax credits to purchase non-compli-
ant short-term, limited duration insurance
plans—which could further draw younger,
healthier people out of the risk pool for com-
prehensive insurance and drive up premiums
for those who need comprehensive coverage.
The guidance also eliminates protections for
vulnerable populations, such as individuals
with low incomes and those with chronic and
serious health issues, by removing the re-
quirement to safeguard those populations
under any waiver. We are deeply concerned
by this as these changes fundamentally alter
the nature of the Section 1332 waiver pro-
gram and jeopardize adequate, affordable
coverage for people with pre-existing condi-
tions in the individual market. Halting the
implementation of this guidance will protect
people with pre-existing conditions from the
repercussions of these market destabilizing
actions.
H.R. 986 represents a significant step to-
wards protecting patients and consumers.
Yet, we also recognize that there is much
more that needs to be done to improve upon
our current system of care, including mak-
ing coverage more accessible and affordable.
Up until this year, health insurance enroll-
ment has steadily increased, and, with it, the
promise of a more diverse risk pool and
greater protection for people with serious
health care needs. However, the recent rein-
terpretation of the guidelines is jeopardizing
enrollment. Shortened enrollment periods,
fewer resources for outreach and education
and less funding for consumer navigators not
only creates confusion for consumers but di-
rectly impacts the number of individuals
who enroll in Marketplace coverage. Without
Congressional action, these trends will make
it harder for many to access coverage and
will further contribute to the destabilization
of insurance markets and result in higher
premiums for many enrollees.
Making high-quality coverage and care
more affordable is also a high priority for
the people that we represent. Passage of leg-
islation that expands access to and the level

of advance premium tax credits, fixes the
family glitch, creates a nationwide reinsur-
ance program, and reduces systemic health
care costs could significantly ease the cost
burden for people of all income levels who
rely on the individual marketplace for cov-
erage. We urge Congress to support legisla-
tion that maintains the quality of coverage
while expanding access and affordability.
Again, thank you for your leadership on
this critical issue for people with pre-exist-
ing conditions. We support your efforts to
halt the implementation of the 2018 guid-
ance, ensuring the guidance from 2015 re-
mains intact and promoting stability in the
individual marketplace. We urge members of
Congress to vote for H.R. 986.

Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from the District of Columbia (Ms.
NORTON).
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I
thank my good friend for yielding.
Madam Speaker, the administra-
tion’s guidance permitting junk plans
to replace the Affordable Healthcare
Act has fooled no one, and certainly
not the millions with preexisting con-
ditions and those who now enjoy essen-
tial health benefits.
The administration’s true intent is
clear from its support, in court now, as
I speak, of a case to repeal the ACA in
its entirety, including preexisting con-
ditions.
Republicans, historically, have ini-
tially opposed virtually every form of
coverage for the American people, in-
cluding Social Security, but they have
never succeeded in withdrawing or re-
ducing benefits then in use. They will
not succeed this time.
In my own District of Columbia,
106,000 residents with preexisting con-
ditions would lose or risk losing or
being denied or charged significantly
more for health coverage.
The District, on its own, has suc-
ceeded in overcoming Republican at-
tempts to weaken the ACA and now has
reached virtually universal coverage,
in spite of a specific attempt to block
the city’s successful efforts.
The administration’s junk coverage
is particularly untenable in allowing
Federal subsidies of junk plans.
Republicans failed to overturn the
ACA when they controlled majorities
in both the House and the Senate.
Plans that the administration has put
forward to dismember the Act will not
succeed either. Because of how insur-
ance works, junk plans put all insured
at risk of paying more for insurance.
Today, we intend to expose and de-
feat the administration’s dangerous
substitution for the Affordable
Healthcare Act.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself 2 minutes for purpose of a
response.
Look, it is not the Trump Adminis-
tration that is taking money out of the
Affordable Care Act and putting it to
other purposes. It is clearly written
into the law.
And, again, I didn’t vote for this law.
I voted against it. I argued against it,
but the taking of advanced premium
tax credits, cost-sharing reductions
and small business tax credits under
Section 36(b) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 under subpart (1)—blah,
blah, blah—an alternative means by
which the aggregate amount of such
credits or reductions that would have
been paid on behalf of participants in
the exchanges established under this
title had the State not received such a
waiver, that amount shall be paid to
the State for the purposes of imple-
menting the State plan under the waiv-
er.
So it is really pretty clear in the ex-
isting language of law. It is not the
Trump Administration deviating funds,
it was congressional intent. It was
passed by this House of Representa-
tives.
Again, I didn’t vote for it. I wouldn’t
have defended it at the time. I didn’t
think it was a good idea then, probably
not the greatest idea now. But the Sec-
retary has this tool to use and he is re-
sponding to requests from people’s con-
stituents, do something about the high
cost of my insurance, the high costs
that I am required to spend in order to
protect myself against the health ca-
tastrophe.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
am prepared to close, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. ROGERS).
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas
for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to this rule. This rule dem-
onstrates, once again, that the Demo-
crat majority refuses to acknowledge,
accept, or address the very real crisis
at our southern border.
Numbers came out yesterday illus-
trating the magnitude of the crisis.
CBP detained more than 109,000 mi-
grants along the southwest border last
month alone—a 591 percent increase
compared with April of 2017.
In just the last 7 months, more than
1 percent of the total population of
Honduras and Guatemala have mi-
grated to the United States.
In total, over a half a million mi-
grants have crossed our border since
October of last year, approximately the
population of Tucson, Arizona.
Smugglers and cartels continue to
preach that now is the time to come to
the U.S. These criminal organizations
run an international smuggling organi-
zation filled with misery and abuse.
CBP has already rescued more than
2,000 migrants this fiscal year, pulling
families out of the Rio Grande River
and saving children who smugglers
have abandoned.
Migrants that survive the smugglers
often arrive in poor health, physically
exhausted, and in need of urgent med-
ical care.
The men and women of CBP are
doing the best they can to respond to
this humanitarian crisis, but they have
run out of space to safely house and
process unprecedented numbers of fam-
ily units seeking entry into the United
States.
Health and Human Services is on the
urge of running out of funds to shelter
vulnerable, unaccompanied children
that are crossing our borders at levels
50 percent higher than just last year.
Last week, the President sent Con-
gress an urgent request for supple-
mental appropriations to address this
humanitarian crisis.
Ranking Member COLLINS and I filed
an amendment to the supplemental,
which would have provided $4.5 billion
requested by the President.
It would have replenished critical
funds needed to feed and shelter mi-
grant families and unaccompanied chil-
dren, provide urgent medical care and
transportation services, and pay the
growing cost of overtime for the men
and women of DHS working on the
front lines of this crisis.
Unfortunately, the majority refused
to make our amendment in order, and
in doing so they, again, refused to take
action to address this crisis.
They stunningly refused to support
the men and women of DHS, and most
remarkably, they refused to provide
the needed assistance to thousands of
vulnerable migrants arriving at our
border on a daily basis.
The majority’s political dysfunction
is disgraceful. I urge them to work
with the President and Republicans in
Congress to immediately resolve this
humanitarian crisis.
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members
to oppose this rule.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I do
have one additional speaker.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
WOODALL), who is a valuable member of
the Rules Committee, and gave us a
stirring history lesson on the ERISA
plans and how the protection from pre-
existing conditions actually goes back
to 1996.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
hope what I am getting ready to say, it
turns out to be redundant, that we are
going to hear it in the closings of both
the gentlewoman from Florida and the
gentleman from Texas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3517
May 9, 2019
We talk about this preexisting condi-
tions’ bill today as if it is going to help
with preexisting conditions. As we
have discussed already, it is not.
But the preexisting conditions issue
is a very real issue. It is a very real
issue for families all across the coun-
try, and it has been for a long time.
And undeniably, elections were won
and lost this past cycle over a pre-
existing conditions issue based on the
misinformation around it.
I don’t know how we are advantaged
as a community by continuing to per-
petuate the misinformation. When we
first tackled preexisting conditions in
a serious way, we did it together in
this institution.
I know, because it was a gentleman
from my State, Madam Speaker,
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was sit-
ting in that chair at the time.
It was 1996. Bill Clinton was sitting
in the White House. Newt Gingrich was
sitting here leading the United States
House, and we came together, Repub-
licans and Democrats, we passed the
Health Insurance Affordability and Ac-
countability Act that abolished pre-
existing condition worries for every
single family with an ERISA-based
plan. Those are the plans that the Fed-
eral Government controls.
So what I mean, Madam Speaker, is
that for every single plan the Federal
Government had dominion over, we
eliminated preexisting conditions.
Medicare, no preexisting conditions.
Medicaid, no preexisting conditions.
ERISA plans, no preexisting condi-
tions.
Collectively, that is about 250 million
Americans.
What we didn’t do was go into the
area where the Federal Government
had no dominion, which were State-
regulated plans, and we said States
should have the ability to regulate
their own plans.
Now President Obama said, no,
States had been moving too slow to
help their constituency.
He ran on the platform of taking
those plans away from State control;
he won that debate. The Affordable
Care Act implemented those condi-
tions. And the bill today says, if states
have an idea about how to protect fam-
ilies from preexisting conditions that
is better than the one in the Affordable
Care Act, we don’t want to hear it.
b 1315
There is one solution for preexisting
conditions and it is the one that Presi-
dent Obama has implemented, no
other. I think that is wrong.
Dr. BURGESS knows more about medi-
cine than I will ever hope to know. He
knows more about serving patients
than I will ever hope to know.
Ms. SHALALA, as Secretary of Health
and Human Services, knows more
about healthcare than I will ever hope
to know. I trust these folks to find so-
lutions differently in Florida, and dif-
ferently in Texas than we do in Geor-
gia.
This bill does one thing and one
thing only. It continues the debate
from 1996, not about whether to help
people with preexisting conditions, but
about whether States have anything to
add to the discussion. I am certain the
State of Georgia does. I believe the
State of Florida does. I know the State
of Texas does.
If we defeat this rule and defeat this
bill, it will allow those very best ideas
to come out and not ideas about how to
keep people down, Madam Speaker, but
ideas about how to lift families up.
We have come together on those
issues before, Madam Speaker, and we
can do it again.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I appreciate the comments of the
gentleman from Georgia, and I have en-
joyed the opportunity of working with
him on the Rules Committee.
We are not objecting to what was
done in 1996. We are saying to the
States that they must cover pre-
existing conditions as part of a waiver,
and they cannot undermine those con-
ditions by imposing annual limits or
charging more. The problem with the
guidance is that it gives States the op-
portunity to propose cheap plans that,
in essence, undermine preexisting con-
ditions.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to move a resolution
that reinforces the Republican’s long-
held views that every American should
have preexisting condition protections.
On the opening day of the 116th Con-
gress, House Republicans brought a
measure to the floor that called on
lawmakers to legislate on locking in
protections for patients with pre-
existing conditions. Unfortunately, in
a fit of partisanship, House Democrats
blocked that effort. If Democrats were
serious, they would not object to mak-
ing a statement on behalf of the House
of Representatives that we want to
work together with the administration
to protect patients with preexisting
conditions.
Our position is simple and clear. Re-
publicans stand ready to protect those
with preexisting conditions in a man-
ner that will withstand judicial scru-
tiny, and I hope our Democratic col-
leagues will join us in that effort.
Madam Speaker, if the previous ques-
tion is defeated, House Republicans
will move to immediately consider a
resolution that maintains that no
American should have their health in-
surance taken away or lose protections
for preexisting conditions due to the
Democrats in Congress enacting an un-
constitutional law.
It would instruct Congress and the
Trump administration to ask the Su-
preme Court for a stay in the Texas v.
United States decision, should the Af-
fordable Care Act be found unconstitu-
tional.
It would instruct Congress to develop
bipartisan legislation that guarantees
that no American citizen can be denied
health insurance coverage or charged
more due to a previous illness or health
status.
It includes commonsense consumer
protections, provides more choice and
affordable coverage than the Afford-
able Care Act, lowers prescription drug
prices for patients, strengthens Medi-
care for current and future bene-
ficiaries, and rejects the Democrats’
radical one-size-fits-all, government-
run, Soviet-style, top-down healthcare
scheme that would only outlaw the em-
ployer-based coverage of more than 180
million Americans.
Madam Speaker, I suspect our Demo-
cratic colleagues will vote against con-
sidering this resolution, so I must ask:
Why are Democrats opposed to making
a statement that the goal of the House
of Representatives of the United States
is to work together to protect coverage
for patients with preexisting condi-
tions? If that is not the goal, then what
might it be?
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to insert the text of this
amendment into the RECORD, along
with extraneous material, immediately
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas?
There was no objection.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker,
again, I would reiterate that neither
bill under consideration today has a
chance of becoming law.
While I support funding for disaster
relief, the Democrats chose not to ne-
gotiate with the Senate and included
controversial positions.
As a result, we would likely be con-
sidering a disaster relief bill yet an-
other time, and our hard-hit commu-
nities will continue to struggle without
relief.
Once again, despite the title of H.R.
986, this bill will have no impact on
protections for preexisting conditions
for Americans with those conditions. It
will simply overturn a regulation—
overturns part of ObamaCare—it over-
turns a regulation that allows States
to innovate in the Affordable Care Act
marketplace, and that provides flexi-
bility and consumer choice to
healthcare consumers.
House Republicans continue to sup-
port preexisting conditions protections
and have offered solutions to give pa-
tients this assurance. Republicans
stand ready to work with Democrats in
a bipartisan manner to pass these pro-
tections into law and also provide des-
perately needed disaster relief.
I look forward to when we can all
gather around the negotiating table. I
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous ques-
tion, a ‘‘no’’ vote on the underlying
measures, and I yield back the balance
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3518 May 9, 2019
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
It was only 10 years ago that people
who lacked employer-provided insur-
ance and had preexisting conditions
could not find health insurance in
many parts of this country, and those
who could find health insurance, too
often found that their plans were not
comprehensive. They might not cover
the type of cancer some buyers pre-
viously had, or they might have an an-
nual or even a lifetime cap on cov-
erage.
It was 2 years ago that this body
passed a bill that stripped those protec-
tions, a bill that would make com-
prehensive health insurance out of
reach for many Americans. Thanks to
a courageous few, that bill did not be-
come law.
Now that the administration has lost
that battle to destroy the Affordable
Care Act, they are trying to do it
through guidance and through law-
suits.
H.R. 986 prevents the administration
from enforcing guidance that would
allow States to use taxpayer money to
sell subpar health plans on the ex-
change.
The administration is taking the 1332
waivers, which are designed to allow
States flexibility to lower health insur-
ance costs, like through reinsurance,
and using it to take away important
consumer protections. The 1332 waiver
requires high-quality, affordable health
insurance while retaining the basic
protections of the Affordable Care Act.
As the American Cancer Society
notes: This administration guidance
tips the scales in favor of insurance
products that are inadequate to meet
the needs of millions of Americans
with preexisting conditions.
Madam Speaker, I also support H.R.
2157, which provides disaster assistance
to communities from every nook and
corner of this country who are waiting
for our help.
When disaster hits this country, we
come together and support each other.
When tornados, and floods, and hurri-
canes strike, we help people quickly. It
is an embarrassment that a disaster
bill has not yet made it to the Presi-
dent’s desk in this Congress.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
on the rule.
The text of the material previously
referred to by Mr. BURGESS is as fol-
lows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 357
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this
resolution, the House shall proceed to the
consideration in the House of the resolution
(H. Res. 280), protecting the health care of all
Americans, especially those with preexisting
conditions. The resolution shall be consid-
ered as read. The previous question shall be
considered as ordered on the resolution to
adoption without intervening motion or de-
mand for division of the question except one
hour of debate equally divided and controlled
by the chair and ranking minority member
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the
consideration of House Resolution 280.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time, and
I move the previous question on the
resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3520 May 9, 2019
administration continues to take ac-
tions that undermine the healthcare of
millions of Americans, including the
more than 133 million people with pre-
existing conditions.
Today, we are here because of the
Trump administration’s proposed guid-
ance last October that would allow
States to expand and prop up short-
term junk insurance plans, even pro-
viding taxpayer subsidies for those
plans. In order to take this action, the
administration blatantly ignored the
plain text of the Affordable Care Act
and gutted standards that States must
meet in order to test insurance re-
forms.
I believe the administration’s action
is illegal, but, sadly, this administra-
tion has never let the law get in the
way of its goals. These efforts will,
without a doubt, seriously undermine
the health coverage of Americans with
preexisting conditions.
A coalition of 24 national groups rep-
resenting millions of Americans with
preexisting conditions, including the
American Cancer Society Cancer Ac-
tion Network, the American Heart As-
sociation, and the American Diabetes
Association, wrote a letter in strong
support of H.R. 986, stating: ‘‘The 1332
guidance substantially erodes the
guardrails governing coverage that
people with preexisting conditions such
as cystic fibrosis, lung disease, cancer,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, rare
disorders, pregnant women, and many
others rely on in the individual mar-
ketplace.’’
The patient organizations go on to
say that ‘‘these changes fundamentally
alter the nature of the section 1332
waiver program and jeopardize ade-
quate, affordable coverage for people
with preexisting conditions in the indi-
vidual market. Halting the implemen-
tation of this guidance will protect
people with preexisting conditions.’’
Mr. Chairman, by encouraging States
to promote and expand short-term in-
surance plans, the administration is
giving insurers the green light to di-
rectly discriminate against people with
preexisting conditions; it is giving the
green light to these plans to charge
people with preexisting conditions
more money; and it is giving these
plans the green light to refuse to cover
any treatment that is related to some-
one’s preexisting condition.
The expansion of these junk plans
will also undermine the insurance mar-
ket, leading to higher premiums for
people with preexisting conditions who
need comprehensive coverage. This is
not the way you protect people with
preexisting conditions.
The Trump administration’s guid-
ance also undermines the ACA’s prom-
ise of coverage of essential health ben-
efits. The American people should not
have to worry about whether their in-
surance plan covers prescription drugs,
maternity and newborn care, mental
health and substance use disorder serv-
ices.
This guidance is also bad news for
older Americans who could be charged
a lot more for their insurance than
what is allowed by the ACA.
In a nutshell, Mr. Chairman, this
guidance is bad news for any American
who wants access to quality and afford-
able health coverage that is there for
them when they need it. Junk plans
are just that—they are junk.
People shouldn’t have to read the
fine print to see what is and is not cov-
ered, and that is the hallmark of the
Affordable Care Act. So that is why we
must rescind the guidance.
I want to commend my colleague,
Ms. KUSTER, for her great work on this
important bill.
I do want to emphasize that H.R. 986
would not do anything to interfere
with existing 1332 reinsurance waivers,
which have bipartisan support and
began under the Obama administra-
tion. My Republican colleagues con-
tinue to intentionally conflate these
reinsurance waivers with the Trump
administration’s new 1332 waiver guid-
ance from October of last year. H.R. 986
does not affect these reinsurance waiv-
ers.
I am disappointed that my Repub-
lican colleagues continue to make
these arguments, but the bad faith is
not surprising, given their terrible
record on protecting people with pre-
existing conditions.
Mr. Chairman, this bill is necessary
because of the ongoing assault by the
Trump administration on our
healthcare system. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in standing up for
people with preexisting conditions and
standing up for people who want access
to affordable and quality healthcare.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS,
Washington, DC, May 8, 2019.
Hon. FRANK PALLONE,
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: I am writing
with respect to H.R. 986, Protecting Ameri-
cans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019.
As a result of you having consulted with us
on provisions that fall within our rule X ju-
risdiction, and in recognition of the desire to
expedite consideration of the measure, the
Committee on Ways and Means agrees to
waive formal consideration of H.R. 986.
The Committee on Ways and Means takes
this action with the mutual understanding
that we do not waive any jurisdiction over
the subject matter contained in this or simi-
lar legislation, and the Committee will be
appropriately consulted and involved as the
bill or similar legislation moves forward so
that we may address any remaining issues
within our jurisdiction. The Committee also
reserves the right to seek appointment of an
appropriate number of conferees to any
House-Senate conference involving this or
similar legislation.
Finally, I would appreciate your response
to this letter confirming this understanding,
and would ask that a copy of our exchange of
letter on this matter be included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration
of H.R. 986.
Sincerely,
RICHARD E. NEAL,
Chairman.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE,
Washington, DC, May 9, 2019.
Hon. RICHARD E. NEAL,
Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN NEAL: Thank you for con-
sulting with the Committee on Energy and
Commerce and agreeing to discharge H.R.
986, Protecting Americans with Preexisting
Conditions Act of 2019 from further consider-
ation, so that the bill may proceed expedi-
tiously to the House floor.
I agree that your forgoing further action
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation
in the future. I would support your effort to
seek appointment of an appropriate number
of conferees from your committee to any
House-Senate conference on this legislation.
I will ensure our letters on H.R. 986 are en-
tered into the Congressional Record during
floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate
your cooperation regarding this legislation
and look forward to continuing to work to-
gether as this measure moves through the
legislative process.
Sincerely,
FRANK PALLONE, JR.,
Chairman.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today to call out
the mischaracterization of H.R. 986.
The misleading title of this bill con-
firms the Democratic majority’s posi-
tion to score political points instead of
governing. They claim their agenda is
‘‘for the people.’’ Well, this bill is ‘‘for
the politics.’’
So let me be clear. This bill has noth-
ing to do with protecting Americans
with preexisting conditions. This bill
has everything to do with eliminating
healthcare options that would be af-
fordable for Americans who can’t af-
ford health insurance today and
choices for States.
Section 1332 waivers were first en-
acted under ObamaCare to provide
States the opportunity to innovate and
to provide their residents with afford-
able health insurance options. The
Trump administration has simply up-
dated the guidance for these 1332
ObamaCare waivers to make it easier
for a State’s plan to be approved.
This guidance does not—I repeat,
does not—permit the Secretary to
waive preexisting condition protec-
tions.
But, don’t take my word for it alone.
CMS Administrator Seema Verma con-
firmed it yesterday, in writing. ‘‘To be
very clear, the 2018 guidance does noth-
ing to erode PPACA’s preexisting con-
dition provisions, which cannot be
waived under section 1332,’’ wrote Ad-
ministrator Verma.
b 1415
She went on to explain: ‘‘Section 1332
does not permit States to waive Public
Health Service Act requirements such
as guaranteed availability and renew-
ability of health insurance, the prohi-
bition on using health status to vary
premiums, and the prohibition on pre-
existing conditions exclusions. Fur-
thermore, a section 1332 waiver cannot

be approved that might otherwise un-
dermine these requirements. This ad-
ministration stands committed to pro-
tecting people with preexisting condi-
tions.’’ Seema Verma, she is the Ad-
ministrator.
It is not just Administrator Verma. I
want to quote from the Trump admin-
istration statement of policy. ‘‘If H.R.
986 were presented to the President, his
advisers would recommend that he veto
it,’’ wrote the Trump administration in
its ‘‘Statement of Administration Pol-
icy.’’
It goes on to say: ‘‘The President has
repeatedly made clear that this admin-
istration will protect people with pre-
existing conditions. The 2018 guidance
in no way alters the guardrails in place
for those with preexisting conditions,
and it would not allow the administra-
tion to waive the requirements in place
around preexisting conditions. The
title of this legislation gives the mis-
leading impression that it will enhance
healthcare protections for Americans
with preexisting conditions.’’
Put simply, Mr. Chair, this cynically
titled messaging bill is all about scor-
ing political points and not legislating,
which is what we should be doing.
You see, if Democratic Members ac-
tually cared about protecting individ-
uals living with preexisting conditions,
they would govern and lock in these
important safeguards. Since Demo-
cratic leaders chose to put politics
first, I offered an amendment to pro-
tect patients with preexisting condi-
tions, to lock that into law.
Mr. Chair, this amendment wasn’t
presented to the House for a vote. In
fact, it was never allowed out of the
Rules Committee. That is a shame be-
cause we could be voting on it today. I
have tried to bring that vote to the
floor on numerous occasions, and I
have been denied by the Democratic
majority.
My bill is simple. It provides guaran-
teed issue and renewability, a ban on
health status underwriting, and a ban
on benefits exclusions, real preexisting
condition protections Democratic
Members say they support.
Guess what? It is titled the ‘‘Pre-ex-
isting Conditions Protection Act.’’ How
ironic, except my bill does what the
title says.
Let’s vote on that bill, Mr. Chair.
Here is what it comes down to. The
status quo is not working for many
Americans. Healthcare costs are out of
control. Patients and families are
struggling to pay ever-increasing pre-
miums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket
costs.
There is work that we are doing. I
just came from a meeting with the
President of the United States in the
Roosevelt Room talking about surprise
billing. We are going to work together,
Mr. PALLONE and I and others, to draft
legislation to prevent that, to protect
consumers.
We could do more here today than
what this bill alleges to do. Repub-
licans want to work toward healthcare
solutions that will decrease costs, in-
crease access, protect individuals with
preexisting conditions, make the
healthcare system work better for fam-
ilies and for patients, and actually be
affordable.
We want to let our States innovate.
These section 1332 waivers—originally,
again, put forward under President
Obama—known as State innovation
waivers, they are working, Mr. Chair.
Premiums have gone down in seven
States by an average of 20 percent,
down 20 percent.
In my home State of Oregon, we have
been a real innovator for decades in the
space of healthcare coverage and ac-
cess and trying to get prices down. Our
premiums, under this 1332 waiver that
Oregon has, have gone down 6 percent
in 2018, down 6 percent thanks to a
State innovation waiver.
These waivers could work. States
want to innovate. They care about
their people and want to bring down
costs. Instead of allowing more and
more States to innovate and lower
their healthcare costs, unfortunately,
Democrats are of the mindset that
Washington knows best, not our
States. States can’t be trusted, appar-
ently. They want to limit the ability of
States to innovate on behalf of their
citizens.
This type of top-down, command-and-
control, government-knows-best ap-
proach is what leads to policies like
the Democrats’ ultimate goal of a one-
size-fits-all government takeover of
healthcare.
A vote in support of their bill is a
vote against innovation, lowering
costs, my colleagues’ constituents,
State legislatures, Governors, State in-
surance commissioners, on and on and
on. That is what my colleagues are
doing if they vote for this.
A vote against the bill is actually a
vote for the people.
Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues
to oppose this partisan gimmick, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from New
Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER), the sponsor
of the bill.
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Chair, I thank Chairman PALLONE for
yielding, and I thank him for his guid-
ance and leadership on the Energy and
Commerce Committee as we advanced
critical legislation this week to sta-
bilize the Affordable Care Act and drive
down prescription drug costs for all
Americans.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of
my legislation, H.R. 986, the Protecting
Americans With Preexisting Condi-
tions Act.
As a patient with a preexisting condi-
tion myself, I rise today to stand with
over 52 million Americans and over
200,000 Granite Staters who live with
preexisting conditions every single
day. They could have been denied ac-
cess to healthcare prior to passage of
the Affordable Care Act, and many
were.
While we recognize that we need to
strengthen and stabilize the ACA, we
should equally accept the principle
that nobody should be denied coverage
because of a preexisting condition.
When you think about it, asthma, al-
lergies, Alzheimer’s, cancer, diabetes,
just go right through the alphabet,
having a child, even, any of these are
preexisting conditions. In my home
State of New Hampshire and across
this country, opioid and alcohol addic-
tion are preexisting conditions.
Every week, and again here today, we
have heard Republicans on the House
Energy and Commerce Committee say,
‘‘Oh, of course we want to protect
Americans with preexisting condi-
tions.’’ Yet, at every step, this admin-
istration is trying to sabotage the con-
sumer protection guardrails that are in
the ACA, including fighting in court
for the total elimination of the Afford-
able Care Act with absolutely no re-
placement.
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield the
gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Chair, an important piece of the Af-
fordable Care Act, section 1332, created
the State innovation waivers, which
provide States with flexibility in im-
plementing the ACA as long as plans
remain comprehensive, affordable, and
accessible. However, the Trump admin-
istration recently issued guidance en-
couraging States to promote junk
health plans through these waivers in
order to circumvent essential health
benefits and protections for preexisting
conditions.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. WALBERG), a very important
member of our Energy and Commerce
Committee.
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chair, I thank
the lead Republican for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition
to H.R. 986. I would give its titled
name, but it is yet another misleading
effort that has nothing to do with the
title of the bill.
House Republicans fully support pro-
tections—and I will make it clear—for
patients with preexisting conditions.
I know that my Democratic col-
leagues and friends want to continue
using the mantra that works so well
politically without fact, truth, or re-
ality during the election. We have gone
beyond that now.
Republicans support protections for
patients with preexisting conditions.
These patients deserve peace of mind
and safeguards from being treated un-
fairly. That has always been a priority
of ours, and it will continue to be, but
that is not what the bill before us
today would do.
H.R. 986 can be summed up in 3
words: Washington knows best. The bill
eliminates flexibility at the State
level, taking away options for States

to innovate and bring down healthcare
premiums.
The high and rising cost of
healthcare is a significant concern for
patients and families in my district.
We need to focus on solutions, not poli-
tics. We need to focus on solutions to
provide relief from increasing costs,
encourage choice and competition, ex-
pand access to quality care, and main-
tain—and I will make it very clear here
again—important protections for pa-
tients with preexisting conditions.
We have the ideas to do that. We
have the amendments that would put
that forward and make this bill some-
thing important to people with pre-
existing conditions, but that is not
being allowed today.
Let’s stop playing political games
with a bill title and a title like this
and, instead, focus on patient-centered
solutions.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Col-
orado (Ms. DEGETTE), who chairs our
Oversight and Investigations Sub-
committee.
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, I thank
Chairman PALLONE for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of
the Protecting Americans with Pre-
existing Conditions Act.
Frankly, if my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle were so firm in
their commitment to protecting Amer-
icans with preexisting conditions, they
would support this bill, because all it
says is that section 1332 will not stop
the protections that we have under
current law.
The Trump administration guidance
that allows States to undermine the
preexisting condition provisions of the
ACA is, frankly, in clear violation of
congressional intent.
Let’s be clear about something. When
we say we are going to protect people
with preexisting conditions, we actu-
ally mean it. That is exactly what this
legislation does.
I would welcome support from my
friends on the other side of the aisle.
According to the Kaiser Family
Foundation, over 750,000 people just in
my little State of Colorado would be at
risk of losing their healthcare coverage
if it wasn’t for the protections of the
ACA.
The administration’s repeated at-
tempts to take these protections away
from people and deny them their right
to obtain healthcare coverage is the
difference for many of them between
life and death.
We are not going to let this happen.
This Congress is going to make sure
that the goals of the ACA to give full
healthcare coverage to every Amer-
ican, including people with preexisting
conditions, is going to be preserved. We
have come too far to turn back the
clock now.
Mr. Chair, I am glad that we have
this bill on the floor now. I thank my
colleague, Ms. KUSTER, for sponsoring
it, and I urge every Member of this
body to support it.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER), our pharmacist on
the Energy and Commerce Committee.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition
to the so-called Protecting Americans
with Preexisting Conditions Act.
Mr. Chair, this is a misnomer. A mis-
nomer is defined as a wrong or inac-
curate name or designation. That is
what the title of this bill is. It is
wrong.
I join my colleagues on the Repub-
lican side in supporting protections for
people with preexisting conditions. In
fact, it was one of the first votes in
Congress that we took this year, and it
was defeated by my colleagues across
the aisle.
This bill, which is ironically, as I
say, misnamed because it doesn’t pro-
tect preexisting conditions, would take
steps to roll back State efforts to inno-
vate and lower premiums for Ameri-
cans across the country.
One issue I often hear about from my
constituents is the cost of healthcare
coverage and the lack of options avail-
able under ObamaCare. These waivers
would allow for new strategies to ad-
dress the high premiums that so many
people are facing.
In fact, of the States that created
their own reinsurance programs, they
saw, on average, a nearly 20 percent
drop in premiums, one State seeing a
drop as high as 43.4 percent.
As States continue to grapple with
high insurance costs, they have looked
to these innovative waivers for oppor-
tunities to bring about new ideas that
help people, not remove options and op-
portunities.
We all know that there is an issue
with affordability of insurance in many
areas. It should be known that this
isn’t as though it is just more conserv-
ative States moving forward with these
reinsurance programs. States like New
Jersey, where the chairman is from,
and Minnesota and Maryland have seen
the benefits of this.
Mr. Chair, that is why I urge my col-
leagues to give States the flexibility
they need to reduce premiums and to
vote ‘‘no’’ on this legislation.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), who chairs our
Consumer Protection and Commerce
Subcommittee.
b 1430
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I
believe that my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle are standing up and
saying what they would like to see, and
that is to protect people with pre-
existing conditions. The problem with
what they are telling the American
people is that what they are proposing
does not protect people with pre-
existing conditions.
I know when I first came to Congress
as a woman, being a woman was a pre-
existing condition. There were a lot of
things that weren’t covered because we
are women, until we passed the Afford-
able Care Act.
While the Republicans are talking
about protecting such people, they are
supporting a lawsuit, right now, that,
once again, would undo all of the Af-
fordable Care Act, sweeping out with
them protections for preexisting condi-
tions.
But the other key word to listen to is
flexibility. They are talking about al-
lowing up to 4 years of policies that
States could enact that do not cover
the whole panoply of things that the
Affordable Care Act covers and could
exclude even protection for preexisting
conditions. That is not flexibility. That
is taking away benefits from people.
You can sign up for one of these,
what we call, junk policies and you are
perfectly well, and then all of a sudden
you have some kind of an illness that,
guess what, is not covered, and won’t
be covered, because then you will have
a preexisting condition.
The legislation Democrats have for
you today would protect preexisting
conditions, no questions, period, end of
story.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. ARRINGTON) to speak on this mat-
ter.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Chairman, I
rise to shed light on a very deceptive
practice and the reason the American
people refer to politics in Washington
as ‘‘the swamp.’’ That is giving bills
names that, not only have nothing to
do with the legislation, but actually
mislead the American people to believe
it is something that it is not.
This Democrat bill being considered
today, entitled the Protecting Ameri-
cans with Preexisting Conditions Act,
has absolutely nothing to do with pre-
existing conditions and protecting peo-
ple with preexisting conditions.
This bill actually prevents a policy
that allows States to have the freedom
and flexibility to provide for their citi-
zens’ healthcare needs. Where they
have exercised that flexibility, we have
seen an average of 20 percent in the re-
duction of healthcare costs.
There are laws on the books, Mr.
Chairman, passed by Democrats and
Republicans alike, that prevent and
punish people and companies who par-
ticipate in such false advertising. In
fact, there is a good reason the FTC
has strong truth in advertising laws
and strictly enforces them against mis-
leading and deceptive practices, be-
cause it hurts people, it hurts con-
sumers, and it actually, in this case,
compromises the American people’s
trust.
Mr. Chairman, the American people
are sick and tired of political games,
they are tired of politicians and their
duplicity, and they are tired of their
elected representatives deceiving them.
That is what this is.
Mr. Chairman, I encourage my col-
leagues to not vote for this bill that
takes the American people as fools and

preys on their fears, and I encourage
both sides to stand in opposition of this
bill.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), our majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the chairman, Mr. PALLONE, for the ex-
traordinary leadership he has shown on
this issue and so many others, and for
his being an original drafter and spon-
sor of the Affordable Care Act.
Sitting here, I was listening to
speaker after speaker after speaker tell
me that this doesn’t protect pre-
existing conditions. Of course, it does.
But those are people who not only
didn’t want to protect preexisting con-
ditions, they wanted to repeal the
whole bill. They wanted to kick 20 mil-
lion people off health insurance. Give
me a break. Their crocodile tears are
not, hopefully, deluding anybody. They
are against the Affordable Care Act.
We get that. This administration has
done everything they can think of to
undermine the Affordable Care Act,
which has an adverse effect on the abil-
ity of Americans to get health insur-
ance at a price they can afford.
Mr. Chairman, over the past few
years, congressional Republicans and
the Trump administration have en-
gaged in a dangerous campaign to re-
peal, undermine, and dismantle the Af-
fordable Care Act. Now, depending
upon how long they have been here,
they may well have voted over 60 times
to repeal the Affordable Care Act. All
of it. Preexisting conditions and every-
thing else.
Through executive actions and law-
suits, they have sabotaged the law and
fueled uncertainty in health insurance
markets in the process. They have a
suit right now which wants to, effec-
tively, repeal the entire Affordable
Care Act that the Attorney General of
the United States and the President of
the United States are supporting.
Spare me these crocodile tears about
how this bill doesn’t protect pre-
existing conditions. It does. But they
don’t care whether it does or not.
They, the people, want to know that
protections for those with preexisting
conditions won’t disappear. That tens
of millions of Americans won’t be
made, effectively, uninsurable and lose
their coverage.
There are very few of us in this
Chamber or in the gallery who don’t
have some sort of preexisting condi-
tion. We, Democrats, are committed to
making sure that that will not pre-
clude people from getting health insur-
ance.
In the first days of the Congress, we
took action to do what the Trump ad-
ministration’s Justice Department has
refused to do: defend the law in court.
We are taking that action.
Instead, the Trump administration is
seeking to overturn the entire law, in-
cluding the ban on denying coverage
for those with preexisting conditions.
Now, the Republicans did pass a bill,
when they were in charge. They sent it
over to the Senate. They had a big—
and I know other people have talked
about that—a big celebration at the
White House, and the President em-
braced the bill. Some 10 days later, he
said: No, it is a mean bill. The Presi-
dent of the United States embraced it,
and, 10 days later, it is a mean bill.
Overturning the law means the end of
popular provisions, like a ban on forc-
ing women to pay more for the same
coverage as men or allowing those
under age 26 to be covered under their
parents’ policy.
The administration’s lawsuit would
also bring back out-of-pocket costs for
preventive care and screenings. We
want to encourage preventive care.
Why? It saves money and saves lives.
Most egregiously, it would kick 20 mil-
lion Americans off health insurance
coverage who were able to get covered
because of the Affordable Care Act.
Last month, the House passed a reso-
lution written by COLIN ALLRED, our
new Member from Texas, condemning
that lawsuit which would repeal the
Affordable Care Act, and reiterating
the importance of protecting Ameri-
cans’ access to quality, affordable care.
Yesterday, the House took another
step by passing bipartisan bills, which
Mr. PALLONE brought to the floor, to
help speed up the process of bringing
the cost of generic drugs down and not
prescription costs up.
Today, we have a bill to overturn the
Trump administration’s guidance that
sabotages the Affordable Care Act by
allowing substandard plans. Are they
cheaper? They are. But, in the end,
they are much more expensive because
the coverage is minimal.
The effect of such a rule is to drive
up prices for those with preexisting
conditions. That wasn’t the intent of
the Affordable Care Act, which aimed
to make coverage affordable for all
Americans.
Next week, we will continue focusing
on healthcare by considering addi-
tional legislation to help Americans
access quality, affordable coverage.
I urge my colleagues on both sides.
Some of them have said they want to
protect preexisting conditions. Some of
them have said that. If they believed
it, then they need to vote for this bill.
They need to do something to protect
those with preexisting conditions. To-
day’s vote is their opportunity to do so.
I thank Representative KUSTER, who
is on the floor with us today, for intro-
ducing this legislation, and, again,
Chairman PALLONE for bringing it to
the floor.
House Democrats will continue, as
we pledged to do in this last campaign
and as the people who voted for us are
expecting us to do, to protect the Af-
fordable Care Act, protect their ability
to get insurance, notwithstanding a
preexisting condition, protect their
families, protect them, and make
America better.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume. I
want to make a couple of comments to
my friend from Maryland, and he is my
friend. He is always quite poignant and
eloquent in his remarks.
What we are debating here today is a
bill that is misnamed that doesn’t do
what it says it is going to do. What we
do know is that 1332 waivers work. My
State took advantage of that 1332 waiv-
er and reduced insurance premiums by
6 percent. The great State of Mary-
land—I was just looking at some data,
Mr. Chairman—has about 181,500 in the
enrollment year. They used a 1332
waiver. This year in the individual
market their costs for premiums in the
individual market percent decreased
43.4 percent.
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman
yield? I would like to tell the gen-
tleman why that happened in Mary-
land.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I bet he
would. But we know, overall, 19.9 per-
cent across the country, because we are
able to take some of this money, put it
together, and have a reinsurance pro-
gram. Maine has done it, Maryland has
done it, and Oregon has done it. These
are things that work.
The complaint I get, Mr. Chairman,
is people at home say, I may have ac-
cess to coverage now, but I can’t afford
the premium, or, if I can afford the pre-
mium, I can’t afford to get sick be-
cause the out-of-pocket costs are so
high. They are now falling off. Later in
the debate, I will share some data that
has been published this week showing
people who literally walk away from
healthcare because they can’t afford it.
That should be our common mission
and goal.
When it comes to protecting people
with preexisting conditions, I intro-
duced legislation—and tried to get a
vote on it every chance I have had—
that would lock into law preexisting
condition protections, regardless of
what this Federal lawsuit’s outcome is
in Texas. We should do that. That
would be an easy vote. We could all
vote for it. But Democrats won’t let us
bring it to the floor.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.
KEVIN HERN).
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr.
Chairman, let’s be honest, we are not
here to solve a problem today. We are
not here to change anything today.
This bill will do nothing to help people
with preexisting conditions.
Something not many people know
about me is my family’s history with
spina bifida.
I had an older sister, about 13 months
older than me, who died 2 hours after
birth because of spina bifida.
My older sister, who will turn 50
later this month, has lived her entire
life as a spina bifida survivor, spending
the first 6 months of her life enduring
many surgeries. My mother knew that
my sister was going to be born with
that very birth defect that took the
life of her first child. My sister had her
first daughter, Kristen, who was born
with a devastating spina bifida condi-
tion. During the pregnancies, my

mother knew about my sister’s birth
defect and my sister knew of Kristen’s
condition. In spite of that knowledge,
their lives were not aborted.
Kristen has a son who just turned 10.
In spite of being in a wheelchair for her
entire life of 30 years, Kristen has been
an awesome mom to Daniel. Daniel will
have an incredible story to tell about
his life because his great-grandmother
and his grandmother did not seek abor-
tions to terminate the lives of their
‘‘less than perfect’’ children. He is alive
today, and I am confident he will have
an incredible impact on those around
him.
These aren’t nameless, faceless peo-
ple we are talking about. This is my
sister, my niece, and my family.
These preexisting conditions have
had a massive impact on my life and
the lives of my family. These mes-
saging bills are pointless. People need
help, not our talking points. Our goal
should be success. We should aim to
write legislation that has a shot to be-
come law and will change people’s lives
for the better.
The aim of H.R. 986 is not to protect
Americans with preexisting conditions,
but to interfere with the President’s
ability to govern. These are real people
and real problems that we are ignoring.
I believe that life is precious. Every
life is worth protecting. We have a lot
of work to do and it is time to stop
talking and act. That is what we were
elected to do here.
Mr. Chairman, the American people
are tired of these political games.
b 1445
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. MATSUI).
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today as a proud cosponsor of H.R. 986,
the Protecting Americans with Pre-
existing Conditions Act, which pro-
hibits the Trump administration from
promoting the sale of junk insurance
plans that do not fully protect Ameri-
cans with preexisting conditions.
Today, we are taking a critical step to
reverse a damaging Trump administra-
tion policy.
With the Affordable Care Act, we
sought to ensure that all people cov-
ered in the same area are charged the
same premium as everyone else, re-
gardless of their health status. Women
cannot be denied coverage or charged
more simply because they are women,
and more Americans now have the free-
dom to start their own business or pur-
sue work in the gig economy without
fear of losing coverage for preexisting
conditions. Coverage before the ACA
was often tied to employer plans.
In California, we have taken a stance
against the Trump administration’s
sabotage of the ACA by protecting con-
sumers from the sale of junk plans, but
not every State has followed our lead.
This legislation protects basic fair-
ness and access to healthcare for all
Americans, not just those living in
States that have sought aggressive re-
forms, changes, and improvements to
the law. We now have a real oppor-
tunity to protect and build on the
ACA’s success, and I am immensely
pleased to be able to support such ef-
forts on the floor today.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Kan-
sas (Mr. MARSHALL).
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Chairman, the
lengths that my colleagues across the
aisle are willing to go to mislead the
public and increase the political divide
over healthcare is shameful and embar-
rassing. H.R. 986, which I refuse to call
by its name, makes a mockery of
Americans with preexisting conditions.
Mr. Chairman, I practiced obstetrics
for over 25 years, and do you know
what the most common preexisting
condition is? It is pregnancy.
I came to Congress to protect people
with preexisting conditions and to help
patients. H.R. 986 just does the oppo-
site. H.R. 986 prevents innovation. It
drives the cost of healthcare up and
will cause fewer people to have
healthcare.
Let me be crystal clear about this,
Mr. Chairman. This bill has absolutely
nothing to do with people with pre-
existing conditions. That is why I am
proud to join Congressman WALDEN and
shed light on this deceptive bill that
the Democrats are pushing.
Under current law, States do not
have the authority to waive pre-
existing conditions using the section
1332 innovation waiver. It is that sim-
ple.
Section 1332 waivers are working, and
contrary to the Democrats’ claims, pa-
tients are raving about the 1332 waivers
for reinsurance.
These waivers give States flexibility
to provide Americans with affordable
healthcare options. And in the seven
States using these waivers, premiums
have gone down by an average of 20
percent. They went down 20 percent,
with Maryland achieving a 43 percent
premium reduction.
So I stand here today to discuss the
facts and not the fiction.
The 2018 guide from the President is
making the process easier, helping
States pursue innovation strategies
that will help more people get coverage
while delivering quality coverage peo-
ple can actually afford and use.
Most of us, including the President,
are working towards a better
healthcare future for all Americans,
where patients and families, not bu-
reaucrats in Washington, are in control
of their own healthcare decisions. I ask
that my colleagues across the aisle
stop the partisan politics and come to-
gether to develop real healthcare pol-
icy solutions.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Vermont (Mr. WELCH), a member of the
committee.
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, if we want to level
with the American people, let’s ac-
knowledge something: We have a dif-
ference of opinion on healthcare.
When we passed the Affordable Care
Act, it provided, for the first time, pro-
tections for people who have a pre-
existing condition.
Every single one of my colleagues on
the Republican side voted against that
and then spent the next several years—
69 times—voting to get rid of the pro-
tection for preexisting conditions.
Then when they were in the major-
ity, the first opportunity they had,
they passed a bill out of the House to
take away the protection for pre-
existing conditions.
And thank you to Senator John
McCain for protecting the American
people.
Every single opportunity to stand up
and protect people who are sick, who
lost their job but were sick and wanted
to get insurance, you voted ‘‘no’’; we
voted ‘‘yes.’’
You are talking now about waivers. I
like waivers—we have benefited in
Vermont—but not this waiver. If you
pass this waiver, you are going to wave
good-bye to the protection that we
fought long and hard for for preexisting
conditions.
We fought for your families. We
fought for our families. We fought for
all American families.
What kind of world is it if you are
sick and you can’t get healthcare?
That is what is at stake now. That
should never be in debate.
We will not back down on protecting
people from preexisting conditions. We
will not back down on assaults on
Medicare. We will not back down on as-
saults on Medicaid.
Mr. Chairman, let us pass this bill
and continue to protect Americans’
healthcare.
The CHAIR. Members are reminded
to address their remarks to the Chair.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I would
just say to my friend, the biggest as-
sault on Medicare is the Democrats’
proposal to do Medicare for All.
We know it will cost $32 trillion, dou-
ble personal and corporate income
taxes. I met with our hospitals yester-
day: 40 percent reduction in their pay-
ments. They are not sure how they
would survive. They told me most hos-
pitals in America will go bankrupt
under the Democrats’ proposal.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
REED), a member of the powerful Ways
and Means Committee.
Mr. REED. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today in opposition to the bill before us
but, as the father of a type 1 diabetic,
agree with the basis of the law of the
Affordable Care Act that says pre-
existing conditions must be protected
in every health insurance plan going
forward. We should be celebrating to-
gether that that reform is now the law
of the land, and I would hope my col-
leagues would take ‘‘yes’’ for an an-
swer.
But what is being proposed today po-
tentially jeopardizes that protection,

because what you are proposing today
is to take away the ability of the
States to comply with the law of the
land to protect those preexisting condi-
tions in a way that allows the States to
innovate, to drive health insurance
premiums down as the law protects
those with preexisting conditions.
This is not a political game. You are
talking about real Americans. You are
talking about kids, like my son, who is
a type 1 diabetic. And if this law, as
proposed, becomes the law of the land,
you potentially increase insurance pre-
miums on millions of Americans be-
cause you take away that innovation
ability of the States to deliver the pro-
tections of preexisting condition re-
form but lower premiums at the same
time.
So I stand in strong objection to this
political effort from my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle, and rather
than engage in politics, I join with the
silent majority of Americans who say:
You know what? Enough is enough of
politics. Get to the real work of the
people and lower healthcare costs for
everyone.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, may I
inquire as to how much time each side
has remaining.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Or-
egon has 9 minutes remaining. The
gentleman from New Jersey has 161⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
New York (Ms. CLARKE), the vice chair
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee.
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr.
Chairman, I thank our chairman for
yielding the time. I thank Congress-
woman KUSTER for her leadership.
As vice chair of the Committee on
Energy and Commerce and cosponsor of
H.R. 986, I am proud to stand with my
colleagues in support of the Protecting
Americans with Preexisting Conditions
Act of 2019.
Healthcare is a right. In the 21st cen-
tury, everyone must have the right to
the best quality and affordable
healthcare insurance when they need it
most.
This human right must not be only
limited to healthy individuals, but,
rather, the human right to healthcare
must be available to every American
who has ever been ill at any time or is
born with a preexisting condition. No
American should be penalized for a
medical condition that started before
the individual’s healthcare coverage
benefits went into effect.
Passage of the Protecting Americans
with Preexisting Conditions Act would
rescind the 1332 guidance issued by the
Trump administration, which weakens
coverage and undermines the Afford-
able Care Act’s protections for people
with preexisting conditions.
Our friends on the other side of the
aisle made more than 70 failed at-
tempts to replace and repeal the Af-
fordable Care Act between 2011 and
2017.
Mr. Chair, we must do the right thing
and enact legislation that strengthens
the standards of quality healthcare, af-
fordability, comprehensiveness, and
coverage. Mr. Chairman, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 986.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL).
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to speak in support of protecting
people with preexisting conditions.
Not that long ago, hardworking peo-
ple who did everything right would be
denied insurance coverage just because
they had diabetes or asthma or they
wanted to start a family.
We passed the ACA and ended dis-
crimination against people with pre-
existing conditions. Millions of Ameri-
cans were able to sign up for coverage
for the first time in their lives, and
millions who already had coverage
knew it wouldn’t be taken away from
them.
Remember the stories of people’s in-
surance being canceled as they were
being rolled into operating rooms; that
was the truth.
The ACA has done a lot of good.
Could we work to improve it? Yes. And
I will work with any Republican or
Democrat on those efforts. But when
this Congress and this administration
attempt to roll back protections for
people with preexisting conditions, I
will always stand against those poli-
cies.
Mr. Chair, 2 years ago last week,
House Republicans passed a bill to re-
scind the whole ACA and take
healthcare away from 20 million Amer-
icans. Because Americans spoke up,
that bill failed.
I am proud to cosponsor Representa-
tive KUSTER’s bill. Healthcare should
be affordable to every American.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. BEYER).
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to speak in support of H.R. 986,
the Protecting Americans with Pre-
existing Conditions Act.
Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I am con-
fused. I serve on the Ways and Means
Committee, and a few weeks ago, we
had a long, lively hearing on the need
to preserve the preexisting conditions
created by the ACA. I was impressed
that every member of the Ways and
Means Committee, Democrat and Re-
publican, spoke passionately about this
protection—every one.
We emerged from that hearing with a
clear, bipartisan consensus that we
would never again condemn Americans
who suffer from diabetes or cancer or
heart disease or epilepsy to
unaffordable insurance and perhaps an
early death.
But today my Republican friends are
ready to vote against the only bill this
year to keep the Trump administration
from gutting the preexisting exclusion.
They argue that, no, this is not what
CMS is trying to do, yet this is exactly
what would happen with short-term in-
surance plans if the various States are
given the opportunity to do so. That is
why virtually every organization that
protects human health supports this
bill and is against the CMS action.
b 1500
States want waivers. States want to
innovate. This bill won’t keep them
from innovating or keep them from
getting waivers. Remember what
States did before the Affordable Care
Act when there was no prohibition
against higher costs for preexisting
conditions or no insurance.
If what they say is, indeed, true,
there is no harm voting ‘‘yes’’ for this
bill. States will still be able to inno-
vate, as long as they don’t violate the
preexisting conditions exclusion.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I continue
to reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I
thank the chairman very much for
yielding.
Just a second on memory lane, for
those of us who were here for the Af-
fordable Care Act, dozens of our com-
mittees, including the Judiciary Com-
mittee, heard the pain of people whose
family members had died because they
had no access to healthcare and/or they
had junk policies.
Mr. Chair, I rise today with the
strongest of support for H.R. 986. I
thank my good friend, ANN KUSTER, for
her great leadership and indicate that
since the Affordable Care Act—and I
know that we are now looking at Medi-
care for All and many others. My view
of it is yes, so that we all can have ac-
cess to healthcare.
It is, in fact, sure that this bill that
we now have, which is being attacked
by the Trump administration in the
Fifth Circuit right now because of my
attorney general attacking the Afford-
able Care Act, Texas saw a national de-
crease of the uninsured from 14.8 to 8.8.
Now this legislation, which is to turn
back the Trump guidance on the issue
of waivers, is vital because we have
lower costs for health insurance be-
cause of the ability for people to access
and be taken care of with the Afford-
able Care Act when they have pre-
existing conditions.
Sickle cell, triple negative breast
cancer, and diabetes all plague my con-
stituency. Insulin costs are going
through the roof. With this guidance
that Trump has put in place, it will be
worse. It will be compounded.
Rates will go up, and people suffering
from preexisting conditions, including
pregnancy, will not get policies at a
low cost. They will not have com-
prehensive coverage that will include
mental health. Certainly, they will see
a reverse of them being able to have
coverage for preexisting conditions.

H3526 May 9, 2019
That is the civil rights of healthcare.
Preexisting conditions must be pro-
tected.
I rise to enthusiastically support
H.R. 986, and I demand that the Trump
administration stop taking away con-
stitutional rights in everything and de-
nying people their right to good
healthcare. Enough is enough. Let us
support this legislation.
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R.
986, the ‘‘Protecting Americans With Pre-Ex-
isting Conditions Act of 2019,’’ which blocks
the Trump Administration’s efforts to give
states the ability to weaken the Affordable
Care Act’s critical protections for Americans
with pre-existing conditions.
On October 22, 2018, the Centers for Medi-
care & Medicaid Services (CMS), HHS, and
Treasury issued a guidance on Section 1332
of the ACA, which authorizes states to waive
certain requirements of the law and experi-
ment with health insurance reforms that could
improve the well-being and health of their resi-
dents.
The ACA has a clear statutory directive that
states must maintain the level of benefits, af-
fordability, and coverage provided to state
residents by the ACA.
Section 1332 requires states to meet four
statutory ‘‘guardrails’’ simultaneously and dem-
onstrate that the proposed waiver will provide
comprehensive, affordable coverage to a com-
parable number of residents as under the
ACA, without increasing the federal deficit.
But in the 2018 guidance, HHS and Treas-
ury revised the agencies’ interpretation of the
statutory requirements, and significantly loos-
ened the standards that states must meet in
order to receive waiver approval, setting forth
weaker requirements that must be met for the
affordability and comprehensiveness guard-
rails and adopted a new definition of what
classifies as coverage.
The 2018 guidance provided by the Trump
Administration would allow states to simply
demonstrate that a comparable number of
residents will have access to comprehensive
and affordable coverage, regardless of wheth-
er they actually enroll in that coverage, there-
by allowing the Secretaries of HHS and Treas-
ury to approve waivers that do not provide
coverage that is as affordable or as com-
prehensive as under the ACA.
The 2018 guidance also allows states to re-
ceive waiver approval for proposals that direct
the ACA’s tax credit subsidies towards STLDI
plans and other types of health insurance
plans that do not provide protections for pre-
existing conditions.
H.R. 986 revokes and rescinds the October
2018 Section 1332 guidance and prohibits the
Secretaries of HHS and Treasury from promul-
gating any substantially similar guidance or
rule.
These improper waivers leave consumers
with less comprehensive plans that do not
cover needed services, such as prescription
drugs, maternity care and substance use dis-
order treatment.
Another way the ‘‘Protecting Pre-Existing
Conditions and Making Health Care More Af-
fordable Act of 2019,’’ protects consumers is
by prohibiting insurance companies from sell-
ing junk health insurance plans that do not
provide coverage for essential medical treat-
ments and drugs or cover people with pre-ex-
isting medical conditions.
As a member of Congress who voted
against each of the dozens of Republican ef-
forts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I know
first-hand how important and critical access to
affordable, high quality, accessible health care
available to everyone, including those with
pre-existing conditions, to the well-being of
American families.
Because of the passage of the Affordable
Care Act, the national uninsured rate has
been slashed from 14.8 in 2012 to 8.8 percent
in 2018. Texas has long led the nation in rate
of uninsured so the comparable rates are 24.6
and 15 percent, respectively.
Mr. Chair, I distinctly recall a candidate for
the highest public office in the land saying
‘‘Obamacare is a disaster’’ and appealing for
voters to support him with this question: ‘‘What
have you got to lose?’’
The question deserves a response so I
hope that person, who occupies the Oval Of-
fice, is listening to my answer.
The Affordable Care Act, or ‘‘Obamacare,’’
has been an unmitigated success to the more
than 20 million Americans who for the first
time now have the security and peace of mind
that comes with affordable, accessible, high
quality health care.
Mr. Chair, Tip O’Neill used to say that ‘‘all
politics is local’’ so let me share with you how
Obamacare has dramatically changed lives for
the better for the people in my home state of
Texas.
1.874 million Texans who have gained cov-
erage since the ACA was implemented could
lose their coverage if the ACA is entirely or
partially repealed or invalidated.
1.1 million Texans who purchased high
quality Marketplace coverage now stand to
lose their coverage if Texas v. United States,
No. 4:18–cv–00167–0 (N.D. Tex.), the lawsuit
brought by Republican Governors, and now
whole-heartedly supported and aided by the
Trump Administration were to succeed.
508,000 kids in Texas who have gained
coverage since the ACA was implemented are
also at risk of having their coverage rolled
back.
205,000 young adult Texans who were able
to stay on a parent’s health insurance plan
thanks to the ACA now stand to lose coverage
if the Republican Congress eliminates the re-
quirement that insurers allow children to stay
on their parents’ plans until age 26.
646,415 Texans who received cost-sharing
reductions to lower out-of-pocket costs such
as deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance are
now at risk of having healthcare become
unaffordable if the Republican Congress elimi-
nates costsharing reductions.
10.28 million Texans who now have private
health insurance that covers preventive serv-
ices without any co-pays, coinsurance, or
deductibles stand to lose this access if the Re-
publican Congress eliminates ACA provisions
requiring health insurers to cover important
preventive services without cost-sharing.
913,177 individuals Texans who received fi-
nancial assistance to purchase Marketplace
coverage in 2016, averaging $271 per indi-
vidual, are at risk of having coverage become
unaffordable if the Republican Congress elimi-
nates the premium tax credits.
1.1 million Texans could have insurance if
all states adopted the ACA’s Medicaid expan-
sion; these individuals will not be able to gain
coverage if the Republican Congress elimi-
nates the Medicaid expansion.
Women in Texas who can now purchase in-
surance for the same price as men are at risk
of being charged more for insurance if the
ACA’s ban on gender rating in the individual
and small group markets is invalidated.
Before the ACA, women paid up to 56 per-
cent more than men for their health insurance.
Roughly 4.5 million Texans who have pre-
existing health conditions are at risk of having
their coverage rescinded, being denied cov-
erage, or being charged significantly more for
coverage if the ACA’s ban on pre-existing con-
ditions is struck down.
346,750 Texas seniors who have saved an
average of $1,057 each as a result of closing
the Medicare prescription drug ‘‘donut hole’’
gap in coverage stand to lose this critical help
going forward.
1.75 million Texas seniors who have re-
ceived free preventive care services thanks to
ACA provisions requiring coverage of annual
wellness visits and eliminating cost-sharing for
many recommended preventive services cov-
ered by Medicare Part B, such as cancer
screenings, are at risk of losing access to
these services if congressional Republicans
go forward with their plan to repeal the ACA.
The Affordable Care Act works and has
made a life-affirming difference in the lives of
millions of Americans, in Texas and across the
country.
This is what happens when a visionary
president cares enough to work with a com-
mitted and empathetic Congress to address
the real issues facing the American people.
You want to know why the American people
have Obamacare?
It is because Obama cared.
The same cannot be said about this Repub-
lican president and congressional Republicans
who have made careers of attacking and un-
dermining the Affordable Care Act’s protec-
tions and benefits for the American people.
I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 986 and
send a powerful message to the President and
the American people that this House will not
stand idly by as this Administration tries to
take away health care from more than 130
million persons.
Instead, this House will resist by all constitu-
tional and appropriate means, including op-
posing this Administration in the courts and by
passing H.R. 986, the ‘‘Protecting Pre-Existing
Conditions and Making Health Care More Af-
fordable Act of 2019.’’
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I continue
to reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. COURTNEY).
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I thank
the chairman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, after 2 years of the Trump
administration trying and failing in
Congress to repeal the Affordable Care
Act, they have gone to plan B. Plan B
is to use the administrative agencies,
the Department of Health and Human
Services, and the court system as a
way of trying to accomplish what they
could not accomplish through the
House and the Senate in the 115th Con-
gress.
Today, we are dealing with one of
those efforts, which was an order that
was issued in October of last year,
issuing new guidelines for State waiv-
ers from the Affordable Care Act, re-
pealing the ObamaCare guardrails that

made sure that patient protections
would not be affected by such waivers—
for example, protecting people with
preexisting conditions; the elimination
of lifetime caps on health insurance;
and the protections that were built in
for essential health benefits that de-
fined real healthcare, not the cheap
healthcare that was being sold before
the ACA was enacted.
An intervening event occurred since
last October. We had an election. It
was the largest midterm turnout since
1914. We had a new majority that was
elected with a plurality of 10 million
votes, larger than any flip election in
the past, any wave election in the past.
The number one issue from the voters
was healthcare and protecting their pa-
tient rights to affordable and com-
prehensive benefits.
Mr. Chair, we are here today debat-
ing an issue that the patient groups
that represent people with chronic ill-
nesses, with expensive illnesses like
cancer, have stepped up across the
board, saying vote for this legislation
to overturn the Trump order that they
are trying to get through but that they
cannot get through the U.S. Congress.
Vote for this bill.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire how much time remains?
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
New Jersey has 9 minutes remaining.
The gentleman from Oregon has 9 min-
utes remaining.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I wanted to mention this
issue of reinsurance. Some of the Re-
publicans have brought up the fact
that in the last few years under the
Obama administration, actually before
President Trump, certain States—I be-
lieve there are eight now, including my
own—applied for 1332 waivers because
they wanted to put in place reinsur-
ance programs.
I want to assure everyone that those
types of waivers that are granted for
reinsurance would continue and that
this legislation in no way impacts that.
Keep in mind, we are not opposed to
1332 waivers.
But pursuant to the Affordable Care
Act, which I helped draft, those waiv-
ers, when granted, have to maintain af-
fordability and comprehensiveness of
coverage and keep the same number of
people insured as under the ACA.
When my State and others have ap-
plied for waivers for reinsurance pro-
grams, it is because the ACA reinsur-
ance funding was discontinued at some
point under the original bill. Those
States want to, among other things,
make sure that there is competitive-
ness in the marketplace by providing
some kind of reinsurance or risk pro-
tection so that more insurers come
into the marketplace in those States
and create more competition and lower
prices.
When you ask the Federal Govern-
ment for a reinsurance waiver, you are
still maintaining affordability, prob-
ably making things even more afford-
able because of competition. You are
still maintaining the comprehensive-
ness of the coverage because you have
to provide policies that have all the es-
sential benefits. You are keeping the
same number of people insured. In fact,
what you are probably doing is having
more people insured.
The difference between that and the
section 1332 guidance that the Trump
administration is now putting forth is
that none of those things are guaran-
teed under the waivers that the Trump
administration is proposing with their
guidance.
For one thing, they are saying you
can sell a junk plan that doesn’t have
hospitalization, that doesn’t have es-
sential benefits, so you violate the sec-
tion 1332 provision.
You also end up having fewer people
insured because the Trump administra-
tion says you don’t have to have the
same number of people covered. All you
have to do is have access.
Lastly, affordability, sure, they will
argue that somehow it is more afford-
able because a junk plan doesn’t cost
as much, but that is sort of a misnomer
because the comprehensiveness of the
coverage disappears.
I want everyone to understand, a
State that applies to have reinsurance
as part of their program and gets a
waiver, that is in no way impacted by
what we are proposing here today with
Ms. KUSTER’s bill. In fact, reinsurance
reinforces the very things that the 1332
waivers are seeking to guarantee.
So that is a very false bit of informa-
tion that my colleagues on the other
side are trying to put out here today. I
wanted to explain that.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I continue
to reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN).
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, I rise today
in support of the Protecting Americans
with Preexisting Conditions Act.
For me, this issue is particularly per-
sonal. It is a major reason why I ended
up coming here to Congress.
I believe that the sabotage, the at-
tempts at legislating out protections
for people with preexisting conditions,
is something that is just out of touch
with the American people, certainly in
Michigan’s Eighth Congressional Dis-
trict.
It is particularly personal to me be-
cause of my mom. My mom passed
away in 2011 from ovarian cancer.
When she was diagnosed, she did not
have healthcare.
She had trouble with healthcare her
entire life. She had breast cancer as a
young 31-year-old mom, so for the rest
of her life, she had a preexisting condi-
tion.
My parents divorced, and she lost her
job. Because of that preexisting condi-
tion, she could not afford health insur-
ance. She went 51⁄2 years without a
checkup and no gynecological exam.
We finally got her health insurance,
my brother and I. It was $1,000 a
month, with a $10,000 deductible, her
highest bill in Detroit.
In 2009, without us knowing, she let
it lapse. Two months later, she walked
into an ER and was diagnosed with
stage IV ovarian cancer.
I am sure my colleagues around the
room know what it is like to have a
loved one get a terminal diagnosis.
Your life as you know it explodes.
That same week and that same
month that our lives were exploding
was the same week and the same
month we spent filling out the paper-
work for her to declare bankruptcy.
I think no matter whether you are a
Republican, a Democrat, or an inde-
pendent, it is essential that we support
people with preexisting conditions, and
I urge my colleagues to do so.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I continue
to reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. I am
still waiting for one of our other speak-
ers.
Mr. Chair, I want to respond to my
colleague, the ranking member, whom
I respect a great deal. He has several
times today, as well as in committee
and as a representative at the Rules
Committee, talked about this amend-
ment that he has on preexisting condi-
tions.
First of all, the reality is that the
ACA guarantees people coverage with
preexisting conditions. The problem
here is not that we need to restate
that, but that the section 1332 guidance
that the Trump administration has
proposed would undermine it.
On its surface, Mr. WALDEN’s amend-
ment appears to maintain protections
for preexisting conditions, but, again,
that is not the issue because he is not
getting rid of the guidance that the
Trump administration has put forward
under 1332.
What does that mean? It means that
even with his amendment, the Trump
administration, under their guidance,
would allow insuring companies to not
offer basic services such as hospitaliza-
tion, maternity coverage, mental
health, and substance abuse disorders.
Insurance companies would no longer
have to offer these benefits to people
with preexisting conditions who need
those benefits.
Mr. WALDEN’s amendment also does
not include prohibitions on annual and
lifetime limits, which are critical pro-
tections for individuals with pre-
existing conditions. These limits,
which were commonplace prior to the
ACA, are a threat to the life and health
of individuals with serious medical
conditions.
The Walden amendment would also
allow insurance companies to charge
women more than men and put a sig-
nificant financial burden on older
Americans.
We are not interested in these half
measures that would leave Americans
worse off.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3528 May 9, 2019
Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
California (Mr. HARDER).
Mr. HARDER of California. Mr.
Chair, I rise today in support of my
amendment. My legislation would sim-
ply require the Federal Government to
issue an expert analysis of the impact
of junk plans on mental healthcare ac-
cess. People deserve access to mental
healthcare, and we don’t know how
many people will lose that access if
these junk plans become used more
widely.
That is exactly what my amendment
would tell us.
People who are struggling with de-
pression, anxiety, schizophrenia, or
substance use disorder deserve cov-
erage. We are talking about real people
in our communities who need help, and
they should get it.
That is especially true because of the
stigma surrounding mental health
issues. If you tell your friends that you
have cancer, they tell you to get help.
If you tell your friends you have de-
pression, they tell you to tough it out
or go to the gym.
Without access to mental healthcare,
a lot of people end up self-medicating.
That is why we have to make sure that
they are covered with real insurance,
not junk plans.
b 1515
These plans are a scam.
I heard a horror story from a woman
in Stanislaus County about her fam-
ily’s experience with a junk plan before
the Affordable Care Act. Her daughter
went off to school and got cheap, uni-
versity-sponsored insurance.
After a couple of years, she had a
mental health issue present, but she
was completely denied coverage for the
treatment that she needed. Even
though she paid premiums for years,
she wasn’t covered, and her family had
to pay thousands of dollars out of
pocket. Years later, they are still pay-
ing it off today, more than 10 years
after her mental health episode.
That is a common story because only
about half of these plans cover mental
healthcare, and only about one-third
cover substance use disorder, and that
is a huge problem in the Central Val-
ley, especially for young people.
It is in people’s twenties that they
start showing signs of a lot of mental
health problems, and this often coin-
cides with the development of sub-
stance use disorders. People who turn
26 have to get off their parents’ insur-
ance. They pick the cheapest thing
they can find.
If we don’t pass this amendment, mil-
lions of people who have similar stories
will be denied coverage for mental
health issues when they need it most.
That is a scam. That is what my
amendment demands.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, how
much time remains on each side?
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Or-
egon has 9 minutes remaining. The
gentleman from New Jersey has 1
minute remaining.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, let me address a few
issues. First of all, my friend my New
Jersey—and he is my friend—ref-
erenced my amendment.
It is unfortunate that we can’t debate
my amendment on the floor, because
the Democrats who control the Rules
Committee wouldn’t allow my amend-
ment to be considered, nor would they
allow us to bring a bill to the floor that
I have authored that has more than 100
cosponsors that would make sure that
preexisting conditions are protected in
case the court decision in Texas goes
against the ACA and wipes out those
protections.
This would be an insurance policy in
public law for people with a preexisting
condition. We can do that today. If it
has some shortcomings, then let’s have
a markup on this bill and work that
out.
I care deeply about preexisting condi-
tion protection. I fought for it as a leg-
islator. I helped create the high-risk
pools in Oregon back in the late
eighties and early nineties. I have sup-
ported it every step of the way.
Let me again quote from the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services.
We asked them, and they wrote back to
me, about protection for preexisting
conditions. Seema Verma, the Admin-
istrator, said in her letter to me: ‘‘To
be very clear, the 2018 guidance does
nothing to erode PPACA’s preexisting
condition provisions, which cannot be
waived under section 1332.’’
So they cannot do that. They cannot
waive those protections under 1332.
‘‘Section 1332 does not permit States
to waive Public Health Service Act re-
quirements, such as guaranteed avail-
ability and renewability of health in-
surance, the prohibition on using
health status to vary premiums, and
the prohibition on preexisting condi-
tions exclusions. Furthermore, a sec-
tion 1332 waiver cannot be approved
that might otherwise undermine these
requirements. This administration
stands committed to protecting people
with preexisting conditions.’’
That is the head of CMS. It is her
agency that approves 1332 waivers.
There have been no waivers so far ap-
proved under this guidance, and that is
what she tells us in writing, period, be-
cause of the information that is being
sent around.
We do know that seven States have
taken advantage of the prior 1332 proc-
ess, and it has yielded more affordable
insurance premiums for American citi-
zens.
Now, I find it curious. My State has
been very progressive in these areas.
When I was in the State legislature, I
helped try to expand access to afford-
able healthcare. We had to come to
Washington to get a waiver for the Or-
egon health plan and Medicaid, and we
looked at all kinds of different ways to
get access to affordable healthcare, and
I have never let up on that.
I believe strongly in helping people
with preexisting conditions. Like my
colleagues on the other side of the
aisle, my wife and I had a son who did
not survive because of a heart condi-
tion. We dealt with all of these issues
leading up to his birth and eventual
death. So I am fully committed to pro-
tecting people with preexisting condi-
tions.
What we are arguing about here is: Is
health insurance affordable for Ameri-
cans and are there better ways, using
States as laboratories, to innovate and
bring down costs of care and costs of
insurance, because more of us are pay-
ing more out of our pocket than at any
time in our history.
There was a very interesting story
which I will put in the RECORD for ev-
eryone to read, data from the Kaiser
Foundation this week that ran in a
publication called Axios. I just want to
share some of what they found about
what is really going on if you get out-
side of the beltway here in Washington
and talk to real people.
They evaluated people who had cov-
erage under their employer, in this
case, and had a chronic condition of
some sort. It is not a small group.
About half of Americans who have
employer coverage—so that is half of
158 million—report that 6 in 10 in that
group report they or a family member
skipped or postponed medical care or
prescription drugs they needed because
of the costs, or, in some cases, they
tried a home remedy.
High deductibles make things worse.
Among those with chronic conditions
whose deductibles were at least $3,000
for an individual or $5,000 for a family,
three-quarters, Mr. Chairman, 75 per-
cent, report skipping or postponing
some type of care; and about half, 49
percent, say they or a family member
had problems paying medical bills or
difficulty affording their premiums,
deductibles, or copays in the last year.
So what States—including mine, in-
cluding New Jersey, including Mary-
land, and including Maine and Alaska—
did was say: Hey, Washington, D.C.,
give us just a little flexibility here. Let
us come with up with plans that may
be more affordable.
They did that under the prior rules,
and rates went down, on average, 19.9
percent—some States more, some less.
Now, what happens when people can’t
afford to use their own insurance? Be-
cause that is happening with these
deductibles and with these high levels,
let alone the premiums.
The ripple effect on family budgets,
according to the story in Axios, is a
substantial share of people reported
taking measures such as increasing
credit card debt, 28 percent; using up
most of their savings, 26 percent; get-
ting an extra job, 19 percent; borrowing
money from family or friends, 14 per-
cent.
This is what we are trying to argue
could be better taken care of. This is
the issue that is being ignored by a
Washington one size fits all.
So we protect people with preexisting
conditions, 1332 waivers—that law

stays in effect—but we want to give
States a little more flexibility to go
after this to bring down the cost.
Now, my friend from New Jersey and
I, Mr. Chairman, are working together
on some of these drug reforms so we
can get drug costs down.
I was at the White House today with
the President on surprise billing, and I
think we are going to work together on
that issue, Mr. Chairman, so that no
American consumer who follows the
rules gets stuck with a surprise bill.
What are you supposed to do, wake up
in the middle of the operation and say:
Hey, is everybody in this room still on
my plan? If you play by the rules, you
shouldn’t get stuck unfairly with a sur-
prise bill. We are going to find a solu-
tion.
My State came up with a way to do
that already and other States have
other ideas, but we are going to protect
consumers there as well. We are going
to drive down the cost of drugs, and we
should continue to go after this issue
of the high cost of healthcare because
that is what Americans in my 20 town-
halls—and I don’t think anybody in the
House has done more.
I have done 20 townhalls this year. In
almost every one of them, they are
asking: How do you get the costs down?
Mr. Chairman, 1332 waivers gave my
State the opportunity to get costs
down, and we should not impede that
process.
We are going to debate a lot about
these policies going forward, and if
there are junk plans, then let’s expose
them for what they are, and let’s pass
Ms. ESHOO’s bill from, I think, last
Congress, which required more trans-
parency and accountability so you
don’t have fraud and deception. Count
me all in on that.
There is a lot more we can do to
drive down costs.
My legislation—again, Democrats re-
fused to bring up in committee or have
on the floor—would make sure, regard-
less of any lawsuit, people with pre-
existing conditions can continue to get
covered. So irrespective of the court
decisions, they would get covered.
If my bill were allowed to be voted on
in the House, I guarantee you, we
might have some issues we need to
work out. I am happy to do that. If it
passed, it would become law. This
President is firmly committed to pro-
tecting people with preexisting condi-
tions, so we should do that.
We should also have a hearing on the
Medicare for All bill that some on the
other side are promoting. I have asked
for that.
I know there was one in the Rules
Committee, but Energy and Commerce
is the committee of jurisdiction for
most of that. We have not seen that
hearing yet. I hope, in the future, we
will, because we should know the im-
pact of wiping out Medicare Advantage
plans and Medigap plans.
I have been told TRICARE would go
away, all private insurance would go
away, and it would be a one-size-fits-
all, government-run system. I am wor-
ried about the delay in access to care.
I am worried about the access to the
great, new innovative drugs and proce-
dures that we would lose in America.
So, Mr. Chairman, I must oppose this
underlying legislation. I remain com-
mitted to protecting people with pre-
existing conditions, as do my col-
leagues on the Republican side. Then
we ought to focus together, Mr. Chair-
man, as a Congress to do the best thing
for our constituents, which is to bring
the greatest leverage possible to reduce
unnecessary costs in the healthcare
system in America.
Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to
oppose this bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, the problem is that
nothing that my colleague on the Re-
publican side says about his amend-
ment and nothing that is in Seema
Verma’s letter will help a person with
preexisting conditions.
The bottom line is this 1332 guidance
that the Trump administration has put
forward allows junk plans to be sold so
that people with preexisting conditions
will not get the coverage they need.
They can be charged more. They are
not guaranteed that things like
recisions and lifetime limits don’t go
back into place.
So the problem that we face is we
can’t allow people with preexisting
conditions to suffer and not get cov-
erage because they are going to be
charged more or because they are not
going to get the coverage they need by
buying a junk plan.
If you really care about that and you
want to make sure that people with
preexisting conditions really are guar-
anteed good coverage and can afford
their coverage, then you have to vote
for Ms. KUSTER’s bill. That is all we are
saying here.
I am not saying that my colleague on
the other side is not well meaning, but
nothing he has said will protect the
people with preexisting conditions
from the problems with the Trump
guidance. So I would ask my colleagues
to support this bill.
Mr. Chairman, I include in the
RECORD two letters from various non-
profit health organizations supporting
the bill.
MAY 8, 2019.
Hon. GREG WALDEN,
Ranking Member,
House Energy & Commerce Committee,
Washington, DC.
DEAR RANKING MEMBER WALDEN: Our 35 or-
ganizations, representing the interests of the
millions of patients and consumers who live
with serious, acute, and chronic conditions,
have worked together for many months to
ensure that patient voices are reflected in
the ongoing Congressional debate regarding
the accessibility of health coverage for all
Americans and families. In March 2017, we
identified three overarching principles to
guide and measure any work to further re-
form and improve the nation’s health insur-
ance system. Our core principles are that
health care must be adequate, affordable,
and accessible. Together, our organizations
understand what individuals and families
need to prevent disease, manage health, and
cure illness. As the 116th Congress pro-
gresses, we welcome the opportunity to work
with members on both sides of the aisle on
solutions that will preserve coverage for in-
dividuals who are currently covered, extend
coverage to those who remain uninsured, and
lower costs and improve quality for all.
Prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), in-
dividuals who were in the most need of
health insurance coverage—including older
and sicker Americans and people living with
pre-existing conditions—often found it dif-
ficult, if not impossible, to obtain health in-
surance that provided the coverage they
needed. Many individuals were denied cov-
erage due to their pre-existing conditions or
were charged outrageous premiums and/or
were left with inadequate benefit packages.
Without access to comprehensive health
coverage they could afford, many patients
with serious and chronic conditions were
often forced to delay or forego necessary
health care. Before the patient protections
provided under the ACA, more than half of
heart patients reported difficulty paying for
their care and of those patients more than 40
percent said they had delayed care or had
not filled prescriptions. Uninsured patients
with diabetes were six times as likely to
forgo necessary medical care than those with
coverage. Uninsured patients were less likely
to be screened for cancer and more likely to
be diagnosed with later stage disease which
is harder to survive and more costly to treat.
Individuals and families with pre-existing
conditions rely on critical protections in
current law to help them access comprehen-
sive, affordable health coverage that meets
their medical needs. Unfortunately, the ar-
guments of the plaintiffs and the recent
change of opinion by the Department of Jus-
tice in the Texas v. U.S. case continue to
represent a serious threat to these protec-
tions. We are troubled by the argument made
by the plaintiffs and DOJ that the court
must invalidate the entire ACA due to Con-
gress’ repeal of the individual mandate, as
many provisions of the ACA directly protect
people with pre-existing conditions.
Our organizations appreciate that mem-
bers of Congress share our concerns about
the potential impact of Texas v. U.S. on peo-
ple with pre-existing conditions. Several
bills have been introduced in response to this
case, from H. Res. 14, which authorized the
Speaker, on behalf of the House of Rep-
resentatives, to intervene in the case of
Texas v. United States, to S. 1125, the Pro-
tect Act, and H.R. 692, the Pre-existing Con-
ditions Protection Act of 2019.
Some of these bills—including S. 1125 and
H.R. 692—attempt to provide protection to
people with pre-existing conditions should
the ACA be invalidated. We recognize and ap-
preciate the sponsors’ efforts, and know that
in many cases, in response to stakeholder
feedback, sponsors have revised previous
drafts of these bills to offer additional pro-
tections for consumers, including those with
pre-existing conditions. However, we remain
concerned that the policies outlined in these
bills fall far short of the comprehensive pro-
tections and coverage expansion included in
current law.
As you are aware, current law requires
issuers to comply with a set of provisions
that work together to promote adequate, af-
fordable, and accessible coverage for people
with pre-existing conditions. A holistic ap-
proach that includes—but is not limited to—
community rating, guaranteed issue, essen-
tial health benefits, cost-sharing limits, a

prohibition of lifetime and annual limits, al-
lowing young people to stay on their par-
ents’ insurance to age 26, the ban on pre-ex-
isting condition exclusions, and other impor-
tant provisions protect people with serious
health care needs from discriminatory cov-
erage practices and promote access to afford-
able coverage. Medicaid expansion also
brought coverage to millions of Americans
who were previously uninsured, many of
whom went without vital care. These poli-
cies are inextricably linked and repealing
any of them threatens access to critical care
for people with life-threatening, disabling,
chronic, or serious health care needs.
We hope that you will keep these critical
patient protections and the interlocking
functions of current law that safeguard cov-
erage for consumers, patients, and individ-
uals with pre-existing conditions at the front
of your mind during the 116th Congress. We
are grateful that Congress is committed to
exploring both immediate and long-term ap-
proaches that can be taken to shore up and
strengthen the individual insurance market
and we remain ready and willing to work
with Congress to achieve that goal and pro-
vide all Americans with the health care they
need and deserve. If you have any questions

Re Letter of Support from 23 Patient and
Consumer Advocacy Organizations for
H.R. 986.
Hon. ANN MCLANE KUSTER,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE KUSTER: Our 24 or-
ganizations, representing the interests of the
millions of patients and consumers who live
with serious, acute, and chronic conditions,
have worked together for many months to
ensure that patient voices are reflected in
the ongoing Congressional debate regarding
the accessibility of health coverage for all
Americans and families. Today, we write in
strong support of your legislation to protect
people with pre-existing conditions who re-
ceive coverage in the individual market-
place. The Protecting Americans with Pre-
existing Conditions Act of 2019, H.R. 986,
would require the Administration to rescind
its Section 1332 State Relief and Empower-
ment Waivers Guidance, released on October
22, 2018 (1332 guidance). We are concerned
about the impact that this guidance could
have on the people we represent and applaud
your introduction of this bill.
In March 2017, we identified three over-
arching principles to guide and measure any
work to further reform and improve the na-
tion’s health insurance system. Our core
principles are that health insurance coverage
must be adequate, affordable, and accessible.
Together, our organizations understand what
individuals and families need to prevent dis-
ease, manage health, and cure illness. Our
organizations are deeply concerned about
how the new 1332 guidance will affect the in-
dividual marketplace’s stability in states
that choose to pursue some of the policies al-
lowed under this guidance, including those
that promote short term plans and other
substandard coverage. We are pleased that
this legislation represents a significant and
meaningful step towards protecting all
Americans from coverage that does not cover
what they need to promote their health and
well-being.
As you know, the 1332 guidance substan-
tially erodes the guardrails governing cov-
erage that people with pre-existing condi-
tions such as cystic fibrosis, lung disease,
cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, rare
disorders, pregnant women, and many others
rely on in the individual marketplace. Of
particular concern, the new guidance would
allow states to let individuals use advanced
premium tax credits to purchase non-compli-
ant short-term, limited duration insurance
plans—which could further draw younger,
healthier people out of the risk pool for com-
prehensive insurance and drive up premiums
for those who need comprehensive coverage.
The guidance also eliminates protections for
vulnerable populations, such as individuals
with low incomes and those with chronic and
serious health issues, by removing the re-
quirement to safeguard those populations
under any waiver. We are deeply concerned
by this as these changes fundamentally alter
the nature of the Section 1332 waiver pro-
gram and jeopardize adequate, affordable
coverage for people with pre-existing condi-
tions in the individual market. Halting the
implementation of this guidance will protect
people with pre-existing conditions from the
repercussions of these market destabilizing
actions.
H.R. 986 represents a significant step to-
wards protecting patients and consumers.
Yet, we also recognize that there is much
more that needs to be done to improve upon
our current system of care, including mak-
ing coverage more accessible and affordable.
Up until this year, health insurance enroll-
ment has steadily increased, and, with it, the
promise of a more diverse risk pool and
greater protection for people with serious
health care needs. However, the recent rein-
terpretation of the guidelines is jeopardizing
enrollment. Shortened enrollment periods,
fewer resources for outreach and education
and less funding for consumer navigators not
only creates confusion for consumers but di-
rectly impacts the number of individuals
who enroll in Marketplace coverage. Without
Congressional action, these trends will make
it harder for many to access coverage and
will further contribute to the destabilization
of insurance markets and result in higher
premiums for many enrollees.
Making high-quality coverage and care
more affordable is also a high priority for
the people that we represent. Passage of leg-
islation that expands access to and the level
of advance premium tax credits, fixes the
family glitch, creates a nationwide reinsur-
ance program, and reduces systemic health
care costs could significantly ease the cost
burden for people of all income levels who
rely on the individual marketplace for cov-
erage. We urge Congress to support legisla-
tion that maintains the quality of coverage
while expanding access and affordability.
Again, thank you for your leadership on
this critical issue for people with pre-exist-
ing conditions. We support your efforts to
halt the implementation of the 2018 guid-
ance, ensuring the guidance from 2015 re-
mains intact and promoting stability in the
individual marketplace. We urge members of
Congress to vote for H.R. 986.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I want
to voice my support for H.R. 986, the Pro-
tecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions
Act of 2019.
This legislation will rescind the administra-
tion’s October 2018 Section 1332 waiver guid-
ance, which is an essential step to protect pre-
existing conditions and prevent the loss of
comprehensive coverage plans. We will en-
sure that our constituents will be able to ac-
cess the essential health benefits guaranteed
under the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act.
As representatives of Americans from all
corners of our country, we have a responsi-
bility to protect the most vulnerable in our
communities. We must ensure that our con-
stituents, many with pre-existing conditions,
are not placed at risk of losing their health in-
surance coverage or fall victim to plans which
fail to offer essential health benefits.
As the first registered nurse elected to the
United States Congress, I am proud to safe-
guard the healthcare of my constituents and
all Americans through my support of the Pro-
tecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions
Act of 2019.
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I rise
today to stand up for my neighbors—including
those with preexisting conditions—by sup-
porting H.R. 986, the Protecting Americans
with Preexisting Conditions Act. Health care in
American should be affordable and accessible
to all. Passage of the Affordable Care Act in
2010 ensured that our neighbors with a pre-
existing condition, like asthma, heart disease
or cancer, would no longer be denied insur-
ance.
It is unfortunate that the President and Re-
publicans in Congress have made it their mis-
sion to sabotage the affordable health care of
hardworking families, including gutting protec-
tions for people with preexisting conditions
and take away affordable, quality health care
from millions of Americans. I am cosponsoring
the Protecting Americans with Preexisting
Conditions Act to safeguard Americans from
the Trump administration’s efforts to undo the
affordability and comprehensiveness of our

health care. H.R. 986 will overturn the Trump
administration’s expansion of Section 1332
waivers that were originally included in the Af-
fordable Care Act to give states flexibility to
experiment with insurance reforms that could
improve the health and well-being of citizens.
Unfortunately, the administration would instead
use those waivers to weaken standards put in
place to protect the health of Americans—es-
pecially our neighbors with preexisting condi-
tions.
H.R. 986 would end the administration’s
push of Americans into sub-par and deceptive
junk plans that many times exclude coverage
for preexisting conditions. These plans do not
provide basic benefits or financial protection
standard and would return patients to the days
when they would discover only when they get
sick or God forbid get a cancer diagnosis that
their plan imposes unreasonable limits on cov-
erage and excludes vital benefits. They dis-
criminate based on age, health status and
gender.
Democrats will not allow the Trump adminis-
tration and Congressional Republicans to drive
premiums higher in the individual market and
rip coverage away from those that need it the
most. I want to thank my colleague Rep.
KUSTER for helping lead this charge and I urge
my colleagues to support H.R. 986 and sup-
port our neighbors with preexisting conditions.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) On October 24, 2018, the administration
published new guidance to carry out section
1332 of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18052) entitled ‘‘State Re-
lief and Empowerment Waivers’’ (83 Fed.
Reg. 53575).
(2) The new guidance encourages States to
provide health insurance coverage through
insurance plans that may discriminate
against individuals with preexisting health
conditions, including the one in four Ameri-
cans living with a disability.
(3) The implementation and enforcement of
the new guidance weakens protections for
the millions of Americans living with pre-
existing health conditions and jeopardizes
Americans’ access to quality, affordable
health insurance coverage.
Page 3, line 6, redesignate section 2 as sec-
tion 3.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 357, the gentleman from Rhode
Island (Mr. LANGEVIN) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Rhode Island.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, Americans with dis-
abilities have always faced significant
barriers to healthcare. A decade ago,
an insurer could charge a family an ex-
orbitant amount to cover a child,
merely because the child had asthma.
An insurer could tell an amputee that
they would cover her medical equip-
ment except for treatment related to
her amputated limb. Or an insurer
could flat-out deny coverage to the vic-
tim of an accidental shooting at the
age of 16 simply because he had a spi-
nal cord injury.
Essentially, insurers could legally
discriminate against individuals with
disabilities and face no consequences.
That is absolutely outrageous, Mr.
Chairman.
Then Congress finally passed the Af-
fordable Care Act and started to bring
those barriers down. For the first time,
people with preexisting health condi-
tions, including the one in four Ameri-
cans living with a disability, no longer
had to worry about whether they would
be denied comprehensive health insur-
ance.
b 1530
Coverage of essential health benefits
meant a mother with a traumatic brain
injury could obtain rehabilitative serv-
ices and learn how to walk, a man with
Parkinson’s could access medication to
control his tremors, or a child with a
vision impairment could visit an eye
doctor to prevent further vision loss.
This access to healthcare is vital be-
cause, when Americans with disabil-
ities are healthy, they can stay active
with their families, pursue fulfilling
careers, and engage in their commu-
nities.
Unfortunately, the Trump adminis-
tration is, once again, working to raise
barriers to health coverage instead of
working to eliminate them. The ad-
ministration’s October 2018 guidance
encourages States to allow insurers to
offer short-term, limited-duration
plans that do not have to provide cov-
erage of preexisting conditions or es-
sential health benefits.
This means insurers offering these
junk plans can discriminate against
disabled individuals by charging astro-
nomical prices, excluding necessary
treatments from coverage, or denying
an individual health insurance alto-
gether.
This is outrageous. If you are having
deja vu, it is because this is exactly
what was happening to Americans with
disabilities before the passage of the
Affordable Care Act.
The amendment that I am offering
today makes clear exactly what people
with disabilities have to lose if States
act on the administration’s guidance.
I have spent my near two decades in
Congress championing efforts to elimi-
nate barriers to access and integration
for people with disabilities and helping
my fellow Americans understand their
great potential.
But, fundamentally, none of that
matters if people with disabilities are
not healthy because insurers deny
them coverage to treat their condi-
tions.
The damage from the administra-
tion’s guidance would be borne dis-
proportionately by the disabled com-
munity, my community, and my
amendment makes that clear.
Whether someone is born with a dis-
ability, develops a disability, or be-
comes disabled due to an accident, that
disability—I assure you—happened by
chance, not by choice.
Even the healthiest 30-year-old today
could be in a car accident tonight and
wake up with a lifelong disability to-
morrow; and, if that 30-year-old had
one of these junk plans, much of the
cost of that care would fall on his or
her own shoulders, and they would be
on their own.
I had hoped that, 9 years after the
passage of the Affordable Care Act, I
would no longer have to come here and
defend the idea that quality, affordable
healthcare is a right and not a privi-
lege. But, once again, here we are.
Mr. Chairman, I support my friend
Congresswoman KUSTER’s underlying
legislation, and I ask my colleagues to
support my amendment to make clear
the damage the Trump administra-
tion’s guidance would cause to people
with disabilities.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim

ment.

again, cite the guidance from the CMS
director, Ms. Seema Verma, where she
states that. And that will be in the
RECORD.
Again, I think what we are trying to
do here is give States more flexibility
to bring down the cost of health insur-
ance, while following these guidelines
as outlined.
As I mentioned earlier in the debate,
high deductibles are pricing people out
of coverage, and by that, I mean they
are walking away from getting the care
that they need because they can’t pay
for it; or they are driving up their cred-
it card debt, wiping out their savings,
they are having to take another job,
they are borrowing money from others.
So, what the Trump administration
is trying to do is build on what the
Obama administration created, 1332
waivers, that have, frankly, been very
successful in many, many States.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I just
want to, in reference to the gentleman
from Oregon’s comments, state that
the plans under the Obama administra-
tion were supposed to be very short in
duration, for a 3-month period, while
individuals sought more comprehen-
sive, appropriate health coverage ac-
cording to their needs.
It wasn’t supposed to be a replace-
ment for a good quality, affordable
healthcare plan that would cover pre-
existing conditions and essential
health benefits to identify problems
early on, a potential lifelong or a very
serious illness with long-term health
consequences that could potentially
even lead to losing one’s life.
They took what was supposed to be a
stopgap, and now they are trying to
make that a permanent plan. That is
just wrong.

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF
MARYLAND
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 2 printed in part
A of House Report 116–51.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 3, line 17, insert after the period the
following new sentence: ‘‘Nothing in the pre-
vious sentence shall be construed to affect
the approval of waivers under section 1332 of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act (42 U.S.C. 18052) that establish reinsur-
ance programs that are consistent with the
requirements under subsection (b)(1) of such
section (42 U.S.C. 18052(b)(1)), lower health
insurance premiums, and protect health in-
surance coverage for people with preexisting
conditions.’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 357, the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the un-
derlying bill that will preserve protec-
tions for hundreds of thousands of
Marylanders and Americans who, like
me, have a preexisting condition.
And I rise in support, of course, of
my amendment to protect States
which are acting to strengthen their
insurance marketplaces, lower pre-
miums, and expand access to high-qual-
ity care by preserving their reinsur-
ance programs that they have estab-
lished.
For more than 2 years, the President,
in concert with Republicans in Con-
gress, have tried every trick in the
book to undermine the Affordable Care
Act. They tried repealing it, taking it
to the courts, and now want to allow
States to gut protections for those the
Affordable Care Act helped most.
These attacks jeopardize healthcare
for Americans with chronic conditions
like asthma, high blood pressure, and
diabetes and threaten to bankrupt
thousands of families with a loved one
who has fallen ill due to no fault of
their own.
It is not just bad policy. It is fun-
damentally cruel.
That is why, in the face of this on-
slaught by the Trump administration
to make the Affordable Care Act less
effective, we must provide States with
every tool in the toolbox to keep pre-
miums down, while preventing the
Trump administration from giving
States the power to gut essential pro-
tections.
I firmly believe that States should
have the power and flexibility to inno-
vate and find healthcare solutions that
work best for them. The Affordable
Care Act always envisioned a critical
role for States.
States design their own exchanges,
shape their Medicaid programs, and
take the lead in enforcing patient pro-
tections and reviewing rate increases.
These waivers took on new impor-
tance after President Trump and the
Republican Congress failed to repeal
ObamaCare and, instead, sought to un-
dermine the Affordable Care Act by
eliminating the requirement to obtain
health insurance, ending cost-sharing
payments for low-income individuals,
passing regulations that encouraged
short-term and junk insurance, and
defunding advertising and outreach
during open enrollment.
This sabotage has caused more fami-
lies to pay higher premiums and made
fewer people able to get the high-qual-
ity care they deserve.
States acted to counteract these ef-
forts by establishing reinsurance pro-
grams and applying for State innova-
tion waivers.
Reinsurance programs protect insur-
ers from very high, unpredictable med-
ical expenses incurred by their Mem-
bers.
Alaska, Minnesota, Oregon, Maine,
Wisconsin, New Jersey, and my own
State of Maryland have all received
Federal approval to establish reinsur-
ance programs.
These are the very programs my
amendment seeks to protect. These
programs work and meet the shared
goal of making health insurance af-
fordable and accessible to all Ameri-
cans, including those with preexisting
conditions.
Reinsurance programs have been able
to cut premiums by 20 percent, on aver-
age, and save the Federal Government
nearly $1 billion.
Maryland saw the biggest savings,
lowering individual premiums by more
than 43 percent. These lower premiums
will help entice younger and healthier
individuals to get insurance, making
healthcare more affordable for every-
one.
While we have a President in the
White House and Republicans in Con-
gress who have made healthcare pro-
hibitively expensive and stripped pro-
tections for those who need it most, it
is imperative that this Congress pro-
tect our partners at the State level
who are working with us to protect
healthcare for all Americans.
My amendment will protect these in-
novative reinsurance programs and en-
courage more States to adopt them.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition to the gentle-
man’s amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Or-
egon is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I am
not necessarily opposed to his amend-
ment, but I do think it is important to
talk about the issues that really mat-
ter when it comes to affordable
healthcare.
Again, when we talked about giving
States the authority to innovate and
to protect their citizens, we are for
that. I come from a State that pio-
neered the Oregon Health Plan.
I was there. I created a select com-
mittee when I was the Republican ma-
jority leader of the Oregon House,
when we finally got the waiver from
the Federal Government after a couple
of years to actually implement the Or-
egon Health Plan. It was very creative
about how to hold down healthcare
costs and expand coverage and do all
those things. We have worked on a lot
of different issues over the years.
What we did with the President
today, I think, is really important and,
that is, looked at this issue of surprise
billing: If you follow all the rules, you
go to a hospital that is in your net-
work, and let’s say some provider gets
sick in the night and they substitute
somebody else who doesn’t turn out to
be in your network and then, weeks
later, you get an astronomical bill
through no fault of your own.

daughter had had, I think, some sort of

surgery, and the physician, on the way
out, said: Oh, by the way, I want you to
do just a little urine test here. We are
going to run an analysis.
So she did, left, and, a period of time
later, got a bill for $17,000.
Her dad is a doctor and said: How did
this happen?
Well, it turned out whoever did the
test was not in the network of her in-
surance. She didn’t know.
What are you going to do? You have
had whatever surgery she had, and on
the way out the doctor says: Hey, by
the way, give us a little sample. I just
want to run a test because I have got
you on this drug, and I want to make
sure it is all working right.
Then a $17,000 bill arrives a couple of
months later.
They were there with the President
today in the Roosevelt Room at this bi-
partisan event. And her dad negotiated.
He couldn’t say what level, but it was
certainly not what the insurer would
have paid.
Do you know what the insurer would
have paid for that, in network? A hun-
dred bucks. He said you can probably
get the test done now for $25.
A $17,000 bill arrives.
This is what is happening to Ameri-
cans who have insurance, and that is
why we have got to deal with the sur-
prise billing issue. It is why we have to
squeeze the juice out of the middle of
the healthcare delivery system.
We do all these great innovations.
And Republicans led the effort on the
21st Century Cures Act.
We met with Dr. Francis Collins yes-
terday, the extraordinary leader of
NIH; the longest-serving President-ap-
pointed—under Obama—NIH director
in the history of our country.
Because of what we put forward to
dramatically increase investment in
NIH—Republicans led that effort, FRED
UPTON, but joined with DIANA
DEGETTE, a Democrat out of Colorado,
and a bunch of us—they are now find-
ing cures.
Dr. Collins said yesterday they have
identified now 6,500 genetic diseases
where they now can figure out, I’ll say,
the misspelling of the DNA code.
Some of my colleagues may have
seen on ‘‘60 Minutes’’ Dr. Collins talk-
ing about that they think they found a
cure for sickle cell anemia. They found
a misspelling—one letter misspelled in
that big chain of DNA—that they were
able to go in with our new tech-
nology—some of it is a result of what
we have done collaboratively here—and
change, alter, that letter.
And they have these people now that
there is no evidence of sickle cell in
their blood platelets.
There are 6,500 diseases that they
now know the misspelling. Now they
have got to figure out how to train
your body, using immuno technology,
to have your own cells turned on in a
little different way and go after these
diseases.
These are remarkable advances in
lifesaving medicines and treatments.
b 1545
We, I think, as a country, have to fig-
ure out how we pay for that, if each
one of these is individualized.
Our system is antiquated and doesn’t
deal with this effectively. We are going
to have to figure that out because a
lifesaving cure isn’t going to cure a life
if people can’t afford to get the medi-
cine.
We also need to drill down on tele-
health and telemedicine.
One of our colleagues today was talk-
ing about mental health services. My
district is bigger than any State east of
the Mississippi, unless you have to
count Lake Michigan with Michigan,
which, of course, you do. So telehealth
really matters, and we are getting
great results for our veterans and for
our citizens using telehealth. But our
providers don’t often get paid for the
service they provide over telehealth.
Why? That is something we have to ad-
dress.
You go one thing after another after
another here, where we should be
spending our valuable legislative time
solving the problems that real Ameri-
cans run into every day of the week:
How do I pay the bill? You tell me I
have insurance, and I do, and I pay a
record—I don’t know whose premium
under ObamaCare went down $2,500 a
month, but I will talk about this more.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair,
I join my colleague, the gentleman

ance programs. It is my amendment

sider amendment No. 3 printed in part
A of House Report 116–51.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
In section 2, insert ‘‘, including any such
action that would result in individuals losing
health insurance coverage that includes the
essential health benefits package (as defined
in subsection (a) of section 1302 of the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42
U.S.C. 18022(a)) without regard to any waiver
of any provision of such package under a

health benefit described in subsection
(b)(1)(D) of such section’’ after ‘‘(October 24,

lution 357, the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in support of my amendment to
H.R. 986, the Protecting Patients with
Preexisting Conditions Act.
Quality, affordable healthcare is a
fundamental human right, period. No
one should have to face financial ruin
while they are fighting for their life.
When people are using GoFundMe
pages to pay their medical bills, when
parents are burying their children who
ration their insulin to pay their stu-
dent loans, we know that we are in the
midst of a moral crisis. Yet, we must
contend with an administration that is
determined to roll back these rights
and protections.
Each of us has loved ones whose lives
are put in conditional jeopardy when
we erode protections for preexisting
conditions. These efforts put lives at
risk, and we are here today to fight
back.
In my district, the Massachusetts
Seventh, half the residents are living
with preexisting conditions. Families
are struggling with some of the highest
per capita healthcare costs in the Na-
tion, even as they live in the shadow of
some of the best healthcare institu-
tions in the world.
In my district, travel 3 miles from
Back Bay to Roxbury, and life expect-
ancy drops 30 years—30.
Since its implementation, the ACA
has provided critical protections for
the nearly 3 million residents of Massa-
chusetts living with preexisting condi-
tions.
Our families, our neighbors, our com-
munities are depending on us to uphold
the lifesaving protections for people
with preexisting conditions. We can do
that today by passing H.R. 986.
Mr. Chair, my amendment to H.R. 986
affirms that women’s healthcare isn’t
optional. It is an essential benefit
every plan must cover. At a time when
more than 67 million American women
and girls are living with a preexisting
condition, we cannot—no, we will not
go backward.
At a time when life expectancy is de-
clining because of gun violence, opioid
use, and a maternal mortality crisis,
we cannot afford to compromise on
these essential services.
Before the ACA, Mr. Chair, typical
insurance plans considered maternity
care a luxury benefit, and women con-
sistently paid more for primary care
than men. In fact, women who have
given birth, had a C-section, or were
living with HIV or a previous breast
cancer diagnosis could be considered to

have preexisting conditions and denied
coverage.
Thanks to the ACA, many women
who were previously uninsured gained
health coverage, including vital access
to preventative care.
This administration’s cruel and dan-
gerous guidance would weaken these
provisions and allow insurers to sell
skimpy plans that can exclude cov-
erage like maternity care and pediatric
services.
The ACA is our floor, not our ceiling.
We must continue to fight for universal
healthcare. We must continue to push
for a healthcare system that meets the
needs of the people we represent, a
healthcare system that sees all people,
hears all people, and cares for all peo-
ple in a way that promotes safety, dig-
nity, and respect. I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition, although I am not
necessarily opposed to the gentle-
woman’s amendment.

gentleman from Oregon is recognized

There was no objection.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I reserve

Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I appreciate
the gentlewoman’s comments and her
amendment. I don’t intend to oppose
her amendment, but I do want to pick
up on something she said that is really
important.
The gentlewoman mentioned opioids.
In the last Congress, when I chaired
the Energy and Commerce Committee,
I helped lead the bipartisan effort to
produce 60 pieces of legislation dealing
with the opioid crisis, to help those
who were addicted get the assistance
they need, to get resources into our
communities to help medical advance-
ments to find non-opioid-related med-
ical treatments, and to stop fentanyl
from coming into our country.
I didn’t get the opportunity, but I
hope the President and his team will
continue to raise this issue with the
Chinese leadership when they come be-
cause a lot of this illicit fentanyl is
being produced in China and then com-
ing to the United States.
Dr. BURGESS, who was our chair of
the Subcommittee on Health and is
now the top Republican, I think went
up to the chairman’s district in New
Jersey and viewed one of the inter-
national mail processing facilities. At
least, it was in New Jersey. I don’t
know its precise location.
Together we said, working with the
Trump administration’s FDA Commis-
sioner, we have to do more at these
mail processing facilities to stop
fentanyl from coming in.
By the way, fentanyl is like 100 times
more potent than morphine. If you had
a salt shaker and put out, I don’t know,
10, 15 grains of salt and ingested that,
if it was fentanyl, it would kill you.
We said let’s put more resources to-
ward stopping illegal fentanyl from
coming into the United States, and we
are doing that now. We are beefing that
up.
It comes in through Mexico as well.
It is both China and Mexico. It is cre-
ating pockets of death in our commu-
nities. Especially in some of our urban
areas, we have seen where it gets mixed
in with heroin to give even a higher
high or whatever. Then you see groups
of people who take this, not knowing it
has been jacked up with fentanyl, and
you have a whole group that dies.
The most insidious discussion or inci-
dent I heard about was a parent who I
got to know a little bit, whose daugh-
ter, he told me, self-medicated occa-
sionally with heroin, and she died in
college.
When they did the autopsy, they fig-
ured out she had been given 100 percent
fentanyl. It wasn’t a mix with heroin,
Mr. Chair.
The tragedy of that was, he felt that
her supplier knew she was an occa-
sional user so had low tolerance and,
basically, probably killed her to prove
to his other buyers that he had the
most potent stuff on the street.
A colleague of ours, Mr. KATKO, who
was a prosecutor before he came to the
Congress, he and I were having a dis-
cussion on this matter. He said he pros-
ecuted a case just like that. That is
how evil this stuff is.
As we look at the whole panoply of
issues about healthcare, mental health
services, addiction services, stopping
these things from coming in, we can
find a lot of common ground.
Republicans supported protections
for preexisting conditions before the
ACA, during the ACA, after the ACA
today. We did. Same with putting kids
on your policies at 26. We agreed with
those principles.
But the ObamaCare act was rammed
through this House and the Senate, and
we weren’t even allowed to bring any of
the 90-some amendments we offered to
the floor. We were completely shut out
of that process. It was a horrible proc-
ess, and it shouldn’t be repeated.
I hear a lot about how we voted to re-
peal it a bazillion times. Well, you
know what? If you go through and dis-
sect those votes, there were a whole
bunch of Democrats that voted with us.
The President at the time, President
Obama, signed some of that legislation
because even he admitted there were
problems in the ACA.
Going forward, I hope we can address
the big problem in America, which is
high-cost insurance, high deductibles,
but, moreover, the high cost of
healthcare itself because it is pretty
hard to go home and explain why
things cost what they do today.
We have to get around the high cost
issue. The access issue, that is where
earlier I talked about telehealth and
telemedicine. There is a lot of work we
will do together.
Unfortunately, this is a mislabeled
bill today. The laws governing 1332
waivers prohibit what the majority is
concerned about. But I don’t have op-
position to this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

rewrote America’s mental health laws
for the first time since John Kennedy
signed the last bill into law before he
was tragically assassinated in Texas. It
was a lot of work, but it was bipartisan
work.
Not only did we look at those mental
health laws that were on the books, be-
cause what happens around here is
somebody comes up with a new idea, so
you put a new program in place, and
you give an authorization. Maybe it
gets funded, maybe it doesn’t. A year

this review and said, look, we have to
help kids with mental illness, and we
need to help adults.
We could deal with a lot of the vio-
lence in America if you got people
care. It is not that everybody with
mental illness goes violent, but we do
know that mental health services help
people in every way and that the pro-
grams we had—we had a lot of them—
weren’t funded, weren’t funded prop-
erly, or didn’t work. Some worked bet-
ter than others.
We had this comprehensive review in
the Energy and Commerce Committee
of these different programs the Federal
Government has. Then we said, going
forward—kind of what you are trying
to do with this GAO report in a little
different way—let’s measure the effi-
cacy of the programs we do have.
b 1600
Let’s find out what is working in our
communities, and then let’s get aid
into our communities directly. Let’s
cut out the middle bureaucracy and get
assistance, financial assistance into
our communities.
So we passed that. That is now the
law of the land. And I think last year
we were able to get money into that, fi-
nally, and I hope we can do more going
forward, because we know that—I am
being a little sarcastic here, but it is
an extraordinary finding. Guess what?
Your brain and your physical body are
connected. Who knew, right? And we
have all known that.
So I supported the effort to get the
same treatment under insurance for
mental health as physical health be-
cause they are completely connected.
So going forward, we have got to make
sure that that bond is strengthened,
not weakened, and that people con-
tinue to get help for mental health.
I am a big believer in that. I know it
works. It is fascinating to see, with the
whole genome project, now they can do
a genetic test and figure out which
mental health drug will work in your
body or my body. We didn’t know that
before, and now they can figure out
which one will actually work for you or
me or whomever.
I hope we have lifted the stigma on
people needing mental health services.
We are just a big bag of chemicals, and
things get out of balance. So I hope
that we have lifted that as we did, I be-
lieve, on addiction.
There are a lot of people, and over
time people evolve their views and get
better understandings, and I think over
time we realized that people with drug
addictions—especially this came out
through our opioids work—weren’t nec-
essarily criminals. They weren’t to be
shunned from society.
What we learned in the course of our
work on opioids was, when I talked to
parents whose kids had a high school
football injury or something and the
doctor gave them a painkiller, all of a
sudden, this stuff is so addictive, a few
treatments and they are hooked, and
then they need more and more and
more and more.
I always remember my friend Mr.
RUSH from the Chicago area, when we
were talking about treatment for
opioids, said: That is great you are
doing that. When the people I rep-
resented had issues in terms of crack
cocaine and all, you just called them
druggies and you put them in prison.
That affected what we wrote and how
we legislated, and we moved away from
calling it treatment for opioids to peo-
ple with substance abuse because we
realized we needed to think broader as
a country and as a Congress, and we did
that and we changed the law. All that
now is law to deal with opioids and
mental health services.
So, Mr. Chairman, I don’t have an ob-
jection to this amendment, but there is
a lot we have done and a lot more we
need to do, and I will talk about some
of the things we need to do going for-
ward.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from California (Mr. HARDER).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MR. WALDEN
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 5 printed in part
A of House Report 116–51.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk. I believe it
is No. 5, printed in House Report 116–51.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Beginning on page 3, line 4, strike ‘‘Pro-
tecting Americans with Preexisting Condi-
tions Act of 2019’’ and insert ‘‘This Bill Actu-
ally Has Nothing to do with Protecting
Americans with Preexisting Conditions
Act’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 357, the gentleman from Oregon
(Mr. WALDEN) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oregon.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I would
just say, in terms of this amendment,
it is just trying to make the point that
the bill we have before us today is not
as described or labeled. In our opinion,
it is more about politics and gotcha
politics than it is about the underlying
issue.
We know from the Department of
Health and Human Services, they have
made it clear in the letter from the Di-
rector who would approve these waiv-
ers that she believes that the under-
lying law protects people with pre-
existing conditions and all the other
things I talked about earlier, that they
can’t waive that law—they cannot.
So I would enter into the RECORD
again, Mr. Chairman, as part of my re-
marks, her comments about the guid-
ance, the 2018 guidance, and where she
says it does not erode ObamaCare’s
preexisting condition provisions. She is
the one in charge of this. That is what
she is saying.
But I want to talk about something
else she says in this letter about pre-
miums and the costs to people getting
their insurance. She says: ‘‘Under the
PPACA’’—or ObamaCare or the Afford-
able Care Act, however you want to de-
scribe it—‘‘we have seen dramatically
higher premiums and decreased options
for millions of consumers, in large part
due to the law’s overly prescriptive
mandates and excessive Federal Gov-
ernment takeover of areas tradition-
ally left under State oversight.’’
She points out: ‘‘In 2019, the average
monthly premium for a benchmark
plan for a family of four on
HealthCare.gov is now over $1,500,
which can easily exceed a family’s
mortgage.’’
Continuing with her letter to me, she
said: ‘‘There are many areas of the
country with far higher monthly pre-
miums. For example, a of 60-year-old
couple living in Grand Island, Ne-
braska, making $70,000 a year, will need
to pay over $3,000 per month for the
lowest cost silver plan available. That
is almost $38,000 per year for a plan
with an $11,100 deductible.’’
Now, think about that, Mr. Chair.
This is a couple that is making $70,000
a year. They are 60 years old. They live
in Nebraska, and $3,000 a month in pre-
miums, over $3,000, and an $11,000 de-
ductible. That is over $48,000, and they
only make $70,000 a year.
This is happening in America today.
Heck, it is happening in Nebraska right
now. So what we are saying is people
are walking away.
She goes on to say: ‘‘For millions of
Americans, coverage this expensive is
not a realistic option, and many choose
to go without coverage at all. In fact,
after average premiums rose by 21 per-
cent, 1.3 million unsubsidized people
walked away from the market in 2017.’’
Those are the people we need to be
helping. There is a lot more we need to
be doing. I will put the rest of this in
the RECORD. But I think everybody
knows we are just trying make a point
with this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent
to withdraw my amendment.
The CHAIR. Is there objection to the
request of the gentleman from Oregon?
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I object.

The CHAIR. Objection is heard.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition to the amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
New Jersey will suspend.
The gentleman from Oregon is recog-
nized.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, just to
clarify, from a parliamentary stand-
point, I was just going to withdraw the
amendment, but if the gentleman
wants to speak on it, I can ask unani-
mous consent to withdraw it after he
speaks.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition to the
gentleman from Oregon’s amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, it dis-
turbs me, I guess, that my colleague on
the other side, whom I greatly respect,
keeps mentioning this letter from
Seema Verma, the CMS Administrator.
Nothing that she says in her letter is
in any way going to change the guid-
ance that she and the Trump adminis-
tration have put forward that would
undermine people with preexisting con-
ditions’ ability to get good insurance if
this guidance is allowed to continue
and States get waivers pursuant to the
guidance, because of, again, the issue
of affordability.
You see, the problem is that the 1332
waivers, the way they are set out in
the ACA, have certain guardrails, if
you will, to prevent waivers that would
allow for junk insurance and other
policies that would undermine people
with preexisting conditions from get-
ting good insurance.
Those guardrails say that any kind of
waiver has to guarantee affordability,
has to guarantee comprehensive cov-
erage, the essential benefits package,
robust coverage, and also not reduce
the number of people who are insured.
This guidance that Seema Verma and
the Trump administration have put
forward does exactly the opposite, be-
cause it allows insurance to be sold, if
a State seeks to do so, that would
eliminate, for example, hospitalization
or eliminate mental health coverage or
eliminate coverage for maternity care.
Now, if you are someone with pre-
existing conditions and they eliminate
coverage for your preexisting condi-
tion, that relates to your preexisting
condition, you might as well not even
have insurance, and that is why we say
it is junk. It lets a waiver be granted
that would allow the insurance compa-
nies of that State to charge more based
on age, based on sex. I mean, the list
goes on.
So Seema Verma can send out all the
letters she wants, but it doesn’t mean
anything.
I like to say, you know, one of the
things that disturbs me most, also, is
we on the Democratic side, myself and
some of the other chairmen of some of
the other committees, sent a letter and
a request, because it has been pointed
out repeatedly that Seema Verma has
been putting out contracts up to $4
million a year to basically promote
herself, and that is being investigated
right now as we speak.
So, again, I don’t like to say bad
things about people, but the bottom
line is she is in no position to be telling
us what is in this guidance. This guid-
ance is going to hurt people with pre-
existing conditions, and there is no
way that she is going to get around it.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I would
just suggest that it was Seema Verma
who is the head of CMS who issued the
guidance, so I think she is in a position
to have a say about what she believes
the guidance allows or doesn’t.
To be clear, to quote her letter again:
‘‘The 2018 guidance does nothing to
erode the PPACA’s preexisting condi-
tion provisions.’’ That is what she is
saying.
So I think that letter is important.
She put it in writing. She has said that
repeatedly, and so I take her at her
word. I do. I include her letter in the
RECORD.
CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &
MEDICAID SERVICES,
Washington, DC, May 7, 2019.
Hon. GREG WALDEN,
Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy
and Commerce, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE WALDEN: Thank you
for your continued interest in new state
flexibility available under guidance recently
issued interpreting section 1332 of the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(PPACA) (the 2018 guidance). Working within
the limitations of the PPACA, this 2018 guid-
ance is an important element of the Admin-
istration’s actions to expand options and
lower costs for patients around the country.
I wanted to take this opportunity to set the
record straight and reaffirm this Adminis-
tration’s commitment to lowering
healthcare costs, increasing consumer
choices, and protecting our most vulnerable
citizens, including those who have pre-exist-
ing conditions.
To be very clear, the 2018 guidance does
nothing to erode the PPACA’s pre-existing
condition provisions, which cannot be waived
under section 1332. Section 1332 does not per-
mit states to waive Public Health Service
Act requirements such as guaranteed avail-
ability and renewability of health insurance,
the prohibition on using health status to
vary premiums, and the prohibition on pre-
existing conditions exclusions. Furthermore,
a section 1332 waiver cannot be approved
that might otherwise undermine these re-
quirements. This Administration stands
committed to protecting people with pre-ex-
isting conditions.
Under the PPACA, we have seen dramati-
cally higher premiums and decreased options
for millions of consumers, in large part due
to the law’s overly prescriptive mandates
and excessive Federal government takeover
of areas traditionally under state oversight.
In 2019, the average monthly premium for a
benchmark plan for a family of four on
HealthCare.gov is now over $1,500, which can
easily exceed a family’s mortgage. There are
many areas of the country with far higher
monthly premiums. For example, a 60-year-
old couple living in Grand Island, Nebraska,
making $70,000 a year, will need to pay over
$3,000 per month for the lowest cost silver
plan available. That’s almost $38,000 per year
for a plan with an $11,100 deductible. That’s
over half their income.
For millions of Americans, coverage this
expensive is not a realistic option, and many
choose to go without coverage at all. In fact,
after average premiums rose by 21 percent,
1.3 million unsubsidized people walked away
from the market in 2017, the last year the
prior administration oversaw open enroll-
ment. While these higher premiums force
some people to go uninsured, coverage is
generally not optional for people with a pre-
existing condition and so, without a subsidy,
someone with a pre-existing condition must
face the full burden of the PPACA’s skyhigh
premiums. This Administration has not for-
gotten the people facing this hardship.
Section 1332 of the PPACA provides the
discretion to approve a section 1332 state
waiver plan if the following four statutory
guardrails are met: affordability, com-
prehensiveness, coverage, and federal deficit
neutrality. Section 1332 allows states to de-
velop new healthcare programs and solutions
that would be not permissible without a sec-
tion 1332 waiver.
Unfortunately, guidance issued under the
prior Administration in December 2015 (the
2015 guidance) regarding section 1332 waivers
had the effect of significantly restricting the
innovation states could pursue. The prior
Administration imposed a one-size-fits-all
approach to these waivers, making it dif-
ficult for states to address the specific needs
of their residents.
In October, the Administration issued
guidance under section 1332 of the PPACA to
provide states with significant opportunities
to chart a different course for their markets
through expanded flexibility. Section 1332
and the 2018 guidance ensure that consumers
who wish to retain coverage similar to that
provided under the PPACA can do so, but
they empower states to take steps to sta-
bilize their markets and allow more afford-
able coverage options that may be more at-
tractive to individuals and families priced
out of the current market, including people
with pre-existing conditions.
Over the past two years, this Administra-
tion has approved seven section 1332 waivers
authorizing reinsurance programs to help
fund claims for people with high healthcare
costs. These reinsurance programs provide
much needed premium relief for people in
the market and, in particular, for people
with pre-existing conditions without other
coverage options. These section 1332 waivers
were all approved under the prior, more re-
strictive 2015 guidance. I believe, given the
expanded flexibility discussed in the 2018
guidance, states will be able to develop addi-
tional healthcare programs and solutions
that work for their residents.
As you know, some have criticized the
state flexibility offered under the 2018 guid-
ance, claiming that states will pursue sec-
tion 1332 waivers that undermine their own
individual market risk pools and make cov-
erage more expensive for their own residents
with pre-existing conditions. Again, I want
to make clear that a section 1332 waiver can-
not undermine coverage for people with pre-
existing conditions. Moreover, any section
1332 waiver will need to carefully account for
any impact on the individual market risk
pool and guarantee that access to coverage is
at least as comprehensive and affordable as
would exist without the waiver.
So, if a state seeks to pursue the use of
more affordable options, such as cata-
strophic plans or short-term limited dura-
tion plans, under a section 1332 state waiver
plan, the state must ensure access to cov-
erage that is overall as affordable and com-
prehensive for people who remain in the indi-
vidual market risk pool.

Thank you again for your shared interest
in bringing down healthcare costs and pro-
tecting our fellow Americans with pre-exist-
ing conditions. We remain focused on im-
proving our nation’s health care system by
empowering states to innovate and develop
new solutions to expand access to affordable
and high value coverage options, and we look
forward to working with you to achieve
these goals. Should you have questions,
please contact the CMS Office of Legislation.
Sincerely,
SEEMA VERMA.
Mr. WALDEN. Now, Mr. Chair, I was
willing to withdraw the amendment.
That takes unanimous consent, and I
just would attempt to do that again. I
don’t know if my colleague cares about
that or not.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I have no
objection.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, so we
can move on to the other amendments,
I ask unanimous consent to withdraw
the amendment.
The CHAIR. Is there objection to the

There was no objection.
The CHAIR. The amendment is with-
drawn.

ment No. 6 will not be offered.
AMENDMENT NO. 7 OFFERED BY MR. HOLDING
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 7 printed in part
A of House Report 116–51.
Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 3, beginning on line 4, strike ‘‘Pro-
tecting Americans with Preexisting Condi-
tions Act of 2019’’ and insert ‘‘Insert Politi-
cally Punchy Title That Doesn’t Reflect the
Bill Substance Act’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 357, the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. HOLDING) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from North Carolina.
Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chairman, I be-
lieve my amendment speaks for itself.
My friends on the other side of the
aisle are playing political games with
their bill trying to convince the Amer-
ican people that it would accomplish
something that it would not. I have of-
fered a title that accurately reflects
the political grandstanding that my
Democrat friends are effecting today.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, just to
back up what I said previously about
the implications for this Trump admin-
istration and Seema Verma’s guidance
that they put forward with regard to
1332, I want to read a section from a
letter that was sent by 23 patient and
consumer advocacy organizations in
support of H.R. 986, the bill that is be-
fore us. These organizations include
the Heart Association, the Lung Asso-
ciation, the Epilepsy Foundation, et
cetera. This goes back to the guard-
rails.
As I said, under 1332, in the ACA,
there are guardrails that say that any
waivers have to guarantee afford-
ability, have to guarantee comprehen-
siveness of coverage, and have to, at
the same time, not reduce the number
of people with insurance.
Nothing that Seema Verma or any-
thing on the other side that is being
said is suggesting in any way that,
under this guidance, those principles
wouldn’t be violated. In fact, they
would be violated.
So this is what these 23 patient and
consumer advocacy organizations say
about the Trump guidance waiver:
‘‘This gross misinterpretation of the
guardrails will have real consequences
for patients, steering people into sub-
standard coverage, such as short-term,
limited-duration plans and association
health plans, which often do not cover
the full range of benefits and services
that patients rely on to manage their
conditions.
‘‘Further, policies that could be im-
plemented under this new interpreta-
tion could fundamentally alter the risk
pool for a State’s individual market-
place, making comprehensive coverage
unaffordable for patients who rely on it
and jeopardizing the stability of the
State’s marketplace. The resulting
lack of access to care could have dev-
astating short- and long-term con-
sequences for the millions of patients
we represent.’’
b 1615
The bottom line is this is going to
dramatically hurt people with pre-
existing conditions if they try to buy
insurance that will cover the maladies
that they want to cover, and they need
to have covered.
Again, I don’t understand, Mr. HOLD-
ING and, previously, Mr. WALDEN have
these amendments that really have
nothing substantive to say. All they do
is talk about changing the title be-
cause they are trying to ridicule what
Democrats are trying to do here, which
is to guarantee that people with pre-
existing conditions are protected.
I don’t want to get upset, but I think
that it is kind of inappropriate, when
here we are trying to guarantee people
with preexisting conditions are pro-
tected—even Republicans on the other
side are saying that is important to
them—and, instead of having a serious
debate about this, they put forward
amendments that change the title to
ridicule what we are trying to do. It is
just unfortunate that we are at that
point now, but that is where we are.
Madam Chairman, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Chair, I yield
to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.
WALDEN).
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Chair, I just want to say that
I, too, wish we were debating my legis-
lation that I tried to offer the first of
the Congress and was refused the op-
portunity to bring it to the floor. That
would lock into statute preexisting
protections for people who have pre-
existing conditions.
This court case is pending. We could
get a ruling tomorrow. Somewhere in
the last couple of months, Congress
could have acted to put in statute a
separate law that would be there, irre-
spective of the decision of the judge, or
judges as it goes through its process,
that could wipe out all of the ACA and
could wipe out preexisting condition
protections. We could do that, except
their Committee on Rules put these
amendments in order to debate on the
floor, but not the amendment that ac-
tually protects people with preexisting
conditions. So it is not my fault—we
don’t control of the Rules Committee—
that my serious amendment about pro-
tecting people with preexisting condi-
tions was not made in order. I don’t
control the Rules Committee. The
Speaker does, and others.
When we talk about affordability, re-
member the example that Seema
Verma points out, in Grand Island, Ne-
braska, a couple making $60,000 a year,
60 years old, $38,000 for the plan, and
$11,000 deductible. How is that afford-
able? It is not.
I want our States to innovate. Do
you know what, if a State doesn’t want
to innovate, it doesn’t have to. And if
they violate the rules, they are not
going to get their waiver.
But what we do know is that when
States have innovated, like mine, like
the gentlemen from Wisconsin and
Alaska, they have seen reductions in
premiums and full-throated coverage. I
want innovation. I don’t want to price
people out of the market.
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Chair, this
bill before us today makes no struc-
tural changes to improve access to or
delivery of care. It would limit
healthcare choices and stifle State
level innovation that has proven to
lower premiums. This bill does not help
those with preexisting conditions, but
it does attempt to confuse them and
encourage more political dysfunction
to the detriment of the American peo-
ple.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, my
colleagues on the other side started out
this debate on these amendments by
basically saying they wanted to sub-
stitute the title rather than talking
about the substance. Now, my col-
league, the ranking member, starts
talking about the lawsuit that would—
I think he is talking about the lawsuit
that would repeal the Affordable Care
Act.
Again, my colleagues on the other
side are not looking to protect people
with preexisting conditions, they are
not looking to protect anybody, be-
cause now they are saying that it is a

good idea to repeal the Affordable Care
Act. So we are back to the basic debate
about whether or not we should have
the Affordable Care Act, which until
President Trump came along and start-
ed sabotaging the bill, 97 percent of
Americans had health insurance, an
all-time high in the history of this
country.
So, okay, that is fine. Now we are
going to say that they want to repeal
the Affordable Care Act once again.
This is what this is all about on their
side of the aisle: repeal the act, move
to court to try to get the courts to de-
clare the act unconstitutional, no ef-
fort to worry about the millions and
millions of Americans who have gotten
coverage because of the Affordable
Care Act.
I really don’t know what else I can
say at this point, but at least they re-
vealed their true motive, which is sim-
ply to repeal the whole bill.
Once again, I guess there is not much
to say here, other than to say that I
would urge my colleagues to reject this
amendment. Let’s get back to talking
about the substance of the bill that is
before us, which would guarantee that
there are protections for people with
preexisting conditions.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-

(42 U.S.C. 18022(a)) compared to the number
of such individuals who would have been so
enrolled in such coverage had such action
not been taken’’ after ‘‘(October 24, 2018))’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 357, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. PORTER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I rise
today to offer an amendment to the
Protecting Americans with Preexisting
Conditions Act.
This bill would prevent the Trump
administration from allowing States to
use waivers to provide junk health
plans that reduce coverage and de-
crease cost sharing provisions.
In the Affordable Care Act, section
1332 waivers were created to provide
States flexibility to implement innova-
tive plans that would expand coverage,
reduce costs, and provide more com-
prehensive benefits.
Our States can be incubators for op-
portunity and these waivers allow
them the opportunity to improve ac-
cess to affordable, quality services in
groundbreaking ways. But, last year,
the Trump administration released
guidance that would allow States to
use these waivers to take care away
from the individuals who need it most,
and that is unacceptable.
Because of the Affordable Care Act,
3,826,000 Californians have gained
health coverage. In my home district,
the 45th District of California, more
than 338,000 people have a preexisting
condition, many of whom gained cov-
erage or received more affordable cov-
erage because of new protections estab-
lished under the Affordable Care Act.
This Sunday is Mother’s Day. Having
given birth, being a mother, is a pre-
existing condition, a factor that used
to contribute to higher insurance costs
for most of the women we will cele-
brate this weekend. We can’t go back
to the days when being a woman was
enough to let an insurance company
charge you more for basic healthcare.
My amendment will prohibit the ad-
ministration from issuing any waivers
that would let States craft healthcare
plans that would reduce the number of
individuals enrolled in comprehensive
plans that are compliant with our
country’s current healthcare laws.
This bill preserves waivers that pro-
vide States with flexibility. This bill
encourages States to provide innova-
tive plans. But what this bill does is
make sure that those waivers can be
used for their original intent: expand-
ing care and decreasing costs.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support my amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I seek
time in opposition to the gentle-
woman’s amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I would
like to point out a couple of things.
One, I have introduced legislation to
protect people with preexisting condi-
tions. I did that because I knew this
lawsuit is pending. We can argue about
the ACA and the lawsuit and all that,
but the long and short of it is that if
the court rules the ACA gets thrown
out as unconstitutional, which may
happen, people with preexisting condi-
tions would be exposed, and I don’t
want that to happen. That is why I in-
troduced legislation.
I would be honored if we could take
that up in the Energy and Commerce
Committee that I used to chair and put
it on the House floor. I tried to bring it
here as an amendment and it was de-
nied by the Democrat majority, so we
can’t even have a debate here about it.
If it is not everything it should be,
then I am happy to work with people to
try and make it as durable and robust
as it needs to be. So that is one.
When we talk about insurance—and
there is kind of silence on the other
side—2.5 million Americans since
President Trump have gotten
healthcare insurance through their em-
ployer. We have one of the most robust
economies most Americans have ever
seen: 3.2 percent, I think, GDP growth
the first quarter. Some have said, you
need fairy dust to do that. Well, that is
not true. You need good economic pol-
icy. We have that in America: the low-
est unemployment for African Ameri-
cans, Hispanic Americans, all Ameri-
cans. Incredible numbers, incredible
growth. As a result, people are getting
off government subsidized healthcare,
or fully funded healthcare, onto private
health insurance, which Democrats
want to wipe out. One hundred and
fifty-eight million Americans get their
health insurance through their em-
ployer or through their union.
And when it comes to the Affordable
Care Act, that is what put in place the
big cuts that are coming to our hos-
pitals, the DSH cuts, that I held off as
chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee. We passed legislation to
prevent the DSH cuts from hitting our
disproportionate share of hospitals,
those that deal with more lower in-
come folks. We are going to have to do
that again. Because ObamaCare says
you got to hit your hospital with a big
cost increase, if you will, or take away
a subsidy.
The Cadillac tax. I met with building
trade folks in my State. These people
bargained away, potentially, wages for
better benefits. And then along comes
ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act,
that says: Oh, by the way, if you have
got too generous a plan, according to
the government, you are going to have
to pay a 40 percent tax on that plan.
And, by the way, it was never indexed
for inflation. And guess what,
healthcare costs continue to go up and
premiums go up.
More and more Americans’ health in-
surance is going to fall into this so-
called Cadillac tax. There will be a 40
percent tax on those plans. The work-
ing men and women, who are part of a
union or in the private sector and who
have good, generous healthcare bene-
fits, the Federal Government, the Dem-
ocrat-driven plan that is totally par-
tisan passed, it says, we are going to
whack you with a 40 percent tax. How
fair is that, Madam Chair? I don’t
think it is. We have kept that tax from
taking effect as Republicans. We will
see what this Congress does.
But, moreover, we fully funded our
community health centers. We, under
Republicans, funded the children’s
health insurance program, a Repub-
lican creation, for a decade. I led that

effort. Most Democrats consistently
voted against funding children’s health
insurance time and time again. It had
never been funded for more than 5
years ever in its history. One hundred
and twenty-two thousand, seven hun-
dred Oregonian kids and pregnant
moms get their health insurance
through CHIP. It is a marvelous pro-
gram. Republicans led the effort, be-
cause I did it. We first tried to get 5,
then 6, and then eventually we got 10
years funded. That is locked into law.
We need to go back and fund our
community health centers. I told peo-
ple that if I were chairman, my palms
would be getting a little sweaty now at
the list of things we need to get done—
I am looking at my friends.
In Oregon, in my district, I think we
had 63 delivery sites and 12 community
health centers. We fully funded those
centers at a record level in the last
Congress, because I believe fully in
that network of the delivery of
healthcare. It is extraordinarily impor-
tant. We should be doing that today,
but we are not.
We have got the National Health
Service Corps, special diabetes pro-
grams for Indians, special diabetes pro-
grams for type I diabetes, teaching
health centers, personal responsibility
education programs, sexual risk avoid-
ance education grants, and family-to-
family health information centers. We
have demo programs, increased access
to dental healthcare services, and
delay in authority to terminate con-
tracts for Medicare Advantage plans.
We have protection for recipients of
HCBS against spousal impoverishment.
We have demonstration of approved
community behavioral health clinics,
Medicaid funding for territories, delay
in effective date for Medicaid amend-
ments related to beneficiary liability
settlements, DSH allotment, and
money follows the person. All those ex-
pire at the end of this fiscal year. We
have real work we need to get done,
Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
b 1630
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI).
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding, and I
thank her for the constructive amend-
ment and for her exceptional leader-
ship as a leading Member of an out-
standing freshman class.
I also thank Congressman PALLONE,
chairman of the full committee, for
giving us the opportunity to bring to
the floor historic legislation that will
make a tremendous difference in the
lives of the American people.
Today, with the Protecting Ameri-
cans with Preexisting Conditions Act,
Democrats are honoring their promises
to the American people.
Madam Chair, our Democratic major-
ity ran on the promise to protect
American families’ quality, affordable
healthcare.
We have now voted three times to op-
pose the GOP healthcare lawsuit, but
every time, with every vote, House Re-
publicans reveal their inconsistency
and complicity with the administra-
tion’s assault on people with pre-
existing conditions and every Ameri-
can’s healthcare.
It was interesting to listen to the dis-
tinguished ranking member of the
committee express his views when the
fact is that, 2 years ago, House Repub-
licans voted to gut protections for peo-
ple with preexisting conditions and
take away millions of families’
healthcare, and they then threw a
party to celebrate.
They went down to the White House
and celebrated: We have taken away
the preexisting conditions benefit.
The American people resoundingly
rejected the Republicans’ attack on
their healthcare and their financial se-
curity, yet the GOP is plowing full
steam ahead with their monstrous
campaign to sabotage the Affordable
Care Act and take away healthcare.
Just last week, the administration
doubled down on its demands that the
courts throw out every protection and
benefit provided by the Affordable Care
Act.
Again, over and over, we have had
bills on the floor to invite the Repub-
licans to join us in rejecting that Re-
publican attack. Overwhelmingly, they
have rejected that.
Today, again, we can celebrate that
we are protecting Americans with pre-
existing conditions and honoring that
promise we made to the American peo-
ple, as I said.
The bill reverses a dangerous part of
the Trump administration’s reckless
sabotage campaign, blocking cynical
guidance to States. Here is what they
do: dismantle protections for people
with preexisting conditions and push
families into junk plans that discrimi-
nate against people with preexisting
conditions and do not cover essential
benefits.
In fact, you are paying for nothing.
The Trump guidance puts lives on
the line, not only sabotaging the
healthcare law but the health of mil-
lions of Americans who rely on it.
Nearly 30 national groups rep-
resenting people with preexisting con-
ditions have spoken out, including the
American Cancer Society, Cancer Ac-
tion Network, American Heart Associa-
tion, American Diabetes Association,
American Lung Association, National
Alliance on Mental Illness, Susan G.
Komen, and many more.
They write, ‘‘This dangerous action
could take us back to the days when
people with preexisting conditions were
openly discriminated against and bla-
tantly denied access to lifesaving
care.’’
These organizations, I want Ranking
Member WALDEN to hear because he
seemed to have been distracted, all
these organizations for cancer, diabe-
tes, heart, lung, mental health, all of
that, they write, ‘‘This dangerous ac-
tion could take us back to the days
when people with preexisting condi-
tions were openly discriminated
against and blatantly denied access to
lifesaving care.’’
We thank all the groups and fami-
lies—including the sick little children,
the Little Lobbyists—for their courage
to speak out and show that this is a
fight not just about legislation but
about lives. Nothing is more eloquent
than the stories that they tell, and
many have told their stories here.
They had 10,000 events around the
country to stop the Republicans’ sabo-
tage on healthcare, much of it from
people with preexisting conditions, es-
pecially children born with preexisting
conditions.
This bill that we have today is just
the beginning. In the coming weeks,
House Democrats will bring forth more
bold legislation to reduce the price of
prescription drugs, to empower States
to build better exchanges, and to block
junk plans and reverse the GOP’s en-
rollment sabotage.
Senator MCCONNELL said that he is
the grim reaper. He wears that as a
badge of honor.
He is the grim reaper. He is going to
kill any House legislation for the peo-
ple, saying that he will bury our bills
in the Senate graveyard, effectively.
That is really not a very hopeful polit-
ical agenda, the grim reaper.
I have news for him. Legislation to
protect the preexisting condition ben-
efit and many of the other pieces of
this agenda are alive and well among
the American people, and they will
make their voices heard.
The American people want action,
and the special interest GOP Senate
needs to stop standing in their way,
Leader MCCONNELL.
I urge a strong vote for this legisla-
tion for the people.
I commend the gentlewoman for her
very important amendment. She said
being a mom was a preexisting condi-
tion. As the mother of five, it is 6 years
to the day when I talked to the insur-
ance company about my bad back.
They said: Why would we even insure
you? You are a poor risk, having had
children.
I said: That is funny you say that. I
thought it was a show of strength on
my part to have five children. Are you
calling that something that would be a
barrier to my getting insurance?
I want to emphasize, as we approach
Mother’s Day, how important this par-
ticular amendment is to help moms
and their families.
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
Congresswoman PORTER’s important
Mother’s Day amendment.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.

H3540 May 9, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
In section 2, insert ‘‘, including any such
action that would, with respect to individ-
uals with substance use disorders, including
opioid use disorders, reduce the availability
or affordability of coverage that is at least
as comprehensive as the coverage defined in
section 1302(a) of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022(a)) com-
pared to the availability or affordability, re-
spectively, of such coverage had such action
not been taken’’ after ‘‘(October 24, 2018))’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 357, the gentleman
from New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Hampshire.
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I thank my colleague
from New Hampshire, Representative
KUSTER, for offering this legislation
that will safeguard healthcare protec-
tions for the 130 million Americans
with preexisting conditions.
The amendment I am offering today
would ensure that we don’t take any
steps backward in our fight against
this Nation’s opioid epidemic.
For people in my home State of New
Hampshire, the Affordable Care Act is
a lifesaving law. It is the best tool we
have to combat the opioid crisis. As I
travel around my district, I hear heart-
breaking stories of those lost and those
still fighting hard.
I also hear from constituents who, on
a regular basis, can’t fathom where
they would be without coverage for
their substance use disorder.
I am here today on behalf of con-
stituents like Phil Spagnuolo from La-
conia. As Phil fought to recover from
substance use disorder, he took com-
fort in knowing that he could rely on
coverage that was affordable and acces-
sible to him in the midst of the great-
est medical challenge of his life.
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act,
Phil has gone from jail to treatment
and recovery to serving as a leader in
the recovery community, coaching and
advocating for those grappling with ad-
diction.
New Hampshire is incredibly proud of
his story and his example, and it is all
made possible because of the ACA and
its basic protections.
The collective impact of substance
use disorder coverage has expanded
treatment and recovery opportunities
in New Hampshire and across the coun-
try.
Unfortunately, far too many still do
not access this kind of lifesaving care.
We still lose 130 Americans each and
every day in their battle with opioid
addiction.
The scope of this crisis is simply im-
mense. No region, no community, no
family has been spared.
Despite the alarming statistics, the
administration issued guidance that
would allow insurance companies to
discriminate against Americans with
preexisting conditions, including the
19.7 million Americans like Phil with a
history of substance use.
That is why I am offering this
amendment today, to strengthen the
underlying legislation and prohibit any
further actions to reduce the avail-
ability or affordability of coverage for
those battling substance use disorder.
We should be working together to
open the doors to those most in need,
not shutting them because of politics.
I urge the adoption of this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my
time, Madam Chair.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I seek
time in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Chair, I am
willing to close if the gentleman from
Oregon is, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Actually, I believe I
get to close, don’t I?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon has the right to close.
Mr. WALDEN. That is what I
thought.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Chair, this is a
critical issue. This is an important
piece of legislation. I, for one, don’t
trust this administration to get it
right.
They have tried every trick in the
book they can to repeal the Affordable
Care Act outright legislatively and to
undermine it administratively. They
have gone to the courts to take away
critical protections from Americans
who need them most. I, for one, am not
going to stand for it.
The people of New Hampshire and of
this country, we are ensuring that we
get this right for them. It is very crit-
ical for those suffering from substance
use disorder that we ensure those im-
portant protections remain on the
books so that people can access care.
There is no more important tool in
our toolbox than ensuring that people
have health insurance to take care of
their substance use disorder. That is
why I brought forward this amendment
today.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Section 1332 already requires that the
State plan will provide coverage that is
at least as comprehensive as the essen-
tial health benefits, including mental
health and substance use disorder serv-
ices. That is already required, includ-
ing behavioral health treatment, and
would provide coverage to at least a
comparable number of its residents.
That is already in the 1332 require-
ments.
I appreciate the gentleman’s passion
for dealing with the opioid epidemic. I
led the effort that brought together
Republicans and Democrats. We passed
60 different pieces of legislation. I
think 57 of them, by the time we were
done working together, passed unani-
mously in this House.
We bundled them up into H.R. 6 be-
cause we all know the Senate can’t
handle 57 or 60 different pieces of legis-
lation, but they could handle one. The
work we did here and the work they did
there ended up in, I would argue, the
Nation’s most comprehensive legisla-
tion to address a drug problem our
country has ever had. And that is our
law.
The President of the United States,
who was just disparaged here on the
House floor, helped lead this effort be-
cause he passionately cares about the
issue of addiction. He lost a brother, I
believe, to alcoholism.
He was a leader, and his team were
leaders, in this effort we put together
on opioids. He invited Republicans and
Democrats to the White House for the
bill signing. Mrs. Trump helped orga-
nize all of that.
This legislation is comprehensive on
opioids. It wasn’t part of the ACA. You
see, we can work together and improve
underlying laws. We can address major
problems facing the country when ma-
jorities want to do that. We did it last
Congress under my leadership, and it
was Republicans and Democrats. We
didn’t start out agreeing on some of
these matters, but we ended up there,
with just a couple of exceptions.
I sent my friend, Madam Chair, the
chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee today, a comprehensive list
of kind of what we learned in the final
phase of our investigation into how
America ended up in the place it was
with opioids. There are some additional
recommendations that I hope and as-
sume we will get to out of that inves-
tigative report that we concluded at
the end of the year. Hopefully, we will
get there.
I believe we need to do oversight on
the legislation we passed. I have al-
ways felt that about bills we passed.
We need to go take a second look.
b 1645
What is working? What is not? We
are not going to get it right the first
time, and we always know there is
more to do, and we need to do more on
what was H.R. 6 in the last Congress,
our opioids legislation.
Madam Chair, I am not opposed to
the gentleman’s amendment, and you
have to say you are in order to get the
time, I guess, but I am not.
I am fully committed to making sure
that people with substance abuse dis-
orders continue to get the help they
need in our communities. That is what
our whole legislative thrust was about
last Congress and will remain there. As
I say, section 1332 already requires that
in these plans.
Again, remember what we are talk-
ing about here is States coming to the
Federal Government saying: We have a

better idea to fill a gap, so people have
affordable insurance. That is what a
waiver is under 1332. And, I guess, I
have more confidence in my State than
others must have in theirs, but I think
from my own experience, Republicans
and Democrats work together in Or-
egon to get health insurance out, and
coverage out, and expand access to
care. I have always continued to try to
do that.
I have faith that my State would do
this. These plans we will hear more
about next week, but they are regu-
lated by State insurance commis-
sioners. I am not in the school that
says all of those people are bad and we
are the only ones with a great idea. I
want innovation. I want it from the
States, and I want to drive down costs
of healthcare while improving access
and delivery of services.
So I am not opposed to the gentle-
man’s amendment. I do hope we can ad-
dress these issues of fully funding our
community health centers, our Na-
tional Health Service Corps, and these
diabetes programs which we reauthor-
ized and funded in the last Congress,
and which we need to do again. They
are called the Special Diabetes Pro-
gram for Indians and Special Diabetes
Program for type 1 diabetes.
We have got to get after that, too,
Madam Chair. We have to find the
money to do it. It is not easy. I know
we have a lot of other things. I just
wish we were doing those sorts of the
things today because these programs
expire in September, and we don’t have
that many legislative days left.
Hopefully, we can move on to the
things I know we can agree on and find
solutions for, and that we do it sooner
rather than later.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 357, the gentleman

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Chairwoman, 9
years ago our Nation took a monu-
mental step forward to address the
needs of millions of Americans with a
preexisting condition. Before the pas-
sage of the Affordable Care Act, indi-
viduals across the country were denied
coverage or charged higher premiums
due to their medical history.
While I came to Washington to pro-
tect our healthcare, the Trump admin-
istration has continued its assault on
the Affordable Care Act. In this case,
the administration is trying to use an
ACA provision designed to give States
the ability to test new insurance re-
forms that could improve the wellbeing
of their residents, but, instead, that
provision is being used to undermine
protections for people with preexisting
conditions and the coverage of essen-
tial health benefits, all in an effort to
prop up junk, short-term insurance
plans.
Today, we will stand up to that as-
sault on America’s healthcare by pass-
ing H.R. 986, to nullify these efforts.
We must be clear that any future ad-
ministrative actions by this adminis-
tration or any other administration
should not harm the vulnerable popu-
lations that the Affordable Care Act
was designed to protect.
To that end, my amendment would
prohibit any future rule or guidance
from diminishing the Affordable Care
Act that would result in reduction in
the availability, affordability, and
comprehensiveness for people with pre-
existing conditions, the elderly and
low-income individuals.
My amendment would affirm these
critical guardrails that protect the
care of so many Americans across our
country and help strengthen and up-
hold the principles of this landmark
law.
I would like to thank Chairman PAL-
LONE, Chairman NEAL, and their re-
spective staff for their assistance with
this amendment.
I ask my colleagues to join me in
supporting this amendment to ensure
that this and future administrations do
not undermine the healthcare of vul-
nerable populations.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.

Again, section 1332 already requires
that the State plan, the one they sub-
mit, will provide coverage that is at
least as comprehensive as the essential
health benefits, including mental
health and substance use disorder serv-
ices, including behavioral health treat-
ment, and will provide coverage to at
least a comparable number of its resi-
dents.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Chairwoman, we
are at a crossroads in our country.
When we look at the global stage, there
are approximately 200 countries, of
which 40 are industrialized, developed
countries. Of those 40 industrialized,
developed countries, 39 of them have
universal healthcare. Only one does
not, the wealthiest, greatest country in
the history of the world. That is why
we have tens of millions of individuals
in our country without insurance.
We know that preexisting conditions
have to be covered because when we
look at the fact that this country
spends 18.5 percent of its GDP on
healthcare, almost double what these
other industrialized, developed coun-
tries spend, you would think the
United States of America has the
healthiest people in the world.
Madam Chairwoman, that is not the
case. I am sad to report that most crit-
ical criteria when looking at Ameri-
cans’ healthcare, we are in the bottom
quartile, even though we spend 18.5 per-
cent of our GDP. We know that the in-
ability to pay healthcare costs is a
leading cause of involuntary bank-
ruptcy and homelessness.
Preexisting conditions is the under-
lying reason for those two things. That
is why we must make sure that we pro-
tect affordable healthcare in the
United States through the act, and
make sure that preexisting conditions
are covered today and tomorrow for fu-
ture generations.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chairwoman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, I just want to go back
to what is going on in America’s
healthcare costs and look at some of
what is going on elsewhere around the
world.
First of all, I would draw the Mem-
ber’s attention to the Kaiser Founda-
tion report that Axios reported on
about people who have health insur-
ance and still can’t afford to use it.
They talked about just over half of
those with employer coverage have
some sort of chronic disease, so they
have health insurance. But the
deductibles which are at $3,000 to $5,000
are so high that three-quarters of the
people reported skipping or postponing
some type of care. Half, 49 percent, said
that a family member had a problem
paying medical bills or difficulty af-
fording their premiums, deductibles, or
copays in the last year.
What we are trying to do is help
those people in the individual market,
and we would love to help those people
in the market that employer-provided
health insurance is in as well, and put
downward pressure on pricing, and go
after the cost of healthcare from one
end to the other.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3542 May 9, 2019
Now, the gentleman from California,
I believe, has talked about going to a,
I guess, government-run, single-payer
system. I have got two veterans that
work virtually full time helping vet-
erans in Oregon’s Second District get
access to a similar sort of system. You
know of it as the VA. Think about the
problems we have with that govern-
ment-run, single, sort of, payer-oper-
ated system.
If you get in, I have veterans saying:
It is great. I have got coverage. But it
is people who have to wait 6 months to
get eyeglasses at one point, or they
can’t get in to get their surgery done.
And we are working with thousands of
veterans that have to come to their
Member of Congress to be able to get
access to the healthcare they were
promised when they put on the Na-
tion’s uniform.
We have that system in place, and it
has incredible problems in wait time,
so I had to create the Choice Program
and everything else.
Then I was intrigued by a story about
a woman in Nova Scotia who is 33
years old. She is under one of those
systems my friend wants for us, I
guess. After three trips to the emer-
gency room, they just never would be-
lieve her and her problem and see her,
and she couldn’t get access to doctors.
When she finally did, her anal cancer
had progressed to stage III.
Now, at 33, she is in menopause, she
writes. She had a Facebook post re-
cently wanting to meet with the Pre-
mier to explain how broken their
healthcare system is.
We all know stories about Canadians
who come across the border who can af-
ford to get their healthcare done here
because they can get it done sooner.
We all know of stories in other coun-
tries where they have global budgets,
and when they run out, you are done. I
have had people tell me the little se-
cret is: Get sick before June because
they are going to run out and you
won’t get in. That is what is going on
around the world.
And I think, in many measures, when
people are especially sick, if they have
the money, they come to the United
States for care. They go to MD Ander-
son Cancer Center, and they go to the
Mayo Clinic.
Those are the folks who come to
America. What I want is the MD An-
dersons and the Mayo Clinics, and the
Oregon and Health & Science Univer-
sities to be affordable and available to
all Americans.
We had a hearing today—I think it
was pretty good—on drug pricing, fol-
lowing up on what I did 2 years ago
looking at the manufacturers, the
PBMs, the distributors, and the insur-
ers. Everybody wants a piece of this.
Everybody is getting a chunk. The re-
sult is, we have a healthcare system
that costs too much. So let’s go figure
that out.
That is what innovation is about, and
that is what our States can do in their
wonderful laboratories. Some of them
will do really good things, and some of
them will make mistakes and learn
from it. We should pick the best from
among the States. That is what we are
looking for here in these 1332 waivers is
some flexibility for our States to inno-
vate.
I believe our States and my col-
leagues—and by the way, Oregon is
completely Democrat controlled—but
they care about citizens of the State of
Oregon, and so does the insurance com-
missioner, and they are only going to
ask for permission for a plan that will
be better than what the Federal Gov-
ernment is trying to jam down their
throat in a one-size-fits-all.
So I don’t object to the gentleman’s
amendment. I think we can do better
by harnessing great innovation. We do
it in medicine, and we do it everywhere
else. We have competitive insurance
products for a lot of other things we
buy, and I would like to see more op-
tions, more choice, more transparency
in healthcare, and more consumer in-
volvement.
Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ROUDA).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 11 OFFERED BY MR.
MALINOWSKI
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 11 printed
in part A of House Report 116–51.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
In section 2, insert ‘‘, including any such
action that would, with respect to individ-
uals with preexisting conditions, reduce the
affordability of coverage that is at least as
comprehensive as the coverage defined in
section 1302(a) of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022(a)) com-
pared to the affordability of such coverage
had such action not been taken’’ after ‘‘(Oc-
tober 24, 2018))’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 357, the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Chair-
woman, there are many problems in
our healthcare system. We have heard
about a number of them today, but we
are here for one simple, specific reason,
because of the guidance that the ad-
ministration issued last year that al-
lows States to expand the availability
and duration of junk, short-term insur-
ance plans.
Now, the administration and its de-
fenders will not say this because it has
become politically impossible to do so,
but these plans are cheaper precisely
because they deny coverage to people
with preexisting conditions and for,
what any reasonable person would
agree are essential benefits, like ma-
ternity care and prescription drugs.
That is what they mean when they
use the euphemism ‘‘flexibility.’’ Will
these plans take hold? Here is what
happens, in plain language, if you have
a preexisting condition. You have a
choice. Either stay in your ACA plan
and see your premiums rise as healthy
people move to cheaper, junk insur-
ance, or you sign up for a junk plan
yourself and risk getting gouged when
the services you need aren’t covered.
You end up with a two-tiered
healthcare system in America: one for
healthy people, and one for sick people.
Now, the underlying bill rescinds that
guidance. The amendment I have sub-
mitted would prohibit the administra-
tion from taking any other action that
would reduce the affordability of com-
prehensive coverage for Americans
with preexisting conditions.
b 1700
Now, this would not in any way pre-
vent States from using section 1332
waivers to make healthcare better and
more affordable. Many States, as we
have heard, have done so in ways that
have lowered health insurance pre-
miums without, in any way, under-
mining protections for people with pre-
existing conditions.
Yes, section 1332 has a clear directive
that States must maintain the bene-
fits, affordability, and coverage pro-
vided by the ACA, but it is clear that
the administration has disregarded
these standards and could do so again
to remove protections for vulnerable
groups, to promote expansion of health
plans that are not compliant with the
ACA, and to take other steps that
would increase costs, especially for
women and older adults.
This amendment, along with the
overall bill, makes sure that we keep
our promise to the American people. It
makes clear that, when we say we are
going to protect everyone with a pre-
existing condition, that is not an
empty slogan that means whatever we
want it to mean. Those words mean
something, that every American de-
serves quality health insurance, and no
American should be forced to pay more
for good coverage because of a pre-
existing health problem.
Madam Chair, that is what H.R. 986
and my amendment guarantee. I urge
my colleagues to support both, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the gentle-
man’s amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Chair, I
will close by saying there is no ques-
tion whatsoever what the administra-
tion intends to do. They have been try-
ing from day one, from January 2017, to
repeal the Affordable Care Act and its
essential protections for the American
people.
The only thing that has changed is
that it has become politically impos-
sible for anyone in America to say that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3543

you are opposed to protecting people
with preexisting conditions, and so a
war against healthcare protections is
being covered up by a war against the
English language.
Everyone says, ‘‘We are for pre-
existing conditions,’’ yet every single
step the administration and its sup-
porters take is designed to weaken
those protections. This amendment and
the underlying bill say that you can’t
do that anymore. They guarantee,
going forward, that the ACA’s protec-
tions are respected and that any ex-
perimentation by the States will have
to be consistent with those protec-
tions.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues’
support for the amendment and the
bill, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I do not oppose this
amendment because this amendment
does not do anything the law already, I
think, requires.
Section 1332 does not permit States
to waive preexisting condition protec-
tions. Section 1332 already requires
that the State plan will provide cov-
erage that is at least as comprehensive
as the essential health benefits and
will provide coverage and cost-sharing
protections against excessive out-of-
pocket spending. That is what the un-
derlying law already does.
We have the assurance from the CMS
Administrator saying, once again, to
be clear: ‘‘The 2018 guidance does noth-
ing to erode the PPACA’s preexisting
condition provisions, which cannot be
waived under section 1332.’’
She is the one who makes the deci-
sion.
By the way, I would just point out
that no State has come to the Trump
administration under this new author-
ity that we are aware of and said:
‘‘Please approve our plan.’’
Junk plans—and we will hear more
about that term of art. By the way,
those junk plans were allowed for
under the Obama administration and
under the ACA. At that time, they
were only allowed for 3 months. There
seemed to be a lot of interest in a vari-
ety of options for citizens to take ad-
vantage of that covered their needs.
So the Trump administration said,
well, if they are good for 3 months,
what if we extend them to 12 months or
just at 12 months? That is what they
did. They were junk plans under
Trump; they were wonderful options
under Obama. It is the same set of
plans.
You can always go on the exchange,
and you can always find other coverage
that fits your need. We are trying to
not have just one plan that nobody can
afford. That is what you are seeing in
this situation that Ms. Seema Verma
put forward, Madam Chair, the head of
the CMS, the Administrator for the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services.
She uses, as an example, this situa-
tion in Grand Island, Nebraska. It is
not Oregon; it is Nebraska. A $70,000-a-
year, 60-year-old couple are paying
$38,000 a year for their insurance with
an $11,100 deductible. Now, how is that
affordable? Does anybody in here think
that is a great idea?
That is what you are saying: Don’t
innovate. We have got it covered. The
ACA has it covered. There is no need
for innovation here, nothing to see.
The plan works great.
Then we know, from the Kaiser
Foundation study, people are saying: I
can’t afford it. So I will jack up my
credit card, and I will wipe out my sav-
ings.
All this is going on. The ACA did not
solve every problem. It expanded cov-
erage. You can’t help but do that,
spend that much money. States like
mine took full advantage of it. But we
are left with these pockets and prob-
lems in America that I think States
could assist us in if we gave them ex-
panded authority under 1332 waivers to
say: Hey, guess what, Washington? We
have a better idea here. Here it is.
Take a look at it, and make sure it fits
the Federal guidelines and law, but let
us innovate.
Oregon did that. Under the prior 1332
approval process, insurance rates went
down 6 percent; Wisconsin down 10.6;
New Jersey, 15; Maryland, 43; Maine,
9.4; Minnesota, 20; Alaska, 34.7. Using
this sort of ‘‘Mother May I’’ approval,
that is what you have to do.
I remember when Oregon did the Or-
egon health plan. I was in the State
legislature then, and we had to plead
and beg with the administration at the
time to get approval to try and experi-
ment on Medicaid coverage to expand
coverage and improve access to care.
We couldn’t do it without Mother
Washington, Father Washington, or
Brother Washington, whoever, back
here, saying: Yeah, okay. We will let
you try that.
We should be in partnerships with
our States.
By the way, States can pass a law
and say: We are not going down this
path. They have every right to do it.
New Jersey has done it, and California
has done it: None of these short-term
duration plans, we are not going to be
a part of that.
Every State has that right. But there
are a lot of States that look at their
citizens and say: $38,000 a year for your
insurance and $11,000 for your deduct-
ible; you are making $70,000; you are 60
years old. That is not working real well
either. So maybe we can find a product
that would work for you and help you
out.
So we are talking about a range of
options and choices. America has al-
ways done well and markets do better
when we have more choices. That is
what we are talking about here.
The gentleman’s amendment I don’t
object to at all. I think it is the under-
lying law as described by the head of
the Department who would have to ap-
prove all these 1332 waivers.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr.
MALINOWSKI).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Chair, I
demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from New Jersey will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 12 OFFERED BY MS. WILD

to consider amendment No. 12 printed
in part A of House Report 116–51.
Ms. WILD. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

following: ‘‘including any such action that
would result in higher health insurance pre-
miums for individuals enrolled in health in-
surance coverage that is at least as com-
prehensive as the coverage defined in section
1302(b) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 18022(b)),’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 357, the gentlewoman
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania.
Ms. WILD. Madam Chair, I rise today
to offer an amendment to H.R. 986, the
Protecting Americans with Preexisting
Conditions Act of 2019.
My amendment would put an end to
the rising cost of premiums. It is an
amendment that should be met with
overwhelming bipartisan support and
without opposition.
Specifically, my amendment would
prohibit the administration from tak-
ing any further action that would re-
sult in higher premiums for Americans
who need comprehensive coverage.
This administration has unilaterally
made healthcare more expensive and
less accessible for the American people
by taking actions that run contrary to
the spirit and purpose of the ACA. That
has resulted in higher premiums and
reduced enrollment.
In 2017, the administration stopped
cost-sharing payments that helped re-
duce out-of-pocket costs for low-in-
come Americans. This action alone in-
creased premiums by 20 percent and
raised costs for families not receiving
subsidies.
In 2018, the administration issued
new section 1332 guidance that allows
States to raise healthcare costs for
people with preexisting conditions.
This 2018 guidance also gave a green
light to insurance companies to expand
junk plans that don’t cover essential
health benefits. We know that pulling
people out of the pool only makes in-
surance premiums more expensive for
those with preexisting conditions.
Also, in 2018, the administration
slashed funding for consumer enroll-
ment assistance and outreach. Their

goal: reduced healthcare enrollment;
the result: higher premiums.
Just last month, the administration
finalized a rule that would increase
limits on total out-of-pocket costs for
millions. The administration moved
forward with this even though the rule
itself noted that all commenters on
this topic expressed opposition to or
concerns about the proposed change.
This past Monday, the administra-
tion released a notice seeking com-
ment on a proposal that would reduce
eligibility for Medicaid and cut pre-
mium tax credits for millions.
It is time to say ‘‘no’’ to future at-
tempts to sabotage working Ameri-
cans’ healthcare.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the gentle-
woman’s amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WILD. Madam Chairman, my
amendment is about fairness. Patients
should not face increased premiums at
the whim of appointed government of-
ficials, especially for essential health
benefits like emergency services, ma-
ternity, newborn, pediatric care, men-
tal health and substance abuse treat-
ment, prescription drugs, laboratory
services, and preventive and wellness
services for chronic disease manage-
ment.
From malicious lawsuits aimed at
striking down the ACA in its entirety
and, along with it, the protections for
preexisting conditions to ending the
practice of public advertisement of en-
rollment period and educating the peo-
ple about the complexities of health in-
surance, it has become clear that Con-
gress must reclaim its legislative au-
thority and ensure that this adminis-
tration faithfully executes the spirit of
this law.
The ACA is the law. The Constitution
gives Congress the power to make laws
and requires the executive branch to
faithfully execute the laws that Con-
gress passes.
We all heard Republicans on the cam-
paign trail last year say that they
would protect coverage for preexisting
conditions and help drive down our pre-
miums. This is their chance to fulfill
those campaign promises with concrete
action.
Action, not words, is what the Amer-
ican people demand, and it is what
they deserve. Let’s make that commit-
ment a reality by adopting this amend-
ment, passing this bill, and pushing the
Senate to take it up so that we can get
it signed into law.
In closing, Madam Chair, this is
about standing up for the dignity of
working families in the most basic and
fundamental sense. It is about saying
that every child, woman, man, and
family in this country deserves the
same certainty of being able to afford
high-quality healthcare.
Our people deserve better. We need to
stop the political gamesmanship, and
we need to focus on people across our
country who need good, affordable
healthcare right now.
This is also our chance to remind
this administration and future admin-
istrations that Congress makes the
laws, and the executive branch doesn’t
get to fool around with the implemen-
tation just to see it fail for political
reasons.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, let’s talk about this
amendment.
I have talked earlier about all the
things that need to be reauthorized—
community health centers, special dia-
betes programs, all of that which I
know the committee is aware of and I
hope we begin marking. I wish we were
dealing with that today.
I heard from the gentlewoman about
Republicans and preexisting conditions
and ‘‘Where is your plan?’’ It is sitting
up in the Rules Committee because
your party would not allow my amend-
ment to do that and to be brought to
the floor for debate today. I don’t con-
trol the Rules Committee. It is 2 to 1
by the majority. It is just the way it
works around here, and I respect that.
But you allowed my amendments
that were more in jest about the false
nature of the title of the bill to be de-
bated but not the substantive amend-
ment I offered which does protect peo-
ple with preexisting conditions in case
the lawsuit were to prevail and
ObamaCare is thrown out. But, no, we
couldn’t have that debate.
I have asked for my bill to be consid-
ered in the committee of jurisdiction.
That hasn’t happened either.
I have also asked for the Democrats’
one-size-fits-all takeover of healthcare,
Medicare for All, however you want to
describe it, that we have a hearing in
Energy and Commerce. That hasn’t
happened either. We are the committee
of jurisdiction.
You talk about working people. It is
ObamaCare that puts a 40 percent tax
on union plans and employer plans that
exceed a certain level of costs, and
they don’t index it. Now, I don’t know
where the gentlewoman is on the Cad-
illac tax, but I want to repeal it. I
never voted for it.
b 1715
So, if they want to enshrine the Af-
fordable Care Act in its entirety and
make no changes, then I guess they are
for a 40 percent tax on the kind of in-
surance plans that my building
tradespeople negotiated to get—and
other unions—instead of getting wage
increases.
We have delayed that.
And when we look at the cuts in the
Affordable Care Act coming at our hos-
pitals in rural areas that serve lower-
income areas, the DSH payments, we
put off those cuts to our hospitals—last
cycle—under Republican leadership.
And we are going to face that question
in this Congress under Democrat lead-
ership.
So, a vote to delay those DSH cuts
again—if one does that—is voting to re-
peal or delay part of ObamaCare.
I hear 60, 70 votes to do these things
to ObamaCare—repeal the CLASS Act,
which was a long-term health insur-
ance program that was destined for
failure, and even President Obama
signed its repeal.
I can go through a whole list of
things that got repealed. We are the
only ones who ever get tagged with
voting to repeal.
As far as our commitment to pre-
existing conditions protection: It is
real, it is robust, and it was always in
everything we did.
Yeah, I know what the political rhet-
oric was. I have run campaigns. I have
been around that. I know how you can
nuance around. But we always pro-
tected people with preexisting condi-
tions—always, period, hard stop. Pro-
tected people with preexisting condi-
tions, in what came out of my com-
mittee and came across this House
floor, they were always covered—al-
ways.
So I hear the political rhetoric, but I
know the facts. See, I am an old jour-
nalism major, and I believe in facts.
The facts of the matter are that 1332
waivers have given our States an op-
portunity to give our citizens an af-
fordable health insurance plan, not one
that I guess they will defend—$38,000 a
year in premiums, $11,000 a year in
deductibles, copays, out-of-pocket
costs.
How is that working for anybody?
And shouldn’t that 60-year-old couple
in Nebraska have a chance to have a
better plan option? Nope, guess not.
Washington is going to decide it all for
you. Write your check: 38 grand. That
is for the premiums. And $11,000 in out-
of-pocket costs, your deductibles. Then
maybe you can get something covered,
right?
Well, what is left? We know from this
Kaiser study I have cited earlier that
was in Axios: People wipe out their
savings. They put it on their credit
cards. They borrow from their friends.
Or they simply don’t get coverage.
That is the world they want to
freeze-frame and leave in place. That is
not what the Republicans are for. We
want innovation. We want choice. We
believe in our States having the oppor-
tunity to innovate and do it even bet-
ter, not to go back to the old ways. No.
That is not what we are for. I know
that is what Democrats want to label
us as being for, but it is not true.
And we have proven results in
opioids; Community Health Centers;
the longest funding for Children’s
Health Insurance Program in the his-
tory of the United States of America,
under Republican leadership—10 years.
We are the ones, Republicans, who

So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The Acting CHAIR. There being no
further amendments, under the rule,
the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.
UNDERWOOD) having assumed the chair,
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma, Act-
ing Chair of the Committee of the
Whole House on the state of the Union,
reported that that Committee, having
had under consideration the bill (H.R.
986) to provide that certain guidance
related to waivers for State innovation
under the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act shall have no force or
effect, and, pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 357, she reported the bill back to
the House with sundry amendments
adopted in the Committee of the
Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
Is a separate vote demanded on any
amendment reported from the Com-
mittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair

The amendments were agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3548 May 9, 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. WALDEN. Oh, yes, I am, Madam
Speaker, in its current form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Walden moves to recommit the bill
H.R. 986 to the Committee on Energy and
Commerce with instructions to report the
same back to the House forthwith with the
following amendments:
Page 3, strike lines 3 through 5, and insert
the following:
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) On October 24, 2018, the Administration
published new guidance to carry out section
1332 of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18052) entitled ‘‘State Re-
lief and Empowerment Waivers’’ (83 Fed.
Reg. 53575).
(2) The new guidance does not amend such
section 1332 and does not permit the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services to
waive protections for individuals with pre-
existing conditions, including guaranteed
availability and renewability of health in-
surance, the prohibition on using health sta-
tus to vary premiums, and the prohibition on
preexisting conditions exclusions.
(3) Moreover, this guidance stipulates that
any section 1332 waiver will need to carefully
account for any impact on the individual
market risk pool and guarantee that access
to coverage is at least as comprehensive and
affordable as would exist without the waiver.
Page 3, line 17, insert before the period the
following: ‘‘, including if such substantially
similar guidance or rule would allow a State
to waive such requirements as guaranteed
availability and renewability of health in-
surance, the prohibition on using health sta-
tus to vary premiums, or the prohibition on
preexisting conditions exclusions’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, this
bill is blatantly political in its title.
The misleading title of the bill con-
firms the Democratic majority’s pas-
sion to score political points instead of
governing. Madam Speaker, they claim
the agenda is ‘‘for the people.’’ This
bill is ‘‘for the politics’’ and the TV
ads.
This motion to recommit is simple,
Madam Speaker. First, it strikes the
Democrats’ misleading title, and it in-
cludes findings to make clear that,
under current law, Health and Human
Services cannot waive protections for
individuals with preexisting condi-
tions, period. They are protected.
Second, Madam Speaker, the motion
to recommit would prohibit the Secre-
taries of HHS and Treasury from re-
issuing substantially similar guidance,
including guidance that allows the
State to waive guaranteed availability
and renewability of health insurance,
the prohibition on using health status
to vary premiums, and the prohibition
on preexisting conditions exclusions.
Madam Speaker, the Trump adminis-
tration guidance does not amend sec-
tion 1332. It does not permit the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services
to waive protections for individuals
with preexisting conditions, like guar-
anteed availability and renewability of
health insurance, like the prohibition
on using health status to vary pre-
miums, and the prohibition on pre-
existing conditions exclusions.
Moreover, the President’s guidance
stipulates that any section 1332 waiver
will need to carefully account for any
impact on the individual market risk
pool and guarantee—guarantee—that
access to coverage is at least as com-
prehensive and as affordable as would
exist without the waiver.
Now, this is fully explained, Madam
Speaker, in the letter I have here from
the head of CMS, Seema Verma, and I
want to quote directly from it because
I think it is important for our Members
to understand the facts of the matter
here, because facts matter.
‘‘To be very clear, the 2018 guidance
does nothing to erode,’’ I am going to
say ObamaCare or the Affordable Care
Act’s ‘‘preexisting condition provi-
sions’’—nothing—‘‘which cannot be
waived under section 1332. Section 1332
does not permit States to waive Public
Health Service Act requirements such
as guaranteed availability and renew-
ability of health insurance, the prohi-
bition on using health status to vary
premiums, and the prohibition on pre-
existing conditions exclusions.’’
Now why are we here? Why are we
having this discussion? Because people
at home can’t afford the health insur-
ance they are being peddled, and we
want States to be able to innovate and
cut costs for consumers. That is why
we are here. That is what we are for.
Democrats don’t want that. Demo-
crats are opposed to letting States in-
novate, apparently. And let’s look at
what happens.
Madam Speaker, according to Health
and Human Services Administrator
Seema Verma, Grand Island, Nebraska,
a 60-year-old couple making $70,000 a
year is paying about $38,000 for their
insurance premiums, and that plan,
under ObamaCare, gets them an $11,100
deductible.
$38,000 in premiums, $11,000 in
deductibles, and they call that cov-
erage. I call that unaffordable.
Now, meanwhile, we have seven
States that have used the authority
under the last administration. See,
ObamaCare allows this 1332; Trump ex-
pands it. They have been able to drive
down premiums by 19.9 percent. My
State, it is 6 percent; other States have
been more. Alaska, New Jersey, other
States have taken advantage of this.
Republicans and Democrats agree we
will always protect people with pre-
existing conditions. We will always do
that. They can run their ads; they can
deceive people; they can mislead peo-
ple, Madam Speaker; but we will al-
ways fight to protect people with pre-
existing conditions—always. Our plan
last year did it. Our plan this year does
it.
I will tell you what, Madam Speaker.
We would have a vote today on the
House floor to do that, to actually en-
shrine in statute, irrespective of the
lawsuit, protections for Americans
with preexisting conditions, except the
Democrats and the Rules Committee
refuse to allow that amendment to be
considered on the House floor. They
would not do that, because it was my
amendment; it is my bill.
I have been pleading to have this bill
considered so we can lock into statute
protections for Americans’ preexisting
conditions. They want the argument.
They want the politics. They don’t
want the policy.
We are for innovation; we are for
lower premiums; we are for more con-
sumer choice; and we are for driving
down the cost of healthcare in America
so people have coverage they can af-
ford, Madam Chair. That is what our
motion to recommit will do, and I urge
our support.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I
claim the time in opposition.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Michigan is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise
because this motion to recommit is
simply another attempt to take away
protections for people with preexisting
conditions.
Madam Speaker, at face value, the
amendment appears to maintain pro-
tections for people with preexisting
conditions, but make no mistake, no
matter the language included in this
MTR, the goal of the 1332 guidance ex-
pands and promotes junk plans that
discriminate against people with pre-
existing conditions. These plans also
make comprehensive coverage for peo-
ple with preexisting conditions more
expensive.
It is not enough to say, my col-
leagues, that you protect preexisting
conditions. It is what happens on the
ground that matters.
b 1815
If my colleagues are serious about
protecting Americans with preexisting
conditions, I urge them to oppose this
amendment, support the underlying
bill, and join us in doing what the
American public has made very clear
they want.
While Members of the other party
may claim they are ready to work to
protect individuals, their actions tell a
different story.
Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, exactly
this week, most House Republicans
voted overwhelmingly for a bill that
would have gutted the ACA and weak-
ened protections for people with pre-
existing conditions.
My colleagues—including you, sir—
stood on the White House lawn and
celebrated that bill and would have
made it more difficult for people with
preexisting conditions.
A few courageous Republicans, who I
applaud—including the late Senator
John McCain—joined Democratic Mem-
bers and Senators in preventing this
bill from becoming law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3549
May 9, 2019
You can boo John McCain if you
want.
Since then, the administration has
tried every play in the book to under-
cut, sabotage, skirt protections in the
ACA, including protections for people
with preexisting conditions.
We currently have an open suit from
your side that is meant to invalidate
the entirety of the ACA, including pro-
tections for people with preexisting
conditions.
I stand in opposition to this motion
because the issue of protecting people
with preexisting conditions is deeply
personal to me, as it is to so many peo-
ple in this room and in our districts.
My mom passed away in 2011 from
ovarian cancer, and when she was diag-
nosed, she did not have healthcare. She
had struggled to afford healthcare her
entire life.
She had breast cancer as a 31-year
old mom, leaving her with a pre-
existing condition for the rest of her
life. When she lost her job in 2002, she
lost her insurance, and it was impos-
sible to find coverage that she could af-
ford. She went 51⁄2 years with no insur-
ance, no checkup, no gynecological
exam, no one saying ‘‘you should get
tested.’’
In 2008, we finally helped her get in-
surance. Because of her preexisting
condition, it was $1,000 a month and a
$10,000 deductible. She let it lapse and
walked into an ER a few months later
and was diagnosed with stage IV ovar-
ian cancer.
Now, I am sure my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle know exactly
what it is like to have a loved one get
a terminal diagnosis. Your life as you
know it explodes.
And that same week and that same
month that my life was exploding, was
the same week and the same month
that I spent filing the paperwork for
my mom to declare bankruptcy. So, no
one should be gouged because they hap-
pen to be born with a preexisting con-
dition.
We have evolved as a country, as a
Nation, to see that, and I urge my col-
leagues to evolve as well.
Madam Speaker, in my district pro-
tecting people with preexisting condi-
tions is not a Democratic or Repub-
lican issue. It is what people of all po-
litical backgrounds are demanding of
us as their representatives.
That is our mission. That is our man-
date. And to ignore the interest of our
constituents at this point, is derelic-
tion of duty, plain and simple.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
opposing this amendment that would
hurt people like my mom. To my col-
leagues across the aisle, do the right
thing. Put people before politics. Vote
against this amendment.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Without objection, the previous ques-
tion is ordered on the motion to recom-
mit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.

ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING
VICTIMS OF UNIVERSITY OF
NORTH CAROLINA SHOOTING
(Ms. ADAMS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the victims of the
shooting in my district last week on
April 30 at the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte.
The campus was terrorized by gun vi-
olence. Two promising young men,
Ellis ‘‘Reed’’ Parlier and Riley Howell,
lost their lives. Four other students
were injured in this act of senseless vi-
olence.
As a mother, grandmother, and re-
tired professor, my heart goes out to
the loved ones and the entire UNC com-
munity. Too many people fear for their
safety in their schools, on their cam-
puses, and even in their places of wor-
ship.
Enough is enough. We can and must
do more to stop gun violence. UNCC
and the Charlotte community will
never forget last week’s tragedy, and
we will never forget Reed and Riley.
We will honor their memories with ac-
tion and continue working to keep our
communities safe.
I ask all Members and guests in the
gallery to rise for a moment of silence.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, which requires appropriate
medical care for babies who survive
abortion procedures and imposes
strong criminal penalties for failure to
provide such care, and ask for its im-
mediate consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by bipartisan floor and com-
mittee leadership.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, if this
unanimous consent request cannot be
entertained, I urge the Speaker and the
majority leader to immediately sched-
ule the born-alive bill, so we can stand
up and protect the sanctity of human
life.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is not recognized for debate.

MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH
AWARENESS
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, May is
Mental Health Awareness Month.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor America’s mothers and to raise
awareness about maternal mental
health.
Each year in the United States, an
estimated 1.3 million women suffer
from perinatal mood and anxiety dis-
orders, such as maternal depression.
To all the mothers or potential
mothers out there, know that maternal
depression is nothing to be ashamed of.
It is the number one complication of
pregnancy in the United States, and it
can affect women regardless of the out-
come of the pregnancy. Do not be
afraid to reach out to healthcare pro-
fessionals to get treatment.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in honoring the
mothers, the survivors of maternal de-
pression, and the great organizations

TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today during
Teacher Appreciation Week to cele-
brate America’s hardworking, dedi-
cated, and passionate teachers.
The National Education Association
and the National PTA team up each
year to recognize the contributions our
teachers make every day to shape the
minds of their students.
Madam Speaker, I am sure every
Member of the House can think of a
teacher who had a positive influence on
not only their education but their life.
Our teachers push students to
achieve their best, and they show stu-
dents how to realize their full poten-
tial.
Teachers are some of the most power-
ful professionals in the entire world.
They lend a caring hand and extend a
loving heart. They make differences in
the lives of our students academically,
emotionally, and physically.
I thank every teacher in America for
the job they do, for the hours they
work, for the patience they show, and
for the impact they have on so many
lives.
Happy Teachers Appreciation Week.
This Nation would be lost without
them.
f
BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker,
this coming Sunday, millions of Ameri-
cans will celebrate Mother’s Day.
While I look forward to celebrating
Mother’s Day and honoring my own
mom, I know that mothers deserve
more than to be celebrated. They de-
serve safe pregnancies and births, and
healthy lives for themselves and their
babies.
In the 14th Congressional District of
Illinois, we are committed to this
cause. This past weekend, I joined con-
stituents and Medela employees in
McHenry County at the March for Ba-
bies 5K, which raised tens of thousands
of dollars to improve the health of
moms and babies.
This could not come at a more crit-
ical time. The maternal mortality rate
in the U.S. has more than doubled over
the last 30 years. It is a crisis.
Underlying this crisis are alarming
disparities. Black women are nearly
four times more likely than White
women, and more than twice as likely
than women of other races, to die from
preventable, pregnancy-related com-
plications.
This week, I joined Congresswoman
AYANNA PRESSLEY and my Black Ma-
ternal Health Caucus cofounder, Con-
gresswoman ALMA ADAMS, to address
this crisis by introducing the Healthy
MOMMIES Act.
The Healthy MOMMIES Act would
expand access to essential health serv-
ices to improve outcomes for mothers
and eliminate disparities in morbidity
and mortality for moms.

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING
OFFICER ROBERT MCKEITHEN
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I
rise today along with my fellow mem-
bers of the Mississippi delegation to ex-
press the sorrow and grief within our
hearts. This week, the city of Biloxi
lost one of our law enforcement officers
at the hands of senseless violence.
Officer Robert McKeithen’s end of
watch was on May 5, 2019, when he was
killed in the line of duty less than an
hour after helping a Biloxi man out of
his wrecked car.
McKeithen was an Air Force veteran
who served our Biloxi Police Depart-
ment for nearly 24 years. He was a fam-
ily man who leaves behind a wife and
children.
During his time as an officer,
McKeithen became known for his self-
less acts to put those in our commu-
nity first. Particularly, he was awarded
the Medal of Honor for his heroic ac-
tions during Hurricane Katrina, where
he went out of his way to save the lives
of a family trapped in their home while
the floodwaters were rising.
We have come to expect our law en-
forcement officers to run to the dan-
gers we civilians run from. They choose
to keep our families and neighborhoods
safe, never knowing if they will return
home to their own families when their
shift ends.
Our community now comes together
in a time of grief mourning the loss of
our fallen hero.
Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask
the House to join me in a moment of si-
lence to honor the life and service of
Officer Robert McKeithen.
f
THE MUELLER REPORT
(Mr. ENGEL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I read
from the Mueller report, volume II,
page 107: ‘‘At some point after the May
17, 2017, appointment of the special
counsel, then-Attorney General Ses-
sions recalled, the President called him
at home and asked if Sessions would
‘unrecuse’ himself. According to Ses-
sions, the President asked him to re-
verse his recusal so that Sessions could
direct the Department of Justice to in-
vestigate and prosecute Hillary Clin-
ton, and the ‘gist’ of the conversation
was that the President wanted Sessions
to unrecuse from ‘all of it,’ including
the special counsel’s Russia investiga-
tion.’’
Again, the Mueller report, volume II,
page 107.

GUYTON UMC MEN’S BIBLE CLASS
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
Guyton United Methodist Church
Men’s Bible Class on the 63rd anniver-
sary of its Fifth Sunday Morning
Breakfast. Occurring on each fifth Sun-
day of the month, the morning break-
fast has become an institution in
Effingham County since 1956.
The Bible class sends invitations
across Effingham County and neigh-
boring counties, and nearly everyone
there knows about the breakfast. By
inviting guest speakers from a number
of different civic organizations, the
breakfast is a unique opportunity for
the citizens and religious community
in Effingham County to engage di-
rectly in government and other types
of public issues.
Just recently, the Fifth Sunday
Morning Breakfast hosted a guest
speaker discussing his time deployed as
a member of the U.S. Army Reserves in
Bosnia and Afghanistan, as well as his
service in the New York State Police
Department.
I want to thank the Guyton United
Methodist Church Men’s Bible Class for
engaging all the citizens of Effingham
County, and I am proud to have an or-
ganization like this in the First Con-
gressional District of Georgia. Con-
gratulations on their 63rd anniversary.

HEALTHCARE AND PREEXISTING

(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I
am grateful for the opportunity to
speak to the Members of the House.
As a dentist, I have a firsthand un-
derstanding of the American
healthcare system and the need to
make it both accessible and affordable.
I have seen the high costs of
healthcare and how they can be dev-
astating to those who suffer a health
emergency.
Additionally, those with preexisting
conditions should not feel under the
constant threat of losing or not being
able to obtain coverage.
We must protect our families and our
small businesses, including those with
preexisting conditions, and work to

lower the high cost of healthcare and
prescription drugs. Individuals and
families lose their homes and their ve-
hicles—literally, their entire way of
life—due to the high cost of healthcare
and prescription drugs.
This week, we voted to lower pre-
scription prices and to protect those
with preexisting conditions. We must
continue to work together right here in
the House in a bipartisan way to do
what is right and to make healthcare
more accessible for all of the American
people.

RECOGNIZING BOREALIS, BOROUGE
IN TAYLORSVILLE, NORTH CARO-
LINA
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize the inau-
guration of the Borealis, Borouge plant
in Taylorsville, North Carolina. It is
the first of the company’s North Amer-
ican facilities dedicated to automotive
materials production and is well posi-
tioned to source suppliers and original
equipment manufacturers in the
Southeast United States.
It is exciting to see another way that
progrowth policies adopted by the
North Carolina State Legislature and
this body last Congress are attracting
capital and creating new jobs.
The investment by Borealis also says
much about the high caliber of people
in Taylorsville. They are entrepre-
neurial-minded and working hard to
grow their business community. Begin-
ning with 30 new full-time jobs, Bore-
alis aims to expand in the region
through local relationships and by de-
veloping a new generation of talent.
I am very proud to represent the
Taylorsville community and to see new
opportunities taking off in its econ-
omy.
f
FAMILIES BELONG TOGETHER
(Ms. HAALAND asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to stand in solidarity with
families suffering from this adminis-
tration’s inhumane policy of sepa-
rating children from their parents.
Earlier this week was the 1-year an-
niversary of this administration’s fam-
ily separation policy, and today hun-
dreds of families are still separated.
That means hundreds of children will
not be with their mothers on Mother’s
Day.
This week, I visited a Families Be-
long Together art installation outside
the Capitol by Paola Mendoza. It de-
picted a mother reaching out in an-
guish for her child who was in a cage.
That is the reality for these families,
and they will feel this trauma for the
rest of their lives.
Native Americans know all too well
the long-lasting trauma of govern-
ment-enforced family separation. Our
communities still struggle with the
impact that cruel assimilation policy
has had.
This trauma cannot be undone. We
cannot let this administration forget
the chaos it created in so many peo-
ple’s lives, and we must stop the racist
policies it continues to push.
f
NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS
WEEK
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize National Small
Business Week.
There are over 30 million small busi-
nesses across the country, and over
half of the American workforce is ei-
ther employed by a small business or
operates one.
With April’s strong jobs report and
the unemployment rate reaching the
lowest in 50 years—a truly unprece-
dented level of 3.6 percent—it is clear
American small businesses are thriv-
ing.
There is no bigger job creator. Small
businesses are the mainstay of our
economy, a big reason why it is boom-
ing.
Two out of three jobs created in the
U.S. are within a small business. Last
month, there were 263,000 nonfarm jobs
created, surpassing most predictions.
Indeed, our economy is doing quite
well and, as a result, so are our small
business owners. I believe the
progrowth policies of the last Congress
and this administration, such as tax re-
form and regulatory reform, have quite
a lot to do with it.
I will always be a strong supporter of
small business, and I hope this body
will as well and continue to support
the policies that will help them suc-
ceed.
I thank those who are hanging in
there in the small business commu-
nity—keep going, and keep creating.
f
TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK
(Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Teacher Ap-
preciation Week and honor all who in-
spire and motivate our children every
day.
I want to thank all the wonderful and
dedicated teachers across Colorado and
the country, including my wife, Nancy,
and my sister, Cassie, who are both
public schoolteachers. I have witnessed
firsthand their commitment to their
students and their schools.
Being a teacher is a tough job, but
one of the most important. We all have
teachers who pushed us, counseled us,
or took a friend or family member
under their wing and shaped our lives.
Nowadays, too often, our teachers, in
addition to teaching and educating us,
have to protect and defend us. We have
had that instance recently in Colorado.
The passion for education shown by
teachers in Colorado and across the
country is amazing. I look forward to
working with my colleagues to invest
in our schools, reduce class sizes, and
ensure our teachers have the resources
they need to educate the next genera-
tion.

REMEMBERING WESTLAND
FIREFIGHTER BRIAN WOEHLKE
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, 6 years
ago yesterday, Westland firefighter
Brian Woehlke made the ultimate sac-
rifice when he died courageously bat-
tling a blaze at a local strip mall.
Brian, who was born in Detroit, cer-
tainly was courageous, and he lost his
life after the 29 short years he had been
on this Earth.
On the sixth anniversary of his tragic
passing, let us remember him and his
loving family that survives him, in-
cluding his wife, Jennifer, and his
daughter, Ava. We thank them for
their selflessness and bravery, and we
honor them by offering unwavering
support for the men and women who
continue to serve as our first respond-
ers across the country.

DC at a proposed total annual cost of
$8,650,000 for a lease term of up to 20 years,
a prospectus for which is attached to and in-
cluded in this resolution.
Approval of this prospectus constitutes au-
thority to execute an interim lease for all
tenants, if necessary, prior to the execution
of the new lease.
Provided that, the Administrator of General
Services and tenant agency(ies) agree to
apply an overall utilization rate of 201 square
feet or less per person, except that, if the Ad-
ministrator determines that the overall uti-
lization rate cannot be achieved, the Admin-
istrator shall provide an explanatory state-
ment to the Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure of the House of Rep-
resentatives prior to exercising any lease au-
thority provided in this resolution.
Provided that, except for interim leases as
described above, the Administrator may not
enter into any leases that are below pro-
spectus level for the purposes of meeting any
of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-
cluded in the prospectus that would result in
an overall utilization rate of 201 square feet
or higher per person.
Provided that, to the maximum extent
practicable, the Administrator shall include
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option
that can be exercised at the conclusion of
the firm term of the lease.
Provided further, that the General Services
Administration shall not delegate to any
other agency the authority granted by this
resolution.
Provided further, that the Administrator
shall require that the delineated area of the
procurement is identical to the delineated
area included in the prospectus, except that,
if the Administrator determines that the de-
lineated area of the procurement should not
be identical to the delineated area included
in the prospectus, the Administrator shall
provide an explanatory statement to the
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure of the House of Representatives
prior to exercising any lease authority pro-
vided in this resolution.
Provided further, not later than 30 calendar
days after the date on which a request from
the Chairman or Ranking Member of the
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure of the House of Representatives is
received by the Administrator of General
Services, the Administrator shall provide
such Member a response in writing that pro-
vides any information requested regarding
the project.
Provided further, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services may not enter into this lease if
it does not contain a provision barring any
individual holding a Federally-elected office,
regardless of whether such individual took
office before or after execution of this lease,

under this lease or any part thereof and that
such provision provide that if this lease is
found to have been made in violation of the
foregoing prohibition or it is found that this
prohibition has been violated during the
term of the lease, the lease shall be void, ex-
cept that the foregoing limitation shall not
apply if the lease is entered into with a pub-
licly-held corporation or publicly-held entity
for the general benefit of such corporation or
entity.
Provided further, prior to entering into this
lease or approving a novation agreement in-
volving a change of ownership under this
lease, the Administrator of General Services

questing the novation, as applicable, to iden-
tify and disclose whether the owner of the

eral Services shall notify the occupant agen-
cy(ies) in writing, and consult with such oc-
cupant agency(ies) regarding security con-
cerns and necessary mitigation measures (if
any) prior to award of the lease or approval

Provided that, to the maximum extent
practicable, the Administrator of General
Services shall require that the lease procure-
ment consider the availability of public
transportation consistent with agency mis-
sion requirements and that the space to be

PHARMACY DRUG PRICES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER) is recognized for 60
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members may have 5 legislative
days in which to revise and extend
their remarks and include extraneous
material on the subject matter of my
Special Order tonight.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I am grateful for the time to-
night to talk about a very important
subject. As many Members know, cur-
rently, I am the only pharmacist serv-
ing in Congress, and that is something
I take very seriously.
Two of the things that I really want-
ed to concentrate on when I became a
Member of Congress, among many
things, but two of the main things
were, first of all, prescription drug
pricing—that is one of the things that
we want to talk about here tonight—
and the other thing that I wanted to
concentrate on was the opioid epi-
demic. We have been very successful
here in Congress in addressing that
issue.
Tonight I want to talk about pre-
scription drug pricing because I have
witnessed it. I have witnessed what I
would describe as truly a crisis.
After 30 years of practicing phar-
macy, I have seen families struggle to
pay for their medications. I have seen
senior citizens at the counter across
from me try to make a decision be-
tween buying medication and buying
groceries. I have seen mothers literally
in tears because they couldn’t afford
the medication for their children.
When I came up to Washington, that
was one of the things I wanted to con-
centrate on. We are very fortunate we
have a President and administration
who are focused on this issue as well
and have done some outstanding
things. Two of those things that are
being proposed by the administration
right now I want to talk about tonight,
but the main thing I want to talk
about is the prescription drug chain.
Just earlier today, we had a hearing
in the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, in the Health Subcommittee
that I serve on, where we had rep-
resentatives from the pharmaceutical
manufacturers and from the PBMs, the
pharmacy benefit managers, pointing
fingers at each other and blaming each
other for the problem.
b 1900
I have to tell you, in full disclosure,
I am a big fan of the pharmaceutical
manufacturers. What I have seen over
my years of pharmacy practice has
been nothing short of phenomenal.
When I first started practicing phar-
macy in the early 1980s, I can remem-
ber a time when, if you needed an anti-
biotic, you had to take 40 tetracycline.
You had to take four a day for 10 days.
Now you can take an antibiotic or get
a shot in one day and be cured of some
of the things that we were treating
back there in 1980 with a 10-day supply.
I have seen illnesses such as hepatitis
C—and hepatitis C, when I first started
practicing pharmacy, was pretty much
a death warrant. If you were diagnosed
with hepatitis C, you were probably
going to die.
Through the research and develop-
ment of the pharmaceutical manufac-
turers, I have seen them come up with
medication so that we can now treat
hepatitis C. That is phenomenal. We
can cure it with a pill, and it is because
of the research and development that
has been done through our pharma-
ceutical manufacturers and through
the National Institutes of Health that
we have reached this point.
However, the price of those medica-
tions, in many cases, makes it inacces-
sible for people. If you have to pay
$85,000 for a medication to treat hepa-
titis C, for many people, that is just
simply not accessible. If that medica-
tion is not accessible, it does you no
good whatsoever.
I have called on the pharmaceutical
manufacturers to do their part as well.
They are not without responsibility
here, and I think they understand that.
Tonight, what I want to concentrate
on are the PBMs, the pharmacy benefit
managers, the middlemen, if you will.
If you look at their mission statement,
they will tell you their mission is to
lower drug costs.
My questions to you would be: How is
that working out? If that is working
out, if they are achieving their mis-
sion, why are we here? Why are we here
tonight talking about this, the high
prescription drug costs?
I submit to you that they bring no
value whatsoever to the healthcare
system.
Madam Speaker, I am very blessed
tonight to have a number of speakers
here with us to share their expertise,
and I want to hear from some of them
right now.
I want to begin with the gentleman
from Kansas, Representative ROGER
MARSHALL, who also is a physician, was
a hospital administrator, and knows
and understands this system.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL).
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I
thank my colleague for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Trump administration’s
rule that will modernize Medicare part
D and, as a result, lower drug prices,
reduce out-of-pocket expenses for
America’s seniors, and make critical
fixes to our systems that will help our
local pharmacies.
Across Kansas, there are 506 chain
drugstores and 253 independent commu-
nity pharmacists. These pharmacists
are honest, hardworking men and
women who often go above and beyond
to ensure that patients know how to
manage their medications.
I have heard their stories, and they
all share the same frustration: direct
and indirect remuneration, or DIR,
fees.
In many instances in rural America,
the only healthcare professionals left
standing are my good friends and col-
leagues from the noble pharmacy pro-
fession, and these DIR fees are running
them out of town.
The increase of DIR fees over the last
several years has raised out-of-pocket
costs for our seniors and put our phar-
macies at financial risk, often oper-
ating in negative margins.
Far too regularly, pharmacy benefit
managers, or PBMs, collect DIR fees
from pharmacies months and months
after claims. It is completely unpre-
dictable and unfair, and the benefits all
go into the pockets of the pharmacy
benefit managers.
Shame on them for doing this, but
not anymore. This proposed rule will
guarantee predictability by helping
standardize the process and end the
disparity between pharmacists, pa-
tients, and PBMs.
The Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services estimated that seniors
will save up to $9 billion—$9 billion—
over the next 10 years, and the Federal
Government will save nearly $17 billion
over that same timeframe.
I appreciate President Trump and his
administration for addressing this con-
cern and providing commonsense, fi-
nancially responsible solutions.
It is my hope and the hope of phar-
macists across the country that this
rule will be finalized quickly so that it
can go into effect next year.
I would like to recognize my col-
league, pharmacist BUDDY CARTER, who
may know this issue better than any of
us, as our only pharmacist in Congress.
I thank my colleagues Dr. PHIL ROE,
MORGAN GRIFFITH, and PETER WELCH
for leading on this issue and bringing it
front and center for both the Doctors
Caucus and the Energy and Commerce
Committee members.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his
keen insight on this subject. It is very
important, and I appreciate his exper-
tise.
Madam Speaker, what the gentleman
from Kansas was speaking about are
two proposals that are before CMS
right now.
One proposal would do away with
DIR fees. Now, let’s make sure we un-
derstand that DIR stands for direct and
indirect remuneration. This is when
the PBMs go back months later—in
some cases, years later—and recoup, or
claw back, reimbursements for what
they have already sent to the phar-
macies.
You can imagine what kind of impact
this would have on a business. There is

no sustainable business model out
there that can absorb that.
I get texts all the time from small
pharmacy chains that are telling me: I
just got a bill from the PBM. Last
year, my total DIR fees were $500,000, a
half million dollars.
That is money they have already
paid taxes on, but they are clawing it
back. They are taking it back.
CMS has proposed that that end. I
am in support of that, and I appreciate
CMS doing this.
The other proposed rule that CMS
has come out with has to do with the
rebates, or discounts, if you will, that
are offered to the PBMs by the pharma-
ceutical manufacturers—not offered to
them, but the PBMs demand them from
the pharmaceutical manufacturers.
What CMS is proposing is that all of
those rebates, or discounts, if you will,
be given at the point of sale.
What we are trying to achieve here is
to make sure that those rebates, that
those discounts, are going where they
are supposed to be going, and that is to
the patients.
Keep in mind, everything we are
talking about here is about the pa-
tient. We are talking about patient
care.
My next guest speaker is also an ex-
pert in healthcare. In fact, he is an-
other one of the members of our Doc-
tors Caucus, a urologist from Florida,
Representative NEAL DUNN, who, again,
has practiced in the healthcare field
and who has seen this with his pa-
tients.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN).
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Representative CARTER, who is a col-
league, a friend, and a neighbor, and
who also has genuine expertise on this
subject.
The administration recently pub-
lished two rules that tackle the issues
faced by both our Medicare bene-
ficiaries and the pharmacies that serve
them.
One rule in particular, the ‘‘Modern-
izing Part D and Medicare Advantage
to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-
of-Pocket Expenses’’ rule, addresses
pharmacy direct and indirect remu-
neration fee reform by instituting that
DIR fees will be negotiated at the point
of sale instead of the underhanded and
retroactive fashion by which the plans
and PBMs currently operate.
Currently, pharmacies can face these
clawback fees after they have already
filled and sold a prescription for Medi-
care part D and Medicare Advantage
patients.
DIR fees have become a catchall cat-
egory for pharmacy benefit managers
to collect more overhead after pre-
scriptions are sold.
Pharmacies are often unaware of
what they will owe, and the standards
for these fees can be impossible to
meet. As a result, many independent
pharmacies in my district are forced to
provide the drugs at below cost.
Imagine that for just a moment. DIR
fees are causing pharmacies to operate
in the red, all while they are providing
lifesaving medication to America’s sen-
iors.
DIR fees have also led to drastic in-
creases in out-of-pocket costs for our
patients, which, in turn, forces seniors
into the doughnut hole of Medicare
part D even sooner.
To protect seniors and pharmacists
in my district, and as a medical profes-
sional, I urge CMS to finalize the lan-
guage included in the rule that reflects
the negotiated price at the point of
sale.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank Dr. DUNN for his keen
insight on this very important subject
and for his comments.
Madam Speaker, I have a couple
other comments about PBMs.
As I mentioned earlier, if you look at
their website, if you look at what their
mission statement is, it says that they
are there to lower drug costs. Well,
that is not working out very well.
Let me say this: I am not opposed to
anybody making money. I get it. That
is capitalism, and that is fine.
But three PBMs control 80 percent of
the market—80 percent of the market.
Three companies control that, three
PBMs. The largest PBM, in 2016, had
gross revenues that exceeded that of
Ford Motor Company, Pfizer Pharma-
ceuticals, and McDonald’s added to-
gether.
Again, I am not opposed to anybody
making money, but tell me how a com-
pany can make more than Pfizer Phar-
maceuticals, McDonald’s, and Ford
Motor Company combined.
To make matters even worse, those
companies are worldwide. This PBM is
just domestic. They are just here in
America.
Again, I am not opposed to anybody
making money, but tell me the value
they are bringing to the system. They
are not bringing any value to the sys-
tem.
That is why I am in support of what
CMS is proposing: doing away with the
DIR fees; making sure that the rebates,
the discounts, if you will, are given at
the point of sale; and increasing trans-
parency.
Madam Speaker, the next speaker is
a good friend, a member of the Georgia
delegation, Congressman RICK ALLEN
from Augusta. RICK is a businessman, a
very successful businessman. He under-
stands the challenges in business. Cer-
tainly, healthcare costs, I am sure,
were challenges for him.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN).
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Congressman CARTER for yielding and
for his efforts here this evening to
shine a light on an issue that we all
know is affecting far too many Ameri-
cans.
It is a shame to keep doing things
when they don’t work. Something has
to be done.
Madam Speaker, the rising cost of
prescription drugs is causing signifi-
cant financial burdens for millions of
Americans, patients, seniors, and our
businesses. Too often, Americans have
to choose between much-needed pre-
scriptions and household expenses.
However, President Trump made it
clear to the American people during his
State of the Union Address that low-
ering the cost of prescription drugs was
one of his top priorities. As we have
seen throughout his Presidency, prom-
ises made are promises kept.
Earlier this year, the Trump admin-
istration issued a proposal that would
create incentives to lower list prices
and reduce out-of-pocket spending on
prescription drugs, potentially becom-
ing the most sweeping change to how
American drugs are priced, a much-
needed change.
By delivering discounts directly to
patients at the pharmacy counter and
bringing long-overdue transparency to
a broken system, we are putting pa-
tients and seniors first. That is how it
should be.
It is high time to end these kick-
backs to pharmacy middlemen, re-
ferred to as PBMs, in this process of
dealing with these DIRs, which are put-
ting many of those in the pharma-
ceutical business in my district out of
business.
I thank the administration, Con-
gressman CARTER, and my fellow col-
leagues this evening for their commit-
ment to righting this ship and reducing
drug prices for all Americans.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his
comments, and I certainly appreciate
his leadership here in the House.
Madam Speaker, as you heard earlier
from one of our speakers, CMS esti-
mates that this change alone, doing
away with the DIR fees—putting the
discounts, the rebates, if you will, at
the point of sale—will benefit the con-
sumer, benefit the patient, and could
save patients $7.1 to $9.2 billion.
b 1915
Now, let me tell you, that is signifi-
cant. That is significant for those sen-
ior citizens that I was talking about
earlier who are trying to make a deci-
sion between buying medicine and buy-
ing groceries. That is significant to
that mother who is trying to buy the
medication for her child. Those savings
will help. Transparency will help.
The savings are going to go much
further than just this estimated seven
to $9 billion, because as we get better
transparency we will get lower drug
prices. I am convinced of that.
Madam Speaker, my next speaker is
a gentleman who certainly understands
this issue and has worked closely on it.
He has been a champion on this issue.
Representative AUSTIN SCOTT, from
Georgia, has gone to great lengths to
study this issue. He has met with small
pharmacies in his district. He has dis-
cussed with them the problem, and he
understands it; and we are very, very
fortunate to have him and his input.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN
SCOTT).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3660 May 9, 2019
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my
colleague, Representative CARTER, for
his work on this. He was a small phar-
macy owner before he got here.
Prior to my arrival in Congress, I
was actually an insurance broker for
many years, a health insurance broker.
And it always amazed me, as pharmacy
benefit managers tried to explain their
business model, that they actually
couldn’t explain their business model.
So I rise today in support of our local
pharmacies and the unique role that
they play in serving patients. I stand
here to commend the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services and the re-
cently-proposed rule aimed at address-
ing direct and indirect remuneration,
DIR, fees and drug rebates; rebates
that don’t go to the consumer, but re-
bates that go to multibillion-dollar
corporations.
I frequently make stops at local
pharmacies when I am back at my
home in Georgia, and I appreciate the
services that they provide their cus-
tomers.
I am from a small town, and local
pharmacists are a fixture in the com-
munity. They are the first line of de-
fense in preventing and treating a cus-
tomer’s needs. They have known most
of their customers in their community
for many years.
I will give you one brief example. As
an insurance broker, we had written a
contract on a business and the cards
had not come in yet. And there is a
small-town pharmacy, and then there
is the big chain pharmacy. One of the
employee’s children had gotten sick.
Guess which pharmacist was willing
to work with the family to get them
the medicine before the insurance card
came in? And guess which pharmacist
was blocked out of the plan by the
pharmacy benefit managers? It was the
same one, the local, small-town phar-
macist.
I am troubled on many of these vis-
its, because I know how these commu-
nity pharmacies are finding it more
and more difficult to serve their neigh-
bors while remaining competitive in
the larger healthcare marketplace.
I hear from my constituents regu-
larly about the financial burden they
face as drug prices continue to climb.
And the price for a drug today, when
they go to get it refilled a month from
now may be totally different, and rare-
ly is it lower.
Plain and simple, we pay too much
for drugs in this country. I would hope
that it is something that we could
work together in a bipartisan manner.
President Trump has already said that
he is willing to sign a piece of legisla-
tion to reduce the cost of pharma-
ceuticals in this country, and it is
something that we should be able to
come together and pass to help the
American citizens and reduce the cost
of healthcare for the American family.
Most Americans assume that it is
probably a pretty simple transaction
for the pharmacist when the phar-
macist purchases the drugs, even
though they know it is a very complex
transaction for them, never knowing
what the drug is going to cost prior to
going into the pharmacy.
But the pharmacy transaction is just
as complex; and it is anything but
clear and simple, and this is because of
the pharmacy benefit managers.
They have used direct and indirect
remuneration fees, DIR fees, to claw
back money from pharmacies on indi-
vidual claims, long after those claims
are believed to have been resolved.
It means that a pharmacy doesn’t
know how the final reimbursement
amount will be received for a claim for
weeks or even months. And anyone
who runs any business, healthcare
business or any other business, knows
you can’t operate when you don’t know
what your reimbursement is.
CMS recently proposed drug pricing
rules addressing this issue head-on by
requiring all pharmacy price conces-
sions, a subset of DIR, to be included in
the negotiated price, which is the price
the pharmacy will be reimbursed at the
point of sale for dispensing the drug.
This directive would move negotiated
drug prices much closer to the cost of
the drug for the Part D sponsor, essen-
tially eliminating retroactive phar-
macy DIR fees.
Patients win when pharmacy price
concessions are included in the nego-
tiated price.
I want to commend the administra-
tion for making lowering drug prices a
priority; and I want to challenge my
colleagues in the Democratic Party to
work with the administration and the
Republicans in this House to push for-
ward legislation that would continue
to reduce the cost of healthcare, spe-
cifically pharmaceuticals, for the
American citizen.
I, along with many of my colleagues
on both sides of this aisle, have advo-
cated for these sorts of reforms that
bring transparency and accountability
to the system.
Now who could be against trans-
parency and accountability?
These are bipartisan issues on which
we share broad agreement. I call on the
leadership of this House to put the par-
tisan politics aside; follow the lead of
the administration; or walk with the
administration to address the lack of
transparency in the pharmaceutical in-
dustry. Give pharmacies a level playing
field to compete, and provide Ameri-
cans access to affordable prescription
drugs.
This is something that we should
have done for the American citizens
long ago and it is something that we
can do right now.
Madam Speaker, I thank my good
friend and fellow Georgian, Mr. CAR-
TER, for hosting this Special Order this
evening. I look forward to continuing
to resolve this issue for the American
citizens.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his
comments, and I thank him for his
work. He truly has been a champion for
his constituents.
His father is a doctor and, certainly,
he understands healthcare. As he men-
tioned, he was an insurance broker, he
understands insurance. And a lot of
what we talk about here is insurance.
Let me try to articulate, if you will,
exactly what I am talking about here.
Some of the folks back home who are
watching may be thinking, well, I don’t
really understand why the pharma-
ceutical manufacturers have to go
through the PBMs.
What happens is that insurance com-
panies work on formularies. In other
words, they say, if you have got this
disease, or if you have got this health
problem, these are the drugs that we
are going to cover.
The pharmaceutical manufacturer, in
order to get their drug on that for-
mulary, has to go to the PBM, the mid-
dleman, and has to offer them dis-
counts, rebates, if you will, in order to
get their product on that formulary.
That is what we are talking about.
That is where they have the pharma-
ceutical manufacturers by the short
hairs, if you will. That is where they
really put the pressure on. So that is
really what we are talking about.
Look, again, as I have said before, I
am not opposed to anybody making
money, but show me the value.
I mentioned a hearing that we had
earlier today in the Health Sub-
committee of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. I mentioned that we
had some PBMs there. We had two
PBMs there. One is one of the major
PBMs that requires the pharmaceutical
manufacturers to give them rebates in
order to have their products listed on
the formulary.
And then another PBM was there,
and they are just a flat fee. In other
words, they just charge an administra-
tive fee. That is all they charge. Again,
PBMs, that is the way they evolved.
All they were to begin with, when they
started way back when, were just sim-
ply processors.
But enough about what we have done
here in Washington. Let’s talk for just
a minute about State legislators and
what State legislative actions have
been taken.
Let me clarify and let me point out
that I am not talking about just red
States. I am not talking about just
blue States. I am not talking about big
States. I am not talking about small
States. I am talking about all States,
all the States in our union;
I am talking about States like Ohio.
Ohio’s Department of Medicaid pub-
lished a report in January detailing ex-
actly how PBMs have been gaming the
system; that’s right; in Ohio.
Ohio found that CVS—CVS is
Caremark—that they had been using
their role as the PBM for their State
Medicaid program to pay CVS phar-
macies as much as 46 percent more
than competing pharmacies.
Now, this is something else we need
to talk about. We need to talk about

what is referred to as vertical integra-
tion. That is, right now, where the in-
surance company owns the PBM and
owns the pharmacy.
The top three that I mentioned ear-
lier that control 80 percent of the mar-
ket, that is the case with all of them.
CVS is the pharmacy. Caremark is the
PBM. Aetna is the insurance company.
Now, when we were talking to the
PBMs today in the committee, we
would ask them, what are you doing
with these discounts? What are you
doing with these rebates that you get?
And they would tell us, well, we give
them back to the plan sponsors, and
the plan sponsors decrease premiums.
Anybody seen their premium decreas-
ing recently? I don’t think I have.
But think about it for a moment. If
the insurance company owns the PBM,
and owns the pharmacy, if the PBM is
going to give it back to the insurance
company, isn’t that just taking money
out of one pocket and putting it in the
other pocket?
I mean, if CVS—if Caremark is going
to give back the money that they are
saving in the third party with the
PBMs to the insurance company,
Aetna, that they also own—and they
are not the only one.
What about Express Scripts? Express
Scripts just recently bought Cigna. So
you have got Cigna as the insurance
company. You have got Express Scripts
as the PBM. And, oh, by the way, Ex-
press Scripts has their own mail order
pharmacy and in terms of volume, they
are the third largest in America. So,
again, we have the situation there.
Same thing goes with United,
UnitedHealthcare owns Optum, and
they have their own mail order phar-
macy.
So, there you have the three top
PBMs, controlling 80 percent of the
market; that also have their own insur-
ance company, and they also have their
own pharmacy.
This is what happened in Ohio. Ohio
discovered that Caremark, that third
party, the PBM, was paying their phar-
macy, CVS, 46 percent more than they
were paying competing pharmacies.
That is an example of where they were
taking money out of one pocket and
putting it in another pocket.
What about New York State? Their
State Medicaid reported that PBMs
were pocketing a 32 percent markup on
generic drugs; 32 percent markup on
generic drugs; the drugs patients tradi-
tionally rely on to be more affordable
than their branded alternatives. But
New York caught them red-handed.
I can go on and name State after
State. The State of Arkansas called a
special session to address the situation
with PBMs.
Just yesterday, my home State of
Georgia, the Governor signed into leg-
islation two bills dealing with PBMs;
one of them that would prohibit PBMs
from steering their patients to their
own pharmacies and steering them
away from other pharmacies, inde-
pendent pharmacies.
So this is just not the Federal Gov-
ernment acting on these issues. We
have had States who have acted on
these issues as well.
So let’s talk about a couple of other
things that we have done in Congress.
One thing that I want to mention, be-
cause I thought it was such an egre-
gious thing that the PBMs were doing
in the past—we, thankfully, were able
to address this—was called the gag
clause.
Thankfully, we had legislation that I
was honored to sponsor here in the
House that was passed in the House,
passed in the Senate, signed into law
by the President. It addressed the gag
clause.
What is a gag clause?
You want to talk about the audacity
of the PBMs? Let me tell you about the
audacity of the PBMs.
As I mentioned earlier, about the
pharmaceutical manufacturers being
under pressure to give the PBMs dis-
counts, rebates, if you will, in order to
get their drugs on the formularies;
well, independent pharmacies are the
same way. They are under pressure.
What the PBMs did is they told—
they had a clause in their contract
with the pharmacy, and it said that if
a drug is cheaper if you buy it out of
pocket, if you pay for it out of pocket,
if you buy it for cash than the copay,
you cannot tell the patient that.
b 1930
And if you do tell the patient that,
then you run the risk of being kicked
out of the network. Well, the reality is
you can’t afford to be kicked out of the
network. If you lose thousands of bod-
ies because that PBM controls that
network, then you are out of business.
So pharmacies had no other choice.
Patients were paying more with their
copay than what they would have paid
for it if they would have simply paid
out of pocket, just simply paid cash.
We did away with that.
Thank you, Mr. President, for sign-
ing that legislation.
We addressed that in Congress. We
said, no, that is not going to happen
anymore. Now pharmacists can do
what they were trained to do, and that
is take care of their patients and tell
them, Look, if you pay for this, you
can buy it for $4 and you don’t have to
pay a $20 copay.
You say, Well, how often did that
happen?
Well, let me give you just one exam-
ple that happened in our committee, in
the Energy and Commerce Committee.
We actually had one of our Members
who was the primary caregiver for her
husband, who was very ill at the time.
We had been talking about the gag
clause, so she knew about it. She knew
that pharmacists weren’t allowed to
offer that information.
So she went into the pharmacy, and
she was told that her husband’s medi-
cation, no exaggeration, was going to
be $600. She knew to ask the phar-
macist. She said, What if I just pay for
it out of pocket? What if I just pay you
cash? How much will it be?
$40. $40.
Now, granted, this is an extreme ex-
ample, but it is an example.
Thank goodness we did away with
that. I thank the Senate for passing
this. I thank the House for passing it.
I especially thank the President for
signing this into law.
Madam Speaker, this is a real prob-
lem.
I want to conclude by saying that
what we are trying to do here is to
bring about transparency. Just show us
what is happening. That is all we are
asking for.
I want to applaud the administra-
tion. I want to thank President Donald
J. Trump for bringing this issue to
light. This has been an issue that he
has worked on.
This is a nonpartisan issue. I never in
my years of practicing pharmacy asked
someone, Are you a Republican or a
Democrat? That doesn’t matter. This
impacts everyone.
I thank the President for his leader-
ship on this and I thank the adminis-
tration for these two proposed rules:
doing away with DIR fees, making the
rebates at the point of sale, so that
they will truly go to the patient.
These two rules that are being pro-
posed by CMS will help get us to a
point where we will have more trans-
parency. That is what we need.
Folks, this is a serious subject, a
very serious subject. I have witnessed
it firsthand, witnessed it in my prac-
tice of pharmacy for over 30 years. It is
horrible when you see someone suf-
fering who can’t afford a medication.
I call on the pharmaceutical manu-
facturers to do their part. They have
got to do a better job with their pric-
ing. They are not without responsi-
bility here, and I think they under-
stand that.
But, Madam Speaker, we have got to
have these two rule proposals passed,
and I encourage CMS to follow through
on this, do away with DIR fees, put the
rebates at the point of sale. This will
bring about transparency.
I thank the administration for their
support. I thank those who spoke here
tonight.
Madam Speaker, thank you for giv-
ing me this opportunity to bring to
light this extremely important subject.
Madam Speaker, I yield back.

system and directly attack American
democracy. It outlines alleged coordi-
nation between individuals associated
with one camp and Russia to influence
our election.
It also documents multiple instances
of potential obstruction of justice.
The report has been mischaracterized
and spun in inappropriate ways in the
Halls of Congress and within the
media.
In reality, the report documents
widespread activities undertaken by
many in positions of power that were
at best unethical and at worst illegal.
But you don’t have to take my word
for it. Instead, listen to the following
examples taken directly from the re-
port and judge for yourself.
I am going to begin with a quote
from the Mueller report and then in-
vite my colleagues to also simply read
from the document, which the Amer-
ican people should know can be
downloaded for free from the Depart-
ment of Justice website.
‘‘The evidence we obtained about the
President’s actions and intent present
difficult issues that would need to be
resolved if we were making a tradi-
tional prosecutorial judgment. At the
same time, if we had confidence after a
thorough investigation of the facts
that the President clearly did not com-
mit obstruction of justice, we would so
state. Based on the facts and the appli-
cable legal standards, we are unable to
reach that judgment. Accordingly,
while this report does not conclude
that the President committed a crime,
it also does not exonerate him.’’ Vol-
ume II, page 8.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. DAVIS) to quote from the
Mueller report.
Mrs. DAVIS of California. ‘‘On Satur-
day, June 17, 2017, the President called
McGahn and directed him to have the
special counsel removed . . . In inter-
views with the Special Counsel’s Office,
McGahn recalled that the President
called him at home twice and on both
occasions directed him to call Rosen-
stein and say that Mueller had con-
flicts that precluded him from serving
as special counsel. On the first call,
McGahn recalled that the President
said something like, ‘You gotta do this.
You gotta call Rod.’ ’’ Volume II, page
85.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. ‘‘Substantial
evidence indicates that the catalyst for
the President’s decision to fire Comey
was Comey’s unwillingness to publicly
state that the President was not per-
sonally under investigation, despite
the President’s repeated requests that
Comey make such an announcement.
Other evidence, however, indicates that
the President wanted to protect him-
self from an investigation into his
campaign.’’ Volume II, pages 75 and 76.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. CASTEN).
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, this is in response to the at-
torney general’s claim that the Presi-
dent has constitutional immunity from
prosecution. Mr. Mueller writes: ‘‘We
were not persuaded by the argument
that the President has blanket con-
stitutional immunity to engage in acts
that would corruptly obstruct justice
through the exercise of otherwise valid
Article II powers.’’
He goes on at some length to talk
about what that standard is, but I want
to read the footnote in that section.
‘‘A possible remedy through impeach-
ment for abuses of power would not
substitute for potential criminal liabil-
ity after a President leaves office. Im-
peachment would remove a President
from office, but would not address the
underlying culpability of the conduct
or serve the usual purposes of the
criminal law. . . .
‘‘Impeachment is also a drastic and
rarely invoked remedy, and Congress is
not restricted to relying only on im-
peachment, rather than making crimi-
nal law applicable to a former Presi-
dent . . . ’’
That is from Volume II, page 178.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan (Mrs. LAWRENCE).
Mrs. LAWRENCE. ‘‘On Saturday,
June 17, 2017, the President called
McGahn and directed him to have the
special counsel removed . . . In inter-
views with the special counsel’s office,
McGahn recalled that the President
called him at home twice and on both
occasions directed him to call Rosen-
stein and say that Mueller had con-
flicts that precluded him from serving
as special counsel. On the first call,
McGahn recalled that the President
said something like, ‘You gotta do this.
You gotta call Rod.’ ’’ This is from Vol-
ume II, page 85.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio
(Mrs. BEATTY).
Mrs. BEATTY. Reading from Volume
II, page 8: ‘‘Congress has authority to
prohibit a President’s corrupt use of
his authority in order to protect the
integrity of the administration of jus-
tice.’’
‘‘Article II of the Constitution does
not categorically and permanently im-
munize the President from potential li-
ability for the conduct that we inves-
tigated. Rather, our analysis led us to
conclude that the obstruction-of-jus-
tice statutes can validly prohibit a
President’s corrupt efforts to use his
official powers to curtail, end, or inter-
fere with an investigation.’’
‘‘The conclusion that Congress may
apply the obstruction laws to the
President’s corrupt exercise of the pow-
ers of office accords with our constitu-
tional system of checks and balances
and the principle that no person is
above the law.’’
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. OMAR).
Ms. OMAR. Reading from Volume II,
page 157: The ‘‘investigation found
multiple acts by the President that
were capable of exerting undue influ-
ence over law enforcement investiga-
tions, including the Russian-inter-
ference and obstruction investigations.
The incidents were often carried out
through one-on-one meetings in which
the President sought to use his official
power outside of usual channels. These
actions ranged from efforts to remove
the special counsel and to reverse the
effect of the attorney general’s recusal;
to the attempted use of official power
to limit the scope of the investigation;
to direct and indirect contacts with
witnesses with the potential to influ-
ence their testimony. Viewing the acts
collectively can help to illuminate
their significance.’’ Volume II, page
157.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. MORELLE).
Mr. MORELLE. ‘‘After it was re-
ported that Cohen intended to cooper-
ate with the government, however, the
President accused Cohen of ‘making up
stories in order to get himself out of an
unrelated jam (taxicabs maybe?),’
called Cohen a ‘rat,’ and on multiple
occasions publicly suggested that
Cohen’s family members had com-
mitted crimes. The evidence con-
cerning this sequence of events could
support an inference that the President
used inducements in the form of posi-
tive messages in an effort to get Cohen
not to cooperate, and then turned to
attacks and intimidation to deter the
provision of information or undermine
Cohen’s credibility once Cohen began
cooperating.’’ Volume II, page 154.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LOWENTHAL).
Mr. LOWENTHAL. ‘‘The President
launched public attacks on the inves-
tigation and individuals involved in it
who could possess evidence adverse to
the President, while in private, the
President engaged in a series of tar-
geted efforts to control the investiga-
tion. For instance, the President at-
tempted to remove the special counsel;
he sought to have Attorney General
Sessions unrecuse himself and limit
the investigation; he sought to prevent
public disclosure of information about
the June 9, 2016, meeting between Rus-
sians and campaign officials; and he
used public forums to attack potential
witnesses who might offer adverse in-
formation and to praise witnesses who
declined to cooperate with the govern-
ment.’’ Volume II, page 157.

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. ‘‘In early 2018,
the press reported that the President

cial counsel removed in June 2017 and

that McGahn had threatened to resign
rather than carry out the order. The
President reacted to the news stories
by directing White House officials to
tell McGahn to dispute the story and
create a record stating he had not been
ordered to have the special counsel re-
moved. McGahn told those officials
that the media reports were accurate
in stating that the President had di-
rected McGahn to have the special
counsel removed.’’
Volume II, pages 5 and 6.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. MORELLE).
Mr. MORELLE. ‘‘Congress can per-
missibly criminalize certain obstruc-
tive conduct by the President, such as
suborning perjury, intimidating wit-
nesses, or fabricating evidence, because
those prohibitions raise no separation
of powers questions. . . . The Constitu-
tion does not authorize the President
to engage in such conduct, and those
actions would transgress the Presi-
dent’s duty to ‘take care that the laws
be faithfully executed.’ ’’
Volume II, page 170.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio
(Mrs. BEATTY).
Mrs. BEATTY. ‘‘On October 7, 2016,
the media released video of candidate
Trump speaking in graphic terms
about women years earlier, which was
considered damaging to his candidacy.
Less than an hour later, WikiLeaks
made its second release: thousands of
John Podesta’s emails that had been
stolen by the GRU in late March 2016.
The FBI and other U.S. Government in-
stitutions were at the time continuing
their investigation of suspected Rus-
sian Government efforts to interfere in
the Presidential election.
‘‘That same day, October 7, the De-
partment of Homeland Security and
the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence issued a joint public state-
ment ‘that the Russian Government di-
rected the recent compromises of
emails from U.S. persons and institu-
tions, including from U.S. political or-
ganizations.’ Those ‘thefts’ and the
‘disclosures’ of the hacked materials
through online platforms such as
WikiLeaks, the statement continued,
‘are intended to interfere with the U.S.
election process.’ ’’
Volume I, page 7.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Mrs. HAYES).
Mrs. HAYES. ‘‘Further, the Office
learned that some of the individuals we
interviewed or whose conduct we inves-
tigated—including some associated
with the Trump campaign—deleted rel-
evant communications or commu-
nicated during the relevant period
using applications that feature
encryption or that do not provide for
long-term retention of data or commu-
nications records. In such cases, the Of-
fice was not able to corroborate wit-
ness statements through comparison to
contemporaneous communications or
fully question witnesses about state-
ments that appeared inconsistent with
other known facts.’’
Volume I, page 10.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan (Mrs. LAWRENCE).
Mrs. LAWRENCE. ‘‘Cohen also re-
called speaking with the President’s
personal counsel about pardons after
the searches of his home and office had
occurred, at a time when the media had
reported that pardon discussions were
occurring at the White House. . . .
Cohen understood, based on this con-
versation and previous conversations
about pardons with the President’s per-
sonal counsel, that as long as he stayed
on message, he would be taken care of
by the President, either through a par-
don or through the investigation being
shut down.’’
Volume II, page 147.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. ‘‘The inves-
tigation established that several indi-
viduals affiliated with the Trump cam-
paign lied to the Office, and to Con-
gress, about their interactions with
Russian-affiliated individuals and re-
lated matters. Those lies materially
impaired the investigation of Russian
election interference. The Office
charged some of those lies as violations
of the Federal false statements stat-
ute.’’
Volume I, page 9.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Mrs. HAYES).
Mrs. HAYES. ‘‘The President and his
personal counsel made repeated state-
ments suggesting that a pardon was a
possibility for Manafort, while also
making it clear that the President did
not want Manafort to ‘flip’ and cooper-
ate with the government.’’
Volume II, page 131.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio
(Mrs. BEATTY).
Mrs. BEATTY. ‘‘Immediately after
the November 8 election, Russian Gov-
ernment officials and prominent Rus-
sian businessmen began trying to make
inroads into the new administration.
The most senior levels of Russian Gov-
ernment encouraged these efforts. The
Russian Embassy made contact hours
after the election to congratulate the
President-elect and to arrange a call
with President Putin. Several Russian
businessmen picked up the effort from
there.’’
Volume I, page 7.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. ‘‘The President
engaged in a second phase of conduct,
involving public attacks of the inves-
tigation, nonpublic efforts to control
it, and efforts in both public and pri-
vate to encourage witnesses not to co-
operate with the investigation.’’
Volume II, page 7.
‘‘The President’s position as the head
of the executive branch provided him
with unique and powerful means of in-
fluencing official proceedings, subordi-
nate officers, and potential witnesses.’’
Volume II, page 7.
‘‘Substantial evidence indicates that
the President’s effort to have Sessions
limit the scope of the special counsel’s
investigation to future election inter-
ference was intended to prevent further
investigative scrutiny of the Presi-
dent’s and his campaign’s conduct.’’
Volume II, page 97.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. ‘‘Two days
after the President directed McGahn to
have the special counsel removed, the
President made another attempt to af-
fect the course of the Russia investiga-
tion. On June 19, 2017, the President
met one-on-one with Corey
Lewandowski in the Oval Office and
dictated a message to be delivered to
Attorney General Sessions that would
have had the effect of limiting the Rus-
sia investigation to future election in-
terference only.’’

I yield back the balance of my time.

MARKING THE ONE-YEAR ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE FAMILY SEPA-
RATION CRISIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from
Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL) is recog-
nized for the remainder of the hour as
the designee of the majority leader.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I
thank Representative SCHAKOWSKY for
her incredible leadership in the Con-
gressional Progressive Caucus on so
many issues, including bringing truth
to the Mueller investigation and mak-
ing sure people understand exactly
what is going on.
Madam Speaker, for the rest of the
Special Order hour, which is the Con-
gressional Progressive Caucus’ Special
Order hour that we do each week, we
are focusing on the 1-year anniversary
of the family separation crisis. Any of
our Members here who would like to
speak are welcome to do so.
Let me start by saying, 1 year ago, I
became the first Member of Congress to
go into a Federal prison where hun-
dreds of men and women, mothers and
fathers, had been separated from their
children and were being held in the
prison system, in the Federal prison
just south of my district.
I cannot, even today, 365 days later,
forget the stories that these mothers
and fathers told me. They told me
about how immigration agents said to
them, ‘‘Your families don’t exist any-
more,’’ and that they would never see
their children again.
At the time that I saw them, it was
already 3 to 4 weeks after they had
been separated, and the majority of
those parents had no idea where their
children were.
In fact, that morning, some of them
had been handed slips that supposedly

had the names of their children written
on those slips of paper. One woman
came over to me crying and she said:
These are not my children.
That slip that supposedly had the
names of her children did not match
her actual children.
Can you imagine? I just think, as a
mother, and for all the mothers and fa-
thers out there, as a parent, can you
imagine being separated from your
child, in some cases children as young
as 6 months, later we found out 3
months old, babies, who were torn off
the breasts of their mothers?
These moms described immigration
agents tearing them from their chil-
dren without the opportunity to say
good-bye. Some of them told me that
when they went to go to the bathroom,
they were told their children would
still be there. When they came back,
their children were gone. But they
could hear them in the very next room
crying for them, screaming for their
parents, and these mothers were not
able to go.
They told me how immigration
agents put them in line with their chil-
dren, and they would send the parents
in one direction and the children in an-
other direction.
One of the mothers told me how she
left Guatemala with her 8- and 12-year-
old children. Her husband is in prison.
He was put in prison for raping a young
child around the same age as her
daughter. He was just about to come
out of prison, and she was afraid that
he would come out of prison and then
go after their child, rape her daughter.
Another woman from El Salvador
told me how she got a protection order
against her ex-husband, who is a police
officer, but the protection order was
meaningless. He continued to antago-
nize her family, so she left.
Many of these mothers told me how
they had left one or two of their chil-
dren behind because they wanted to try
to save one. It was too difficult to
bring small children on the long jour-
ney that they were taking—the incred-
ible sacrifice as a parent of trying to
save one child.
One mother told me that she had
three children. The first was shot and
killed by gang members. The second
was shot and paralyzed by gang mem-
bers. She left the paralyzed child at
home because she knew that he would
not be able to make the journey. She
took the final child. She tried to bring
that child to safety.
b 2000
After everything these mothers expe-
rienced—the trauma in their home
countries, the cruel separation from
their children—the treatment that
they experienced in immigration cus-
tody was just outrageous.
Immigration agents told them that
they were ‘‘filthy.’’ They used that
word. Immigration agents laughed at
these mothers when they cried about
losing their children. And these moth-
ers told me how they were detained in
cells that were so cold that they called
them ‘‘the ice box’’ because it was so
cold.
Many of these mothers described
being put there after crossing the Rio
Grande River; and they were still wet,
and they were put into these freezer
boxes, these ice boxes, without blan-
kets, without sleeping mats. Some
mothers described how they went with-
out water for 5 days.
After public outcry and pressure
from elected officials, the government
set up a number for parents to call to
get information on their children, but
some of the parents that I spoke to in
Texas said that the number didn’t
work or that ICE wouldn’t allow them
to speak to their children.
One mother mentioned that she re-
peatedly tried to call her child to try
to locate her child, but the number
would not go through.
One mother told me that, when she
requested to talk to her child, the ICE
agents would get mad; and agents men-
tioned that, in some instances, families
would have to pay for these phone
calls.
And this isn’t just anecdotal. The
DHS inspector general’s September
2018 report found mixed results among
parents attempting to call their chil-
dren and that important information
about how to contact separated chil-
dren was not always available.
Just this week, 2 days ago, Members
of Congress had hoped to do the Special
Order hour on the day of the anniver-
sary. We had to do it today because
this is our scheduled time. But the
group Families Belong Together, a coa-
lition of groups working on this issue,
did an installation on our Capitol lawn
with the shoes of tiny children all
throughout and then an incredible 3–D
statue of a mother reaching out to her
child, and the child was in a cage.
I cannot imagine that this is the
country that we call the greatest coun-
try in the world. I cannot imagine that
my country that I am proud of, that I
serve here as a Member of Congress for
would do this to children.
And this administration has consist-
ently demonized and vilified immi-
grants, but this policy of cruel family
separation is hard to even describe,
hard to imagine that it is happening in
our borders.
I was privileged to co-chair, with
Congresswoman LUCILLE ROYBAL-
ALLARD, the Women’s Working Group
on Immigration Reform, and we led a
trip to the border. I see my good friend
Representative Jan Schakowsky, who
was on that trip, and I just want to ask
the gentlewoman, Representative
SCHAKOWSKY, who has been so eloquent
on this issue, I want to see if she wants
to say a few words.
And then I know my friend BARBARA
LEE is here, as well, about this crisis
and about our commitment, as Demo-
crats, to refuse to allow this to con-
tinue.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY).
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gen-
tlewoman for yielding.
We have talked about how shocking
it is for our country, the United States
of America, which is, despite any effort
to change, a country of immigrants. I
know the gentlewoman, herself, is an
immigrant to the United States of
America.
My parents, neither were born in the
United States of America. But this is a
place where my family was able to find
refuge from the pogroms in Eastern
Europe and make a good life here. And
yet, today, we are seeing such horror
that, if it were another country, I
think we would want sanctions. We
would go to the United Nations. How
could a country separate families?
And it is not just at the border, as
Members know. Inside our country, in
my city of Chicago, we are finding fam-
ilies that are scared all the time,
mixed families where the children
might be citizens and the parents un-
documented. The kids are afraid to go
to school, wondering if their parents
will be there when they get home.
But that trip to the border that the
Congresswoman helped organize is
something that I will never, ever for-
get. Seeing people in cages, seeing that
grandmother—remember?—who was in-
consolable because she came with her
7-year-old granddaughter who was
taken from her because our country did
not recognize a grandmother as family.
That child was redesignated as an un-
accompanied minor, and she thought
she may never see her granddaughter
again, and maybe that is true.
There are thousands, we think, of
children and families that are sepa-
rated. We don’t know. Nobody knows.
The Department of Homeland Security
doesn’t know how many children have
been separated from their parents.
We saw some moms who were being
reunited with their children, and one of
them was furious, and I was curious as
to why. This mother said her 8-year-old
daughter was told, ‘‘Your mother aban-
doned you.’’ Someone representing our
country said that to a child.
Who does that?
‘‘Your mother abandoned you, and
you will be in a shelter until you are 18
years old.’’ That reunion, mother and
daughter, did not go smoothly at first,
as you can imagine.
I mean, we saw a whole room full of
people pleading guilty to crossing the
border because it wasn’t at a des-
ignated border crossing. It was so pain-
ful to see that. And that was the begin-
ning of the zero-tolerance policy. And
we are still seeing families separated,
families suffering 1 year later.
And, Madam Speaker, I thank the
gentlewoman for calling attention to
this and for organizing that visit to the
border, which is forever in my mind.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I
thank Representative SCHAKOWSKY for
her comments.
My colleague, the gentlewoman from
California, BARBARA LEE, has been such
a champion for families, for children,

for people of color, for low-income fam-
ilies across this country and knows the
history of this country. This is not the
first time that we have separated chil-
dren from their parents.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) to
say a few words on this, as well.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, I thank Representative
JAYAPAL for yielding, and I thank her
for her tremendous leadership and for
staying steady and focused. And, also, I
just have to recognize her for the input
which she has provided to the con-
ference committee to keep the govern-
ment open, but, also, it was a con-
ference committee to fund Homeland
Security. Her input and what she gave
us really was extremely important to
get that done. We have a lot of work to
do. So I thank her very much for that,
also.
Yes, our Nation has yet to recover
from the Trump administration’s cruel
zero-tolerance, zero-humanity prosecu-
tion policy that tore and is tearing
thousands of children from their par-
ents and guardians, which was an-
nounced 1 year ago this week.
Since Donald Trump started his zero-
humanity policy—and that is exactly
what it is—we have learned more and
more disturbing evidence.
We know that the Trump administra-
tion piloted family separation on a
limited basis and planned to impose a
policy of mass separating of children
from their moms and dads—a policy.
We have seen the administration’s
memos contemplating how this could
be done and the resources needed to
separate and detain thousands of chil-
dren and parents.
The Government Accountability Of-
fice has investigated, finding that, de-
spite the administration’s contempla-
tion, this is a very serious, serious
problem, that they were unaware the
then-Attorney General, Jeff Sessions,
intended to launch this zero-humanity
policy. They didn’t even know this,
they said.
At least as of February this year, we
know that the Justice Department and
their attorneys are still not tracking
when they prosecute parents and legal
guardians separated from their chil-
dren.
And that brings me to what may be
the most disturbing part of it all: The
Department of Health and Human
Services’ inspector general found that
the total number of children separated
from a parent or guardian by immigra-
tion authorities is unknown and that
thousands of children may have been
separated.
So the bottom line is that Donald
Trump and his administration, showing
horrific cruelty and disregard for the
well-being of children, planned for
months—this was a plan—to tear chil-
dren from their parents’ arms.
Key officials were warned about the
potentially lifelong harm to children,
and Donald Trump and his administra-
tion still did absolutely nothing to en-
sure children could be reunited with
their parents.
Yes, Congresswoman JAYAPAL, this is
not a stain, but this is yet another
stain on the United States.
I am reminded that 400 years ago,
when the first Africans were brought to
this country to begin the horrific, in-
humane institution and government-
sanctioned slavery, children were sepa-
rated from their parents. And that was
a plan, just as it is a plan now. African
families were split and destroyed.
We still experience, in the Black
community, generational trauma from
these crimes against humanity. I
couldn’t help but be reminded of what
my ancestors experienced as I visited
McAllen, Texas, and Brownsville,
Texas, last year.
I saw children sleeping on concrete
floors, behind barbed wire, crying for
their parents. I spoke with mothers
and fathers who did not know where
their children were after several
months. And we were told that they
could make these phone calls, but also
that these calls cost money.
Where do they have money? How
could they get any money?
These children and their parents had
no access to mental health profes-
sionals.
Now, my background is psychiatric
social work, and I know the trauma of
separation of children from their par-
ents, just within 24 hours that trauma
settles in.
They had no access to legal services.
And, yes, I couldn’t believe it when I
saw that these detention centers were
prisons. They reminded me of San
Quentin.
I saw mothers in prison uniforms.
These were asylum seekers. They were
put behind barbed wire in prison uni-
forms. This was like something I had
never seen in my life.
And yet it took me back to what our
government sanctioned and promoted
and had as its policy 400 years ago.
Yes, I was born in a border city, El
Paso, Texas. I was just there with Con-
gresswoman ESCOBAR on Monday. And
El Paso, the people of El Paso are
doing everything they can to help with
the children and with the families that
are being so ruthlessly treated by our
immigration officials.
Now, I just have to tell you, these
children will grow up with a disdain for
America; okay? Their trauma will turn
into anger. And I know that, profes-
sionally. I know what is going to hap-
pen to these kids.
The long-term impact will not be
good for our country, so this adminis-
tration better figure this out pretty
quickly. There are so many dimensions
to what they are doing. I don’t think
they even get it.
The humane and the humanitarian
crisis that we are experiencing is first
and foremost, but we also have to re-
mind the Trump administration they
are creating children now who will be
adults soon, and this trauma is going
to stay with them all of their lives. So
we better get it right, and get it right
quickly.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Washington (Ms.
JAYAPAL) for her leadership. We have
done much work in the Appropriations
Committee.
Thank God we were able to pass some
of the amendments last year that
would not allow the immigration offi-
cials to chain pregnant women—get
it?—chain pregnant women. We got rid
of that. Hopefully, they are imple-
menting that properly.
So there is a lot to do, but this is
something that cannot last. This is
America, and we should not—the world
should not see us leading an immigra-
tion policy or promoting an immigra-
tion policy that, central to it, destroys
families and children and lives.
These are human beings. They don’t
deserve this, and we have to do more to
stop it.
Madam Speaker, I again thank the
gentlewoman for yielding.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congresswoman LEE for her
work, for her leadership. I was think-
ing about what she said about children
and the impact on them, even within 24
hours.
We had the then-Director of the Of-
fice of Refugee Resettlement, Scott
Lloyd, who was in to testify before us
in the Judiciary Committee.
b 2015
We also had other career child wel-
fare experts that were there on the
panel, including one who testified to us
on the committee that he warned the
director and those above him about the
increasing family separations and the
incredibly significant, and potentially
lifelong risks to those children; not
only the ones that weren’t reunited—
because at that point there was still, as
there are today, over 300 families today
that still aren’t reunited—but not only
to the ones that weren’t reunited, but
he said even the ones who were re-
united with their families, but they
spent 3 months or even a week, or even
3 weeks—most of them spent months
separated from their parents—that life-
long—and he used that—lifelong dam-
age to those children would be intense.
I asked Scott Lloyd as the then-di-
rector of the Refugee Resettlement
Program: Did you do anything? Did
you take that information that you
got, that this was going to be lifelong,
irreversible—he used the word irrevers-
ible, the witness who testified about
the damage to children—did you do
anything with that information about
the lifelong, irreversible damage to
thousands of children that you, this ad-
ministration, has caused?
And he said: No, didn’t share it with
anybody. Didn’t do anything about it.
On the same day that the Trump ad-
ministration said that it would reunite
thousands of children—because this is
not a Democrat or a Republican issue—
people across this country were out-
raged by what they saw.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3666 May 9, 2019
I remember First Lady Laura Bush
wrote an amazing op-ed talking about
this is not us, this is not America.
Independents, Republicans, and Demo-
crats knew that the Trump zero-hu-
manity policy was wrong, it was cruel,
and it was un-American.
The same day that the Trump admin-
istration said: Okay, we hear the out-
rage. We will reunite thousands of chil-
dren that it had separated through a
central database, a government official
admitted in an email that the Trump
administration only had enough infor-
mation at that point to reconnect 60
parents with their kids; 60 parents out
of nearly 3,000 children that we know
of.
Because later, we also found out that
there were more children that we
didn’t know about in a ‘‘pilot project’’
that was even before the scrutiny
came.
Let me remind people that at the
time that this was happening, DHS
Secretary, then-DHS Secretary
Kirstjen Nielsen and other Trump offi-
cials claimed repeatedly—not just
once, not just twice—but repeatedly in
testimony, in hearings, that they were
keeping track of separations, and that
claim had simply no basis in reality.
The truth is that DHS has better sys-
tems in place to track the property
that people who were in custody left,
but not the children. Trump’s Depart-
ment of Homeland Security did not see
fit to track children, including infants
and toddlers.
A Federal judge recently ordered the
Trump administration to locate the
children that were still remaining, po-
tentially numbering in the thousands,
over the next 6 months as opposed to
the 2 years that the Trump administra-
tion requested. Just imagine, the
Trump administration said give us 2
years to try to reunite these kids with
their parents.
But the truth is, Congresswoman LEE
and everybody that is watching, we
may never know the number of chil-
dren who were separated by the Trump
administration. There are children who
may never ever be reunited with their
parents.
We are, of course, trying to get to the
bottom of this. We are trying to get ac-
countability on this, but we know that
DHS is still separating families. We see
the relentless efforts of this adminis-
tration to cut people off from seeking
asylum, which is, by the way, a lawful
act, not only by our own domestic
laws. We are signatory to human rights
treaties, international treaties, which
require us to allow people to seek asy-
lum.
Last week I reintroduced my Dignity
for Detained Immigrants Act with my
colleagues, Congressman ADAM SMITH,
and Senator BOOKER introduced it in
the Senate. Last cycle, this bill had
over half of the Democratic Caucus. I
think it was like 167 cosponsors. We in-
tend to get more of our Democratic
Caucus. My office spent 8 months
working on this bill in the last Con-
gress with stakeholders from across
the country.
I am proud to say that as we reintro-
duce it, we have also made sure—and,
frankly, it would have addressed the
humanitarian crisis that we saw
through family separation. Last year
already made it extremely difficult to
detain children and families. This year,
what we did is, we added explicit lan-
guage that bars Immigration and Cus-
toms Enforcement officials from de-
taining children under 18 years.
We actually had the provision of not
allowing for pregnant women to be
shackled. Why do we need provisions
saying pregnant women can’t be shack-
led?
What this bill is about is denying
this administration and any adminis-
tration in the future—Democratic or
Republican—from using detention to
facilitate the cruel separation of fami-
lies.
I am hoping—I know the gentle-
woman is either on the bill or is going
to be on the bill—but I am hoping that
every single one of my colleagues joins
me in transforming a cruel, abusive
system; a detention system that takes
these children and puts them—we
should call them jails because that is
what they are. They are not detention
facilities. Most of the actual facilities,
as the gentlewoman saw, are just like
jails.
And, in fact, they are using more and
more jails. But that system is now de-
taining 52,000 people a day, which is
why we need to make sure that we ad-
dress this in appropriations. We need to
make sure that we address this through
legislation.
So I am still astounded by the pro-
found cruelty of this administration
and this policy of family separation, of
zero humanity that was imposed on
children and families seeking asylum.
Ms. LEE of California. Will the gen-
tlewoman yield?
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, Congresswoman JAYAPAL’s
bill is extremely important, and I hope
that Republicans also join us in this ef-
fort because this is a concern that
should be bipartisan or nonpartisan.
But let me just mention a couple of
things. Everyone who is a parent, a
grandparent, or has ever babysat chil-
dren, or who has been around children,
if a child walks off, or you can’t locate
the child that you are caring for, I
know you have felt the panic. I know
when my children were small, and I
would turn around and they were gone
it was like: Oh, my God, what has hap-
pened? And the anxiety and the fear,
and just getting very emotionally dis-
traught behind not knowing where my
children were, will always be with me.
So I think everyone in our country
should understand what these parents
are going through and what a lost child
is feeling if they have had that experi-
ence before.
We had a hearing on this family sepa-
ration policy in the Appropriations
Committee, the Labor, Health and
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Services Subcommittee, and we
had a panel of individuals. Some were
mental health professionals. And we
were told in no uncertain terms that a
day or two of counseling is not going to
get it. These parents and these children
need a specific form of psychotherapy,
and it has got to be sustained. It has
got to be professional, and it has got to
be the type of therapy that addresses
specifically trauma.
So I am not sure that DHS even un-
derstands this. So it is on the record,
and we have been trying now to make
sure that we can provide the funding
for the proper type of mental health
services so that we can begin to deal
with this trauma that has to be ad-
dressed early on. Because otherwise,
this, again, is not going to be only
these kids. This will be generational
because there are DNA changes
through the generations as a result of
family separation and children being
separated from their parents at an
early age.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for pointing
that out. The head of the American
Academy of Pediatrics has come. We
have had a number of forums where
people have been able to ask questions.
Our Members have been able to ask
questions, and I am very grateful to
many of the Members who have taken
it upon themselves to go and visit
these detention facilities, go to the
border with us and on other trips as
well, and see exactly what is hap-
pening. Because I don’t think you can
really imagine it unless you see it.
I don’t think you can imagine what
it is like to go into a giant facility
where children are being held, 6, 7, 8
years old, being held in cages with no
place to sleep.
Ms. LEE of California. Peeping out at
you, begging for help.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Yes, begging for help.
And I think about the children, the
parents that I talked to, and some of
the reunifications that we saw when I
led that trip to the border and thinking
about these parents who had to experi-
ence their children not wanting to
come to them.
Representative SCHAKOWSKY talked
about one mom that we met who was
reunited with her 8-year-old daughter.
The daughter had been told that the
mother had abandoned her, and for
months, she thought the mother had
abandoned her and that she was going
to go into a shelter, or a foster home
because her mother had abandoned her.
So you can imagine when the mother
came to be reunited with the child, the
mother was so happy that she finally
was getting to see her child, and the
child did not want to go to her mother.
She didn’t want to go to her mother. It
took some time for them to actually be
reunited and for the mother to say: No,
I did not abandon you. But if you are

an 8-year-old child, how do you under-
stand that?
Ms. LEE of California. It is hard to
process that.
Ms. JAYAPAL. How do you process
it? And I think that in the end, I con-
tinue to think about the ways in which
we are criminalizing migrants, crim-
inalizing people who are fleeing vio-
lence, tremendous violence in their
countries.
Just the other day there was an arti-
cle in The New York Times, I think,
that talked about in Honduras, which
is where many of the parents that I
met with that were in that Federal
prison separated from their children,
many of them were from Honduras.
This article described how you have
two choices: You either get killed by
the gangs or you leave. That is the
only choice you have.
I also went to Tijuana. I think I was
the first Member to go to Tijuana, and
I met with a 15-year-old boy who had
been shot in both knees. And he had a
phone message on his cell phone from
his mother who said: Please do not
come back here. Just go. Just go. Get
to the United States. Get to a place of
safety. Seek asylum. I will be dev-
astated to have you leave me, but I
just want you to stay alive.
What parent doesn’t want their child
to stay alive? And this young man who
talked to me was a strong young man,
but he started weeping, talking about
how he had to leave his mother and
come to the United States as an unac-
companied child. It was devastating to
hear, absolutely devastating to hear.
As we celebrate this 1-year anniver-
sary—not celebrate, memorialize, I
should say—this 1-year anniversary of
this cruel, zero-humanity policy of
family separation, I urge all of my col-
leagues to sign on to my Dignity for
Detained Immigrants bill, to work in
appropriations in every committee
that we have, to remember that we
still have children who are separated
from their parents, still to this day.
We still have families that are being
separated from their parents as we
speak. We still do not know how many
thousands more children were sepa-
rated from their parents as a result of
this administration’s cruel policies
that undermine who we are.
I see I have been joined by an incred-
ible colleague, a leader on the Judici-
ary Committee, a leader in the Pro-
gressive Caucus, and also somebody
who was on our trip to Texas, to the
border, but also is from Texas.
I yield to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), my col-
league, for her comments on this.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
I want to join both Congresswoman
JAYAPAL and Congresswoman LEE on
just reinforcing the devastation and
the dastardliness of child separation
from their parents. I would just like to
very briefly say that this sad com-
memoration should equate to a com-
mitment of zero tolerance for sepa-
rating children from their families.
We should end the migrant policy
that includes child separation, the po-
sition of remaining in Mexico as you
seek asylum, the losing of your space,
or your bed, if you are in a shelter and
have to be sent back to Mexico when
you actually apply for asylum. All of
these migrant policies, which included
child separation, clearly can devastate
the families.
So I want to emphasize just one point
that included my many trips to the
border, including the time we had the
opportunity to travel together, and I
want to focus on the psychological and
maybe irreparable damage that is
being done particularly to children in
the understandable period. That is not
a technical term. I am not a sociologist
or a psychologist, but in that period
where the child may be somewhere be-
tween 4 and 15, or 4 and 12. Those are
really years when, whether it is a boy
or girl, they are bonding with mom.
People must realize that those children
traveled thousands of miles or 1,000-
plus miles with that parent and mostly
that mother, and it has been a dad.
b 2030
So that mother made a sacrifice, ei-
ther out of lack of understanding of the
language or signing a paper that she
did not understand or thinking that
she needed to separate because of the
housing situation, and many of us saw
the housing situation and the metallic
blankets and the lack of space.
Let me just say this for the personnel
on the border. We found some very em-
pathetic personnel on the border, men
and women who do their job. But the
resources of the facilities are abso-
lutely inadequate and disgraceful, and
they have been like that on the border
of Texas for a very long time.
So I am grateful for Congresswoman
LEE and Congresswoman LUCILLE ROY-
BAL-ALLARD, those who realize we have
to really overhaul those facilities, that
will include healthcare facilities and
otherwise.
But in that reunion, you might say—
and there were good staff people who
thought they were doing the right
thing, and they were excited with the
expectation. They had brought the
children.
I remember two little boys. First of
all, there wasn’t a dry eye in the room
of those of us who had come. It was
just unspeakable. It was overwhelming.
It brought back memories. You
thought about your children or your
extended family members.
So two little boys, crisp little white
shirts on over at a table playing with
the best red fire truck and truck that
they could find. In walk mothers who
went to different corners. But in walks
this mother with her belongings, as I
recollect, like in a pillowcase, not even
a suitcase. Obviously, you have trav-
eled 1,000 miles plus, and then you have
been detained somewhere and your
child went off some other place.
She comes with those welled-up eyes
of expectation. She stood by that table
for the longest period of time.
We all know there is no way you
don’t know someone is standing behind
you or there is no way you don’t recog-
nize your mom even in the sight of
your eye who was walking in. We know
how mom and children are, mom and
dad. They break that big grin, and they
run like they have never run before to
get into the arms of that mom and dad.
This mom stood there with her pil-
lowcase belongings for the longest pe-
riod of time, and those little boys con-
tinued to play and ignore and play and
ignore and play and ignore. I almost
wanted to reach out and turn that lit-
tle face back here.
There was no way they did not know
mom was standing there, but the de-
tachment was so devastating. When
that mom put her arms around pre-
cious little boy, he was so stiff that I
knew this was going to take a very
long time.
What I was fearful of was, where they
would be destined, there would be no
resources for his treatment, for his
ability to understand what happened.
How callous this policy is, to date,
that there are still some separated
children; and with the leadership we
have now, we don’t know whether they
will do it again.
So I thank the gentlewoman for
doing this because, even now, my eyes
well up because children are children,
and we will never repair the damage,
but we must stop this policy. It must
be zero tolerance. We must not have
this policy ever again. It is truly inhu-
mane, and it is not representative of
the values of this Nation, in spite of
some of the history we have had as a
country.
This is a nation where people believe
in that sense of dignity and equality.
Our values say that. We need to act on
that and, certainly, humanity, which is
so very important.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from Texas for
her leadership, for her words, and for
her work on this issue.
I would just say that, as we get ready
to close, here, this Special Order hour,
we are thinking, keeping in our minds
and in our hearts the thousands of fam-
ilies across this country and across the
world that have been separated from
their children, and we will do every-
thing we can to continue to fight for
justice.

ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3668 May 9, 2019
Obviously, we have a big problem on
the southern border. If you have been
paying attention to what is on TV, at
the beginning of the year, about 50,000
people were arriving here every month.
We are now, we believe, at 100,000 peo-
ple illegally entering this country.
One of the reasons this is happening,
it is not surprising that people from
other countries think the United
States does not enforce their immigra-
tion laws. Many local governments are
sanctuary cities, sanctuary counties,
or even sanctuary States, sending the
clear message to people in other parts
of the world: the United States does
not enforce their immigration laws.
Sadly, even in my home State of Wis-
consin, the Governor of Wisconsin
pulled the Wisconsin Air National
Guard off the border, sending the mes-
sage that a Governor of a State does
not apparently believe we should be
spending money enforcing our immi-
gration laws.
The chief executives of the biggest
city in the country and the biggest
State in the country have both made it
clear that they will provide, or want to
provide, free medical care to people
who come here.
By the way, I should point out that,
right now, at a time when so many
Americans have huge deductibles, they
are almost better off being here ille-
gally and getting the free medical care
than our citizens are.
In any event, it is not surprising that
we are flooded with people who want to
come here.
Another evidence of that is this
body’s refusal to appropriate enough
money to build the wall. Now, in the
last week—at least, it has been put out
there—we have the majority party’s
suggestion or guidance for where we
are going to spend money in the next
budget.
Now, Madam Speaker, given the cri-
sis at the border, you would think the
biggest increase in the next budget
compared to the 2020 budget would be
at Homeland Security—but, no.
So the people back home understand,
when we pass our annual appropria-
tions, when we fund the budget, we
break it into 12 different subcommit-
tees, subcommittees like Agriculture,
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies;
subcommittees like State, Foreign Op-
erations, and Related Programs; sub-
committees like Defense and the sub-
committee in charge of protecting our
southern border, Homeland Security.
Of the 12 groups that this body is
going to vote on, which classification
is getting the smallest increase in this
budget? Homeland Security. One more
time, the Congress itself is sending the
message that we do not take our immi-
gration laws seriously.
It is time for us to send the message
to people abroad that they should be
taking our immigration laws seriously.
After all, given the complete irrespon-
sibility from so many politicians up
here, it doesn’t surprise me people
think we don’t take our immigration
laws seriously.
What can we do?
Well, recently FAIR came out with a
report in which they guessed that
maybe over half the people who are in
this country illegally are getting some
sort of public benefit. When I went
down to the border in Arizona awhile
back and talked to Customs people who
went through people’s wallets and peo-
ple’s purses, they found evidence of
people receiving public benefits who
were not citizens here.
I am glad our HUD Secretary is be-
ginning to look into the, I believe,
large number of people here illegally
taking advantage of low-income hous-
ing.
I want to point out, there is nothing
wrong with legal immigrants coming
here. Neither myself nor Donald
Trump, who ran on this issue, want to
decrease the 700,000 people who are
sworn in every year as legal immi-
grants, and we do not want to decrease
the 4 million people who are here on
legal work visas. As a matter of fact,
we said, if need be, we would even in-
crease that.
But to have so many people come
here illegally is, no question, a huge
problem. I would suggest to President
Trump, because you can’t wait for Con-
gress to do anything around here, that
he send a message that, when Sec-
retary Carson finds people in low-in-
come housing who are here illegally,
they should be deported.
I certainly have anecdotal evidence
from back home that people who are
here illegally are benefiting from
SNAP benefits; and people who are,
again, here illegally taking—not de-
porting everybody, but if they are tak-
ing advantage of our public benefits,
again, they should return home and try
to make a living in their home country
or get benefits available in their home
country.
The next thing I would like to see
happen, I know it is something Presi-
dent Trump ran on—I think it is time
he rings the bell—is ending birthright
citizenship. Birthright citizenship is
something that can cause somebody to
become legal here whose parents are il-
legal.
We should not reward illegal behav-
ior by having people come here ille-
gally and have a child in the country;
not to mention, it is not right to en-
courage pregnant people to just fly
here and have a baby in this country
and wind up having their family stay
here legally by that way as well.
One thing that intrigues me is that
apparently Canada is looking to get rid
of their birthright citizenship law, one
of the few other Western countries that
has it. It would be very embarrassing if
Justin Trudeau’s Canada gets rid of the
antiquated birthright citizenship law
ahead of Donald Trump’s United
States.
In any event, I strongly encourage
President Trump to counteract the
message being sent by so many other
elected officials and make it clear that
our immigration laws are to be taken
seriously.
Please, Mr. Trump, send the message.
Congress is paralyzed. Stand up not
only to the people overtly discouraging
and ignoring our immigration laws, but
stand up to the Chamber of Commerce
lobby and say that, in the future, we
want our immigrants to be picked,
merit-based immigrants, not whoever
decides to break the law.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

today as the founder and co-chair of
the Black Maternal Health Caucus. I
want to take this time to briefly speak
about the importance of Black mater-
nal health.
Our country is in the midst of a na-
tional public crisis. Black mothers are
dying.
Across the country, Black women
from all walks of life are dying from
preventable pregnancy-related com-
plications at three to four times the
rate of non-Hispanic White women.
Sixty percent of maternal deaths are
preventable. Their infants are twice as
likely to die by their first birthday as
infants born to White mothers.
Black women are 50 percent more
likely than non-Hispanic White women
to give birth preterm, accounting for
more than half of the disparity in in-
fant mortality rates among Black and
non-Hispanic White women.
Reducing this gap through interven-
tions like better medical care and in-
creased social support can improve ma-
ternal outcomes for African American
women, while also reducing racial dis-
parities in infant mortality.
Research suggests that the cumu-
lative stress of racism and sexism un-
dermines Black women’s health, mak-
ing them more vulnerable to complica-
tions that endanger their lives and the
lives of their infants. Unfortunately,
current healthcare practices are inad-
equate in addressing the health con-
sequences of living with the stress.
As a Black mother and as a grand-
mother, this issue is very personal to
me. That is why Representative
LAUREN UNDERWOOD and I founded the
Black Maternal Health Caucus, with

the goal of closing the racial dispari-
ties gap.
The caucus aims to raise awareness
about this crisis, to educate Members
of Congress, and to find meaningful
legislative solutions to improve mater-
nal health outcomes. We intend to am-
plify the voices and needs of mothers
and families all across this Nation.
I have been working closely with
healthcare providers and with stake-
holders and policymakers to begin
identifying a comprehensive path for-
ward for eliminating these disparities.
On average, African American women
receive lower quality healthcare than
their non-Hispanic White peers. This
disparity in care quality starts as early
as birth, with African American in-
fants in neonatal intensive care units
receiving lower quality care than non-
Hispanic White infants.
b 2045
This continues throughout adulthood
with three out of four Black women
giving birth at low-quality hospitals
where their risk of poor maternal
health outcomes is the highest.
More than a third of Black women
undergo cesarean sections, C-sections,
even for low-risk pregnancies. This is 4
percent higher than the U.S. average,
higher than any other racial or ethnic
group.
Although a C-section can save lives
when a pregnancy is high risk, it is,
nevertheless, a major surgical proce-
dure accompanied by risks, including
surgical injury to either the mother or
infant, infection, and heavy bleeding.
Here we have a few areas that we
need to focus on. We must improve ac-
cess to critical services. We must im-
prove the quality of care provided to
pregnant women. And we must address
maternal and infant mental health.
May is Mental Health Month. Too
often, however, maternal and infant
mental health problems go unrecog-
nized or unaddressed, particularly for
women and infants of color, with dev-
astating consequences.
We should also enhance supportive
services for families before and after
birth. All families need support to
thrive, but not all have the support
that they need.
Adjusting to parenthood can be espe-
cially difficult for families experi-
encing economic insecurity. As a con-
sequence of structural racism, many
families experiencing this insecurity
are in lower-income communities of
color.
Programs that help families meet
their basic needs—including nutrition
assistance, housing assistance, and
other social supports—are underfunded,
and the application and enrollment
process can be difficult and time-con-
suming.
We must also improve data collection
and oversight. Collecting and sharing
reliable, consistent data on maternal
and infant mortality is essential to de-
veloping solutions.
Although some progress has been
made, such as H.R. 1318, which helped
to provide States with resources for
maternal mortality review commit-
tees, there is still more work we need
to do.
To address these problems, Federal
policymakers should help States stand-
ardize and improve the quality of the
data being collected and ensure diver-
sity among stakeholders who serve on
mortality review committees.
There is no easy fix for this issue. It
is going to require many steps to begin
closing the gaps.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues to begin implementing some
of these important strategies to save
our mothers.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAW-
RENCE), my good friend who is co-chair
of the Democratic Women’s Caucus.
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I
am proud to be here today, and I thank
my colleagues, Representative ADAMS
and Representative UNDERWOOD, for es-
tablishing the Black Maternal Health
Caucus, of which I am a proud member.
I also want to recognize my colleague
ROBIN KELLY for her continuous leader-
ship in healthcare when it comes to
maternal health.
I am also here to let the public know
that this issue of maternal health is a
priority for the Women’s Caucus here
in Congress. As my colleague ALMA
ADAMS has said, we in America have a
crisis. Maternal mortality is not only a
public health crisis, but it is also an
American crisis.
It is an American crisis because we
are the highest for any developed coun-
try in the world when it comes to
deaths from maternal mortality. The
CDC reported this week that most of
the maternal mortality deaths in our
country are preventable.
It saddens me that the maternal mor-
tality rate in the United States, again,
is the highest among developed coun-
tries in the world. We have women,
mostly Black women and women of
color, dying for no reason. It is unac-
ceptable. It is heartbreaking.
In my home State of Michigan, 80 to
90 maternal deaths occur every year.
These are women who are losing their
lives to give birth.
We must do all that we can to end
this crisis. As a leader on this issue,
joining my other colleagues in their
leadership, I look forward to working
on both sides of the aisle to address
this issue.
Madam Speaker, when we elected a
record number of women to Congress
this Congress, this issue, which has
been escalating year after year, has fi-
nally been brought to the forefront. I
am proud to say, when a woman sits at
the table, the conversation changes,
and we will fight for the lives of women
giving birth.
To every woman who has given birth,
who has been a parent, I want to say
happy Mother’s Day. We are fighting to
make sure that every woman coming
forth to be a mother can live.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the congresswoman from Michi-
gan, not only for her work with the
Women’s Caucus but all of her work in
this area.
Of course, when we can improve the
quality of health for women, we are
going to make our families much more
sustainable.
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to
welcome someone who has been a lead-
er on the issue of health, who chairs
the CBC Health Braintrust, and who
has continued to lift her voice in the
area of health.
She is a member, as well, of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. She is
also the founder of the Black Women
and Girls Caucus.
I am pleased to have my colleague
from the State of Illinois, ROBIN
KELLY, join us this evening to speak on
this issue.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY).
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I thank my colleague from
the great State of North Carolina and
my colleague from the great State of
Michigan.
I rise today because American moms
are tragically dying. The majority of
these deaths are entirely preventable,
as we have heard.
This weekend is Mother’s Day, the
day when we celebrate our mothers,
grandmothers, aunts, stepmothers, and
all the women who love and nurture us.
There will be brunches and mimosas,
cards and flowers, backyard barbecues
and fancy dinners. Or it might just be
a quick call saying: Hey, Mom, I love
you.
But each year, more than 700 Amer-
ican kids begin their lives without
moms. Nearly 100 of these deaths are in
my State of Illinois. These kids will
never know their moms or celebrate a
Mother’s Day with her because of
America’s embarrassing maternal mor-
tality crisis.
Perhaps most shocking of all, a re-
cent CDC report shows that 60 percent
of these deaths are entirely prevent-
able.
While hundreds die, thousands suffer
severe health complications that can
endanger their lives and limit the abil-
ity of mothers to care for their fami-
lies.
Recently, Serena Williams and
Beyonce have boldly spoken out about
their personal experiences with these
terrifying complications.
As the mother and stepmother of
adult daughters, it worries me that it
will be more dangerous for them to
have a baby today than it was for me
to have them 20 years ago.
On nearly every health issue, death
rates have declined, except for preg-
nancy and birth-related deaths. In fact,
America is the only developed Nation
where the number of women dying con-
tinues to grow.
We can and must do better because
all mommas deserve the chance to be
mommas.
What can be done? Last year, Con-
gress came together in a moment of bi-
partisanship to pass the Preventing

Maternal Deaths Act thanks to the
leadership of Congresswoman HERRERA
BEUTLER and Senator Heitkamp. This
law will standardize data and reporting
so we have a clearer picture of this cri-
sis.
Building on this bipartisan progress,
I have proposed a comprehensive,
multipronged approach called the
Mothers and Offspring Mortality and
Morbidity Awareness Act, or, simply,
the MOMMA’s Act.
It starts by expanding what is work-
ing. It builds on last year’s work to fur-
ther standardize data and reporting. It
also takes the highly successful Alli-
ance for Innovation on Maternal
Health program, called the AIM pro-
gram, developed by our Nation’s obste-
tricians and gynecologists and grows
it.
AIM’s emergency protocols and best
shared practices are already saving
lives in hundreds of U.S. hospitals. The
MOMMA’s Act would leverage Federal
resources and publications to grow this
proven program.
It also uses another proven strategy
to prevent future deaths: mortality re-
view committees. These committees
examine every tragic death in great de-
tail to prevent further ones.
When the city of Philadelphia estab-
lished one, it cut the number of deaths
by 75 percent in just 1 year. Imagine
what we could do with a nationwide
committee.
The MOMMA’s Act also addresses a
bizarre gap in current law that pre-
vents many mothers from seeing their
doctor. We know that one-third of
deaths occur after giving birth. Right
now, moms on Medicaid lose their cov-
erage just 60 days after giving birth,
but it takes a woman’s body a full year
to recover.
More than 70 percent of moms will
have some complications within a year
of giving birth. These mothers should
be able to see their doctors and get the
care they need.
While we are seeing approximately
the same rate of maternal deaths re-
gardless of a woman’s income, edu-
cation level, or other demographics,
the recent CDC report shows that
Black, American Indian, and Native
Alaskan mothers are dying at more
than three times the rate of White
mothers. In my home State of Illinois,
that disparity climbs to six times more
likely to die for Black moms.
My bill directly addresses this dis-
parity by pushing for culturally com-
petent care throughout the care con-
tinuum.
As we celebrate Mother’s Day, I hope
my colleagues will join me in working
to ensure that everyone gets a chance
to know a mother’s warm love and af-
fection.
We can prevent mothers from dying.
We know how. The question is, do we
have the will?
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I
thank my colleague from Illinois, not
only for her comments tonight but for
all the work that she has done in this
area.
It is a preventable issue and some-
thing that we can do something about.
That is why we are here tonight to
shed some more light on this, Madam
Speaker, and to try to make sure that
we are all educated so that we will
know.
This comes right on the heels of
Mother’s Day. As we think about our
mothers, our grandmothers, and all of
those who have been mentors to us,
this is an issue that we want to try to
make right.
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to wel-
come the congresswoman from Cali-
fornia, who is a senior member on the
Appropriations Committee, has been a
champion of reproductive rights, and
sits on the Budget Committee.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE),
my colleague.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, I thank Representative
ADAMS.
First, I have to thank the gentle-
woman for her tremendous leadership
on so many issues. Our young people at
our Historically Black Colleges and
Universities really owe her a debt of
gratitude.
I thank her and Congresswoman
UNDERWOOD for forming the Black Ma-
ternal Health Caucus, and also Con-
gresswoman ROBIN KELLY, who has
been such a tremendous leader in
healthcare. Her MOMMA’s Act, which I
am proud to cosponsor, is really, truly,
making a huge difference already.
The horror of health disparities for
African American women in many
ways is very personal to me. Let me
just share a quick story about my
birth.
When my mother, Congresswoman
ADAMS, went into labor—this was in El
Paso, Texas—she went to the hospital,
and she needed a cesarean section.
They refused her admission, and she
nearly died as a result.
By the time the very racist—it was a
hospital that did not allow African
Americans into the hospital. By the
time they allowed her in, though, after
my grandmother had to fight to get her
in—as she told me the story over and
over again as a child—they put her on
a gurney in the hall. They just left her
there. Again, she needed a C-section.
She became delirious, became uncon-
scious. Somebody finally saw her. By
then, it was too late to do a C-section.
They pulled her in, and the doctors
really didn’t know quite what to do.
They finally decided to deliver me
using forceps.
My mother almost died. I almost
didn’t get here. And I bore those scars
on my eye, the forceps scars, for many
years. They went away just a few years
ago, actually.
b 2100
I share that story because here we
are now, in 2019, and we are talking
about many of the same issues that my
mother had to face, maternal death, in-
fant mortality with African American
women now here in this country.
We have gone backwards. The United
Nations did a report indicating that we
have gone back 25 years in this coun-
try. This is unacceptable. It is totally
unacceptable.
As a member of the Labor, Health
and Human Services, Education, and
Related Agencies Appropriations Sub-
committee, though, we are working
every day to address the crisis swiftly
and with a firm resolve to turn the tide
on these unacceptable disparities in
health plaguing the African American
community and African American
women.
It is utterly unacceptable that Black
women are four times more likely to
die—again, I have to think about my
mother tonight—four times more like-
ly to die from preventable pregnancy
complications than White women. We
do have a Black maternal health crisis
in America.
So as we celebrate Mother’s Day, and
as we honor our grandmothers and our
aunts and our mothers for giving us
life, let us recommit ourselves, on their
behalf, to improving Black maternal
outcomes.
But also, as Congresswoman ADAMS
continues to remind us, we must ad-
dress the structural racism, structural
racism which is really at the core of
this deadly issue. And it is a deadly
issue.
So let me just remind us tonight that
Black lives do matter.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congresswoman LEE. Black lives
matter, and Black mamas’ lives mat-
ter.
As you talked about your mother
giving birth to you and the story that
she told, I thought—I was reminded of
13 years ago, my daughter giving birth
to her daughter who, they both almost
didn’t make it. She had a very difficult
pregnancy, right at the end. She had to
have a Cesarean, what we call a C-sec-
tion, and she had to give blood. All
kinds of things started going wrong at
the last minute.
And once she did return home—be-
cause the baby was premature, 2
months early, once she did go home,
probably less than 10 days, she had to
go back, she was having complications.
So the problems that our women
have don’t always occur while you are
in the hospital, so they need to have
that support, not only before the baby
is born, but even after.
I thought about that, and it was a
very difficult time for us. But now you
wouldn’t believe my granddaughter is
taller than I am, and she is a really
healthy young lady, a beautiful young
lady.
But you have to think about that,
that it does not matter. I think I may
have heard the gentlewoman or one of
our other speakers say, even your so-
cioeconomic status, all those things
really don’t matter. Sometimes doctors
don’t really listen to women.
Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I say to
Congresswoman ADAMS, race is a factor
in everything in this country, and espe-
cially in terms of maternal deaths and

infant mortality rates with Black
women.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship and for all that she continues to
do. I appreciate that very, very much;
and thank her for being here as we
kick off this Mother’s Day. I am miss-
ing my mom. I know the gentlewoman
is missing hers because they passed
away very close to each other.
Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, it was
very close, very close. It is very dif-
ficult coming toward this Mother’s
Day, but we have to thank them and
honor them for giving us life.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for being here
and for her support of what we are try-
ing to do collectively here in Congress.
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure at
this point to introduce another war-
rior, a champion here in the U.S.
House, a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, Homeland Security Committee,
who has continued to lift her voice
over and over and over again.
Madam Speaker, how much time do I
have remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina has 61⁄2
minutes remaining.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
first of all, let me thank Congress-
woman ALMA ADAMS for gathering us a
couple of weeks ago to stand and be
counted as members of the Black Ma-
ternal Mortality Caucus; and to con-
tinue her recognition that if we don’t
become problem solvers the problems
will continue.
So I want to join with my colleagues,
and, in particular, Congresswoman
ADAMS and Congresswoman LEE, both
of whom I knew in the time that they
were going through the loss of their
moms.
A mom and a mother are always a
mom and a mother, so let me, in the
name of my late mother, who I con-
tinue to remember, Ivalita Bennett
Jackson, indicate that we stand here in
your name and in the names of young
mothers around the Nation and young
mothers-to-be.
I don’t believe we could be doing a
more important task than what we are
doing, to not only bring relevance and
substance to this question of why
Black women, African American
women, suffer more with maternal
mortality and infant mortality; be-
cause we know what happens when that
bond is broken by death or sickness,
particularly in the infant stages of a
young child’s life.
So I want to remind us of the beauty
of pregnancy, and particularly, those
pregnancies that these young women
are certainly evidencing, just the beau-
ty of the spirit, the softness of their
faces and the contours of their body,
excitement. If you have been around a
pregnant expectant mother, meaning
expectant of joy and excitement, then
you understand.
Should they not live? Should they
not live, and should their children,
their babies not live?
We have come to find out that Black
women are three to four times as likely
than White women to die of pregnancy-
related causes. A Black baby born
today is twice as likely as a White
baby born the same day, in the same
California city—and I will mention the
fact that California has made great
strides—to perish before she can take
her first steps or experience her first
birthday.
One in seven babies are born too soon
or too small. We have euphemisms that
mask the real impact of the maternal
healthcare crisis. Good prenatal and
maternity care is critically important
for healthy pregnancies and healthy
children.
Congresswoman ADAMS knows that
we have been on the floor discussing
access to healthcare. We know that
pregnancy has been described as a pre-
existing condition, which means that
women, even if they could, could not
access good healthcare.
Collectively, we need to make great-
er efforts to arm the next generation
with the right mix of robustness and
agility and, I would say, righteousness;
that we are righteously indignant that
we live in the greatest Nation in the
world, and here we are talking about
the death of mothers and the death of
their infant child.
As I listened to Congresswoman
ADAMS speak of her beautiful, taller-
than-her grandchild, imagine that she
says the healthcare that her daughter
had, in spite of the horrific chal-
lenges—just think if she did not, or no
one had listened to her about the pain
in her body or how she felt.
That is one the things that we find
with Black women, that, in fact, they
are not paid attention to as relates to
the pain and medical symptoms that
are represented by them. They are dis-
missed or taken less seriously.
Let me quickly say that, as the sen-
ior member on the Crime Sub-
committee, I have had the privilege of
knowing that crime impacts humanity
in many different ways. And so I intro-
duced legislation called H.R. 5130, the
Stop Infant Mortality and Recidivism
Reduction Act of 2016.
I am very glad, as I wrote the Vio-
lence Against Women Act, that I was
able to include the SIMARRA Act in
the 115th Congress, but it was proudly
passed in H.R. 1585, the Violence
Against Women Reauthorization Act of
2019.
The SIMARRA Act permits the Bu-
reau of Prisons to improve the effec-
tiveness and efficiency of Federal pris-
on systems for pregnant offenders,
many of whom are African American,
by establishing a pilot program, a crit-
ical stage, and developmental nurseries
in Federal prisons for children born to
inmates.
The SIMARRA Act helps decrease,
unprecedentedly high current infant
mortality rates by allowing inmate
mothers to provide healthy and safe
gestation for their unborn, as well as
providing a space for bonding with in-
fants during their first 30 months of
life.
It is important to administer effec-
tive services for pregnant, incarcerated
women and transcend our divide, to
protect families and continue shel-
tering the lives of our most vulnerable
children, babies born to mothers in
prison.
And although males account for 96
percent of the deaths, according to the
U.S. Department of Justice, in 2014, the
number of female prisoners who died
was 154.
I use this example to simply say, we
found a problem in incarcerated
women, many of them African Amer-
ican, and we sought to get in the way
of that problem by finding a solution,
to be able to help those mothers have a
healthy pregnancy and those babies be
born.
So let me just simply say that I am
glad to be on the floor to be with my
sisters. I am unhappy to be on the floor
because, as we stand here today, some
African American mother is losing her
life in birth or losing the life of her
child. That is how devastating mater-
nal mortality is.
I thank the gentlewoman for her
leadership, and I am here to stand with
her and fight with her, and this caucus
is going to help save lives. We are sav-
ing lives tonight.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I want
to thank all of my colleagues for being
here, and I yield back.

NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the
Senate has continued to make signifi-
cant progress in the personnel busi-
ness. After 2 years of systematic heel-
dragging from our friends across the
aisle, even on the least controversial
nominations, the modest reform the
Senate adopted last month is helping
us to get back on track.
Another slate of capable nominees is
now on its way to work for the Amer-
ican people. They are precisely the
same sort of unobjectionable sub-Cabi-
net nominees who, until very recently,
would have been subjected to 30 hours
of debate. They would have tied up the
floor for days before being confirmed
anyway. They are perfect examples of
why the Senate returned to our long-
standing norms of processing lower
level nominations. Now the American
people are getting the government they
elected at a more reasonable pace.
To be clear, the silly partisan games
haven’t all been cleared away from our
work on nominations. For example,
just yesterday, we confirmed Judge Jo-
seph Bianco to serve on the Second Cir-
cuit by a relatively close vote of 54 to
42. Remember, for a judge, in the scope
of Senate history, that counts as a
close shave. So are we looking at a con-
troversial person? Are we looking at an
individual whom the Senators agonized
over and painstakingly studied?
Judge Bianco brings a unanimous
‘‘well-qualified’’ rating from the ABA,
and he has already served as a judge for
13 years in the Eastern District of New
York. Oh, by the way, he was con-
firmed to that position by a voice vote.
In fact, back then in 2005, one of Mr.
Bianco’s most vocal supporters in the
Senate was none other than our friend
the Democratic leader. Here is how he
praised his New Yorker to the Judici-
ary Committee in 2005.
Senator SCHUMER said: ‘‘I am proud
to support someone as outstandingly
qualified and well respected as Mr.
Bianco.’’
Well, that was then and this is now.
The nominee is the same. Actually,
he is not quite the same because now
he has been a very highly regarded dis-
trict judge for 13 years, so this nominee
is actually even better. Yet the occu-
pant of the White House is different. In
this political moment, as we know, my
Democratic colleagues’ commitment to
the ‘‘outrage industrial complex’’
seems to crowd out reasonable judg-
ment.
So now, this week, the Democratic
leader lumped the same individual he
used to champion into what he de-
scribed as ‘‘hard-right nominees.’’ Then
the Democratic leader and almost
every other Member of his conference
proceeded to vote against him. He
voted against the same nominee he
praised in such generous terms before.
I can only conclude that now the
‘‘outrage industrial complex’’ comes
first, not the facts, not the nominee’s
qualifications. The ‘‘outrage industrial
complex’’ comes first. The individual
whom the Democratic leader used to
champion and who passed by a voice
vote in 2005 now receives this partisan
treatment. What was once a routine
matter for acclamation becomes a
party-line vote just because this Presi-
dent is the one who nominated him.
Look, fortunately, at the end of the
day, the outcome is the same. Judge
Joseph Bianco, along with a slate of
other well-qualified nominees, is now
on the job, and the Republicans will

f
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
another matter, as I mentioned, we are
in the middle of a historic economic
moment for the American people.
Last week, the nationwide unemploy-
ment rate fell to its lowest level since
December of 1969. In just the year and
a half since the Republicans passed
comprehensive tax reform, 19 States
have set new alltime lows in their un-
employment rates, including in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky.
If you compare today to November
2016, there are now nearly 70 percent
more job openings in durable goods
manufacturing and more than twice as
many job openings in construction. We
are talking about hundreds of thou-
sands of new job openings in these sec-
tors alone.
Overall, under the Republicans’ poli-
cies of the last 2 years, for the first
time in recorded history, the number of
job openings across the country has
surpassed the number of Americans
who are looking for work. Think about
that. There is more than one job open-
ing for every American who wants a
job.
So this economic moment, helped
along by Republican policies, has
placed American workers in much
higher demand, and we know what hap-
pens when American workers are in
high demand—they get paid more. Sure
enough, from late 2017 to late 2018,
wage growth for U.S. workers logged
its fastest full-year growth rate in a
decade.
What is more, the New York Times
reported:
The recent gains are going to those who
need it most. Over the past year, low-wage
workers have experienced the fastest pay in-
creases, a shift from earlier in the recovery,
when wage growth was concentrated at the
top.
Of course, that phrase ‘‘earlier in the
recovery’’ is code for during the Obama
administration.
How often do we hear the left invoke
the stale talking point that pro-growth
policies only help wealthy people? Any-
one who has cracked open a history
book knows it is absurd to say that
American free enterprise only helps
wealthy people and that State-con-
trolled socialism helps everyone else.
Anyone who has picked up a newspaper
in the last year and a half knows it as
well.
Capitalism and free enterprise are
the best tools humanity has ever dis-
covered for lifting up the vulnerable
and for empowering people. It was true
in the 19th century; it was true in the
20th century; and it is still proving to
be true in 2019.
It has been on the Republicans’
watch that we have actually seen low-
wage workers and nonmanagement
workers receive the fastest wage
growth. It has been on the Republicans’
watch that the unemployment rate
specifically for Americans without
high school diplomas has fallen to its
lowest rate since 1992. It has been on
the Republicans’ watch that news-
papers have described ‘‘a wave of dis-
abled Americans’’ who have been able
to join or return to the workforce.
My Republican colleagues and I could
not be more proud of the conditions
our policies have helped to create for
all kinds of American workers and
their families, and we will continue to
defend these gains, to put pro-growth,
pro-opportunity reforms in place, and
to stand up against the far-left grab
bag of socialist ideas that would
threaten America’s progress.

ABORTION
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, a few
weeks ago, I stood right here con-
demning Virginia Governor Ralph
Northam’s chilling remarks about in-
fanticide. Since then, the American
people have continued to witness dis-
turbing abortion extremism by Demo-
cratic public lawmakers. So here I am
again today to condemn and address
these horrific remarks and the unfortu-
nate reality we are living in today in
this country.
Last week, while opposing a bill to
protect unborn human life, Democratic
Alabama State Representative John
Rogers said: ‘‘Some kids are unwanted,
so you kill them now or you kill them
later.’’ He went on to say: ‘‘You bring
them in the world unwanted, unloved,
you send them to the electric chair. So
you kill them now or you kill them
later.’’
These reprehensible remarks reveal a
disturbing abortion extremism that
has become far too normal, too accept-
ed by the Democrats. All human life is
precious, no matter the stage of devel-
opment or disability. We must never
forget these are innocent babies we are
talking about.
Just this week, Democratic Pennsyl-
vania State Representative Brian Sims
posted a disgraceful video of himself
online—I encourage you to go and
watch it—a disgraceful video of himself
online harassing three teenage girls
who were praying outside a Planned
Parenthood abortion clinic. He went as
far as promising to pay $100 to anyone
who would identify these innocent
teenage girls.
Horrific comments like Representa-
tive Rogers’ and harassment of pro-life
teens by Representative Sims should be
condemned at the State and the na-
tional level by all, regardless of polit-
ical party. We must not let this con-
tinue to be the norm in our society. We
must fight back.
I yield the floor.

GUN VIOLENCE
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on
Tuesday afternoon, our country suf-
fered another shooting—this time in
Highlands Ranch, CO. It was the second
shooting of the week following a week-
end where at least 19 people were shot
in Baltimore, 16 in St. Louis, and 28 in
Chicago.
My grandson is less than a year old.
He turned over in his crib last night—
great accomplishment. But on a seri-
ous note, I don’t want him to live in a
world where this is the norm. I don’t
want him to see this on TV every other
week. I don’t want him to come home
after school to tell his parents about
learning to hide under a desk with the
lights off. I don’t want him to grow up
in a country where children and adoles-
cents are more than 20 times more
likely to be killed with guns than their
peers in other high-income countries.
I want him—little Noah and every
other child in America—to live in a
world where America’s gun violence
epidemic is a thing of the past. It may
seem a naive thought in a cynical time,
but I believe we can get there. We can
take steps right now to make these in-
cidents less likely. Nothing will pre-
vent them, but there are lots of things
we can do to make them a lot less fre-
quent. A few months ago, the House did
just that. The House passed legislation
to close the loopholes in Federal back-
ground checks—something that more
than 90 percent of all Americans sup-
port.
No one here pretends that we can
prevent every incident, but we have a
choice to face between moving in the
right direction in a significant way and
doing nothing. That is why I am so dis-
appointed once again that Leader
MCCONNELL and the Republican major-
ity have turned this Chamber into a

legislative graveyard where even the
most bipartisan, broadly supported leg-
islation like background checks can’t
even get a vote or a discussion. Here we
are at the end of another week in the
Senate. This week, we have done noth-
ing but process nominations. It is not
because there is nothing else to do.
There are over 100 bills—many non-
controversial and many bipartisan—
that have passed the House and are
awaiting Senate action, but Leader
MCCONNELL has turned the Senate into
a legislative graveyard.
When the American people demand
action, Leader MCCONNELL does noth-
ing. When the American people demand
action, the Senate Republicans are in
obeisance to this strategy of a grave-
yard, even when in their hearts they
may know doing that is not right and
they would like to debate the issues,
whatever their views.
Leader MCCONNELL promised to pre-
side over an open Senate, with vigorous
debate and amendment votes and the
ability to vote on issues of the day. He
promised that, and he said no matter
which party offered the ideas. Leader
MCCONNELL is breaking those promises
when he consigns bill after bill—every
one of them needed by America, needed
by the middle class, needed by working
people—every one of them to a legisla-
tive graveyard. So there are no de-
bates, no amendments, no progress, no
hope for the American people as the
Senate continues to be in such a legis-
lative graveyard.
PUERTO RICO
Madam President, on Puerto Rico,
last night President Trump held his
first Florida rally of the year in Pan-
ama City, in the heart of the Florida
Panhandle, which was so awfully dev-
astated by Hurricane Michael last
year. President Trump’s speech con-
tained all the usual demagoguery and
bloviating, but one thing in particular
stuck in his craw. The President used
his rally in Florida to denigrate once
again the island of Puerto Rico, to re-
peat falsehoods about how much aid it
has received, and to pit one American
against another, which seems to be his
MO.
Again, the President said that Puerto
Rico has gotten $91 billion of disaster
aid—flat-out false. They received a
hair over $11 billion.
Mr. President, ask your budget peo-
ple how many dollars Puerto Rico has
received, and they will not tell you the
$91 billion falsehood you have repeated
over and over.
Again, I saw the President pit Ameri-
cans against each other, going so far as
to hold up a flimsy graphic to get Flo-
ridians in his audience to turn against
Americans in Puerto Rico. At a time
when we need unity, at a time when we
should be together, with all the threats
challenging us—domestic and foreign
and all the other types of challenges—
all the President can do is to appeal to
people’s worst instincts and divide us.
We are humans. We are made by God.
We have good and bad in each of us.
The President should be appealing to
the good side, not the bad side, but all
he does is the bad side. It is a shame.
Of course, he said that Puerto Ricans
should be grateful for whatever dis-
aster aid they have received, as a pre-
text for not doing more. Does he say
that to the people of Florida: You
shouldn’t get any more aid because you
received some already and you should
be grateful. Of course not, it is a double
standard. President Trump ought to be
ashamed of himself for condescending
to and publicly mocking a community
that is still suffering. These are men,
women, and children. They still don’t
have their homes, their hospitals, their
schools. They can’t go on with life, and
he is mocking them? What did they do
wrong? They are American citizens. I
sometimes cannot believe the depth of
cruelty that the President uses to treat
fellow American citizens this way.
The fact remains, we can end the im-
passe over disaster aid at a moment’s
notice. To the people of Florida: All
you have to do is tell your Senators to
vote for the full aid package, including
aid to Puerto Rico, and you will get all
the aid you need, all the aid that Con-
gress has allocated. Just do that.
But Republican Senators, after Don-
ald Trump went in and said no more
aid to Puerto Rico, blindly bowed in
obeisance. The House will never pass a
bill that doesn’t treat Puerto Rico as
fairly as it treats the other States of
the Union.
Let’s decide now that we are going to
help every corner of America that is
hit by disaster, because that is what
Americans have always done.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Madam President, on the climate and
dark money, I want to return to the
topic of climate change, specifically
today. Why in our political system has
progress on climate change been so
slow? Why is it that so many Repub-
licans here in the Senate are afraid to
say yes to three questions: Is climate
change real? Is it caused by humans?
Should we do something about it? They
are afraid to say yes on any of those.
Why? It is so obvious to almost every-
body else.
Well, one of the dominant reasons is
that for decades Big Oil, Big Gas, and
Big Coal have devoted huge financial
resources to stymie political progress
and sow doubt about climate science.
For years, one of the biggest perpetra-
tors of this anti-climate campaign has
been the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The national chamber of commerce,
which bears almost no resemblance to
local chambers across the country, has
acted like a fossil fuel front group. It
accepts millions of dollars in dark
money, will not reveal its secret do-
nors, and has consistently fought any
attempts by our government to grapple
with climate change—carbon pricing,
reducing methane emissions, and even
the Paris climate accords.
The game has become so obvious that
major American corporations have dis-
associated themselves with the cham-
ber over its climate policies.
Recently, the chamber has begun to
talk as if it intends to get better on cli-
mate change. They added a new page to
their website and announced an ‘‘en-
ergy innovation’’ agenda. I welcome
the progress. But truthfully, the cham-
ber has made a shocking about-face
from climate denier to supposed cli-
mate believer and advocate. It is hard
not to be skeptical. Now, if the cham-
ber were serious about combating cli-
mate change, it would disclose its do-
nors and let the world see that it is fi-
nally changing. Maybe it would even
start endorsing different candidates or
getting behind truly bold legislation.
Maybe they can come here and lobby
that we should support the Paris ac-
cords. Until that day, the chamber’s
so-called big change on climate seems
to be cosmetic.
It may seem that I am spending an
awful lot of time on one group, but it
matters. The chamber is part of a vast
network of generally rightwing organi-
zations that accept and disseminate
billions of dollars of special interest
money with zero disclosure. It has
warped our political process by cre-
ating a financial incentive for many of
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle to oppose climate policies that
deal with climate change, to oppose ap-
propriate consumer protections, to op-
pose environmental protections, and to
oppose issues such as gun safety, as
well.
Senator SHELDON WHITEHOUSE of
Rhode Island has done an amazing—an
outstanding job—of bringing this issue
to the forefront and exposing the web
of dark money that lurks evilly behind
our politics. I want to thank and com-
mend him for it.
I am glad that organizations like the
chamber are feeling the heat for oppos-
ing climate change and proposed solu-
tions. They should. But the bigger and
more pervasive issue is that dark
money will continue to flow into our
political system until we change it.
Until we deal with it or until groups
start voluntary disclosures, in all like-
lihood these organizations will con-
tinue to frustrate the progress behind
the scenes and the longing we all have
to keep our planet the beautiful place
that it is and to prevent the seas from
rising and the weather from changing
and the coral reefs from disappearing.
That will not become a reality as long
as this dark money is still having a
stranglehold on so many of the other
party.

WELCOMING SENATOR ROSEN OF NEVADA
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Thank you,
Madam President. I come to the floor
today to honor my colleague and dear
friend, Senator JACKY ROSEN, as she
prepares to deliver her maiden speech
in this Chamber.
Senator ROSEN has spent her career
pushing boundaries and advocating for
innovation and inclusivity. She is
bringing that vision to the U.S. Senate,
where she has already proved herself to
be a strong advocate for Nevadans by
fighting to bolster our State’s tech in-
dustries, supporting our veterans, and
protecting Nevadans’ healthcare.
When JACKY was elected to the Sen-
ate, we sat down and talked about how
we could best serve Nevada together.
We requested different committee as-
signments so we could be sure we were
covering all the issue areas that are
important to Nevadans. We made sure
our staffs were connected and working
together on projects, not only in DC
but in the great Silver State of Nevada.
We committed to coming together
every Wednesday morning in DC to
welcome Nevadans to the Capitol and
hear their stories. Those Wednesday
morning constituent coffees are one of
the highlights, I think, of both of our
weeks. Anyone lucky enough to work
with JACKY knows that she works tire-
lessly to build consensus and find solu-
tions that help better the lives of Ne-
vada families. I am honored to work
beside her every day to serve the peo-
ple of Nevada. I am proud to call her
my friend, and I want to congratulate
her on making her maiden speech this
morning. I look forward to this and to
many more as we continue to fight to-
gether for the Silver State.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada.
MAIDEN SPEECH
Ms. ROSEN. Madam President, I
thank Senator CORTEZ MASTO for that
great introduction.
I am honored and humbled to address
this distinguished body as the newest
Senator from the great State of Nevada
and to stand alongside an exceptional
group of colleagues with a shared com-
mitment to public service. I am espe-
cially honored to hold this seat, as it
once belonged to a great Nevada public
servant, Senator Richard Bryan. Sen-
ator Bryan served in just about every
position in government, from assem-
blyman to Governor. He worked tire-
lessly to advance civil rights, empower
women in government, and defend Ne-
vada’s public lands. I am so honored to
carry his values with me to move Ne-
vada forward.
As I take up this mantle in the Sen-
ate, I am prepared to continue Senator
Bryan’s legacy and work for Nevadans,
while also building toward a legacy of
our own. I stand here as Nevada’s 28th
Senator and, for the first time in his-
tory, as one of two women to represent
our State in the Senate. I am proud to
be part of such an incredible movement
of strong, passionate, trailblazing
women like Senator CATHERINE CORTEZ
MASTO, who became the first female
Senator to represent the great State of
Nevada and the first Latina elected to
serve in the Senate.
Everywhere, we are seeing women
who are stepping up to lead, and I am
thrilled to have the chance to empower
women who are looking to break bar-
riers along the way. By bringing more
women to the decision-making table,
we can open doors and make progress
on issues that affect us and our hard-
working families on a daily basis.
When women put their minds together,
there is no new ground we cannot
break, and there is no glass ceiling we
cannot shatter.
I stand here today to share my vision
for how we can work together—on both
sides of the aisle—to lay down a frame-
work for progress because Nevadans
and Americans everywhere are count-
ing on us to go above and beyond, to
overcome obstacles before us, and to
find commonsense, forward-thinking
solutions for the challenges of this new
era—challenges like immigration re-
form, which protects our Dreamers and
TPS recipients; challenges like a
changing 21st century economy and cli-
mate change; and, of course, an issue
that is so important to hard-working
families everywhere, the challenge of
access to affordable, quality
healthcare.
Before I discuss where we are going,
let me tell you just a bit about where
I come from—my values and the ways
in which my story has helped to shape
who I am and how it will shape who I
will be as Nevada’s newest Senator.
I am the proud granddaughter of im-
migrants and a first-generation college
graduate who worked my way through
college waiting tables. Yes, I am a
former member of the Culinary Work-
ers Union, and I saved my tips in enve-
lopes to pay for that college tuition. I
am a computer programmer and a sys-
tems analyst who worked my way up in
what has been long considered a male-
dominated industry.
I am a wife to my husband Larry, a
radiologist, whom I can always count
on to be by my side. I am a mother to
my wonderful daughter Miranda, whom
I am so proud of and who inspires me
every day to build a better future for
our country.
I am a former president of my syna-
gogue—the largest synagogue in Ne-
vada—and during my tenure, I wit-
nessed the beauty of our country’s reli-
gious diversity and how community en-
gagement strengthens America. I also
learned the importance of working to-
gether to fight against anti-Semitism,
which we are seeing now, once again,
rear its ugly head here at home and
around the globe.
Remembering where I come from, my
story, my roots, this is what guides me
every day to make decisions to help
working families. When it comes to
issues like college affordability and
education, equal pay for equal work,
labor rights, combating hate and anti-
Semitism, and standing up for Israel, I
can speak from personal experience.
I am reminded that my story is just
one of many from Las Vegas to Reno,
to Searchlight, to Lovelock, and every-
where in between because I hear from
Nevadans who share some of those
same stories from every part of the
rich, vibrant fabric that makes up our
diverse State, including Latinos, Asian
Americans, African Americans, Tribal
communities, and beyond.
When I think of the shores of Lake
Tahoe and of Lake Mead, the majestic
canyons of Red Rock, the open skies
across the desert, and the mountains
that shine below them like jewels in
the sun, I think of home. Nothing rings
more true to me than saying home
means Nevada to me.
YUCCA MOUNTAIN
Madam President, we are a State
that was born to take on challenges.
We come together from every walk of
life to make cities that shine from out
of the desert. We are battle born, and
we are battle tested, and it is our grit,
our perseverance, and our diversity
that truly capture who we are. It is
those same qualities that will help us
change the face of our Nation.
Remembering where we come from—
that philosophy—is a driving force be-
hind my support for environmental
policies that will protect our States’
treasures, including our mountains,
rivers, and lakes.
I am honored to represent the most
beautiful State in the country, but
there is one environmental issue that
threatens Nevada’s beautiful land-
scapes and the families that call our
State home, and that is Yucca Moun-
tain. Nevada has made it clear time
and again that we will not become the
Nation’s dumping ground for nuclear
waste. Yet we continue to see relent-
less efforts to turn our State into the
Nation’s sole nuclear waste repository
without our consent, even after we
have made our voices heard, even
though Nevada does not create nuclear
waste. Congress must respect our will
and our rights as a State because our
voice matters. I stand prepared to use
every tool at my disposal to defend our
State from attempts to revive this
project.
I will continue to fight to keep our
State beautiful by standing up for
clean air and clean water, by pro-
tecting public lands and investing in
clean energy, by taking real action to
address climate change. I know we can
leave the world a better place for fu-
ture generations.
We also know there are commonsense
ways to address our climate challenges,
including investing in renewable en-
ergy right at home. In Nevada, solar

energy is both creating jobs and help-
ing us to lead a way toward a clean en-
ergy future. That is why, last year in
the House, I led the charge against
harmful solar tariffs that threatened to
roll back the progress we have made
and why I introduced legislation to
train our veterans for good-paying
jobs—solar jobs—that can both support
families and reduce our carbon foot-
print.
I will continue these efforts here in
the Senate because our energy inde-
pendence and the future of our planet
should never be partisan issues.
HIRE STUDENT VETERANS ACT
Madam President, in Nevada, we care
for one another, and we believe in look-
ing out for one another, and that is es-
pecially true for our veterans, who
make up a significant part of our
State. Over 226,000 veterans call Ne-
vada home. Our heroes in the armed
services and their families risk every-
thing—everything—to protect our Na-
tion. One way we can honor them is by
helping our heroes successfully transi-
tion to civilian life once they have
completed their military service.
After talking to countless veterans
and military families in Nevada, I in-
troduced the Hire Student Veterans
Act as my first bill in the Senate. This
bipartisan legislation incentivizes busi-
ness to hire our student vets who are
currently using their benefits to study.
We made a promise to take care of our
veterans when they return home, and
the last thing they should have to
worry about is not being able to obtain
a good education or a good-paying job.
I know this commonsense legislation
will further ensure that our student
vets are on the pathway toward success
and that Nevada and our Nation will
benefit from their continued contribu-
tions.
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Madam President, in Nevada, we are
leading the way; we are doing right by
hard-working families in areas like
clean energy and technology. As a
former computer programmer, I am so
excited about our State’s growing tech
industry, and I look forward to work-
ing with my colleagues on the Small
Business Committee to provide our
tech startups the tools they need to
succeed and create jobs and on the
Commerce Committee, where we are
tackling important issues like cyber
security and privacy and, for our rural
communities, critical access to rural
broadband, which they sorely need.
In all of these efforts, I look forward
to bringing new stakeholders to the
table because we can all gain so much
insight when we listen to our constitu-
ents and we embrace bold ideas to im-
prove their lives.
We have also grown our economy and
created good-paying jobs by legalizing
recreational marijuana in our State.
This industry is bringing millions of
dollars in revenue to Nevada. Yet our
marijuana businesses continue to oper-
ate on a cash-only basis as a result of
outdated Federal laws that are block-
ing their access to important financial
services. We cannot expect these busi-
nesses to succeed when the Federal
Government refuses to keep up with
the times. That is why I am supporting
bipartisan legislation to give mari-
juana businesses access to our banking
system so that they can safely operate
and continue contributing to our econ-
omy.
It is through bipartisan action that
we can encourage economic growth in
every corner of our State and every
corner of our country.
Since coming to Congress, I have
consistently made it a priority to
reach across the aisle on issues where
both parties can find common ground.
At a time of increasing political divi-
sion and partisan gridlock, it is even
more important for both sides to come
together, to make progress on the
issues that are impacting Americans at
home.
I am so proud of the work I have been
able to do with my colleagues from
both parties. Last Congress, I was
named one of the most bipartisan
freshman Members during my first
term and was one of the first Demo-
crats to be recognized with an award
by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for
supporting pro-growth policies.
I will continue to take every action
to fight for Nevada’s hard-working
families. We must act boldly, and we
must do more to provide opportuni-
ties—opportunities for our children
through improving education and
working across the aisle to invest in
our children’s future.
BUILDING BLOCKS OF STEM ACT
Madam President, earlier this year, I
introduced the Building Blocks of
STEM Act. In the Senate we are going
to try to make those investments in
early childhood STEM education. My
bipartisan, bicameral bill will give our
kids the opportunities to explore
STEM-related fields at an early age
and set them up for success because we
need a 21st century education if we
hope to succeed in a 21st century econ-
omy.
It is only through robust, quality
education that we can build that
strong workforce that will grow our
Nation’s economy and ensure that our
children and our Nation will ulti-
mately succeed.
Protecting our environment and pub-
lic lands, embracing clean energy, hon-
oring America’s heroes and their fami-
lies, supporting economic growth, in-
vesting in our children’s education,
these are just a few of the ways we can
work together across the aisle.
We can improve lives by listening to
the voices of those who sent us here to
represent us and by working together
to create a healthy, educated, and eco-
nomically empowered future for all
and, most importantly, by agreeing ev-
erywhere we can, especially on the
issues that matter most to families at
home.
HEALTHCARE
Madam President, there is no issue
that matters more than healthcare. I
have met with countless parents,
grandparents, families, who rely on ac-
cess to healthcare to keep themselves
and their precious loved ones healthy.
One of the reasons Nevada ranks near
the bottom when it comes to access to
care is that we continue to face a
shortage of physicians, particularly in
primary care. This is especially true
for Nevadans living in rural and Tribal
communities, with many of our State’s
residents having to drive hundreds of
miles to seek medical care or they sim-
ply go without care.
We know that many other States
face similar problems. We need for-
ward-thinking solutions to make sure
that States like ours have enough doc-
tors to serve our population. We need
to help communities in rural and un-
derserved areas gain access to tele-
health programs so that we are able to
provide better access to critical serv-
ices, not just to Nevadans but to all
Americans, no matter where they live.
We need transparency when it comes
to drug pricing because no person
should be forced to decide between pay-
ing their bills and buying lifesaving
medication. Let’s not forget that we
need equal access to healthcare for
women, for LGBTQ, and for underrep-
resented communities.
We must protect our healthcare sys-
tem from sabotage by this administra-
tion. This month, the Trump adminis-
tration made yet another move to take
healthcare coverage and critical pro-
tections away from millions nation-
wide, instructing our own Justice De-
partment to refuse to defend the Af-
fordable Care Act. We are no longer
just talking about stripping away pro-
tections for those with preexisting con-
ditions, as if that weren’t enough. We
are in even more dangerous territory
than before because if our healthcare
law is completely wiped out, we will
see an end—an end—to the tax credits
that make coverage affordable for mid-
dle-income families; we will see an end
to preventive care without copays, like
health screenings and contraceptives;
we will see an end to the ability of
young adults under the age of 26 to
stay on their parents’ insurance; and
we will see an end to Medicaid benefits,
which have helped over 200,000 Nevad-
ans get coverage.
If this administration has its way
with invalidating our healthcare law,
it would spell disaster for primary care
providers and the millions of Ameri-
cans who rely on its protections for ac-
cess to quality, affordable care.
Healthcare is one of the top issues at
every kitchen table in communities
like Winnemucca and Henderson and
across this country. I can’t even begin
to count the number of Nevadans who
have shared with me how they would
be affected by this disastrous decision
and who tell me what it means in their
personal lives not to have to live in
fear of being denied coverage for a pre-
existing condition. Over 1.2 million Ne-
vadans live with a preexisting condi-
tion. We all know what is at stake if

these individuals are denied access to
care.
There are plenty of ways we can
work to improve the Affordable Care
Act and lower healthcare costs, but de-
stroying the law and leaving our loved
ones at risk is simply unacceptable.
As a member of the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions here in the Senate, I am working
on solutions each day to bring re-
sources, accountability, and relief to
our healthcare system, including sup-
porting legislation to bring down our
skyrocketing drug costs and programs
that bolster telemedicine in our rural
and underserved communities because
healthcare is a personal issue that af-
fects each and every one of us, and we
all know that just one diagnosis can
change your life in an instant.
The Senate today faces many chal-
lenges, none more so than the polariza-
tion and division that prevents us from
coming together in pursuit of the pub-
lic interest. In his farewell address, Ne-
vada Senator Richard Bryan stated: ‘‘If
we can restore civility in our public
discourse, as we debate the great issues
and policy differences of our time, if we
can apply the rules that govern the
process by which we conduct the Sen-
ate’s business fairly to all, and if we
can work together for the common
good, I am confident that the future of
the Senate can be as bright as the
past.’’
So this is my pledge to all of you: I
will be an independent voice for all Ne-
vadans by agreeing where I can and
fighting where I must. There is nothing
more important to me than taking care
of my home, our home, your families,
and all of our families because home
means Nevada to me.
During my first few weeks as a Sen-
ator, I joined Senator MANCHIN in help-
ing lead the effort to defend the con-
stitutionality of the Affordable Care
Act. Our resolution will direct the Sen-
ate legal counsel to intervene in the
Federal court case, where our
healthcare system is under attack, to
defend our current law, including pro-
tections for preexisting conditions.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 18
Madam President, that is why, as my
first action while holding the floor of
the Senate, I would like to ask you
this:
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Rules Com-
mittee be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. Res. 18 and the Senate
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; that the resolution to be agreed
to, the preamble be agreed to, and the
motions to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no
intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. THUNE. I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Ms. ROSEN. This is why Nevadans
sent me here—to protect their
healthcare. And that is what I am
going to do; that is what I will con-
tinue to do.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from
South Dakota.
MEDICARE
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if you are
in a shaky financial situation, won-
dering how you are going to meet your
obligations, your first instinct isn’t
generally to wildly increase your
spending, unless, of course, you are a
congressional Democrat.
Our Nation’s Medicare system is on
shaky financial ground. Democrats’ an-
swer is to massively expand the pro-
gram to the tune of trillions of dollars.
Two weeks ago, the Social Security
and Medicare trustees released their
annual report. According to the report,
beginning in 2026, Medicare will not be
able to meet its obligations. This
doesn’t even seem to register on Demo-
crats’ radar. They steamroll right past
the program’s already shaky financial
status and ask the American people to
believe that, somehow, massively ex-
panding the program to include almost
the entire U.S. population at a pricetag
of staggering proportions will work.
It is difficult to overstate just how
unrealistic Democrats’ Medicare for
All fantasy is. Start with the pricetag:
$32 trillion over 10 years. To put that
number in perspective, that is more
money than the Federal Government
has spent in the last 8 years com-
bined—on everything. That $32 trillion
estimate is likely too low, as it was
based on an earlier version of the Medi-
care for All plan of the Senator from
Vermont. His new plan also includes a
massive new benefit—funding for long-
term care, an enormously expensive
part of the healthcare system.
Democrats’ last attempt to have the
government run a long-term care pro-
gram fell apart before it was even im-
plemented because the program was
not financially viable.
Let’s leave aside for a minute the
tremendous cost and the tax hikes on
ordinary Americans that would be re-
quired to pay for it. Let’s talk about
the massive difficulty of implementing
such a system. The junior Senator
from Vermont expects people to believe
that the government can successfully
transition more than 180 million people
off of their private insurance and into
government-run healthcare in 4 years.
To put that in perspective, the Obama
administration had 31⁄2 years to imple-
ment the ObamaCare exchanges, which
were intended to cover a tiny fraction
of the number of people who would be
covered under Medicare for All. As I
am sure most Americans remember,
the government couldn’t put together a
working website in that 31⁄2 year time
period. Yet Democrats somehow expect
us to believe that they can smoothly
transition 180 million Americans into
government-run insurance in just 4
years.
We are also somehow supposed to be-
lieve things will be much more effi-
cient with government running your
healthcare. It is certainly true there is
a lot of bureaucracy in our current
healthcare system, but I am fairly sure
the answer is not giving control of
healthcare to the mother ship of bu-
reaucracy—the Federal Government.
Democrats also apparently expect
Americans to believe that the Federal
Government will be able to deliver al-
most unlimited healthcare for free. Un-
fortunately, no matter how much
money the Federal Government takes
in with higher taxes, there will eventu-
ally be a limit to how much it can
spend on healthcare.
What happens when it can’t afford to
meet demand, which, by the way, tends
to increase substantially when some-
thing is offered for free? I will tell you
what happens: long wait times and ra-
tioning of care, which have become the
hallmarks of socialized medicine in
other countries.
There is no question that our
healthcare system is not perfect. Re-
publicans are currently working on leg-
islation to address some of the
healthcare challenges facing Ameri-
cans, but destroying our current health
system to fix the problems we have
would be like razing a house to the
ground to fix a leak in the bathroom
sink.
There are lots of good things about
our healthcare system. A lot of people
in this country are happy with their
healthcare. We need to preserve the
good things about our system and fix
what is not working and not force ev-
eryone into a fantastically expensive
one-size-fits-all, government-run
healthcare system that would reduce
everyone’s quality of care.
The Democratic chairman of the
House Rules Committee, discussing a
House hearing on Medicare for All, re-
cently said: ‘‘It’s a serious proposal
that deserves serious consideration on
Capitol Hill.’’
I would argue that it is the exact op-
posite. The only things that are serious
about this proposal are the serious con-
sequences it would have for the Amer-
ican people if it were ever imple-
mented. It is deeply irresponsible of my
Democrat colleagues to peddle this
government-run nightmare as a legiti-
mate healthcare solution. One of our
former colleagues, Tom Coburn, used
to say: If you think healthcare is ex-
pensive now, wait until it is free.
Let’s hope Democrats decide to take
a more serious approach to healthcare
reform before Americans are forced to
live under the ugly reality of their so-
cialist fantasy.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.

May 9, 2019
HONORING ROBERT MCKEITHEN
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I
respect the time-honored practice of
this body which encourages new Mem-
bers to listen and observe before speak-
ing on the floor. There is value in hu-
mility—knowing when to talk and
when to listen.
First, let me say it is a great privi-
lege to represent the people of Mis-
sissippi in the United States Senate. I
am working hard to support the needs
of all Mississippians and to justify the
confidence placed in me by the people
of my great State.
Today I rise to speak on several im-
portant topics. First and foremost, I
rise to honor Officer Robert
McKeithen, a 24-year-decorated vet-
eran of the Biloxi Police Department
who lost his life in the line of duty this
past Sunday night, May 5.
Officer McKeithen was described by
his chief as ‘‘an unbelievably fine po-
liceman.’’ He was an Air Force veteran,
a husband, and a father who dedicated
his life to serving the people of Biloxi,
my State, and our Nation. His loss is a
tragedy and a stark reminder that law
enforcement officers risk their lives
daily to keep us safe. Officer
McKeithen’s family, colleagues, and
friends certainly have my deepest sym-
pathy.
DISASTER RELIEF
Mr. President, I also rise to speak on
behalf of thousands of Mississippians
who have been affected by catastrophic
flooding and other natural disasters
this year. Their plight and the unmet
commitment made to them long ago
provide us an opportunity to evaluate
how we as public servants meet the ex-
pectations of the people.
On February 25, 2019, the Governor of
Mississippi declared a state of emer-
gency due to strong storms, torrential
rainfall, and severe flooding. Homes,
property, businesses, and public infra-
structure had been damaged statewide.
On April 23, President Trump granted a
major disaster declaration for the
State of Mississippi to help commu-
nities recover from these events. I am
grateful for the President’s actions.
A large portion of West Central Mis-
sissippi is experiencing the worst flood
records since 1973. On April 1, more
than 512,000 acres were flooded. Now, a
little more than a month later, more
than 488,000 acres in this highly pro-
ductive agricultural region are still un-
derwater, with conditions forecasted to
get worse before they improve. To put
that into perspective, these flood-
waters span nearly 762 square miles as
we speak. This flooding is affecting
homes, roads, bridges, churches,
schools, and the overall health and
public safety of area residents. Septic
tanks are overflowing. Snakes are in
houses. The bloated bodies of drowned
deer, bear, hogs, and other wildlife
float in stagnant water. The residents
of Mississippi’s Eagle Lake are basi-
cally on an island. If someone needs
emergency healthcare, it is virtually
impossible for an ambulance to get to
them.
Further, hundreds of thousands of
acres of prime agriculture and
timberland will suffer significant dam-
age or simply go unplanted this season.
The economic impact on agriculture
alone will be in the hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars.
I observed the magnitude of the
flooding and damages firsthand in a
flyover with the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers a month ago. The situation
on the ground is no different today. It
is truly heartbreaking to see. While the
full extent of damage can’t be assessed
until the floodwaters recede and resi-
dents can return to their homes, Mis-
sissippians, along with those in the
Midwest experiencing similar chal-
lenges, need relief also.
I commend the Appropriations Com-
mittee chairman and vice chairman for
their continued efforts to reach an
agreement on an emergency funding
measure to help individuals and com-
munities recover from natural disas-
ters. I am especially grateful for their
willingness to consider expanding the
scope of the legislation to address the
2019 natural disasters. Federal assist-
ance alone will not solve all the prob-
lems, and a long road to recovery lies
ahead. However, disaster supplemental
legislation will provide a very impor-
tant first step.
The outcome of the push and pull
over disaster assistance highlights the
need for us, as elected representatives,
to consistently evaluate the Federal
Government’s performance on deliv-
ering promises to the American people.
I cannot speak for others, but Mis-
sissippians would like to see more ac-
tion and less acting from their leaders
in Washington. Our Nation’s environ-
mental review and permitting process
for infrastructure projects is the epit-
ome of a flawed and broken bureauc-
racy in desperate need of repair.
President Trump’s Executive orders
to expedited environmental reviews
and approvals for high-priority infra-
structure projects speak to the Amer-
ican public’s frustration toward Wash-
ington and the never-ending bureau-
cratic redtape carried over from the
Obama administration. I am grateful
this administration has taken a strong
stance to bring common sense to gov-
ernment operations. It should not take
years and numerous acts of Congress to
expand and deepen ports or tackle im-
portant infrastructure projects that
would generate jobs and add billions to
our Nation’s economy. It should not
take decades and numerous acts of
Congress to complete critical flood
control projects that will protect the
lives and property of Americans while
preventing the need for multibillion-
dollar disaster measures. Congress
should make it abundantly clear that
one Federal Agency should not be able
to prevent or delay another Federal
Agency from delivering critical flood
protections specifically authorized by
the legislative branch. There are nu-
merous examples of this—what most
Americans consider bad government—
across the country. The catastrophic
flooding taking place in Mississippi is a
prime example of one Agency that has
worked at odds with another to the
detriment of the public. So many Mis-
sissippians are exasperated by the fact
that they are losing their homes and
way of making a living, all the while
knowing it could have been prevented.
The Federal Government has yet to
put in place the flood control improve-
ment it has promised area residents
since 1941. The fact is, they have made
it worse. Make no mistake, today’s
flooding in Mississippi should not be
happening. It is time for the Federal
Government to step up and make good
on its promises. It is time for the Fed-
eral Government to listen to the people
in need of help and to help them.
Over the past seven decades, signifi-
cant taxpayer dollars have been in-
vested in the Lower Mississippi River
Valley to construct a comprehensive,
systematic flood control solution
which today consists of levees, drain-
age channels, and floodgates. The last
remaining feature of this 77-year effort
remains unconstructed due to the ex-
cessive, overburdensome regulations
and redtape. Because of this, Mississip-
pians are once again losing their homes
and businesses, roads and bridges are
being destroyed, and wildlife is dying—
their habitat lost to contaminated
floodwaters.
I bring this to the attention of my
colleagues because passage of disaster
legislation is vital to my constituents
and millions of people across the coun-
try. I also call attention to this situa-
tion to encourage us to strive to do a
much better job in delivering for the
American people. That is what our con-
stituents expect, and that is what they
deserve.
I yield the floor.

NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I

ness and Entrepreneurship, I want to
thank the 30 million small businesses
in America for their contributions to
our economy during this National
Small Business Week.
I look forward to National Small
Business Week every year because it is
a chance for us to honor the small busi-
nesses and communities in Maryland
and across the country that may not
make headlines, but they steadily
move our economy forward by improv-
ing industries, developing new prod-
ucts, and creating employment oppor-
tunities for more than 47 percent of all
American workers.
One tradition of National Small Busi-
ness Week is that the Small Business

Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and
Guam.

the chief executive officer of Precise
Software Solutions—an innovative in-
formation technology company that is
based in Rockville, MD. Dr. Huang is
also a professor of information systems
at the University of Maryland Balti-
more County, where he is training fu-
ture leaders in Maryland’s technology
sector.
Small business owners like Dr.
Huang are the cornerstone of Mary-
land’s economy, and their deep roots in
the community help to shape the cul-
ture and character of our State. I
thank Dr. Huang for bringing dyna-
mism and ingenuity to Maryland’s
economy, and I wish him and his col-
leagues continued success.
I have met with countless small busi-
ness owners like Dr. Huang as I have
traveled across my home State of
Maryland, which we proudly call
‘‘America in Miniature’’ due to our di-
versity. From bustling metropolitan
areas like Baltimore City and the DC
suburbs to rural communities on the
Eastern Shore and in Mountain Mary-
land, small businesses are not just
where we buy products and services;
they are the building blocks that make
up our communities.
That is why I requested a seat on the
Small Business and Entrepreneurship
Committee when I began serving in the
Senate in 2007. I wanted to make sure
small businesses in Maryland and
across the country were receiving the
support they needed from Washington.
Nationwide, small businesses account
for 99.9 percent of all businesses, with
there being a total of nearly 31 million
small businesses that employ 60 mil-
lion Americans.
According to the Small Business Ad-
ministration Office of Advocacy, small
businesses created 1.8 million net jobs
in 2016, the most recent year for which
data is available. Of those jobs created,
more than 1.2 million were created by
small businesses with fewer than 20
employees. It is clear that small busi-
nesses are the growth engine that
power our economy, so it is on us in
Congress to ensure that they receive
the support they need to overcome the
unique challenges they face.
When I meet with small businesses
across Maryland, one of their top con-
cerns is often their access to capital.
Capital is the lifeblood of small busi-
nesses. So, for many small businesses,
an SBA-backed loan is a lifeline that is
the difference between success and fail-
ure in the early, fragile stages of a
small business’s life.
I see the benefits of SBA-backed
loans every time I drive past Under
Armour’s headquarters in Baltimore.
Without an SBA-backed loan, Under
Armour may not have been able to
grow from a small business being run
out of a basement to the global brand,
with thousands of employees in Balti-
more, that it is today. Last year alone,
SBA-backed financing helped nearly
75,000 small businesses access more
than $36 billion in capital, and it sup-
ported more than 725,000 jobs.
The SBA’s finance programs are mod-
els of public-private partnerships and
do a lot of good in this country, but
some of the programs are not ade-
quately reaching underserved commu-
nities, especially those of minorities,
women, and veterans. I do note that
the SBA’s Microloan Program and the
7(a) Community Advantage Pilot Pro-
gram do punch above their weight in
reaching underserved borrowers. We
can learn from how those programs are
being operated to help underserved
communities in order to help modify
loan programs such as the 7(a) and 504
so they may be able to reach more of
the underserved communities.
The chronic shortfall of SBA loans
reaching the minority communities is
especially important in Maryland,
which I am proud to say has the high-
est average number of minority-owned
businesses in the country. Minority-
owned firms are two to three times
more likely to be denied credit, more
likely to avoid applying for loans based
on the belief that they will be turned
down, and more likely to receive small-
er loans and pay higher interest rates
on the loans they do receive.
Last September, I held a field hear-
ing in Baltimore at Morgan State Uni-
versity—a revered HBCU—to learn
more about the struggles minority en-
trepreneurs face in their accessing of
capital.
One of the key takeaways from the
hearing was that minority small busi-
ness owners need SBA to fill the gaps
when private lenders often fall short.
Additionally, access to capital must go
hand in hand with entrepreneurial de-
velopment training. The entrepre-
neurial development programs at the
SBA provided mentorship, business ad-
vice, and training to more than 1.2 mil-
lion entrepreneurs during fiscal year
2018.
These programs are invaluable. Data
show that small businesses created by
entrepreneurs who receive at least 3
hours of SBA counseling have higher
success rates than small businesses
created by entrepreneurs who have not
received that amount of counseling.
Knowing that small businesses, espe-
cially minority-owned small busi-
nesses, need more support from the
SBA, not less, is why I remain deeply
troubled by the administration’s ef-
forts to make vital business counseling
and SBA-backed loans more difficult to
access.
The administration’s fiscal year 2020
budget proposed more than a quarter of
a billion dollars in new fees for SBA-
backed loans. Simply put, this is a $255
million tax on American small busi-
ness owners. Additionally, instead of
investing in entrepreneurial develop-
ment programs, the administration’s
recent budget proposed $67 million in
cuts to these programs.
The administration’s efforts to un-
dermine the SBA are even more con-
cerning considering the current lack of
leadership at the Agency. Since the
resignation of Administrator Linda
McMahon, the President has not sent
Congress a nomination for a new Ad-
ministrator. I also remain concerned
about the administration’s failure to
nominate a Deputy Administrator—a
position that has been vacant for more
than 12 months.
We hear from the administration
that we haven’t acted on their nomi-
nees. We don’t have the nominees to
act on. As I speak, there are thousands
of small business owners from across
the country who are visiting Wash-
ington, DC, in order to participate in
the National Small Business Week
events that have been scheduled, and
many more are participating in events
across the country.
Let us honor them and their con-
tributions by giving the SBA the tools
and leadership it needs to help entre-
preneurs build successful small busi-
nesses. I look forward to continuing to
work with Chairman MARCO RUBIO and
our colleagues in the House, in a bipar-
tisan fashion, to support American
small businesses so they can continue
developing innovative products and
services and creating jobs.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

REMEMBERING ROBERT PEAR
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
come to the floor today to pay tribute
to a revered and distinguished member
of the press corps, Robert Pear, a long-
time reporter for the New York Times.
He spent four decades in the corridors
of this U.S. Capitol.
I often say that journalists are the
watchdogs of democracy, and I really
believe that—policing their beats to in-
form the public and, more importantly,
to hold wrongdoers and especially our
big government accountable. That
makes them very valuable to pre-
serving our representative system of
government. These journalists serve as
the eyes and ears of the American peo-
ple—reporting on issues that impact
the daily lives and livelihoods of our
neighbors. From crime to education,
healthcare, and foreign policy, journal-
ists serve as guardians of the First
Amendment.
That brings me to Robert.
On Tuesday, the healthcare beat lost
a legendary reporter. The death of Rob-
ert Pear will be mourned for many
years to come. As the dean of the na-
tional healthcare reporters, he estab-
lished a reputation for hard-nosed re-
porting. For decades, he carried out a
noble mission to inform the public, and
he did it with integrity and fairness.
He leaves behind a legacy of un-
matched institutional knowledge, par-
ticularly in the area of healthcare pol-
icy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2759
May 9, 2019
As a policymaker and history buff
myself, I read as much news as I can
possibly get my hands on. On week-
ends, I catch up on my reading when
traveling to and from Iowa. For every
year I have served in the U.S. Senate,
Mr. Pear’s byline has appeared in the
New York Times. I am told that it ap-
peared more than 6,700 times. It is a
byline that I made sure not to miss.
His work put meat on the bones of
public policy. Even those of us who
study legislation closely could learn a
lot and did learn a lot from his
writings. Substantive and crisp, his ex-
ceptional reporting delivered a thor-
ough analysis of complex issues and
then without a doubt influenced the
policy conversation on healthcare.
His prolific pen sharpened the minds
of readers, including staff and law-
makers who wrote legislation here on
Capitol Hill. It even informed lobbyists
who worked to penetrate and influence
the debate. His work carried weight
with those who implemented
healthcare policy from the executive
branch, including the White House, the
Department of Health and Human
Services, the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services, the National Insti-
tutes of Health, and the Food and Drug
Administration.
Now that he has passed away, his ab-
sence on the healthcare beat here on
Capitol Hill will be missed profoundly.
His understanding of the mechanics of
health policy were without equal. He
was able to wade through the weeds of
our archaic Federal spending formulas
for Medicare and Medicaid and deci-
pher their impact on the delivery of
care in my rural communities but also
urban America. Mr. Pear deftly com-
municated how proposed changes would
affect patient care, from the point of
service to the pharmaceutical counter
and the pocketbooks of consumers.
Policymakers, providers, patients, and
the taxpayers have been well-served by
this giant of journalism.
Unlike many of his peers, Mr. Pear
shunned the spotlight by just doing the
old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting.
Unassuming and understated, Mr. Pear
let his published work speak for itself.
I am sure you are going to hear from
Ranking Member WYDEN shortly, and
he knows Mr. Pear very well and would
agree with some of these things I say.
Before holding a press conference to
unveil a bill dealing with healthcare,
any Senator, including this one, had to
be sure to have all their ducks in a
row. No lawmaker wanted to be a sit-
ting duck with Robert Pear in the
front row of the press gaggle.
I will miss his bylines, particularly
the extent to which they helped to edu-
cate me, helped me to understand pol-
icy that other Members of Congress
were promoting and maybe even learn-
ing from his criticism on some stands
that I took.
Today, I extend my condolences to
his family, friends, and peers. I salute
his lifelong contribution through exem-
plary service on behalf of the American
people—most importantly, policing the
process of representative government
and making sure that government and
those of us who serve in government
are accountable.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, be-
fore he leaves the floor, I just want to
thank the chairman of the Finance
Committee. I think the chairman said:
Well, the ranking member might agree
with some of my comments. I agree
with every one of the chairman’s com-
ments.
I think, Madam President, how I
would begin—and I think the Chairman
would agree on this—we can have some
pretty spirited debates about
healthcare in this Chamber and in the
Finance Committee, but, as the chair-
man indicated, there isn’t an inch of
difference with respect to our views on
Robert Pear. We all thought he was a
true professional, and he was the gold
standard of journalism as it relates to
healthcare.
I thought about yesterday, Chairman
GRASSLEY, because we had a hearing on
a topic relating to reimbursement of
physicians. I think the chairman and I
would be of like mind—it probably
wouldn’t be inherently fascinating in
every coffee shop in Iowa and Oregon,
but it is incredibly important, for ex-
ample, for the survival of rural hos-
pitals and so many concerns that I
know the Presiding Officer of the Sen-
ate has and the distinguished chairman
of the Finance Committee has. I looked
over at the press table, Chairman
GRASSLEY, and the seat for Robert Pear
was missing.
Robert Pear—and that was what this
special man was all about—never
jumped to sit in front and say: Well, I
am from the New York Times, so I
should count more. As the chairman
remembers, he always sat in the back.
I thought we missed him so much
yesterday. The chairman and I had just
gotten the news. What we were talking
about yesterday was what Robert Pear
was all about—taking a very com-
plicated issue that probably was not in-
herently fascinating and putting it in
very simple, understandable, thought-
ful words for the American people. As
the chairman correctly said, that was
what everybody would wait for when
there was a complicated issue. You
would hear it among Republicans, the
chairman’s staff, and my staff. People
would hear about an issue, and very
often, the first thing they would say
was ‘‘Did Robert Pear write about it?’’
If Robert Pear wrote about it, it was
important. In fact, one of the most
noteworthy aspects of the incredible
outpouring of affection and admiration
for Robert Pear yesterday—and the
chairman and I talked about it in com-
mittee—is the New York Times had a
slug called ‘‘Pear on Health,’’ and all
over the country, my guess is—the Des
Moines Register; the Oregonian, my
paper, a big paper in Oregon—they
would all wait for the Robert Pear slug
because they knew that was a very im-
portant issue.
The fact that Robert Pear wasn’t at
the witness table yesterday after all
these years broke our hearts and
brought back a lot of memories. I actu-
ally was stunned over the years—and
the chairman touched on it—by his en-
cyclopedic knowledge of healthcare. He
remembered the amendment to the
amendment to the amendment to the
amendment that somebody offered 10
or 15 years ago.
When I came to the Congress, he
went and studied the history of the
Gray Panthers. I was codirector of the
senior citizens group. My little one
still wonders if they are the Pink Pan-
thers. Robert Pear knew everything
about that.
When he was up on the Hill—and the
chairman probably remembers this—he
had a little notebook in which he scrib-
bled Chairman GRASSLEY’s remarks or
my remarks or whoever he was talking
to, but he also had bigger notebooks,
and he kept an exhaustive set of files.
In a town where, particularly at im-
portant post-hearing or post-legisla-
tion events, all the reporters are shout-
ing one above another, Robert Pear
was the most soft-spoken voice in the
room. In fact, I was at some events—
my guess is that the chairman was as
well—where it got kind of loud and
frantic. They were throwing micro-
phones and the like at you. When Rob-
ert Pear raised his hand and was called
on, the room hushed. It went quiet be-
cause everybody understood that the
question Robert Pear would ask was
the right one.
Senator GRASSLEY and I were talking
yesterday about how we particularly
appreciated and felt—Republicans and
Democrats—that Robert Pear was fair
to all sides, and he held us all account-
able. The general sense was that if you
were a legislator and you were going to
be interviewed by Robert Pear, you
better go out and do some serious prep
work because he would know the sub-
ject inside-out and in that soft-spoken
way would just stay at it until he exca-
vated the real effects. That was part of
the Pear ‘‘tell the right story in the
right way’’ approach to ensure that if
you read a Robert Pear health story,
you learned something. I think most
Senators would agree that is not al-
ways the case with every single story,
but that was the standard Robert Pear
set.
I think what I would like to say is
that there are going to be a number of
Senators who over the years had a
chance to work with Robert Pear. We
are going to hear their own accounts of
their relationships, but we are not
going to hear one single Senator—not
one—say that Robert Pear tried to
make them look bad, took a cheap
shot, or tried to say something flashy
in order to get a headline. They are
going to say just the opposite. They
are going to say: That is what jour-
nalism is supposed to be all about.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2760 May 9, 2019
I am a journalist’s kid and very
proud of it. My dad was a first-genera-
tion Jewish kid. He taught himself
English and was a journalist. He al-
ways said: ‘‘Ron, the journalist’s job is
to ask the tough questions—the tough
questions that really matter.’’
Robert Pear asked the tough ques-
tions, no doubt about that, but he al-
ways did it in a very unique way, a fair
way, a thoughtful way, a way that em-
bodied the gold standard for journalism
that I have described.
So yesterday was particularly sad.
We got the news in the morning. We
had that healthcare hearing, which
started about an hour after we got the
news. The first thing I thought of as I
came into the room was how hard it is
going to be—and it is not going to stop
hurting for a long time—to imagine
that seat at the end of the press table
not having the thoughtful, informed
Robert Pear sitting there so he could
get the facts to the American people.
So I just want to close today—we
have had a number of colleagues speak
already—to say, Robert, Robert Pear,
you were the consummate professional.
You were fair to the bone. It was an
honor—an honor to get to work with
you over the years in healthcare. We
say goodbye to someone who was a true
mensch, and this afternoon with heavy
hearts, we think of Robert Pear and
want the country to know what an ex-
traordinary person he was.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. I recog-
nize the Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
come to speak on another matter, but
I want to thank Senator WYDEN for the
kind words he had to say, as well,
about a very distinguished journalist.
ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR
Madam President, yesterday, the
House Judiciary Committee voted to
hold Attorney General Barr in con-
tempt of Congress. Mr. Barr has been
transparent. He made the Mueller re-
port available to them—99 percent
unredacted in the obstruction section
of that report. Instead of reading it,
the Democrats, who voted for con-
tempt, moved like lightning straight to
the charge of contempt. To me, that is
not good-faith negotiation.
In a similar situation, now a few
years ago, in a Democratic administra-
tion, with a Democratic Attorney Gen-
eral, with a House of Representatives
held by Republicans, the House only
held Attorney General Holder in con-
tempt after many months of negotia-
tion over documents that were with-
held on bogus grounds; and just for
connecting that to an issue, that was
the Fast and Furious investigation
that I was involved in as well. We had
a very good case against Holder. We at-
tempted to negotiate with Holder for a
long period of time before the other
body held him in contempt.
This particular issue of contempt of
this Attorney General is not a good
case. I would like to say, as a person
who promotes congressional oversight
of every Democratic and every Repub-
lican President to make sure they
faithfully execute the law, that what
the House Judiciary Committee did
yesterday, just a few days after Mr.
Barr didn’t do exactly what they want-
ed him to do and comparing that with
the negotiations we had with the exec-
utive branch of the Obama Attorney
General on Fast and Furious, is going
to make it very difficult in the future
for Congress to conduct its constitu-
tional role of oversight because future
Presidents are going to use this as an
example of a bad-faith attempt to ne-
gotiate with the executive branch of
Government to get what you want.
Maybe what they want isn’t real infor-
mation or real congressional oversight;
they may be trying to make political
points.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
YOUNG). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-
day, the Judiciary Subcommittee on
Border Security and Immigration that
I chair held a hearing on the humani-
tarian and security crisis along the
southern border. One of the witnesses
we heard from was Border Patrol Chief
Carla Provost, who leads the dedicated
law enforcement officers who safeguard
our Nation’s borders every day. She has
been with the Border Patrol for 25
years, and she has witnessed firsthand
the ebb and flow of border crossings
during that entire quarter century.
Chief Provost announced the most re-
cent data that shows how dire the situ-
ation along our southern border is. She
described these numbers as off the
charts, which I think is a gentle way of
putting it.
Before I get to the numbers, let me
provide some context. In October 2018,
the start of the fiscal year, Customs
and Border Protection encountered
nearly 61,000 migrants at the border.
That is higher than any month in the
previous fiscal year. At the time, we
were all alarmed by the increase, but
last month’s numbers completely
eclipsed those levels. Chief Provost an-
nounced at our hearing yesterday that
in the month of April, CBP encoun-
tered more than 109,000 illegal immi-
grants along the southern border.
From October to April, we jumped from
roughly 61,000 to 109,000 per month, a
78-percent increase over just the 6-
month period.
In addition to that enormous month-
ly total, she told us about the record-
breaking daily total last week. Border
Patrol apprehended 5,200 people in a
single day—the highest number on
record. The problem is that we can’t
simply send these migrants home
under the current state of the law. So
the more individuals we apprehend, the
more detention space we need. If we
don’t have the detention space, these
individuals would simply just be re-
leased into the American population.
We will never hear from most of them
again, unless they commit some other
crime.
But the fact of the matter is, we are
overtaxing the capabilities of the Bor-
der Patrol, of Customs and Border Pro-
tection, of the local communities, and
of the nongovernmental organizations
that try to assist these migrants while
they are in our country and in our cus-
tody. On certain days over the last
month, CBP has had more than 14,000
people in custody, far greater than the
capacity they are able to hold.
People may ask: Why do we have to
detain people? Why can’t we just let
them go and tell them to show back up
for a future court date?
We know from sad experience that
the majority will not return for that
court date, even if they have legiti-
mate claims for asylum. We now know
that there are more than 700,000—I
think approaching 800,000—backlog im-
migration cases waiting to be heard by
an immigration judge. This, again, is
overwhelming our capacity to deal
with these on an individual basis.
Back to the numbers, earlier this
week the Rio Grande Valley Sector an-
nounced that their stations and proc-
essing centers were holding more than
7,000 illegal immigrants, and that is
just one Border Patrol sector. In a re-
cent television interview, Acting DHS
Secretary Kevin McAleenan accurately
described these facilities as being simi-
lar to police stations. Suffice it to say
that CBP does not have the facilities or
resources to manage that many people
in a police station-like environment.
If you think that sounds pretty grim,
just wait because it gets worse. We
aren’t only overwhelmed by the num-
ber of individuals coming across the
border but by the types of people who
are arriving. I am talking about chil-
dren and families who are mostly from
Central America. We were told that, all
told, Border Patrol encounters, in a
given year, individuals from 140 dif-
ferent countries.
Since the criminal organizations that
smuggle people into the United States
are open for business, they are more
than happy to take a Bangladeshi, a
Yemeni, somebody from Iraq or from
Afghanistan or, for that matter, from
Iran and bring them across the border
into the United States.
When our detention facilities were
built, they were designed to hold single
adults for a short duration, which used
to account for the majority of people
apprehended. That is simply not the
case anymore. The human smugglers
and criminal organizations that charge
$5,000, $6,000, $7,000 a head to bring peo-
ple into the United States have studied
our laws and have learned how to ex-
ploit the loopholes and the gaps. That

is why the composition of these mi-
grants has changed so much over the
years from single adults to children
and to families.
In April, 68 percent of those appre-
hended were either families or unac-
companied children. This has put the
Border Patrol in a very awkward posi-
tion. Chief Provost noticed that her
agents were spending now about 40 per-
cent of their time processing migrants
and providing care and transportation.
She had a picture—a chart—that she
demonstrated with a Border Patrol
agent nursing a baby with a bottle and
another Border Patrol agent cradling
an infant in his arms. In other words,
instead of being on the frontlines
against illegal drugs coming across our
border—which contributed to the
deaths of 70,000 Americans last year
alone and where 90 percent of the her-
oin and synthetic opioids known as
fentanyl come principally from Mex-
ico—instead of fighting that scourge
and stopping that poison from coming
into the United States, our Border Pa-
trol has now been diverted to being, es-
sentially, a childcare center handing
out juice boxes and diapers. They
aren’t processing or stopping illegal
immigrants or the human traffickers.
Trying to deal with these record high
numbers, we know that the numbers of
people coming across are far exceeding
the resources available for the Border
Patrol. With so many more people to
process and more manpower needed,
the Border Patrol has been taken off
the line, leaving areas of the border
vulnerable to exploitation by human
smugglers and drug cartels.
Think about it. If you are a leader of
a drug cartel trying to move heroin,
methamphetamine, fentanyl, or other
illegal drugs into the United States,
why wouldn’t you try to flood the Bor-
der Patrol with children and families
so they would be taken off the line and
distracted to take care of these indi-
viduals, as opposed to stopping those
drugs? Of course, this is part of a larger
plan.
Unfortunately, the Congress is doing
little, if anything, about it. I don’t
think it takes an expert to see that
things are bad, and I hope my col-
leagues can recognize that we need to
act before they get worse. This is a
problem that the President can’t solve
on his own and the Border Patrol can’t
solve on its own. This is about the
legal authorities that the U.S. Govern-
ment has to deal with this chaos and
this humanitarian crisis at our own
border. It takes a change in laws
passed by Congress. So we must act on
a bipartisan and bicameral basis to re-
spond or this is going to get worse and
worse.
Yesterday Chief Provost compared
the current situation to holding a
bucket under a faucet. It doesn’t mat-
ter how many buckets you have if you
never turn the water off. Well, that is
what we need to do—stop the flow of
people trying to enter our country ille-
gally.
Last week, Congressman HENRY
CUELLAR—my friend, a Democrat from
Laredo, TX—and I introduced a bill
called the HUMANE Act, which would
at least slow that faucet to a drip and
provide serious relief for the personnel
who serve along the border. It focuses
on the problems posed by high numbers
of unaccompanied children and fami-
lies, whom we do not have the capacity
to adequately care for. It requires the
Department of Homeland Security to
keep families together through court
proceedings—something we all should
agree to—and provides safeguards to
prevent children from being placed in
the custody of dangerous individuals—
sex offenders, human traffickers, and
the like.
It also requires the Department of
Homeland Security to establish re-
gional processing centers in high traf-
fic areas and to improve the processing
of humanitarian relief claims by re-
quiring those to be processed at ports
of entry.
Finally, it mandates the hiring of 600
new CBP personnel to alleviate the per-
sonnel strain and get more of these
highly trained men and women back on
the frontlines. I hope we will have the
opportunity to review this legislation
soon in the Judiciary Committee.
Chairman GRAHAM has told me he is
willing to do that, and I hope our
friends in the House will take it up
soon.
America would never think of send-
ing our men and women in the military
to war without providing them the
training, the equipment, and the sup-
port they need in order to fight and
win our Nation’s wars. Yet somehow we
have sent the Border Patrol into a bat-
tle that is designed for failure. They
simply don’t have the numbers. They
don’t have the resources. We don’t have
the facilities in order to deal with this.
We can’t just try to staunch the flow
while it gets worse and worse and
worse and worse. Instead of putting an-
other bucket under the faucet as it
runs wide open, we need to turn that
faucet off, and the only way we can do
that is by Congress acting. It is on us,
and we must act and act soon.
I yield the floor.

PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise
in celebration of Public Service Rec-
ognition Week, a time to honor public
servants at all levels of government for
their dedication and outstanding serv-
ice to this Nation. Since 2010, I have
taken to the Senate floor to honor our
particularly noteworthy government
employees—a tradition that was first
begun by my good friend Senator Ted
Kaufman.
Today and during this week, I would
like to continue this tradition by high-
lighting the contributions of three Vir-
ginians who have worked tirelessly to
improve the functioning of our govern-
ment and advance America’s interests
at home and abroad.
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL KOZAK
Mr. President, I would like to first
recognize Ambassador Michael Kozak
from Arlington. Ambassador Kozak
currently serves as Senior Bureau Offi-
cial at the State Department’s Bureau
of Democracy, Human Rights, and
Labor. When I first read this, I did a
double-take because Ambassador
Kozak’s remarkable career at State
spans 47 years and nine Presidents.
Throughout his accomplished career,
Ambassador Kozak has been a steadfast
advocate for democracy and human
rights abroad, serving at the forefront
of many historical negotiations. Dur-
ing the seventies and eighties, he
played a key role in negotiating the
Panama Canal and Egypt-Israel peace
treaties. In the 1990s, as chief of mis-
sion in Havana, he led the talks with
senior officials from Fidel Castro’s re-
gime in Cuba before his appointment as
Ambassador to Belarus.
Throughout his career, Ambassador
Kozak has worked to combat anti-Sem-
itism and promote human rights, and
his work has been instrumental to pro-
moting global peace and U.S. interests
abroad.
Thank you, Ambassador Kozak.
TRIBUTE TO KARA DE CASTRO
Mr. President, next I would like to
recognize Kara De Castro from
Haymarket, VA. Through her work at
the National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration, Ms. De Castro has led crucial
programs to reduce one of our Nation’s
most significant national security
threats—nuclear proliferation. Ms. De
Castro has been instrumental in devel-
oping a ‘‘nuclear security culture’’ that
is focused on the proper handling and
use of nuclear materials. She is an
Army veteran, and the Russian lan-
guage training she received in the mili-
tary has been put to good use through
her work in the former Soviet Union.
These efforts have led to the down-
grading of 17 metric tons of highly en-
riched uranium, the equivalent of 446
nuclear weapons.
I thank Ms. De Castro for making the
world a safer place.
TRIBUTE TO JOHN WAGNER
Finally, Mr. President, I want to rec-
ognize John Wagner from Ashburn,
who serves as Deputy Executive Assist-
ant Commissioner of the U.S. Customs
and Border Protection. For those of
you who might actually follow some of
this and are keeping score at home,
John’s name might sound familiar. He
has been recognized before, including
by me on this floor, for strengthening
the passport control process through
the Global Entry Trusted Traveler Pro-
gram and the Automated Passport Con-
trol Program, which are widely famil-
iar to many international travelers.
That alone would have been enough to
gain recognition and be good enough
for a whole career.
Since then, John has spearheaded fa-
cial recognition systems at several
major U.S. airports, which offer a fast
and paperless method of screening in-
coming and outgoing travelers. To

date, the software has identified 45
fraudulent travel documents and ap-
proximately 7,000 visa overstays.
These innovative processes conceived
by Mr. Wagner have increased the effi-
ciency, minimized costs, and allowed
CBP officers to focus on keeping our
country safe.
I hope my colleagues will join me in
congratulating Ambassador Kozak, Ms.
De Castro, and Mr. Wagner and thank-
ing them for their great work.
FEDERAL WORKERS
In closing, Mr. President, I am going
to say a few words about the way our
Federal workers have been treated, un-
fortunately, during this administra-
tion. The truth is, the service of Fed-
eral workers like Ambassador Kozak,
Ms. De Castro, and Mr. Wagner have
not been honored by the President. In-
stead of appreciation, our Federal em-
ployees have too often faced complete
disrespect in the form of pay freezes,
hostile Executive orders, and of course
the President’s own disastrous govern-
ment shutdown. During that 35-day,
self-inflicted crisis, thousands of Fed-
eral workers went without pay. It is
true that after we reopened they got
that backpay, but during that tenure
when they couldn’t make their bills,
oftentimes folks had to get out of
daycare and couldn’t get to the doctor.
The stories we heard were remarkable.
One survey found that more than half
of all Federal workers dipped into sav-
ings to make ends meet. Those who
weren’t furloughed workers worked
long hours in stressful and thinly
staffed circumstances for weeks on end.
Candidly, I fear that the President’s
efforts to antagonize the Federal work-
force is discouraging the best and
brightest from serving in our govern-
ment—at a time when nearly one-third
of our Federal workers are nearing re-
tirement age. This is wrong; it is
unsustainable; and as a former CEO,
these are just not good business prac-
tices, as well as the taxpayers will suf-
fer from the consequences of this Presi-
dent’s actions.
Our public servants are not bar-
gaining chips. They are not faceless bu-
reaucrats. They are our fellow Ameri-
cans who dedicate their lives to serving
their country, to protecting its people,
and to making sure our tax dollars are
properly spent.
Finally, I want to say, again, thank
you to all our Federal workers. You de-
serve much better than what you have
had the last couple of years. I will con-
tinue fighting in the Senate to protect
your pay, your benefits, and your abil-
ity to continue to focus on what you
signed up for—serving our country and
its people.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO MIKE HACKLEY AND RECOGNIZING
BBQGUYS
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise
as a Member of the U.S. Senate Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entre-
preneurship to highlight a veteran-
owned Louisiana business that is a true
success story. With me today is my col-
league from my office, Ms. Cassie
Leonard.
We all know small businesses are how
many Americans live the American
dream. They start small; they start
with a passion; they create jobs; and
then they help us compete globally in
America and spark innovation. These
American small business owners are
often our friends. They are often our
neighbors.
They succeed through the hard work
of entrepreneurs like Mr. Mike
Hackley of Baton Rouge. I am talking
about Mike and his business BBQGuys
because it is National Small Business
Week and because BBQGuys was named
Senate Small Business of the Week just
last week.
Mike has served our country in many
ways. He has served our country in the
Air Force for more than 10 years. Once
his military career ended, he worked in
a number of different sectors. Like a
lot of Louisianans, Mike loves the out-
doors. In Louisiana, we will barbecue
no matter how hot it gets outside.
Mike turned his passion into a pro-
fession, and he did it by starting an
outdoor business called The Grill Store
& More.
Early on, being the perceptive busi-
ness person he is, Mike saw an opening
with e-commerce, something we take
for granted today. He launched a
website called www.bbqguys.com, and
he did this in 2001, 18 years ago, when
Americans who did have the internet
were on dial-up connections.
Today, 18 years later, BBQGuys is a
giant in outdoor living online retailers.
Mike now employs nearly 300 workers.
He started with less than 10. That is
the American dream. That is American
success, and BBQGuys continues to
evolve and to grow.
They started designing and manufac-
turing premium barbecue grills, with
manufacturing operations here in the
United States, and they are looking to
export into Europe and Australia.
Mike also remains committed to a
culture of teamwork at BBQGuys.
Every day he makes a point of going
around the office to say good morning
to his employees, and I am not talking
about just to the executives. It is no
wonder Mike has a high employee re-
tention rate, a reputation for out-
standing customer service, and an A-
plus rating from the Better Business
Bureau. BBQGuys has also been named
one of the 5,000 fastest growing busi-
nesses in the United States by Inc.
Magazine for 11 years in a row.
I am proud to stand today before the
U.S. Senate to say I am proud of Mike
Hackley. I am proud of what he has
built. He is realizing the American
dream, and he is creating good jobs for
my State.
Mike, if you are listening, thank you
for making Louisiana proud.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the
quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOLDEN SPIKE
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on May 10,
1869, a golden spike was driven into the
last link joining the rails of the first
transcontinental railroad at Prom-
ontory Summit, UT. Made of 17-carat
gold and driven into a predrilled hole
in the very last ceremonial tie, it bore
the inscription: ‘‘May God continue the
unity of our country as this railroad
unites the two great oceans of the
world.’’ Indeed, it did, with the joining
of the Union Pacific Railroad, stretch-
ing from the Missouri River near the
Iowa-Nebraska border, and the Central
Pacific Railroad, stretching from Sac-
ramento, CA—east met west. The
United States became truly united.
As the spike was struck, a telegraph
was sent around the Nation, and bells
rang out from coast to coast. This mo-
ment, you see, gave lots of people
throughout the United States and lots
of people in my State of Utah in par-
ticular access to what they needed to
grow, to thrive, to prosper, to feed
their families; that is, access to other
people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2764 May 9, 2019
Throughout the history of humanity,
people have needed access to other peo-
ple. That is why great civilizations
have sprung up along great rivers and
in areas where they had access to an
ocean port. It is one of the reasons
why, throughout much of history, peo-
ple in land-locked regions of any coun-
try, including our own, very often have
a hard time making a living. The intro-
duction of the railroad started to help
to change that.
Tomorrow marks the 150th anniver-
sary of this pivotal moment, and so it
is only right that we pause for just a
minute to recognize it, for this was a
moment that changed the course of
history in Utah and in our Nation and
ultimately the entire world. With the
driving of that golden spike, the ardu-
ous 6-month journey that used to be re-
quired to cross the country—costing
$1,000—had become a mere 10-day trip
costing only $150.
Thousands of miles of tracks were
laid across the country, allowing peo-
ple to migrate west and to establish
new settlements far more quickly,
safely, and easily. It transformed the
economy across Utah and throughout
the Nation. Goods became efficiently
transported across much farther dis-
tances. Settlers found new markets,
and buyers on the frontier and in rural
areas were able to purchase items that
had previously been completely un-
available to them in some cases or at
least very difficult to obtain. It spurred
a boon in communications, commerce,
agriculture, construction, and mining.
It started a significant new chapter in
our relationship with Asia and the Pa-
cific region, and it served as a model of
innovation and prosperity for the rest
of the world.
All of this came about, it is impor-
tant to note, from the perseverance
and efforts of many different people
from different walks of life working to-
gether. It required a clear-eyed vision
from President Lincoln and the Federal
Government and a fruitful private-pub-
lic partnership that allowed the engi-
neers, railroad companies, and local
communities the freedom to do their
jobs and to do them well and without
undo interference. It would not have
been possible without the work of the
Chinese, Irish, Mormons, Civil War vet-
erans, Native Americans, and countless
other laborers who toiled so long and
so hard with such a clear devotion to
build these railroads.
Most of this is, of course, in the his-
tory books, as well it ought to be. Most
of us have a sense of the enormous
achievement this moment represented
some 150 years ago tomorrow, of the
great impact it had on our Nation and
the legacy it has left behind for us and
for our posterity. But what we often do
not know are some of the stories of the
ordinary men and women behind these
achievements and the ones who have
worked so hard to preserve this great
legacy. There are, in fact, hidden he-
roes who make history and unseen ef-
forts of people who worked so hard to
keep that history alive. The doors of
history sometimes turn on small and
often unseen hinges, and so I would
like to take a moment to honor a few
of those people today who helped move
history forward.
Some of us might know the name of
Theodore Judah—a railroad and civil
engineer who was key to the original
idea and design of connecting these
railroads and who advocated for the so-
called Central Route for the first trans-
continental railroad, the Central Route
marked in red in this picture. But less
familiar is the name of Theodore’s
wife, Anna Judah.
While many routes were surveyed as
possible paths for the railroad, Theo-
dore Judah had an often-scoffed-at
dream of laying rails through the
mountains of the Sierra Nevada, from
California going eastward. Anna Judah
shared Theodore’s dream of connecting
the first transcontinental railroad.
When Theodore hiked and surveyed the
Sierra Nevadas, Anna hiked and
worked right alongside of him. She
sketched and did water colors and even
oil paintings of the terrain, plants, and
the foliage. She gathered and labeled
the various fossils and minerals. She
took copious notes all the while, tak-
ing into account different things she
and her husband observed as they were
traveling.
After their time in the Sierra Ne-
vadas, Theodore and Anna, like
Brigham Young, knew: This is the
place. Together they fell in love with
the idea of the railroad taking the Cen-
tral Route across the Sierra Nevadas,
believing that it would provide the per-
fect path for what they wanted to ac-
complish. So they began traveling back
and forth from California, dedicating
their efforts to lobbying for their
dream in Washington.
Anna was sharp, charming, tena-
cious, and undoubtedly she was Theo-
dore’s biggest booster. She had the idea
to display an exhibit right here in the
Capitol showcasing her notes and her
clippings from their travels in the area,
her drawings and her paintings, sam-
ples of mineral and ore she had col-
lected, and charts and graphs that she
was able to present in a way that made
them understandable to laymen, that
helped other people understand why
this area was so important and the sig-
nificant role it could play in our Na-
tion’s development.
Literally hundreds of Senators, Con-
gressmen, lobbyists, and government
clerks visited her display, which helped
convince the eastern legislators of the
beauty of the western mountains—
which many of them had never seen or
at least not experienced anything like
the way she had—and turned their
hearts to the possibility of building a
railroad over them and through them
to unite a country.
Ultimately, Congress was per-
suaded—to everyone’s benefit—to
choose Judah’s proposal for the Central
Route and did so in large part because
of Anna Judah’s efforts.
Tragically, Anna’s husband Theodore
contracted yellow fever. As a result, he
died before seeing the railroad com-
pleted and, in fact, even before the
project was started in earnest. But
Anna lived to see their dream to fru-
ition. In fact, the driving of the last
spike took place on what would have
been the couple’s 22nd wedding anni-
versary. On the date of the ceremony,
Anna visited her husband’s grave, and
she wrote that there her husband’s
spirit—so long dedicated to the rail-
road—felt somehow near to her once
again.
Years later, another young woman
fell in love with the history of the
Golden Spike and the beginning of the
first transcontinental railroad. Bernice
Gibbs Anderson, known to some as the
Mother of the Golden Spike, was born
in Colorado in 1900 and lived the major-
ity of her life in Corinne, UT.
As a little girl, Bernice helped trail
cattle near Promontory Summit and
grew up hearing cowboy stories around
the campfire, including stories about
the Golden Spike, and, as her grand-
daughter put it, ‘‘She just plain fell in
love with it.’’ From the time she was 19
up until the moment of her death, she
tirelessly dedicated her life to recog-
nizing and preserving the history sur-
rounding Golden Spike.
Bernice conceived the idea that the
area around Promontory Summit
ought to be set aside to commemorate
the completion of the transcontinental
railroad. For years, she campaigned to
make Promontory Summit a national
historic monument.
She visited countless legislators,
Governors, commissioners, and rail-
road officers to raise support and raise
funds for a monument at Promontory
Summit.
A mother of six children, she also
worked as a correspondent and as a
staff writer for the Salt Lake Tribune,
where she wrote historic articles and
poetry about the Golden Spike. She
sent letters and invitations to Mem-
bers of Congress, U.S. Presidents, and
Park Service officials—all in hopes
that they might come to recognize the
importance of the site.
As President of the Golden Spike As-
sociation, she coordinated reenactment
ceremonies and anniversary programs,
encouraging local communities to par-
ticipate in those celebrations every
year. While some viewed her mission as
somewhat unimportant—or, at least,
less important than other things—and,
therefore, dismissed her efforts, she
never gave up.
Thankfully, Bernice lived to see the
fruits of her labors. After years of de-
voting her life to this case, Prom-
ontory Summit was declared a national
historic site on July 30, 1965. Just this
past March, it was redesignated as a
national historic park—the first in
Utah—allowing even more of the rail-
road and the surrounding area to be
preserved for history going forward.
Fast forward to 2019. We now reached
the 150th anniversary of the Golden

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2765
May 9, 2019
Spike. Today, another dedicated
woman has been behind its sesqui-
centennial celebration, Spike 150.
Aimee McConkie, carrying the banner
previously carried by Anna Judah and
Bernice Gibbs Anderson, has been a
driving force in our State and in her
community. A BYU graduate, a wife,
and mother of four daughters, Aimee
has worked for 15 years in professional
association management.
In 2005 she founded Utah Venture
Outdoors, a summer festival series in
Millcreek, UT. For 14 years, she volun-
teered her time and her resources to
this event, seeking to bring the com-
munity together through recreational
opportunities.
In 2017 she also launched LABELED,
a 4-day film festival that seeks to
break the stigma around mental health
issues. Now she has once again brought
her community together for an impor-
tant cause—this time, to celebrate and
commemorate the 150th anniversary of
the Golden Spike.
Under her leadership as director of
Spike 150, there are events taking place
not only around Promontory Summit
but also around the entire State of
Utah—events to highlight the history
and legacy of the Golden Spike, events
for children and families, and events
for music, art, and train enthusiasts.
It has taken tremendous amounts of
organization, coordination, and perse-
verance, and it would no doubt make
Bernice Gibbs Anderson proud. At the
1957 celebration of the Golden Spike,
she said:
This is sacred soil, dedicated to the sac-
rifices of the thousands who labored in the
great race to build the first transcontinental
railway in the shortest possible time. . . .
The destiny of this nation rode triumphant
upon the rails that met at Promontory Sta-
tion! The future of this site depends on you,
my friends. Will it take its rightful place in
the heritage and traditions of America . . .
or will it remain desolate and forgotten to
sink into oblivion[?]
Thanks to the work of people like
Aimee McConkie, we know that the
Golden Spike will not sink into obliv-
ion but will indeed take its rightful
place in history.
Anna Judah, Bernice Gibbs Anderson,
and Aimee McConkie might have lived
at different times, but there is a com-
mon thread that runs throughout their
stories: the triumph of ordinary people,
of the hidden heroes behind so many of
our great achievements in history.
Without the work of these ordinary
Americans and Utahns, we never could
have achieved one of the most trans-
formative events in our Nation thus
far: the driving of the Golden Spike
and the completion of the first trans-
continental railroad. And without the
work of these hidden heroes, we could
never reasonably hope and expect to be
able to keep this legacy alive.
It is our task now to take up the ban-
ner that these women have carried—
the banner of innovation, perseverance,
and unity—and to ensure that our re-
markable heritage lives on. If we do,
there is no telling what Utah and our

Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
BRAUN). The Senator from Tennessee.
BORDER SECURITY
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
wanted to spend just a few minutes
today speaking with my colleagues and
also with Tennesseans about an issue
that we hear so very much about every
single day. The issue continues to per-
sist. It is our border, and we all know—
and, indeed, you read in news count
after news count—that yes, indeed,
there is a crisis at our border.
Just a few months ago, we had some
of our friends who are in the other
Chamber who kept saying: Oh, this is
manufactured; oh, there is nothing to
it.
But as we hear from law enforcement
professionals, as we hear from ICE,
from DHS, and from the Border Patrol,
we have a crisis. Our border is strained
to the breaking point.
The real humanitarian crisis at the
border is escalating. There are people
who are being brought in through Cen-
tral America, through Mexico, and
they are stranded in the desert without
food and without water. During the
summer, sometimes you have tempera-
tures above 100 degrees.
Our border is at a breaking point,
and it is, indeed, time for this body to
do something about it and to support
these Agencies that are on the front-
line dealing with this crisis every sin-
gle day.
What we know from our hearing that
we held yesterday at the Senate Judici-
ary Committee is that ICE is facing
mounting challenges when it comes to
expediting the deportations that need
to take place. Abuse and exploitation
of the asylum process overburdens our
court system as illegal immigrants
flood our borders claiming persecution.
Our country historically welcomes
people who are fleeing political perse-
cution, but there have to be tighter
rules on these asylum seekers. The per-
centage of those who have valid asylum
claims is actually relatively low com-
pared to the number who are applying
for these protections. I will tell you
that I welcome President Trump’s
moves to raise the standards.
Last week, the President directed the
Department of Homeland Security to
enact several new asylum changes. As
part of these new policies, the Presi-
dent imposed a new deadline for the
immigration courts to meet. He di-
rected that cases in immigration
courts be settled within 180 days of
those being filed.
Tennesseans want to see government
accountability. They want to see it
across every Agency. Certainly, when
it comes to immigration policy, they
want this accountability. They know
that with a 6-month deadline, it is ex-
actly the kind of accountability that is
needed.
Here is the problem that ICE is fac-
ing when it comes to meeting that 180-
day standard. Right now, as of yester-
day at our hearing, they had more than
800,000 cases that were pending. Think
about that. Your court system has
800,000 cases that are pending. There
are exactly 400 immigration judges
that are there to hear these 800,000
cases. Do the math on that. Think
about how many cases that would be.
It is a 2-year wait at this point to get
the case heard. So ICE needs additional
judges. That means they need addi-
tional officers, and that means they
need additional funding in order to
meet the load.
I asked Director Asher how long it
would take them to ramp up in order
to be able to hear these 800,000 cases.
She said: months, maybe a year, maybe
a little bit longer. It depends on when
they get the authorization to expand
the court system. It depends on when
they get the funding for it.
All of this time, what continues to
happen? Cases continue to be piled
onto that backlog. If we took action
today, and if we approved their ability
to expand their capacity to have more
judges, to have more agents, to have
more officers, and to have more re-
sources, it would be a year by the time
we worked through this process. It
might be as many as 1.5 million cases
that they are working on.
This is one of the reasons that it is
imperative that we close some of the
loopholes that are being used in the
asylum process and work through clos-
ing these loopholes to help secure this
border. It is something that would be
of assistance to those who are trying to
meet the need that is there from people
crushing our border, putting that foot
on American soil, and claiming asylum
and persecution.
Another thing we talked about in
yesterday’s hearing is trafficking. We
all know that cartels are big business.
Cartels deal in trafficking drugs. They
deal in trafficking human beings,
which is disgusting, and they look at
human beings to move them for labor
trafficking, for sex trafficking, and for
gangs. They look at that as part of
their business.
I know Senator CRUZ talked about
his EL CHAPO Act, which would allow
those seized assets from these drug
lords to be used to help pay to secure
that border, because stopping this traf-
ficking is something that is an impera-
tive. It really is true that until we se-
cure this southern border every town
is, in essence, a border town and every
State is a border State because illegal
immigration no longer is a problem
that is confined to those States that
are on the border. We see this all
across our country, and it is heart-
breaking—you talk about the traf-
ficking of human beings, the sex traf-
ficking, and the effect that has on
girls, when you talk about the drug
trafficking and the heartbreaking ef-
fects that has on families in every sin-
gle one of our communities. Opioids,
fentanyl, heroin—we all see it.
God bless our local law enforcement.
Next week we are going to honor our

law enforcement, but God bless them
for the work they do in our commu-
nities. Here is a good example. Just
this past January, our Customs and
Border Patrol seized the largest
amount of fentanyl in the agency’s his-
tory ever—largest amount. They seized
nearly 254 pounds of fentanyl from a
Mexican national trying to enter the
United States. It was enough to kill
more than 115 million people. That is
the volume that 1 person was bringing
over—enough fentanyl to kill 115 mil-
lion people. This is why we have to
make certain we secure that border.
As I mentioned, the trafficking of
human beings is taking place. Another
of the problems is that many adult
sponsors who are seeking custody of
children are here illegally themselves.
The traffickers have adults grab a
child; they are coming to the border.
The child is then transferred to some-
one else in the country, and that indi-
vidual is here illegally. It is difficult to
find out how that child is connected to
the adult they are taken to. Sometimes
it could be a labor gang. Sometimes it
could be a prostitution ring. We don’t
know. I commend the Departments of
Homeland Security and Health and
Human Services, which are taking
steps to close a big loophole here. Last
April, the two agencies entered into an
agreement to ensure that relatives of
these children are not above the law.
Under the agreement, DHS and HHS
promised to share information about
these adult sponsors so that ICE can
run criminal and immigration back-
ground checks on them. This agree-
ment is a powerful tool in the fight to
stop trafficking of migrant children.
So long as law enforcement can keep
running these criminal background
checks on these sponsors, we can hold
more adults accountable and keep
these children safe.
Finally, I want to touch on the wall
because Border Patrol Chief Provost
told me during the hearing yesterday
that the wall was working. The San
Diego sector has 14 miles of the new
double fencing that has been approved
by Congress. It is the first of the sec-
tions of the new wall. Previously, some
of the old walls were 6 feet high, and
they were made out of landing mats,
and they were not successful in deter-
ring illegal entry. The new walls are 30
feet high, and they stand on steel
bollards. The barrier is making it
tougher for illegal immigrants to
sneak across, and it is helping our
agents. Our agents have told us repeat-
edly—not for the last few months or
the last couple of years but, get this,
for 20 years—for 20 years, they have
said we need three things: We need a
barrier; we need better technology; and
we need more agents and officers on
the ground.
These men and women deserve our
best efforts, and we should be giving
them what they need. Our immigration
system is full of legal loopholes and
physical vulnerabilities. I applaud the
President’s new asylum changes, and I
urge each of my colleagues to support
law enforcement’s needs. They are con-
sistent in asking for these three
things—barriers, technology, and
agents. This is what they need in order
to help keep our Nation safe.
So as we consider how much we value
our safe communities, how much we
want our communities to be safe and
happy and prosperous, I encourage each
of us to think about these agents who
are working to protect that southern
border, to deal with human trafficking,
to deal with sex trafficking, and to
keep illegal drugs off our streets.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

VOTE EXPLANATION
∑ Ms. HARRIS. Mr. President, I was

present, would have voted no on roll-
call vote No. 117, the confirmation of
Michael H. Park, of New York, to be
United States Circuit Judge for the
Second Circuit.∑
f
NOMINATIONS
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President,
today I wish to express my opposition
to recent nominees who have come be-
fore the Senate.
First, I would like to express my op-
position to the nomination of Janet
Dhillon, who was confirmed to serve as
Chair of the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission, EEOC, by a party
line vote yesterday. The EEOC has a
critical mission to enforce the Federal
laws that make it illegal to discrimi-
nate against workers on the basis of
their race, religion, national origin, or
disability, and it was the first Federal
agency to take the position that title
VII of the Civil Rights Act protects
employees from workplace discrimina-
tion based on their sexual orientation.
Like many of my colleagues, I am con-
cerned that Ms. Dhillon has refused to
commit to uphold the EEOC’s current
interpretation of title VII as covering
LGBTQ workers. I am also concerned
by arguments that were made in legal
briefs by the Retail Litigation Center
under Ms. Dhillon’s leadership, includ-
ing arguments in support of policies to
make it more difficult for employers to
be held liable for harassment. It is for
these reasons that I would not have
voted in support of Ms. Dhillon’ s nom-
ination.
I also want to comment on my oppo-
sition to Cheryl Stanton’s nomination
to serve as Administrator of the Wage
and Hour Division at the Department
of Labor. Before Ms. Stanton’s nomina-
tion, she served as executive director of
the South Carolina Department of Em-
ployment and Workforce, in which ca-
pacity she garnished wages to collect
unemployment insurance overpay-
ments and had a public dispute with a
staff member who refused to institute a
personnel action after raising ethical
objections. I voted against invoking
cloture on Ms. Stanton’s nomination
and would have voted against her con-
firmation.
Finally, I want to address the nomi-
nation of Joseph Bianco for the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, which I opposed in the Judici-
ary Committee due to concerns regard-
ing his record on such critical issues as
privacy and civil liberties. I am also
concerned that the Senate advanced
Judge Bianco’s nomination even
though neither home State Senator re-
turned a positive blue slip.
Thank you.
f
CONFIRMATION OF JANET
DHILLON
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
opposed the confirmation of Janet
Dhillon to Chair the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission. The
EEOC is an independent Federal agen-
cy with an absolutely vital mission: en-
forcing Federal laws against employ-
ment discrimination. But Ms. Dhillon
has spent her career protecting cor-
porations that are accused of discrimi-
nation by their workers.
As a leader of the Retail Litigation
Center, she advocated legal positions
designed to undermine workplace pro-
tections, especially low-income women
and women of color.
The Retail Litigation Center helped
defend Walmart against wage discrimi-
nation claims filed by 1.6 million
women who worked at Walmart. In
doing so, they managed to convince the
Supreme Court to raise the legal bar-
riers for all workers to bring discrimi-
nation claims.
In a different case, this one involving
racial harassment against an African-
American woman, the Retail Litiga-
tion Center convinced the Supreme
Court to narrow the legal definition of
a supervisor. This means that workers
are now less able to hold their employ-
ers accountable for workplace harass-
ment.
Both of these were 5–4 decisions that
were supported by only the Republican
Justices on the Supreme Court.
All workers need an EEOC that is
looking out for them, but Ms. Dhillon’s
nomination to Chair the EEOC is yet
another way that the Trump adminis-
tration keeps rigging the system for

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES
STAFF SERGEANT CHRISTOPHER SLUTMAN
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I
wish to pay tribute to an American
hero and patriot who was taken from
us far too soon. Earlier this month, I
was standing in the flight line at the
Dover Air Force Base alongside Con-
gresswoman LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER
and Senator CHRIS COONS. We were
there to receive the remains of three
marines killed in action on April 8,
2019, when a roadside bomb went off in
Afghanistan. Two of the
servicemembers killed were Active
Duty: Cpl Robert A. Hendriks, of Long
Island, NY, and SSgt Benjamin S.
Hines of York County, PA.
There was a third: SSgt Christopher
Slutman, a Reservist, a 15-year mem-
ber of the New York City Fire Depart-
ment, and a Delawarean. The 43-year-
old U.S. Marine was also a loving hus-
band to his wife Shannon and father to
three daughters: McKenna, Kenley, and
Weslynn. In life and in death, Staff
Sergeant Slutman epitomized the best
of America. He selflessly put his life on
the line to protect and serve his coun-
try and his community.
It was Winston Churchill who once
said, ‘‘The reservist is twice the cit-
izen.’’ By that measure, Christopher
Slutman was three times the citizen.
He wore two uniforms in service to our
Nation. He was staff sergeant in the
U.S. Marines, serving in the 25th Ma-
rine Regiment, Fourth Marine Division
in the Marine Forces Reserve, based in
Harrisburg, PA. He was also a deco-
rated 15-year veteran of the New York
City Fire Department.
Friends say that Christopher always
dreamed of being a firefighter. He grew
up in Maryland and graduated from
Frederick Douglass High Schoo1, where
he played football, baseball, and wres-
tled and achieved Eagle Scout status.
Eventually, he volunteered with fire
departments in Maryland and Wash-
ington, DC. Most recently, he split his
time between the Bronx and Wil-
mington, DE. Most days, I ride down to
Washington, DC, from my home in Wil-
mington to do my job. Staff Sergeant
Slutman took the train the opposite di-
rection to do his job. He so wanted to
serve that he would travel from his
home in Delaware to Ladder Company
27 in New York City. In fact, he was on
military leave from Ladder Company
27 and nearing the end of his most re-
cent deployment with the Marine Re-
serves in Afghanistan when he and two
comrades lost their lives.
It was Slutman’s work in the Bronx
where, in 2014, he won the Fire Chiefs
Association Memorial Medal for res-
cuing an unconscious woman from the
seventh floor of a high-rise apartment
building.
Scripture tells us in John 15:13,
‘‘Greater love has no one than this: to
lay down one’s life for one’s friends.’’
Staff Sergeant Slutman lived that kind
of profound love: dedicating his life to
serving others, even at his own peril,
and it seems that this kind of selfless-
ness and devotion to service was a hall-
mark of the Slutman household. Staff
Sergeant Slutman is survived by three
brothers. One of his brothers is in the
Marines, another in the Army. The
third is a firefighter in Washington,
DC. Their father is an Army veteran
and was a volunteer firefighter, as was
Slutman’s mother. Here is a family
who has, and continues to, truly give of
themselves in service of others.
Last Friday, I was honored to have
been able to join Staff Sergeant
Slutman’s family, friends, and fellow
servicemembers in New York City to
pay our respects to a man who gave his
life for this country. The first speaker
at his funeral was Marine SgtMaj
Christopher Armstrong, who served
alongside his friend Chris for 8 years.
Armstrong remembered his friend with
these words. He said, ‘‘Upon joining the
unit, I began observing the Marines;
who they watched, how they looked at
their leaders, and what they said.
There were a small number of men that
when they spoke, silence fell; when
they issued an order, the response was
immediate; and when they were looked
upon, it was with reverence. Chris-
topher Slutman immediately stood out
as a leader who was respected and ad-
mired. He didn’t pound his chest, he
didn’t try to impress or go on about
what he was going to do. He just did
it.’’
Armstrong continued. ‘‘He placed his
Marines’ welfare before his own, al-
ways. Chris never sought credit, but he
always gave it.’’
FDNY Commissioner Dan Nigro also
spoke. He described Slutman as ‘‘the
type of American we can all be proud
of.’’ And he added, ‘‘Chris was a pro-
tector of those in danger, a defender to
those who needed him, a rescuer to
those who needed saving, and a leader
who demonstrated his valor on every
tour of duty both here and abroad.’’
It was a poet named Edgar Guest,
who spent his life in Detroit, MI, and
was often referred to as the People’s
Poet, who once said, ‘‘I’d rather see a
sermon than hear one any day.’’ Chris-
topher Slutman’s life was a better les-
son than any sermon. He demonstrated
the absolute best of this country every
day with his heroism and service to
others. The way he lived his life and
gave his life is a language that is clear
to one and all.
It is with a heavy heart that I, along
with the entire First State and the
country, offer our sincerest condo-
lences to his wife Shannon and his
three girls. Their dad is an American
hero. I, along with our Governor, John
Carney, and Delaware’s congressional
delegation, promise you that he won’t
soon be forgotten, and I know that his
legacy lives on in you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2768 May 9, 2019
On the precipice of the American
Civil War, Utah’s delegate to the U.S.
House of Representatives, William
Henry Hooper, recognized that ‘‘A
great band of Union throughout the
family of man is a common interest.’’
Hooper petitioned Congress in his be-
lief that ‘‘a Central Road would unite
that interest as with a chain of iron,
and would effectually hold together our
Federal union with an imperishable
identity of mutual interest.’’
William Henry Hooper’s letter to
Congress would take several months to
reach Washington, DC, as any west-
ward travel beyond the Mississippi
River required wagon, stagecoach, or
horseback.
The U.S. Congress would, however,
approve such an undertaking, and soon,
a National Central Railroad began to
manifest from the worn hands of labor-
ers to execute a vision of national
unity, a feat that would propel Amer-
ican power and change the course of
our history.
These hands belonged to men of dif-
fering national origins and creeds, who
labored together under one banner,
often fleeing significant hardship in
pursuit of economic opportunity in the
American West. Roughly 15,000 Chinese
immigrants, 10,000 Irish immigrants,
and 4,000 Latter-day Saints joined the
national effort to complete the most
remarkable and ambitious engineering
project of the 19th century.
On May 10, 1869, the Union Pacific
and Central Pacific railroads formally
met at Promontory Summit, UT, and
the 17.6-carat golden spike officially
linked the East and West Coasts, mark-
ing a watershed moment for American
trade, commerce, and population.
A 6-month journey across the con-
tinent was reduced to 1 week. Within a
decade of the railroad’s completion,
Salt Lake City’s population more than
doubled, further boosting Utah’s sig-
nificance in the national economy.
Brigham Young recognized the enor-
mous opportunities that global trade
would bring to Utah and the country
and the abundant and yet untapped re-
sources of iron, coal, stone, and timber.
In pursuit of a national railroad
project, Brigham Young recognized
that ‘‘mineral resources of California,
and these mountains, will never be
fully developed to the benefit of the
people of the United States, without
the construction of such a road, and
upon its completion, the entire trade of
China and the East Indies will pass
through the heart of the Union; there-
by giving our Citizens the almost en-
tire controls of the Asiatic and Pacific
trade.’’
Indeed, the Transcontinental Rail-
road would transform the American
economy in profound ways. This
achievement revolutionized commu-
nications, global trade routes, and al-
lowed for the movement of people
across the country at an unprecedented
scale.
On the sesquicentennial of the com-
pletion of the Transcontinental Rail-
road at Promontory Summit, let us re-
member the sacrifice of those laborers
who would not live to see to its conclu-
sion, but whose contributions helped
transform the Nation and the world.
The 150th anniversary of the Golden
Spike is also a celebration of the limit-
less American imagination, spirit of in-
genuity, and industry that made this
incredible project a success.
Let us not forget the example these
pioneers set for us as we go forward in
a new era of challenges and opportuni-
ties.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ZZ TOP
∑ Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I
recognize and congratulate the Texas
blues rock band ZZ Top on their 50th
anniversary. It is only fitting that this
group kicks off their anniversary tour
in their home State of Texas.
With plenty of gas in the tank,
Dusty, Billy, Frank, and the rest of
their crew will be traveling to more
than 60 cities across 14 countries in
their commemorative tour. An appro-
priate reminder of ZZ Top’s history,
this tour clearly shows they have been
able to reach millions of fans across
the globe for decades.
In 1969, two rival blues rock bands in
Houston, TX—Billy’s Moving Side-
walks and Frank and Dusty’s American
Blues—coalesced into one band, ZZ
Top. Two years later, they dropped
their first album, aptly titled, ‘‘ZZ
Top’s First Album.’’
Bandmates Billy Gibbons, Frank
Beard, and Dusty Hill have been writ-
ing songs and creating a musical fusion
between blues and southern rock since
their formation and have never looked
back. Though they draw inspiration
from music greats like Jimi Hendrix,
BB King, Cream, George Jones, and
Texas blues guitarist Freddie King, all
of their influences transform into one
singularly unique sound.
In 1973, the band released its third
album ‘‘Tres Hombres,’’ which cata-
pulted them to the national spotlight
with the hit song ‘‘La Grange,’’ still
one of ZZ Top’s signature songs.
ZZ Top’s momentum and success
built during its first decade culminated
in the legendary 1976 tour entitled the
World Wide Texas Tour, a production
that included a longhorn, a buffalo,
buzzards, rattlesnakes, and a Texas-
shaped stage. If their tour wasn’t proof
enough that things are bigger in Texas,
then maybe their record sales will con-
vince you otherwise.
The band has sold over 50 million
records worldwide, and their 1983
album ‘‘Eliminator,’’ sold more than 10
million copies and included rock hit
‘‘Sharp Dressed Man.’’
‘‘The Little Ol’ Band From Texas’’
has played for millions of fans across
the globe, Sweden to Australia, Japan
to Germany. The band is among a se-
lect few to say they have toured the
globe for half a century.
ZZ Top also lays undisputed claim to
being the longest running major rock
band with the original members intact.
Their iconic beards, powerful rock an-
thems, dedication to music, and im-
pressive artistic talent has sustained
them as a perennial rock power, whose
music will stand the test of time.
Over five decades of creating music,
ZZ Top earned eight Top 40 hits on the
Billboard Hot 100; six No. 1 mainstream
rock hits; and ranked 44th on VH1’s
2000 ‘‘100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists.’’
ZZ Top’s accomplishments through-
out the years culminated in their in-
duction into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame in 2004, where they are recog-
nized as some of the greatest rock art-
ists in the world.

RECOGNIZING BRUNOW
CONTRACTING, LLC
∑ Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, as a
member of the Senate Committee on
Small Business and Entrepreneurship,
it is my privilege to recognize a
woman-owned small business that is
dedicated to its customers, employees,
and community. In honor of the U.S.
Small Business Administration’s Na-
tional Small Business Week, it is my
pleasure to name Brunow Contracting
of Council Bluffs, IA, the Senate Small
Business of the Day.
Brunow Contracting represents the
story of a construction company with
an unlikely founder. Tamara Brunow
was a pre-law student at the College of
Saint Mary who found herself working
in construction. She began her career
with an internship at the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Omaha District, in
military contracting. It was in this
role that she saw a future in construc-
tion and government contracts.
After her time at the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, she proceeded to
work for two other construction orga-
nizations, Oakview Construction and
Lueder Construction. During her ten-
ure with these firms, she realized that
while she loved her jobs, she knew she
wanted to be her own boss. This
prompted her to launch Brunow Con-
tracting in 2008. Shortly after her
launch, Brunow Contracting acquired
its first contract of $1.3 million dollars
to build a Presbyterian church.
Brunow Contracting specializes in
government contracting and is cer-
tified by the Small Business Adminis-
tration as an 8(a) and HUBZone busi-
ness. Brunow Contracting has com-
pleted numerous contracts, ranging in
value from $800 to nearly $5 million,
and a client list which includes the
City of Omaha, the U.S. Forest Service,
the Department of Veterans Affairs,
Southwest Iowa Planning Council, and
the U.S. Coast Guard. These projects
have included everything from church-
es, to water treatment plants, to data
facilities for Facebook.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2769
May 9, 2019
With dedication and determination,
Ms. Brunow, successfully started a con-
struction company as a single mother
of three children in the middle of a re-
cession. Now, she is the owner of one of
the only woman-owned construction
businesses in America, a recipient of
the Midland Business Journal’s 40
under 40, and a leader within her com-
munity. Today, Ms. Brunow has ex-
panded her business reach to include
serving as the head of H2W Apparel, a
women’s active wear company. Addi-
tionally, Ms. Brunow remains an active
mentor for women entrepreneurs and
advocate for female entrepreneurship.
Ms. Brunow embodies what it means
to be an entrepreneur and small busi-
ness owner. Despite those telling her
that it is not the right industry or not
the right time, Brunow Contracting
quickly became a multimillion-dollar
business with an A+ rating from the
Better Business Bureau. Ms. Brunow
showed that, while it certainly is not
easy, it is possible to simultaneously
build a business, be a great mother,
volunteer as a mentor, and remain
committed to your community. It is
my distinct pleasure to honor Ms.
Brunow and the entire team at Brunow
Contracting as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Day. You make Iowa proud,
and I look forward to watching your
continued growth and success.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS
SENATE RESOLUTION 198—CON-
DEMNING BRUNEI’S DRAMATIC
HUMAN RIGHTS BACKSLIDING
Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. YOUNG,
Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr. RUBIO, and Mr. VAN
HOLLEN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 198
Whereas Brunei has been led since 1967 by
one of the world’s longest-reigning absolute
monarchs, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah;
Whereas Brunei gained independence in
1984;
Whereas emergency powers in place in
Brunei since 1962 allow the sultan to govern
with few limitations to his authority;
Whereas, according to the United States
Department of State Brunei 2018 Human
Rights Report, human rights issues included
censorship, interferences with the rights of
peaceful assembly and freedom of associa-
tion, crimes involving violence or threats
targeting homosexuality, and exploitation of
foreign workers, including through forced
labor;
Whereas Brunei’s media are neither free
nor diverse, with broadcasting dominated by
the state and private media owned or con-
trolled by the royal family;
Whereas homosexuality has been illegal in
Brunei, carrying a punishment of up to ten
years in prison;
Whereas in 2013, the Government of Brunei
announced it was imposing new laws that in-
cluded harsher punishments of death by
stoning for adultery and homosexual rela-
tions;
Whereas international condemnation re-
sulted in a delay in carrying out the provi-
sions;
Whereas, in March 2019, the Government of
Brunei announced it was going forward with
the penal code to take effect April 3, 2019;
Whereas the law includes, among other
things, death by stoning for male same-sex
relations, adultery, and blasphemy, amputa-
tion of limbs for theft, caning for female
same-sex relations, and criminalization of
exposure of children to the beliefs and prac-
tices of differing religions;
Whereas, on April 2, 2019, the Department
of State said Brunei’s new laws and associ-
ated penalties run ‘‘counter to its inter-
national human rights obligations including
with respect to torture or other cruel, inhu-
man or degrading treatment or punish-
ment’’;
Whereas, on April 18, 2019, the European
Parliament adopted a resolution strongly
condemning Brunei for introducing ‘‘retro-
grade’’ laws, calling for their immediate re-
peal, urging that Brunei uphold its inter-
national obligations under ‘‘international
human rights instruments, including with
regard to sexual minorities, religious mi-
norities and non-believers,’’ and suggesting
visa bans and asset freezes should the laws
not be repealed;
Whereas the United Nations and inter-
national human rights organizations have
denounced the laws, arguing they amount to
torture and a violation of human rights;
Whereas United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet
urged Brunei to repeal the laws, which in-
clude punishments she called ‘‘cruel, inhu-
man, and degrading’’ and a ‘‘serious setback
for human rights protections.’’;
Whereas Human Rights Watch stated,
‘‘Brunei’s new penal code is barbaric to the
core, imposing archaic punishments for acts
that shouldn’t even be crimes. . .Sultan
Hassanal should immediately suspend ampu-
tations, stoning, and all other rights-abusing
provisions and punishments.’’;
Whereas Amnesty International stated,
‘‘Brunei’s Penal Code is a deeply flawed piece
of legislation containing a range of provi-
sions that violate human rights. . .As well
as imposing cruel, inhuman and degrading
punishments, it blatantly restricts the
rights to freedom of expression, religion and
belief, and codifies discrimination against
women and girls.’’; and
Whereas the United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights has also noted that
the implementation of these discriminatory
laws will drive people underground and out
of reach of life-saving HIV treatment and
prevention services, increases stigma, and
gives license to discrimination, violence, and
harassment: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) condemns the Government of Brunei’s
further criminalization and barbaric punish-
ments regarding sexual orientation, adul-
tery, and relations between persons of the
same sex;
(2) calls on the Government of Brunei to
expeditiously repeal such measures; and
(3) supports the withdrawal and denial of
United States visas for any Brunei official
responsible for passage or implementation of
such laws until they are repealed.

rican Americans who had been displaced by
federally supported urban renewal projects;
Whereas Judge Damon Keith worked
throughout his career to safeguard the civil
liberties, civil rights, and voting rights of all
people of the United States while opposing
housing, employment, and racial discrimina-
tion;
Whereas Judge Damon Keith has received
more than 40 honorary degrees as well as the
Spingarn Medal from the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored People,
the highest honor awarded by the organiza-
tion for distinguished achievement, and the
Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to
Justice Award, the highest award that can be
bestowed on a member of the Federal judici-
ary;
Whereas Judge Damon Keith inspired gen-
erations of lawyers that served under him as
clerks and influenced the State of Michigan
for decades; and
Whereas Judge Damon Keith, who coined
the phrase ‘‘democracies die behind closed
doors’’, will be remembered for his dedica-
tion to upholding the Constitution of the
United States and his commitment to jus-
tice: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate honors the life
and legacy of Judge Damon Jerome Keith
and his dedication to upholding civil rights.

Betty Cooper is the mother of five, a grand-
mother, and an enrolled member of the Black-
feet Tribe. She was born and raised in Brown-
ing. In 1963, Betty moved to the San Fran-
cisco Bay area with her husband and children.
There, she became involved in substance
abuse prevention and treatment in the Indian
community. She helped establish the Amer-
ican Indian Family Healing Center in Oakland,
CA, and served as director for a decade.
Returning home to Montana, she helped es-
tablish the Pikuni Family Healing Center in
Starr School.
Betty was among over two dozen prominent
Native American advocates featured in Sur-
viving in Two Worlds: Contemporary Native
American Voices, a book by Lois Crozier-
Hogle and Darryl Babe Wilson.
Betty has served on the Blackfeet Tribal
Business Council and has been an advocate
for individuals with mental illness.
American Mothers, a non-profit organization
founded in 1935, named Betty Montana’s
Mother of the Year for 2019. In her recent ad-
dress at the group’s annual meeting, Betty
said, ‘‘Love our children; look them in the eye;
hug them close and tell them you love them.
When a child knows they are loved, everything
else falls in place. Each of our children is a
gift to us from the Creator.’’
Madam Speaker, truer words were never
spoken.
Madam Speaker, for her dedication to fam-
ily, advocacy for mental health services, and
leadership in the Indian community, I recog-
nize Betty Cooper for her spirit of Montana.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF JUDGE DAMON J. KEITH
HON. BRENDA L. LAWRENCE
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of myself and Representative JOHN LEWIS,
along with my colleagues, Representatives
KAREN BASs, ALMA ADAMS, COLIN ALLRED,
G.K. BUTTERFIELD, ANDRÉ CARSON, YVETTE D.

PRESSLEY, CEDRIC RICHMOND, LISA BLUNT
ROCHESTER, BOBBY L. RUSH, BENNIE G.
THOMPSON, MARC VEASEY, and Senators CORY
BOOKER and KAMALA D. HARRIS, to honor the
life of a great public servant, Judge Damon J.
Keith. For over half a century, Judge Keith
fought for justice, transparency, and civil lib-
erties, setting an example for generations to
come.
Judge Keith was born on July 4, 1922—a
fitting date for someone who so staunchly be-
lieved in American Democracy. The grandson
of slaves, Judge Keith was a champion for ra-
cial equality. As he grew up in Detroit, he no-
ticed that there were no African Americans in
positions of power. He served in a segregated
unit in World War II. Judge Keith always un-
derstood his importance in creating a more
just nation.
Damon attended Howard University, where
he was mentored by future Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall. In 1967, he was
nominated to a seat on the United States Dis-
trict Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
by President Johnson. This nomination came
at the suggestion of Michigan Senator Philip
Hart, the namesake of the Hart Senate Office
Building. As a federal judge, Damon worked to
end segregation in Michigan. He ordered for
the bussing of ten thousand African American
students in Pontiac to achieve racial integra-
tion. He also ordered the city of Hamtramck to
relocate 500 African Americans who were dis-
placed during a federally supported urban re-
newal project.
These decisions were not popular at the
time, and often resulted in Judge Keith receiv-
ing death threats. He never backed down,
however, saying: ‘‘I don’t scare easily.’’ In
1977, he was nominated by President Carter
to a seat on the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Sixth Circuit, a position he held
until his passing on April 28, 2019.
Judge Keith was a champion for govern-
ment transparency. In his most famous case,
he ruled that the Nixon Administration had
acted unlawfully when issuing domestic wire-
taps, a decision which was unanimously by
the Supreme Court. In 2002, he issued an
opinion on the secret deportation hearings for
alleged terrorists following the September 11th
attacks. In another unanimous decision, he
wrote: ‘‘Democracies die behind closed
doors.’’ These wise words remind us that the
United States is a government of the people,
by the people, and for the people.
At the age of 94, Judge Keith was a firm
supporter of voting rights, dissenting against
voting restrictions in Ohio. He cited the sac-
rifices made by generations of civil rights lead-
ers and refused to let voters be silenced after
decades of struggle and perseverance. Judge
Keith spent every single day committed to
helping our country respect the dignity, worth,
and equality of every human being—whether it
was their right to vote, education, housing,
employment, or privacy.
Judge Keith will be sorely missed, but his
years of tireless service as a champion for
civil rights will never be forgotten.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL
REIMBURSEMENT BILL
HON. ED CASE
OF HAWAII
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
introduce my bill, which would ensure all fed-
eral employees are treated fairly and are reim-
bursed in a timely manner for travel expenses
during a shutdown.
Good government includes ensuring that
during shutdowns, essential services are still
performed. Thus, during the last government
shutdown, federal employees, including TSA
personnel in Hawai‘i, continued to make offi-
cial trips in support of their important security-
related duties.
Unfortunately, these employees did not re-
ceive formal guidance on how or if they would
be reimbursed for the official travel expenses
they paid for using their own credit cards. This
could have resulted in late payments and pen-
alties, impacted their credit scores, and in-
creased interest rates for both their personal
and government cards.
No government employee should be held
liable for the government’s expenses during
the shutdown. They should not have to pay for
government travel on their personal travel
cards without knowing when, or if, they will be
reimbursed. My legislation would improve gov-
ernment functions by ensuring federal employ-
ees do not have to personally take on these
liabilities.

RECOGNIZING ANN O’HANLON’S
SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF
VIRGINIA’S EIGHTH DISTRICT
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
tribute to my longtime friend and Chief of
Staff, Ann O’Hanlon. Ann has served by my
side as chief of staff and campaign manager
over the past five years and has been the
backbone of our Congressional office. She
oversaw our team with outstanding leadership,
and motivated and inspired them to go above
and beyond every day.
Ann’s distinguished career began in the
Peace Corps, followed by years as a journalist
for the Washington Post. She eventually made
her way to the political side, serving as the
Executive Director for NARAL Pro-Choice Vir-
ginia from 2003 to 2007 and then as Director
of Communications for the U.S. Office of Spe-
cial Counsel from 2011 until 2014. I was lucky
to have Ann come on board when I first ran
for Congress and she has since been indis-
pensable to me in running a busy office that
serves the citizens of Northern Virginia.
As Chief of Staff, Ann led both our D.C. and
District Offices, where she fostered work envi-
ronments built upon trust and respect. Under
her leadership, we have some of the most ac-
tive and successful communications and legis-
lative shops on the Hill. In the District, we’ve
created and built invaluable relationships and
resolved hundreds of constituent cases.
Ann has been such a trustworthy and
steady right hand to me. I cannot imagine the
past five years without her superb guidance,
unmatched political savvy, and unyielding sup-
port.
I have been fortunate to be warmly con-
nected to Ann’s husband, John, and her three
children, Liza, Griffin, and Nikki. I am grateful
to them for their patience and support. On be-
half of the American people, the people of Vir-
ginia’s Eighth District, and on behalf of the
team that Ann has remarkably led over the
past five years, I am truly grateful for her serv-
ice. While I am saddened to see her leave, I
have no doubt she will continue to inspire and
lead wherever she goes.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing the dedicated service of my chief of
staff, Ann O’Hanlon.

CONGRATULATING OKLAHOMA
STUDENTS ON ADVANCING TO
THE NATIONAL SCIENCE BOWL
FINALS
HON. KENDRA S. HORN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, maintaining America’s global
leadership means that we must equip our
youth with the skills to meet the science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
needs of the future. Two teams from Okla-
homa schools, Sequoyah Middle School and
the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathe-
matics high school students, showcased their
STEM skills at the National Science Bowl
finals and I want to recognize them for this
achievement.
Sequoyah Middle School was represented
by Alex Kelley, Jack MaGill, Shirsha
Mukherjee, and Billy Sweiger and led by
Coaches Beth Bryan and Shaun Sweiger.
The Oklahoma School of Science and Math
was represented by Peter Ha, Brad Luo, Wil-
liam Wang, Howard Zhong and led by their
coach Dr. Fazlur Rahman.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Na-
tional Science Bowl® is a nationwide aca-
demic competition that tests students’ knowl-
edge in all areas of science and mathematics.
Middle and high school student teams from di-
verse backgrounds are comprised of four stu-
dents, one alternate, and a teacher who
serves as an advisor and coach. These teams
face-off in a fast-paced question-and-answer
format, being tested on a range of science dis-
ciplines including biology, chemistry, Earth
science, physics, energy, and math.
This year, 111 teams competed for a na-
tional title by demonstrating their knowledge in
all areas of science and mathematics. Okla-
homa was represented by the Sequoyah Mid-
dle School team in the middle school division
and the Oklahoma School of Science and
Mathematics in the high school division. These
teams worked tirelessly throughout the year
and competed at the local and regional level
to get to Washington, D.C. So we congratulate
their efforts and celebrate their achievement,
dedication, and hard work.

HAPPY RETIREMENT TO DR.
FRANK AYERS
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Dr. Frank Ayers for his remarkable
career in education and his dedicated service
to the Prescott, Arizona community. Dr. Ayers
is the 7th Chancellor of Embry-Riddle Aero-
nautical University’s Prescott, Arizona Cam-
pus. He is a preeminent example of an educa-
tor who enriched and inspired his students
every step of way. His tenure at Embry-Riddle
has shaped the careers of the next generation
of aviators, national security experts, and
aerospace engineers.
In his 10 years as Chancellor, Dr. Ayers has
dedicated his efforts to better the Embry-Rid-
dle community by promoting the creation of
new degree programs, establishing seven new
athletic programs and creating a family atmos-
phere at the Prescott Campus. In addition, he
was instrumental in working with the Prescott
and Prescott Valley City Councils so that
Embry-Riddle could help serve the greater
Yavapai County region in the best ways pos-
sible.
This semester was Dr. Ayers last as Chan-
cellor at Embry-Riddle. He leaves a remark-
able legacy and Embry-Riddle, along with the
greater Prescott community, will miss his out-
standing leadership. I wish him a long and
happy retirement surrounded by his family and
friends, and thank him for all he has done for
our community.

Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Officer Jordan Harris Sheldon,
who was killed in the line of duty during a rou-
tine traffic stop. Mr. Sheldon honorably served
the Mooresville Police Department for six
years as a K–9 officer.
I know that the Mooresville Police Depart-
ment and the community are heartbroken by
this news, as am I. Our men and women in
blue put on the uniform every day not knowing
what their fate could be, yet they continue to
serve their communities without question.
Madam Speaker, I consider myself ex-
tremely fortunate to be able to represent a
place like Mooresville in the United States
Congress. I know I speak for the good folks in
Mooresville when I say that Officer Sheldon
won’t be forgotten.
I’d ask you to join me in praying for Officer
Sheldon, his family, the Mooresville Police De-
partment, and the community during this dif-
ficult time.

WORKING TO ADDRESS WATER
QUALITY ISSUES
HON. BRIAN J. MAST
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize a great program that is promoting
civic engagement in Florida and across the
country. The YMCA’s Junior Youth In Govern-
ment Program is a model legislative forum
where students learn to write bills, as well as
develop critical debate and leadership skills. In
Martin County, the Junior Youth In Govern-
ment Program started at Murray Middle
School, and now all middle schools in Martin
County have successful programs.
I want to especially recognize four students
who dedicated their time in this program to ad-
dressing the water quality issues plaguing our
community. Emma Mauri, Jasper Millette, KJ
Thompson and Donovan Soars all recognized
the pressing issues caused by polluted water
and harmful algal blooms.
These students researched the issues thor-
oughly, proposed policy changes and success-
fully got their bills passed. They exemplify the
kinds of future leaders we need in our govern-
ment because they understand that protecting
our environment is also essential to defending
human health and strengthening our economy.
Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate
Emma, Jasper, KJ and Donovan on their suc-
cess, and I also hope these programs will con-
tinue to expand to give even more students
the opportunity to learn more about how citi-
zens can participate in our government.

RECOGNIZING THE 44TH CAPITAL
PRIDE CELEBRATION
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing the 44th Capital Pride Cele-
bration, which will take place on the 50th anni-
versary of the Stonewall Riots. From May 31
to June 9, 2019, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Transgender, Questioning and others
(LGBTQ+) communities and their allies in the
National Capital Region will ‘‘shhhOUT, Past,
Present & Proud.’’
On Father’s Day of June 15, 1975, Deacon
MacCubbin, owner of the Lambda Rising
Bookstore in Dupont Circle began Gay Pride
Day as a block party on 20th Street, between
R and S Streets NW. Pride Day outgrew the
curbs and sidewalks of 20th Street and moved
to Francis Junior High School in 1980. The
next year, a Pride Parade from Meridian Hill
Park to Dupont Circle joined the renamed Gay
and Lesbian Pride Day.
Over the years, the Pride festival has
changed both in location and participation. In
1995, Pride Day moved to Freedom Plaza and
on Sunday, June 8, 1997, a retitled Capitol
Pride Festival opened on Pennsylvania Ave-
nue. In 1991, D.C. Black Pride joined the
Pride Celebration followed by Youth Pride in
1997. As momentum grew, D.C. Leather Pride
began in 2006, while Transgender and Latinx
Pride began in 2007. This year, Asian and Pa-
cific Islanders (API) inaugurate API Pride, and
seniors over 60 years of age observe Silver
Pride.
Each June, Capital Pride recognizes individ-
uals and organizations that have advanced
causes important to the LGBTQ+ community
in the National Capital Region. The Paving
The Way Award acknowledges an individual
or organization that has provided exemplary
contributions, support or advocacy that im-
pacts the larger LGBTQ+ community. The Alli-
ance proudly awards the 2019 Paving The
Way Award to The Washington Blade, Amer-
ica’s LGBTQA Newspaper of Record.
The 2019 Hero Award recipients are Kim-
berley Bush, Director of Arts and Cultural Pro-
grams at the DC Center for the LGBT Com-
munity; Rea Carey, Executive Director of the
National LGBTQ Task Force; Martin Espinoza,
co-founder and President of Stonewall Sports;
Ben de Guzman, Acting Director of the D.C.
Mayor’s Office on Asian and Pacific Islander
Affairs; Amanda J. Hackett, Esq., an attorney
in private practice who specializes in immigra-
tion matters for LGBTQ+ communities; and
Tony ‘‘And I Thank You’’ Nelson, one of D.C.’s
leading and most respected emcees and co-
medians.
Capital Pride gives the Engendered Spirit
Award to outstanding advocates, activists and
supporters of the transgender community. This
year’s recipients are: Xemiyulu Mariibusan
Tapepechul, a Nawat Trans Femme from
Kuskatan (El Salvador) and Larry Villegas-
Perez, a Native American-Hispanic born in
Venezuela. Donald Burch, III and Alan Thomp-
son receive the Bill Miles Awards for Out-
standing Volunteer Service. The Larry
Stansbury Award for Exemplary Contributions
to Pride goes to Team DC, the association of
LGBTQ+ sports clubs in the DMV region. Cap-
ital Pride also awarded the National Center for
Transgender Equality the Breaking Barriers:
Community Impact Award.
I have marched in the Pride Parade since
my election to Congress. I look forward to
marching this year. I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing the 44th Capital Pride Cele-

COMMEMORATING THE 54TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE HEAD START
PROGRAM
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 54th anniversary of the suc-
cessful national Head Start program, which
empowers children to succeed across the
country.
Head Start is a critical program that is
based on the simple premise that every child,
regardless of their socioeconomic status,
should be able to succeed in life. Head Start
offers education, health and nutrition services
to economically disadvantaged children, as
well as parenting and employment supports to
their parents.
Head Start is a wise and cost-effective in-
vestment in families and communities. For
every dollar invested in Head Start by the fed-
eral government, the country realizes almost
nine dollars in benefits through increased
earning and reduced reliance on social pro-
grams.
In my state of Wisconsin, Head Start pro-
vides parent education, preventative health
care, and home visits to nearly 17,000 Wis-
consin children and families at over 280 loca-
tions statewide. In addition, just last year,
Head Start provided crisis assistance to over
3,700 families in Wisconsin in the form of
emergency food, clothing or shelter.
Yet, the need is much greater. In 2017, of
the nearly 42,000 children in Wisconsin ages
of three and five in poverty, only 31 percent
had access to Head Start. Of the 50,985 chil-
dren under the three in poverty, only 6 percent
had access to Early Head Start. This is trou-
bling when we know the difference that this
program can make. Earlier this year, I again
joined colleagues in asking the House Appro-
priations Committee to boost funding for Head
Start.
So I commend those who have helped
make this program such a vital part of commu-
nities in the past 50 plus years, the dedicated
teachers, parents, and others who invest so
much in our children. Madam Speaker, I com-
mend Head Start for the difference it is mak-
ing for children and families in Wisconsin and
throughout the nation and urge this Congress
to improve and strengthen it for another 50
wonderful years.

HONORING DR. BEVERLY WARREN
HON. TIM RYAN

Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Dr. Beverly Warren, who has an-
nounced her retirement as Kent State Univer-
sity’s 12th president.
Beverly Warren, Ph.D., Ed.D., began her
tenure at Kent State on July 1, 2014. As the
university’s chief executive officer, President
Warren oversaw one of the nation’s largest
university systems. Under her leadership, the
university embarked upon a systemwide, inclu-
sive process to consider a bold and distinctive
future for Kent State University. The six-year
plan, A Strategic Roadmap to a Distinctive
Kent State, is the result of this effort. With Stu-
dents First named Priority One, the plan iden-
tified strategies that distinguished Kent State
as an exemplar among the nation’s best public
research universities, with a distinctive blend
of teaching, research and creative excellence.
Under Dr. Warren’s leadership, the univer-
sity enrolled its most academically advanced
freshman class ever and has achieved record
enrollment in its Honor’s College program.
With a background in physical education,
President Warren also has led the charge to
turn Kent State into one of the healthiest cam-
puses in the nation. She launched a series of
wellness initiatives, including prohibiting smok-
ing and tobacco use on campus as of July
2017.
Dr. Warren also leveraged her leadership

cheering on the Golden Flashes on the field,
her energy, presence, and compassion can be

I was proud to work with Dr. Warren to help
secure funding to advance research efforts at

IN RECOGNITION OF IMAM OMAR
SULEIMAN
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize and thank Imam
Omar Suleiman for offering the opening prayer
before the House of Representatives this
afternoon.
Imam Suleiman is a world renowned scholar
and theologically driven activist for human
rights. He is the Founder and President of the
Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research and a
professor of Islamic Studies at Southern Meth-
odist University. He’s also the resident scholar
of the Valley Ranch Islamic Center and Co-
Chair Emeritus of Faith Forward Dallas at
Thanks-Giving Square, a multi-faith coalition of
clergy for peace and justice. He frequently
writes for CNN, USA Today, The Guardian,
HuffPo, and The Dallas Morning News.
His career started in his hometown of New
Orleans where he served as the Imam of the
Jefferson Muslim Association in New Orleans
for 6 years and directed the ‘‘Muslims for Hu-
manity’’ Hurricane Katrina Relief effort. It was
during this time that he was recognized on a
national level as being a strong advocate of
community service, interfaith dialogue, and so-
cial justice. He co-founded the East Jefferson
Interfaith Clergy Association and was awarded
for his outstanding civic achievement by the
Mayor and City Council of New Orleans in
2010. He’s also the founder of MUHSEN, a
non-profit umbrella organization serving the
community to establish a more inclusive ‘‘Spe-
cial Friendly’’ environment for our brothers &
sisters of all disabilities.
In July 2016, he marched with demonstra-
tors in Dallas against the killings of Alton Ster-
ling and Philando Castile. In the wake of the
tragic shooting of officers after that protest, he
was chosen to lead the invocation at the Pres-
idential memorial alongside former Presidents
Barack Obama and George W. Bush. The D-
Magazine published a feature on him titled
‘‘The Religious Leader Dallas Needs.’’ His
work in bringing people together was the sub-
ject of a BBC documentary in 2016, and work
with refugees in Syria featured in PBS in Jan-
uary 2017, and in 2016, he was a recipient of
the United Nations Global Goals Award with
Faith Forward Dallas. He led the airport pro-
tests in Dallas against President Trump’s Mus-
lim ban in 2017; led a group of clergy to the
Mexico border that intercepted a bus of chil-
dren taken from their parents under the family

COMMEMORATING THE FIFTIETH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE SOUTH-
ERN TIER CENTRAL REGIONAL
PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
BOARD
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the
Southern Tier Central Regional Planning and
Development Board.
Southern Tier Central has been serving the
communities of Chemung, Schuyler, and Steu-
ben Counties since 1969. As a regional coun-
cil, Southern Tier Central promotes coordina-
tion between the neighboring counties to pro-
vide a regional approach to improving the
economy, the environment, and the quality of
life for citizens of the Southern Tier. Their
work to provide planning for economic devel-
opment, transportation, human services, and
flood assistance helps the communities of the
Southern Tier grow and thrive.
The Southern Tier Central Regional Plan-
ning and Development Board provides a vari-
ety of services to the region. As the des-
ignated Local Development District of the Ap-
palachian Regional Commission and an Eco-
nomic Development District of the Economic
Development Administration, Southern Tier
Central is able to qualify for special grant
funding and project assistance to promote im-
portant local economic and community devel-
opment projects. Over the last half century,
Southern Tier Central has helped to provide
more than eighty-seven million dollars in grant
funding and technical assistance to the region.
Fifty years of serving the community is cer-
tainly a cause for celebration. I congratulate
the Southern Tier Central Regional Planning
and Development Board on this impressive
milestone and look forward to their continued
success in the years to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the
Southern Tier Central Regional Planning and
Development Board.

MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS
MONTH
SPEECH OF
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 8, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in
recognition of Mental Health Awareness
Month. Throughout May, my colleagues and I
will bring attention to the impact of mental ill-
nesses on American society, as well as
Congress’s role in addressing mental
healthcare issues facing the country. It is an
honor to collaborate with my colleagues in the
Congressional Mental Health Caucus to raise
awareness for mental illnesses, reduce the
stigma surrounding mental illness, and create
legislation that improves mental health out-
comes for Americans.
Mental illnesses have a devastating effect
on those struggling to live with them. This in-
cludes changes in mood, social interactions,
sleep patterns, and eating habits. Sadly, the
most extreme consequences of mental illness
are when an individual inflicts self-injury or
takes their life. Suicide is the 10th leading
cause of death in the United States and the
second leading cause of death among Ameri-
cans age 24 and younger. Approximately 1.4
million Americans attempt suicide each year
and over 47,000 Americans lose their lives to
suicide. The United States has 3,700 suicide
attempts daily and 129 suicide deaths per day.
This equates to one suicide every 12 minutes.
Not only does suicide have severe emo-
tional costs on families and communities, but
also on our economy. It is estimated suicide
and self-injury reduce the economic output of
the United States by $69 billion per year.
The suicide epidemic is responsible for
nearly the same amount of deaths in the
United States as another prevalent health cri-
sis: the opioid epidemic. It is estimated opioids
were the cause for 47,600 deaths in America,
only a few hundred more than suicide. While
solving the opioid crisis has received ample
funding and attention, and rightfully so, reduc-
ing suicide and improving mental health treat-
ment deserves the same recognition. Con-
gress has a responsibility to assist individuals
experiencing mental health challenges through
effective legislation and research subsidies.
Congress should advance policies that in-
crease Americans’ access to mental
healthcare treatment as a mechanism for pre-
venting self-harm incidents and suicide at-
tempts. Just one third of Americans with men-
tal illness receive treatment. Our country is in
desperate need of additional trained thera-
pists, psychologists, and counselors. This lack
of access can be partly attributed to a short-
age of mental healthcare professionals in cer-
tain communities. In order to establish a more
reliable supply of mental healthcare profes-
sionals, Congresswoman GRACE NAPOLITANO
and I recently introduced the Mental Health
Professionals Workforce Shortage Loan Re-
payment Act of 2019. Our bill delivers profes-
sionals to areas that require mental healthcare
experts the most by forgiving their secondary
education student loans. It invests in bol-
stering our mental health workforce, while ex-
panding treatment for Americans with mental
illness.
Americans across the country, regardless of
age, social status, or background, are affected
by mental illnesses. Mental Health Awareness
Month serves as an opportunity for any of my
Congressional colleagues, Republican or
Democrat, to join the conversation. Together,
we can improve mental health outcomes for
Americans across the country by engaging in
thoughtful discussion and crafting efficient poli-
cies.
Finally, it is an honor to once again co-chair
the Congressional Mental Health Caucus with

HONORING NEW ROCHELLE YMCA
120TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pleasure that I recognize an institution
that has helped children and families in my
district for an astonishing 120 years, the New
Rochelle YMCA.
On January 15, 1899 a group of New
Rochelleans gathered at 56 Woodland Ave. in
New Rochelle to discuss the possibility of cre-
ating a YMCA. On February 3, 1899 the New
Rochelle YMCA received its article of incorpo-
ration.
The original home of the Y was located at
480–482 Main Street where a building com-
mittee was established to create a permanent
home. Twenty-six years later the YMCA pur-
chased the Hendricks property at the comer of
Division St. and Burling Lane (now Memorial
Highway) and began raising money to build a
new site. Fallowing the economic uncertainty
of the stock market crash, the new building
was completed in 1931.
A true charitable organization, the Y was in-
volved with the soldiers at Fort Slocum during
both world wars, providing them with room
and board while on leave from their base, as
well as providing room for the American Red
Cross. Several local community organizations
used the Y facility as meeting halls for their re-
spective groups. Over the years the Y pro-
vided many programs for the New Rochelle
community, with the pool being the most pop-
ular feature and by 1939 had a membership of
over 2,200 people. Over the years, the Y de-
veloped a rich history in diversity.
In the 1980’s they moved into its current
home on 50 Weyman Avenue, a space it
shared with the Boys and Girls Club.
The YMCA’s presence in the community
has continued to increase over the last ten
years, as the focus of the Y shifted from a
‘‘swim and gym club’’ to a community based
charitable organization, which offers affordable
programs, in addition to providing financial aid
for children and families in need. Currently the
YMCA serves close to 5,000 members, with a
great majority of seniors and children. The
YMCA has developed a Universal Pre-K pro-
gram in partnership with the New Rochelle
school district.
The New Rochelle YMCA has served the
community for 120 years. On the occasion of
their anniversary, I’d like to congratulate and
thank their entire team for all they have done.

HON. WILL HURD
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of the 10th Anniversary of
Texas A&M University-San Antonio. Since its
establishment in 2009, A&M-San Antonio has
transformed into a bustling, centralized Univer-
sity that has awarded over 8,000 degrees on
the Southside of San Antonio, so students are
prepared to take on the challenges of the 21st
Century.
Additionally, the University is reflective of
the rich heritage of the community it serves,
with a student body that’s 60-percent female,
72-percent Hispanic and 77-percent first-gen-
eration college students. I am proud to rep-
resent a University that is playing a hands-on
role in moving our country forward, and I know
this is only the beginning.
On behalf of the Twenty-third Congressional
District of Texas, congratulations to Texas
A&M University-San Antonio on this achieve-
ment and go jaguars.

it fought racial discrimination in the Roanoke
Valley in the 20th Century.
Their tradition of strong, independent jour-
nalism which holds leaders and the powerful
accountable continues today under the leader-

SUPPORT OF THE LAWYERS DE-
FENDING DEMOCRACY ‘‘OPEN
LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT AND
CONGRESS’’
HON. JAMIE RASKIN
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, while the na-
tion has been focused on Russian interference
with the 2016 presidential election and ques-
tions of presidential obstruction of justice,
President Donald Trump’s violation of funda-
mental principles and norms of American de-
mocracy have been far more comprehensive.
In the last three months, more than 400 attor-
neys—including former federal and state
judges, United States Attorneys, managing
partners of large law firms, law deans and
other distinguished lawyers from around the
country—have stepped forward in a broad and
unprecedented effort to defend American de-
mocracy and the rule of law against official
lawlessness.
The lawyers have signed and published an
‘‘Open Letter to The President and Congress’’
identifying five fundamental norms and prin-
ciples of our democracy which they believe
the President has violated. These violations in-
volve the President’s unjustified attacks on the
mainstream media, courts, law enforcement
and intelligence agencies, his repeated lying
to the public, and failure to respect civil dis-
course and peoples from all backgrounds. The
Letter’s Appendix cites examples of violations
of each principle.
The Letter emphasizes that it is ‘‘NOT about
disagreements over Republican or Democratic
policies, liberal or conservative ideology, or
political party advantage. The values and prin-
ciples threatened here are much deeper, and
are much more important, than politics, policy
differences and any politician’s self-interest.
They’re the bedrock of our American, constitu-
tional, democratic form of government for all
times.’’
The Letter notes that: ‘‘[u]nless challenged
and checked, the pattern of disregard weak-
ens the norms that underpin American self-
government and invites unfettered Executive
power—transforming the United States from a
democracy to an autocracy. As members of
the legal profession, pledged to support the
rule of law and the constitutional separation of
powers, we must not allow this to happen.’’ I
am pleased to endorse this Letter and Appen-
dix by Lawyers Defending American Democ-
racy, www.lawyersdefendingdemocracy.org,
and include them in the RECORD.
We are fortunate that, at a time of rising
authoritarianism around the world, lawyers in
the United States are standing strong for the
rule of law and the Constitution.
OPEN LETTER OF LAWYERS DEFENDING
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
We live at a time when America’s funda-
mental values are under attack. As Amer-
ican lawyers, we’re deeply concerned about
protecting the democratic institutions and
principles that have enabled America to be
the world’s preeminent beacon of freedom
and opportunity.
As lawyers, we have the responsibility to
defend the underlying constitutional values
and norms of political behavior on which our
democracy depends. These core values and
principles include: the rule of law; institu-
tional checks and balances; separation of
powers; press freedom; truthfulness to the
public; and the integrity of our system of
justice.
Accordingly, we, as lawyers, cannot ignore
or remain silent about President Donald
Trump’s disregard of these core values and
principles. We must speak out.
Yet, we recognize that elections have con-
sequences. This effort to energize and mobi-
lize our legal profession is emphatically NOT
about disagreements over Republican or
Democratic policies, liberal or conservative
ideology, or political party advantage. The
values and principles threatened here go
much deeper, and are much more important
than politics, policy differences and any poli-
tician’s self-interest. They’re the bedrock of

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E568 May 9, 2019
our American, constitutional, democratic
form of government.
Specifically, we call on the President to re-
spect and honor the following fundamental
principles and norms of American democ-
racy:
Independence, integrity and the critical
role of mainstream media: An independent
and watchful mainstream media is, and al-
ways has been, an essential component of
American democracy.
Independence, integrity, competence and
nonpartisanship of the judiciary: The inde-
pendence, integrity, competence and non-
partisanship of our judiciary is, and from the
founding of our Nation has been, a central
pillar of our democratic system.
Truthfulness of public officials: Our de-
mocracy is built on trust and telling the peo-
ple the truth about public matters; the
maintenance of that trust and Americans’
ability to make informed and rational public
decisions require our leaders to provide hon-
est, factual information to us all.
Independence, integrity, competence and
nonpartisanship of federal criminal justice
and intelligence agencies, including Depart-
ment of Justice (DOJ) and FBI: Nonpartisan
independence, integrity and competence are
critical to the fairness of our federal crimi-
nal justice system and intelligence agencies.
Civil discourse and fair treatment, includ-
ing the respect for rights and the dignity of
all individuals, regardless of race, ethnicity,
national origin, religion, gender, disability
or sexual orientation: Civil discourse and
fair treatment, including respect for the
rights and dignity of all individuals, is an es-
sential ingredient of American democracy.
The President’s attacks on these core
American democratic principles undermine
the foundations of our Constitution and
threaten the rule of law. Unless challenged
and checked, this pattern of disregard weak-
ens the norms that underpin American self-
government and invites unfettered Executive
power—transforming the United States from
a democracy to an autocracy. As members of
the legal profession, pledged to support the
rule of law and the constitutional separation
of powers, we must not allow this to happen.
Fortunately, a group of prominent con-
servative lawyers has recently spoken out on
many of these same issues through a new or-
ganization, ‘‘Checks and Balances.’’ Now,
other members of the bar must no longer re-
main silent.
We call on the leaders of America’s bar as-
sociations, law schools, law firms and fellow
lawyers nationwide to speak out, on a non-
partisan basis, against these attacks on the
core of our democratic constitutional form
of government. As lawyers, we have a re-
sponsibility to uphold ‘‘the rule of law’’ and
prevent ‘‘the law of rulers.’’ Wherever you
live and work—in cities, towns, rural areas,
suburbs—American democracy needs to hear
your voice.
APPENDIX
We list below the five fundamental prin-
ciples and values of American democracy
highlighted in our Open Letter to the Presi-
dent. Under each principle, we describe pat-
terns or examples of behavior by the Presi-
dent that we believe constitute serious viola-
tions of these principles. The examples are
not intended to be comprehensive and may
be added to in the future.
Principle: Independence, integrity and the
critical role of mainstream media.
Pattern of Violations: Nevertheless, the
President has labeled the mainstream news
media that have earned our trust through
decades of relentless, factual reporting as
the ‘‘enemy of the American people!’’ and
has repeatedly criticized reporting he dis-
likes as ‘‘Fake News.’’
Principle: Independence, integrity, com-
petence and nonpartisanship of judiciary.
Pattern of Violations: Nevertheless, the
President has criticized ‘‘our Court System’’
as ‘‘broken and unfair’’ and has pilloried the
judges and decisions of an entire Federal Cir-
cuit as ‘‘[a] terrible, costly and dangerous
disgrace.’’ He has publicly labeled a federal
judge with whose decision he disagreed a
‘‘so-called judge’’. And he sought to under-
mine the public’s confidence in the integrity
of another federal judge—who had ruled that
the President’s immigration policy violated
express statutory language—by calling him
‘‘an Obama judge.’’
Principle: Civil discourse and fair treat-
ment, including respect for rights and dig-
nity of all individuals, regardless of race,
ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender,
disability or sexual orientation.
Examples of Violations: Nevertheless, the
President has said that there were ‘‘some
very fine people on both sides’’ of the mur-
derous Charlottesville white nationalists’
demonstrations. He’s approved the removal
of thousands of children from their immi-
grant parents, for extended time periods, and
has publicly insulted several respected Afri-
can-American female journalists.
Principle: Independence, integrity, com-
petence and nonpartisanship of federal
criminal justice and intelligence agencies,
including Department of Justice (DOJ) and
FBI.
Examples of Violations: Nevertheless, the
President has attacked the DOJ for indicting
Republican Congressmen for serious finan-
cial crimes because the indictments would
harm the chances for reelecting Republicans.
He has attacked and removed former Attor-
ney General Jeff Sessions for lack of per-
sonal loyalty, after having previously com-
plained that: ‘‘I don’t have an Attorney Gen-
eral.’’
He has accused the special counsel’s delib-
erate, professional, lawful investigation of
Russian interference with the 2016 election
as the ‘‘rigged Mueller Witch Hunt!’’ And, he
has rejected the U.S. intelligence commu-
nity’s consensus finding of Russian inter-
ference in that election, because Vladimir
Putin, the autocratic Russian President, told
the President that there was no interference.
Principle: Truthfulness of public officials.
Examples of Violations: [. . .] The Wash-
ington Post has documented more than 7,500
‘‘false or misleading claims’’ by the Presi-
dent.

COMMENDING THE JUNIOR YOUTH
IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AT
MURRAY MIDDLE SCHOOL
HON. BRIAN J. MAST
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize a great program that is promoting
civic engagement in Florida and across the
country. The YMCA’s Junior Youth In Govern-
ment Program is a model legislative forum
where students learn to write bills, as well as
develop critical debate and leadership skills. In
Florida, these bills amend existing laws or cre-
ate new legislation to better serve Floridians.
In Martin County, the Junior Youth In Gov-
ernment Program started at Murray Middle
School, and now all middle schools in Martin
County have successful programs. I want to
especially recognize David Yankwitt. In addi-
tion to teaching American History and Civics
at Murray Middle School, he works as the co-
ordinator for the Junior Youth In Government
Program for Martin County. His work is inspir-
ing a new generation of leaders to engage
with our state in a civic-minded way.
I also want to recognize the 15 students
who participated in this program at Murray
Middle School and the 35 students who par-
ticipated county-wide. As students continue in
Junior Youth In Government, they can then
move into Senior Youth In Government. South
Fork, Martin County and Jensen Beach High
Schools all have great student-led programs
that could result in students receiving college
credit and scholarships.
Madam Speaker, I hope these programs will
continue to expand and give even more stu-
dents the opportunity to learn more about how
citizens can participate in our government.

Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and congratulate City of
Bedford Mayor Jim Griffin on his success as
Chairman of the Hurst-Euless-Bedford Inde-
pendent School District Education Founda-
tion’s Board of Directors.
Through the guidance of its board of direc-
tors, the Hurst-Euless-Bedford Independent
School District (HEB ISD) Education Founda-
tion raises and awards private funds and com-
munity resources in support of the HEB ISD’s
commitment to serving its students and to
educational excellence. Since its establish-
ment in 1995, the Foundation has raised and
awarded over $855,000 in the form of grants
to educators and programs within the HEB
ISD.
In 2016, Jim Griffin assumed the role of
Chairman of the Board of Directors, leading
the foundation into a new period of success
and prosperity. Acting on his passions for edu-
cation and service to his community, Mayor
Griffin has worked rigorously and spent count-
less hours on school campuses, building es-
sential relationships with educators throughout
the area. Furthermore, his efforts to secure
critical funding have enabled the Foundation
to effectively meet the needs of a growing stu-
dent population.
Mayor Griffin’s tremendous impact is appar-
ent in the extensive and continuous outreach
that he conducts on behalf of the Foundation.
Throughout his time as Chairman, he has
maintained the highest level of corporate and
community support for the Superintendent’s
annual Circle of Giving Campaign. He has
also expanded the Campus Liaison Program
to include multiple visits to all HEB ISD cam-
puses each year. Additionally, Mayor Griffin’s
work to rebrand the HEB ISD staff campaign
‘‘ARE YOU IN? Inspire, Innovate, Invest’’, has
resulted in over 100 percent growth of both
donors and donations in 2018–2019. With
over 770 staff donors and $36,000 raised this
past year, every dollar from this campaign is
given directly to classrooms and campuses

Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
artistic ability of a young student from my Con-
gressional District, Caden Ferita from Westing-
house Arts Academy.
Caden is the winner of the 2019 18th Con-
gressional District of Pennsylvania’s High
School Art Competition, ‘‘An Artistic Dis-
covery.’’ Caden’s artwork, an oil painting enti-
tled ‘‘René,’’ was selected from a number of
outstanding entries in this year’s competition.
In fact, 28 works from 10 different schools in
Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District
were submitted to our panel of respected local
artists. It’s a real tribute to Ms. Ferita’s skill
and vision that her work was chosen as the
winner of this year’s competition.
Ms. Ferita’s artwork will represent the 18th
Congressional District of Pennsylvania in the
national exhibit of high school students’ art-
work that will be displayed in the United
States Capitol over the coming year. I encour-
age my colleagues as well as any visitor to
Capitol Hill to view Ms. Ferita’s artwork, along
with the winning entries from the high school
art contests held in other Congressional Dis-
tricts, which will be on display in the Capitol
tunnel. It is amazing to walk through this cor-
ridor and see the interpretation of life through
the eyes of these young artists from all across
our country.
Lillianne Taylor from Pittsburgh CAPA was
awarded second place for her multi-media
composition ‘‘Gabby.’’ Caleb McCoy from
Woodland Hills High School received third
place for his untitled drawing with marker and
pen. Nicholas Altland from Upper St. Clair
High School was awarded fourth place for his
photograph entitled ‘‘Over the Mon,’’ and
Hayley Shevitz from Pittsburgh CAPA was
awarded fifth place for her charcoal drawing
‘‘Mystery-Pop.’’

pressing themselves in a powerful and positive
manner are deeply inspiring. I hope that all of
them will continue to utilize their artistic tal-

IN RECOGNITION OF THE KANSAS
CITY NATIONAL SECURITY CAM-
PUS
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the seventieth anniver-
sary of the Kansas City National Security
Campus (KCNSC), managed by Honeywell
FM&T. Since their founding in 1949, KCNSC
and Honeywell established a strong presence
within our community, fulfilling a national secu-
rity need while engaging our local workforce.
Today, their campus has expanded exponen-
tially to provide quality jobs for over 4,500
members of the Fifth Congressional District.
The Kansas City National Security Campus
was created under the direction of then U.S.
Senator Harry S. Truman to establish a cen-
tralized national defense operation that would
be strategically located in the heart of the
country—Kansas City. Seven years later,
President Truman was pleased to see his vi-
sion come true when Kansas City’s Bendix
Corporation signed the contract to operate the
local division of the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion. Growing steadily, Bendix expanded to
employ 8,301 employees in the Kansas City
community by 1963. Bendix became known
for providing quality employment options for
men and women of diverse backgrounds. As
a new resident of Kansas City in 1968, I was
actually employed at Bendix myself, so I am
especially appreciative to this company for giv-
ing me my first opportunity in the city that I
have called home for the past fifty years.
Throughout their seventy years in service,
KCNSC has consistently paved the way in
providing innovative solutions to some of our
most pressing challenges. State of the art fa-
cilities like the Electrical Products Manufac-
turing Building and the Flexible Manufacturing
System exhibited the foremost technological
advances available at the time.
Beginning in 2013, the National Nuclear Se-
curity Administration (NNSA) and Honeywell
FM&T contract embarked on one of their larg-
est and most prestigious expansions yet—the
relocation of the KCNSC campus. Since this
expansion, the collaboration has remained
steadfast as an integral pillar in the commu-
nity. These $9 billion facilities have enabled
the already thriving KCNSC to expand expo-
nentially, providing secure and highly sought-
after jobs to a plethora of Kansas Citians.
Since the opening dedication of the new facili-
ties on Botts Road in August 2014, hundreds
of employees have been added to the KCNSC
family, encouraging economic growth and in-
vestment in our city. KCNSC has grown their
total staff from 2,500 employees in 2015 to
4,500 employees employed there today. As a
testament to KCNSC’s continued efficiency,
throughout the entire relocation process, the
highest standards of both safety and perform-
ance were maintained, giving this branch of
Honeywell and NNSA national recognition and
approval. Their work during the transition was
described as ‘‘better than flawless’’ by Plant
President Chris Gentile.
Going forward, the KCNSC facility maintains
the same standard of excellence and dedica-
tion to safety and sustainability as they did in
1949 while providing high quality jobs and em-
ployee satisfaction. It brings me great personal
pride to have this institution located within our
Fifth Congressional District of Missouri.
Madam Speaker, please join me with Mis-
souri’s Fifth Congressional District in honoring
the Kansas City National Security Campus,
managed by Honeywell FM&T, for their re-
markable achievements in our community and
their contributions to the security, safety, and
longevity of our nation during the past seventy
years.

HONORING NATIONAL ARAB
AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I want to take
a moment to recognize April as National Arab
American Heritage Month, a time to honor all
of the incredible achievements the Arab Amer-
ican community has made here in America.
For over a century, Arab Americans have
been making valuable contributions to virtually
every aspect of American society: in medicine,
law, business, education, technology, govern-
ment, military service, and culture. Since mi-
grating to America, men and women of Arab
descent have shared their rich culture and tra-
ditions with neighbors and friends, while also
setting fine examples of model citizens and
public servants. They brought with them their
resilient family values, strong work ethic, dedi-
cation to education, and diversity in faith and
creed that have added strength to our great
democracy. Arab Americans have also en-
riched our society by sharing in the entrepre-
neurial American spirit that makes our nation
free and prosperous.
Unfortunately, the history of Arab Americans
in the U.S. has been marred by misconcep-
tions, bigotry, and anti-Arab hate speech and
violence. As such, Arab American concerns,
such as civil rights violations, harmful stereo-
typing, and bullying must be combatted
through education, awareness, and, if nec-
essary our criminal justice system. We must
all join together to see a peaceful and diverse

society, where every individual is treated
equally and feels safe.
Madam Speaker, the substantial contribu-
tions and rich cultural heritage of Arab Ameri-
cans have helped us build a better, stronger
nation for everyone. As someone who rep-
resents a significant Arab American population
in my district, I am honored to help celebrate
and recognize National Arab American Herit-
age Month here in Congress.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF WILLIAM NATHAN SALIN
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of
former Indiana Secretary of State, William Na-
than Salin who passed away on May 4th. Bill
was born in Anderson, Indiana and was a
dedicated public servant and lifelong Hoosier
who established a community bank creating
hundreds of jobs in northern and central Indi-
ana. In addition, Bill worked tirelessly to im-
prove the lives of Indiana students with schol-
arships he provided to help fund their college
education.
Bill’s commitment to his community and
state was well known. He was the two-time re-
cipient of Indiana’s highest honor, receiving
the Sagamore of the Wabash award from both
Governor Dr. Otis R. Bowen and Governor
Edgar D. Whitcomb. Typically, the Sagamore
of the Wabash honor is given for wisdom,
public commitment, and a concern for the
well-being of others.
After graduation from Indiana School of
Business in 1954, Bill went on to join the U.S.
Army, and the following year married Jane
Robertson on June 4, 1955. Bill then earned
a law degree from Indiana University, and he
and Jane moved to Kendallville, Indiana where
he began his professional career as an attor-
ney with the law firm Findlay & Findlay. Later,
Bill continued his active community involve-
ment serving as Kendallville City Attorney.
In 1962, Bill and Jane moved to Fort
Wayne, Indiana where Bill once again was an
active community leader managing Indiana
Bank’s trust department. In 1968, Bill was
elected as Secretary of State serving along
with Governor Edgar D. Whitcomb. After com-
pleting his service as Secretary of State, Bill
returned with his family to Fort Wayne.
In Fort Wayne, Bill continued to practice law
at the firm of Kennerk, Dumas, Burke, Backs
& Salin. Bill was a member of the Indianapolis,
Indiana, and American Bar Associations; Indi-
ana and American Bankers Associations;
American Business Club; Economic Club of
Indianapolis; Indiana University Varsity Club
and of the Well House Society; The Columbia
Club; The Indiana Society of Chicago; and
The Forum Club of Southwest Florida.
In 1983, Bill founded and was Chairman of
Salin Bank & Trust Company, a family owned
community bank serving Columbus, Delphi,
Edinburgh, Fishers, Flora, Fort Wayne, Gal-
veston, Gas City, Kokomo, Lafayette, Logans-
port, Marion, West Lafayette, and Indianapolis.
Bill and the entire Salin family took great pride
in serving Hoosiers and their banking needs.
It was during his tenure at the bank that Bill
and his wife Jane established the Salin Family
Foundation in order to provide annual scholar-
ships to students to fund their education at
colleges and universities in Indiana. In 2018,
Salin Bank merged with Michigan City-based
Horizon Bank and today Horizon Bank pro-
vides community banking services in both Indi-
ana and Michigan.
In addition to Salin Bank & Trust and Salin
Bancshares, Inc., Bill served on the boards of
several banks and bank holding companies.
Bill also served on a number of community
and education boards including serving as a
Trustee of Hanover College, Hanover, Indiana;
a Trustee of the Garrett-Evangelical Theo-
logical Seminary at Northwestern University; a
member of the Board of the Indiana Historical
Society; and the Indianapolis Symphony Or-
chestra.
Bill was an active in the United Methodist
Church for many years. Together, he and
Jane established an endowed scholarship for
ministers’ children attending Anderson Univer-
sity in Indiana’s Fifth Congressional District. In
1997, Bill and Jane served as co-chairs for the
capital campaign which raised funds to build
the sanctuary at St. Luke’s United Methodist
Church in Indianapolis.
Bill was a devoted husband, father, and
grandfather. One of Bill’s favorite places was
with his family at Lake Wawasee where he
spent 55 years enjoying the outdoors and
beautiful lake with Jane and their children and
eight grandchildren. The entire family enjoyed
many summer days sailing and water skiing at
the lake. Bill also enjoyed winter out west, and
spent many special days snow skiing with his
grandchildren in Beaver Creek, Colorado.
Bill was a leader in Indiana who cared
deeply for all the communities both large and
small served by Salin Bank. He will be missed
by many. I want to extend my most heartfelt
condolences to his family in their time of
mourning. Bill is survived by his wife of 63
years, Margaret Jane (Robertson); his children
Bill II (Peggy), and their children Bill III (Julie),
Sophie and Sam; daughter Sherri (Curt)
Fritsch and their children Bob and Will; and
daughter Susie (Garth) McClain, and their chil-
dren Charlie, John and Margaret.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JACQUIE
KAUFFMAN GRIBENS
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in memory of Jacquie Kauffman
Gribens, who passed away on May 6, 2019,
after a lifetime of public service to her commu-
nity.
Born in 1966 in Mexico City, Jacquie moved
to Massachusetts when she was 14, where
she later graduated from the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst. She then earned
her law degree from Suffolk Law School in
Boston. After meeting her ‘‘bashert’’ Bruce
during law school, they spent the next few
years travelling around the country. In 2006,
the family moved to the Bay Area, where she
spent much of her time volunteering for the
local public schools and Congregation Rodef
Shalom.
Jacquie’s life was spent delivering on her
strong desire for public service, in particular
for the most vulnerable in her community.
Most recently, she did this through her work
with Lifehouse; a non-profit that works to im-
prove the quality of life for people with devel-
opmental disabilities. Starting as a volunteer at
Lifehouse, Jacquie stepped up to serve on the
board of directors in 2014 , and then became
Board Chair in 2018. She also spent time vol-
unteering for the Marin County Board of Edu-
cation, where she supervised a grant program
to help first-generation students attend four-
year colleges.
Jacquie is survived by her husband, Bruce,
their three children, Josh, Nick, and Allie, as
well as her mother Wanda, sister Michelle and
brother-in-law Bruce, and many other family
and friends across the world. While she will be
greatly missed, Jacquie’s legacy will live on
through the indelible positive impact she had
on our community and beyond. Madam
Speaker, please join me in offering our sincere
condolences to Jacquie Gribens’ family and
many friends and in appreciating her many
good deeds.

RECOGNIZING EVAN MARKS AS
THE CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH
HON. MIKE LEVIN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it
is my honor to recognize yet another exem-
plary citizen, Evan Marks, as my Constituent
of the Month for May. Each month, it’s my
pleasure to recognize residents of the 49th
District who have gone above and beyond to
make our community stronger, and Evan has
done just that as the Founder and Executive
Director of The Ecology Center in San Juan
Capistrano.
At The Ecology Center, Evan and his team
turned a vacant lot into an educational space,
featuring a vibrant farm, kitchen, and artisan
goods store where they teach community
members about the importance of sustainable
living practices. With roughly 70,000 visitors
per year, The Ecology Center is a critical re-
source for our community that shows people
how to save water, grow healthy food, and
produce goods with a minimal impact on our
environment.
Evan’s work is imperative as we confront
the dangerous impact that climate change is
having on our planet. Just this week, the
United Nations released a landmark report
that found the health of the planet’s eco-
systems deteriorating rapidly, with over one
million species of plants and animals on the
path toward extinction due to human actions.
However, the Intergovernmental Science-Pol-
icy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services (IPBES) Chair, Sir Robert Watson,
highlighted that ‘‘it is not too late to make a
difference, but only if we start now at every
level from local to global.’’ That is exactly what
Evan and The Ecology Center inspire us to
do, to take action at the local level that will
help protect our planet for future generations.
I am proud to represent a community that
recognizes the impact we have on our envi-
ronment and knows we are all responsible for
combatting climate change. Evan and all of
the dedicated staff at The Ecology Center
have led by example and made an extraor-
dinarily positive impact on the region. I am

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-

WEEHAWKEN VOLUNTEER FIRST
AID SQUAD
HON. ALBIO SIRES
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, it is my honor
to recognize the essential role the
Weehawken Volunteer First Aid Squad plays
in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our
communities as they celebrate the 50th anni-
versary of their founding. Started in May 1969,
the Weehawken Volunteer First Aid Squad
currently has thirty active members and pro-
vides free life-saving emergency medical serv-
ices to Weehawken and the surrounding com-
munities in my district.
The Weehawken Volunteer First Aid Squad
is Hudson County’s longest serving volunteer
EMS organization and has responded to
emergencies of community and national atten-
tion, including the World Trade Center Attacks,
the landing of Flight 1549 on the Hudson
River, and Hurricane Sandy. Furthermore, the
Weehawken Volunteer First Aid Squad con-
tinues to give back to the communities it
serves through regular CPR and First Aid
training to residents.
I am grateful to the men and women of the
Weehawken Volunteer First Aid Squad who
volunteer their time and skills in dedication to
the safety of the 8th District and commend
them on this momentous occasion.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND
LEGACY OF ROBERT PEAR
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to express my appreciation for the out-
standing journalistic career of Robert Pear and
to join so many who share a deep sadness
over his untimely loss.
Those of us who had the chance to pitch a
story to Robert or faced the challenge of re-
sponding to his questions knew he was deeply
knowledgeable about health care. For 40
years, he reported on every major health care
story and raised many issues that became
major stories based on his reporting. He knew
the laws that were in place, studied the poli-
cies being proposed to change those laws,
and combed proposed legislation to get the
details right. I knew that I had to know my
stuff when Robert Pear called, because he
would ask smart questions that demanded se-
rious and thoughtful answers.
What always impressed me about Robert
was his interest in looking at how the Con-
gressional debate would affect real people.
Health care wasn’t just an inside-the-Beltway
political conflict in Robert’s reporting, it was a
debate that had real-life consequences for ev-
eryone in every part of our nation. He would
read the footnotes of GAO reports but would
be even more interested in talking with my
constituents about how high cost-sharing or
lifetime limits affected their family budgets. He
was masterful in being able to translate ar-
cane policy into understandable language—in-
forming both policymakers and the public. We
all paid attention to a Robert Pear article.
Robert was a great reporter and he was a
great and kind person. Robert always made
you feel that he respected your views and was
grateful for the time you gave him. He was in-
terested in all perspectives and viewpoints. He
would regularly check in with my long time
Chief of Staff and health policy expert, Cathy
Hurwit. He always said thank you—and you
know he meant it. He would often send follow-
up emails to share something that he thought
might be of interest. He was the nation’s pre-
eminent health care reporter, but he was
never a self-promoter. His goal was always to
get the story and to get it right.
We have lost an important and astute
chronicler of health care. After four decades of
relying on his reporting, it is hard to imagine
that we will never again read another Robert
Pear article in The New York Times. My deep
condolences go to his brother Douglas, his
friends, and all those who got to know Robert
Pear the reporter and the person.

CONGRATULATING WENDY BARON
ON HER RETIREMENT
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize a true public servant on her re-
tirement. Wendy Baron retires today from the
Idaho National Laboratory as the Emergency
Communications Department manager.
Her remarkable journey at the lab started in
the early 1980’s. She first held a summer job
at Argonne National Laboratory-West while
she was in college and then returned after
earning a degree in communications at Idaho
State University in the public affairs office.
She left to work in private consulting in the
90’s but found her way back to the lab in
2000. During this time, she also began volun-
teering with the Chubbuck Fire Department. I
am not sure if it was that first EMT call to the
Chubbuck Flying J where she delivered a
baby in the front seat of a minivan, but it was
in this job that Wendy discovered a passion
for firefighting and emergency response. So
Wendy turned her volunteer passion into her
career.
In 2005 at 41 years old, Wendy became a
member of the Idaho National Laboratory Fire
Department. She trained hard to pass the
physical test, including dragging a toboggan
loaded with rock salt around her neighborhood
at 4 a.m. Wendy immediately became active
in union activities and leadership at the INLFD
and just two years later, she helped lead the
effort to reorganize the 75-member depart-
ment into the International Association of Fire-
fighters and served as the new local’s presi-
dent. That same year, Wendy was named the
2007 INL Firefighter of the year and was elect-
ed to serve on the executive board of the Pro-
fessional Fire Fighters of Idaho (PFFI). She
was then named PFFI Fire Fighter of the Year
in 2009.
In 2013, Wendy was promoted to assistant
fire chief for planning and logistics. Today,
there are seven women in the INLFD, one of
them a battalion chief. Fire Chief Eric
Gosswiller credits Wendy for laying the
groundwork for them.
Wendy is quick to credit those around her
for her success. But even despite her humility,
it is clear that Wendy is extraordinarily tal-
ented, hardworking, and dedicated. These
qualities have resulted in the great respect
and affection that her colleagues share for
her.
I know Wendy looks forward to spending
more time with her family in retirement, espe-
cially her husband Victor. She will also enjoy
more sailing, backpacking, scuba and partici-
pating in competitive swimming and running
events.
On behalf of a grateful community, I con-
gratulate Wendy Baron on an incredibly suc-
cessful and admirable career, and I wish you
all the best in your well-deserved retirement.

HONORING ETHEL MAE MCCULLUM
100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
honor of a remarkable milestone reached by a
wonderful constituent in my district. On May 8,
2019 we will celebrate the 100th birthday of
Ms. Ethel Mae McCullum. It is my distinct
honor to help celebrate the occasion.
Ethel was born in Dunn, North Carolina to
her parents Slona Streeter and Grant Bullard
Streeter. She had two siblings, John Streeter
and Beulah Lee. For 23 years, Ethel worked
for the State of New York, and for 33 years
she has been a resident of Tilden Towers II in
the Bronx.
Ethel was always very involved with Tilden
Towers II, working diligently with the Board for
decades. But she was also involved in a host
of other organizations. She is a lifetime mem-
ber of the local chapter of the National Council
of Negro Women (NCNW), participating in
many of the group’s fundraisers, annual lunch-
eons, and other events. She is also a longtime
member of Abyssinian Baptist Church—over
80 years to be precise—and her first ever
Pastor was Rev. Adam Clayton Powell III.
Ethel’s stories about growing up in rural
North Carolina have always been a hit with
the seniors living in the community. Her per-
sonality is, and always has been, loving and
caring to all she encounters, and it shows.
Many people refer to Ethel as ‘‘everyone’s
Nana.’’ And while she is beloved by all, she is

in actuality the matriarch of an astounding 5
generations. Ethel loves her family deeply,
and always made sure to send every one of
her grandchildren and great grandchildren
cards on their birthdays.
Madam Speaker, it’s hard to put into words
what Ethel Mae McCullum has meant to our
community. Everyone knows what a warm and
caring individual she is, and everyone knows
just how many lives she has touched. 100
years is a remarkable milestone, and Ethel is
an equally remarkable person. On this very
special occasion, I want to congratulate Ethel
and personally send her my warmest wishes.

TRIBUTE TO MS. EARNESTINE
RASBERRY
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 9, 2019
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor the life
of Ms. Earnestine Rasberry who was affection-
ately known by her family, friends and loved-
ones as ‘‘Mommy’’. Ms. Rasberry was born on
December 15, 1940 in Edwards, Mississippi,
to the late Genella Jones and Floyd Hopkins,
Sr. She accepted Christ at an early age while
living in Mississippi and later moved to Chi-
cago while a teenager. In April of 1965 she
and Mr. Moses Rasberry were united in holy
matrimony. Earnestine enrolled in Malcom X
College and earned and Associates of
Science Degree in Nursing and began her
nursing a career at Cook County Hospital
where she worked for many years and then
retired from Hartgrove Hospital in 2005. Her
nursing career spanned for fifty years. Fifty
years of looking after and caring for others. In
addition to nursing, Earnestine had strong in-
terests in traveling and cooking. A few of her
favorite destinations included Alaska, Antarc-
tica and China. The highlight of one of her
many excursions was meeting Grammy Award
winning Gerald Levert. Earnestine knew her
way around the kitchen and hosted many holi-
day meals for family and friends. Cooking was
one of her ways she expressed her love.
Earnestine was the matriarch of her family and
was instrumental. All of you should be com-
forted by these words. And I say ‘‘let not your
heart be troubled, you who believe in God,
also believe in Earnestine. Her father’s house
has many rooms; if it was not so, would I not
have told you so. She is gone to prepare a
place for you, and where she is, you will be
there also. And if she goes and prepares a
place for you, she will come back and take
you to be with her and you will be where she
is. You know the way to the place where she
is going.’’ You can go where she is.
