OATH CEREMONY ON SEPTEMBER
6, 2019
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pleasure and sincerity that I take this
time to congratulate twenty-nine individuals
who will take their oaths of citizenship on Sep-
tember 6, 2019. This memorable occasion will
be held at the United States Courthouse and
Federal Building in Hammond, Indiana.
America is a county founded by immigrants.
From its beginning, settlers have come from
countries around the world to the United
States in search of better lives for their fami-
lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example
of what is so great about the United States of
America—that people from all over the world
can come together and unite as members of
a free, democratic nation. These individuals
realize that nowhere else in the world offers a
better opportunity for success than here in
America.
On September 6, 2019, the following peo-
ple, representing many nations throughout the
world, will take their oaths of citizenship in
Hammond, Indiana: Mohamed Refaat Ahmed
Saleh, Dominic Thomas Chaloner, Phennapha
Flood, Jose Luis Perea, Ubaid Mohammed,
Rosalinda Martinez Canales, Cirilo Favela,

Lehner, Virginia Lehner, Ralph Maximiliano
Cortes, Eder Jahir Nunez Benitez, Jose Luis
Martinez, Jessika Alejandra Lemere,
Devashish Ratankumar Pal, and Sumedha
Dhar.
Although each individual has sought to be-
come a citizen of the United States for his or
her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-
tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives,
each is inspired by the fact that the United
States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-
scribed it, a country ‘‘ . . . of the people, by
the people, and for the people.’’ They realize
that the United States is truly a free nation. By
seeking American citizenship, they have made
the decision that they want to live in a place
where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment
of the Constitution, they can practice religion
as they choose, speak their minds without fear
of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-
test should they choose to do so.
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask you and
my other distinguished colleagues to join me
in congratulating these individuals who will be-
come citizens of the United States of America
on September 6, 2019. They, too, will be
American citizens, guaranteed the inalienable
rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. We, as a free and democratic nation,
congratulate them and welcome them.

TRIBUTE TO THE LOS ANGELES
LGBT CENTER
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the Los Angeles LGBT Center upon
its 50th Anniversary.
The center has worked tirelessly for over
half a century to support the lesbian, gay, bi-
sexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) commu-
nity, combat bigotry, and create a more toler-
ant and equitable world. The center has pro-
moted its values of integrity, respect, inclusive-
ness, innovation, and excellence throughout
its prestigious history, helping LGBTQ people
to thrive.
The Los Angeles LGBT Center assists over
half a million people each year through its
housing, healthcare, legal aid, and education
programs, among countless other services.
The Anita May Rosenstein Campus, opened in
April, 2019, embodies the center’s continuing
mission, providing housing and wellness serv-
ices to LGBTQ youth and seniors and serving
as a symbol of the LGBTQ community’s resil-
ience and creativity. In addition, the center has
provided free Internet access, computer skills,
and resume creation through its David Bohnett
CyberCenter, cultivating a more informed and
well-connected community.
The center has been on the frontline of the
fight against HIV/AIDS since the earliest days
of the epidemic in the 1980s. The center pro-
vides HIV and AIDS specialty care, maintains
HIV and STD testing and prevention pro-
grams, and conducts studies and clinical trials
aimed at ending the epidemic.
Today, supported by hundreds of volunteers
and employees, the center works from local to
global, training activists and advancing
LGBTQ advocacy as nearby as Los Angeles
and as far away as China. Additionally, the
center shares information and expertise with
sister organizations in order to support LGBTQ
people around the globe.
I am proud to recognize the Los Angeles
LGBT Center for five decades of outstanding
service to the LGBTQ community. I ask all
members to join me in congratulating them for
their remarkable achievements.

through its commitment to the community’s
youth. This organization serves more than
8,000 children year-round and provides them
with the opportunity to succeed. Through after-
school and summer programming, participants
engage in cultural arts, sports, tutoring, and
mentorship to learn character and leadership
skills that will guide them for the rest of their
lives.
The Boys & Girls Club has profoundly im-
pacted our district and the students involved.
Participants’ high school graduation rates are
double those in Miami-Dade County. Edu-
cation and mentorship are critical to a child’s
success and the diligent efforts of the Boys &
Girls Club have resonated across South Flor-
ida.
The Boys & Girls Club began with one
building and recreation center in 1940 and has
grown to five centers across Miami-Dade. I am
truly inspired by the Boys & Girls Club’s dedi-
cation to our community and their passion for
enriching the lives of the children they serve.
South Florida is richer and fuller thanks to
their work.

HONORING TEXAS STATE
TROOPER MOISES SANCHEZ
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the life of Texas Depart-
ment of Public Safety Trooper Moises San-
chez, who passed away on Saturday, August
24, 2019. Moises spent his life protecting and
serving the people of Texas with distinction,
and it is my privilege to commemorate his
contributions to our state, community, and
country today.
He was a proud United States Marine Corps
veteran. He also spent 18 years with FedEx
before becoming a Texas State Trooper. He
coached at the Boys & Girls Club and was in-
volved in self-defense classes at his local
church.
Moises cherished time with his family—from
movie nights to barbeques and mountain
biking. He passed away from a surgery asso-
ciated with injuries sustained in the line of
duty. Moises is survived by his wife, Yvonne
Sanchez and his three children Zachary,
Zebastian, and Zoey Sanchez.
Madam Speaker, our country lost a public
servant, husband, father, and hero this past
August. It is an honor to represent brave,
loyal, and hard-working individuals like Troop-
er Moises Sanchez. He was a source of
strength in South Texas and he will be truly
missed by his friends, family, and loved ones.

HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF SALUD PARA LA
GENTE
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and celebrate the 40th Anniver-
sary of Salud Para La Gente. Since 1978,
Salud Para La Gente has provided com-
prehensive primary healthcare to low income
community members of Santa Cruz and Mon-
terey Counties. This non-profit healthcare pro-
vider is dedicated to the values of service, dig-
nity and equity. Salud Para La Gente provides
excellent care by ensuring that patients are
treated with respect, regardless of income.
The organization started with a single free
clinic, offering care primarily to farmworkers on
the central coast of California. Since then, it
has expanded to 11 clinic sites with over 90
providers serving nearly 27,000 patients.
Salud Para La Gente provides wide-ranging
services including family health, reproductive
health, pediatrics, dental, vision, wellness,
counseling, and other types of specialty serv-
ices.
California’s Central Coast produces much of
our country’s fruits and vegetables but suffers
from poor health among its working commu-
nity. Salud Para La Gente has tackled this
problem by focusing on issues including poor
nutrition, obesity and diabetes to ensure that
farmworkers and other low-income families on
the Central Coast can lead healthy lives. The
clinics of Salud Para La Gente work under the
motto, ‘‘even if you are unable to pay, you will
not be turned away.’’ This ensures that the
most vulnerable residents of the Central Coast
can receive quality healthcare. Salud Para La
Gente focuses on all facets of care including
testing, treatment, prevention and long-term
treatment.
I am also proud to recognize Salud Para La
Gente as an exemplary women’s healthcare
provider. Their clinics in Santa Cruz County in-
clude family planning, pregnancy care, child-
birth and breast cancer screening. With their
two women’s healthcare offices, Salud Para
La Gente has reached many milestones. For
example, in 2016, they established the first
Santa Cruz County OBGYN Hospitalist Team,
which provides around-the-clock care at
Watsonville Community Hospital. Through this
program, the team delivers roughly 90 new-
born babies each month to low-income fami-
lies.
Salud Para La Gente is more than just a
health care provider. From assisting patients
with applying for CalFresh to providing mental
health support and healthy diet counseling, it
is a pillar of community well-being. Having
made such incredible progress from their first
free clinic in 1978, I am honored to recognize
Salud Para La Gente and its important con-
tributions to the health of residents on the
Central Coast of California over the past 40
years. Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues join me in congratulating and thanking
Salud Para La Gente for 40 years of service
to our underserved communities.

HON. LIZ CHENEY
OF WYOMING
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the completion of the Jenny Lake
Trail Renewal Project in Grand Teton National
Park.
Grant Teton National Park is one of the
most majestic places to visit anywhere in the
world. The Jenny Lake Trail Renewal Project
will increase accessibility to Jenny Lake and
also offer more scenic views for visitors to
enjoy. I want to thank the National Park Serv-
ice and the Grand Teton National Park Foun-
dation who have contributed to this project.
Without the help of public and private funds,
this restoration would not have been possible.
Again, Madam Speaker, I want to com-
memorate the completion of the Jenny Lake
Trail Renewal Project, and the hard work and
dedication of the many people who made it
possible.

IN RECOGNITION OF WOODFORD
‘‘WOODY’’ L. JOHNSON, SR.
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Woodford ‘‘Woody’’ L.
Johnson, Sr. a native of Laneview, Virginia,
Essex County, who will be retiring after 48
years of service with the Tappahannock Police
Department. Mr. Johnson is also a U.S. Army
veteran who served our country proudly with
the 101st Airborne in Vietnam.
Woody was employed by the Tappahannock
Police Department in December 1971 as a po-
lice officer. At that time, there were only four
police officers in the department. Woody has
seen many changes in law enforcement and
society since that time but has always been
professional and dedicated to the community
he serves. He has truly been an example of
what a law enforcement officer should be.
Woody served several years as the Town
Sergeant for Tappahannock and was pro-
moted to Lieutenant in 1995. He is also a
graduate of the Virginia Forensic Science
Academy and has served for many years as
the department’s forensic technician. Woody is
also a baseball and softball umpire for both
high school and church league games. Woody
has one son, Woody Jr., who is employed by
the Federal Reserve in Richmond, daughter
in-law Kelley, and grandson Mason.
In an era where people change jobs and oc-
cupations frequently, Woody has stayed true
to his chosen profession. The Tappahannock
Police Department has been extremely fortu-
nate to have had someone like Woody John-
son and he will be missed by his fellow offi-
cers but most of all, by the community.

strives to make a positive impact in the lives
of her fellow citizens. I have known Ernestina
since 2011 when I was first elected to Con-
gress, and she has proved to be an exemplary
member of my team.
Congress is an institution devoted to serving
the people, and Ernestina has exemplified this
every day by meeting with veterans, immi-

mitted to being both a voice and a resource
for the people. We look to Ernestina as a de-

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL
GASTROPARESIS AWARENESS
MONTH
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of the millions of gastroparesis
patients from across the country in recognition
of National Gastroparesis Awareness Month.
This devastating digestive disorder can be
detrimental to a patient’s quality of life, and
current treatments are only able to help pa-
tients manage these symptoms. It’s for these
reasons that I’m a proud cosponsor of H.R.
3396, the Functional GI and Motility Disorders
Research Enhancement Act. This important
legislation would help to expand, advance,
and better coordinate research activities on
functional GI and motility disorders and sup-
port innovative approaches to educate patients
and health care providers about strategies that
improve care.
In recognition of the plight of these patients
and the uncertainty they often face, I urge my
colleagues to join me in supporting efforts to
expand research, improve education, and
raise awareness by cosponsoring H.R. 3396
and recognizing August as National
Gastroparesis Awareness Month.

HONORING THE UNITED STATES
NAVAL INSTITUTE AND JACK C.
TAYLOR
HON. JOHN JOYCE
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, in 1873 a group of Navy and Marine Corps
officers founded The United States Naval Insti-
tute on the grounds of the United States Naval
Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Since that
time, the Institute has played a vital role in
transforming the Sea Services from vocations
to tried and true professions. The Naval Insti-
tute’s mission is to provide an open, inde-
pendent, and nonpartisan forum for those who
read, think, speak, and write to advance the
knowledge and understanding of sea power
and other issues critical to global security.
Constantly growing and improving, the United
States Naval Institute will reach a milestone in
its esteemed history by breaking ground for
the Jack C. Taylor Conference Center, which
will adjoin the Naval Institute’s headquarters.
Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor on 7
December 1941, Jack C. Taylor joined the
United States Navy. During his years of mili-
tary service (1942 to 1947), Taylor became an
F6F Hellcat fighter pilot and saw combat duty
in the Pacific Theater from the decks of the
aircraft carriers USS Essex (CV–9) and USS
Enterprise (CV–6). He was a member of Car-
rier Air Group 15, led by the top Navy ace of
all time, Commander David McCampbell.
Group 15, which sustained more than 50 per-
cent casualties during its World War II service,
was one of the most decorated combat units
in the history of U.S. naval aviation. Taylor,
who served as McCampbell’s wingman on
several combat missions, was twice decorated
with the Distinguished Flying Cross, and also
received the Navy Air Medal and the Presi-
dential Unit Citation.
Mr. Taylor served his country with distinction
in World War II, returned home, raised a tal-
ented family and built a world-class organiza-
tion, ‘Enterprise Rent-A-Car,’ named after the
famous aircraft carrier on which he flew. The
late Mr. Jack C. Taylor and his family rein-
vested resources for the good of the commu-
nity and his family continues to remain com-
mitted to the United States Navy, Navy values
and Naval causes that include the Naval War
College, Naval Historical Foundation, U.S.
Naval Aviation Museum, Friends of the Na-
tional World War II Memorial and Navy SEAL
Foundation to name a few. The Taylor Family
now honors their patriarch’s service to the Na-
tion as a naval aviator, an exemplary citizen,
and a civic leader with the naming of the Con-
ference Center.
In heartfelt appreciation of its many con-
tributions to the men and women of the United
States Sea Services, it is my honor and privi-
lege before the 116th Congress to recognize
the United States Naval Institute on the occa-
sion of its groundbreaking for the Jack C. Tay-
lor Conference Center, 18 September 2019.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
JEFFREY M. CICORA
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
remember the life of New York State Police
Sergeant/Station Commander Jeffrey M.
Cicora, a beloved father and husband, and
dedicated public servant, who passed away on
August 10, 2019. Sergeant Cicora spent 24
years on the New York State Police force and
diligently protected communities throughout
New York State.
Sergeant Cicora was a lifelong member of
the Central New York community and aspired
to be a state trooper from an early age. He
graduated from Auburn High School in 1983
and then earned a degree in criminal justice
from Cayuga Community College and public
justice from SUNY Oswego. Upon completing
his training in 1992, Sergeant Cicora was offi-
cially sworn in as a New York State Police
Trooper.
Sergeant Cicora was stationed at the
Baldwinsville State Police Station for the ma-
jority of his career, but his duties called him to
various regions in New York State. During the
tragic events of September 11, 2001, Ser-
geant Cicora arrived at Ground Zero and as-
sisted with search and rescue efforts. In the
six months following the attacks, Sergeant
Cicora and his K9 partner, Devitt, deployed to
New York City’s John F. Kennedy and
LaGuardia airports to ensure traveler safety.
Notably, Sergeant Cicora was awarded the
Superintendent’s Commendation Award from
the New York State Police for his efforts in the
arrest of an on-the-run fugitive wanted for vio-
lent crimes. Sergeant Cicora and his K9 part-
ner, McGinn, were the first to respond fol-
lowing the fugitive’s attack on two people, then
successfully tracked him through the woods
and made an arrest.
Outside his work with the state police, Ser-
geant Cicora was a wonderful family man. He
deeply loved his wife, Valerie, and son, Jack,
as well as all his extended family members.
He was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed
spending time fishing and boating with his
family.
Sergeant Cicora served honorably and,
sadly, contracted an illness stemming from his
emergency search and rescue efforts at
Ground Zero. It is essential our nation sup-
ports the brave individuals and first respond-
ers who selflessly acted on September 11,
2001 without reservation. Many of these brave
individuals, like Sergeant Cicora, have devel-
oped health conditions from their experiences
at Ground Zero. We owe these individuals an
enormous debt of gratitude, and with my sup-
port, the House passed legislation I cospon-
sored to permanently reauthorize the 9/11 Vic-
tim Compensation Fund. This bill is now law,
but we must continue to support the brave
men and women who responded on 9/11.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
House to join me in honoring the life of Ser-
geant Jeffrey M. Cicora. A brave member of
New York State’s law enforcement community
who acted heroically throughout his career,
Sergeant Cicora will truly be missed in the
Central New York community. I ask my col-
leagues to keep him and his family in mind as
we remember the contributions of this cher-
ished public servant.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PRO-
TECTING INDEPENDENT CON-
TRACTORS FROM DISCRIMINA-
TION ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Protecting Independent Contrac-
tors from Discrimination Act, which would ex-
tend to independent contractors the same fed-
eral antidiscrimination protections enjoyed by
employees. My bill would extend the following
antidiscrimination statutes, which apply to em-
ployees, to independent contractors: Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act of 1967, Title I
of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section
505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title
II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
Act of 2008.
In a Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005 anal-
ysis of the American workforce, approximately
seven percent were considered independent
contractors. That number has surely only
grown in the 13 years since that analysis with
the growth of the so-called ‘‘gig economy.’’
Independent contractors, who often do the
same work as employees, have almost none
of the same protections, including health insur-
ance, collective bargaining, retirement security
and even antidiscrimination. My bill focuses
only on discrimination, such as discrimination
based on race, age and gender, from which
every worker is entitled to be free.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to extend my deepest congratulations to
the Bradley County, Arkansas 4–H Forestry
Team and to Braden Harrod on their excep-
tional representation of the Natural State on a
national level.
Braden Harrod, Gregory Hilliard, David
McGhee, and Madison McGhee, of Hermitage,
Arkansas were named National Champions at
the 40th Annual National 4–H Forestry Invita-
tional. Braden Harrod also won the high point
individual award during the competition. The

This is the third Bradley County 4–H national

The national event featured skills testing in
various areas such as tree identification, tree
measurement, compass and pacing, insect
and disease identification, topographic map
use, forest evaluation, the forestry bowl, and a
written forestry exam.
Mr. Greenwood and these students exhibit
exemplary work ethic and superior skill in
preparation for this competition each year. As
a fellow forester, it is a supreme encourage-
ment to see young Fourth District Arkansans
nurture a knowledge of good resource man-
agement and stewardship. I look forward to
witnessing the further success of these stu-
dents as they continue to represent our district

I rise today to celebrate the life of William
David (Bill) Smith, III, who passed away on
Friday, August 9th at the age of 94.
Bill was born on January 16, 1925, in Hous-
ton, Mississippi. He was a lifelong resident of
Houston and served his city as Mayor from
1993 to 2001. Bill graduated from Ole Miss
where he met his wife, Mary Liddell Smith.
They were blessed with 3 children and were
happily married for 71 years.
Bill lived a life of service to his community
and country. Bill was a World War II veteran,
serving with the Navy in the South Pacific. In
addition to his time as the Mayor of Houston,
he was a founding member of the Houston
Exchange Club, and the Houston Country
Club. Additionally, he was the Minister of
Music at First Baptist Church, the Chairman of
the Chickasaw County Board of Development,
a member of Houston Proud, the VFW, and
the Houston Touchdown Club.
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Mary
Liddell Smith; his son, David Smith; his daugh-
ter, Debby Freeman; as well as many grand-
children and great-grandchildren.
Bill’s life was one of service, grace, love for
his family, and community. He will be greatly
missed by all whom he encountered.

GENERATIONS OF PASTORAL
LEADERSHIP: REV. E.V. HILL II
HON. KAREN BASS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I mourn with
the family, friends and congregation of Rev.
Edward V. Hill II, who passed away suddenly
on August 12 at the age of 52.
He pastored at both Mt. Zion Missionary
Baptist Church and Spirit of Zion Church in
Los Angeles, California, and thousands are
expected to honor him at homegoing services
to be held at West Angeles Church of God in
Christ.
Rev. Hill was the son of famed preacher
and evangelist E.V. Hill, who Time Magazine
once honored as one of the seven most out-
standing preachers in the United States, and
who Ebony Magazine listed as one of the 15
greatest Black preachers. Proud of his herit-
age, Rev. Hill had built his own considerable
reputation and spoke frequently at churches
across the country. His colleagues in ministry
have noted how he took his father’s mantle
and wore it with grace. Bishop Charles Blake
noted that ‘‘My world is diminished since he is
no longer in it.’’
From a very young age, Rev. Hill showed a
strong interest in Bible study and prayer, and
a commitment to church service and revivals.
He grew up in Los Angeles and attended the
University of Southern California, earning a
degree in Communications with a minor in
Spanish. Following his father’s counsel he en-
rolled in Pepperdine School of Law, but soon
realized his true passion for the ministry which
would become his life-long pursuit.
That passion led him to devote his energy
to learning every aspect of the Mt. Zion Min-
istry, then to the senior pastorship of Calvary
Temple Pentecostal Holiness Church and fi-
nally, on his father’s passing, to take the reins
at Mt. Zion himself in 2005. He sought new
ways to engage people, and was known for
his active music ministries and revivals. He
brought creativity and dynamic preaching to
his work to help change people’s lives for the
better.
I offer my sincere condolences to his family,
friends and congregants. He will be remem-
bered for his compassion, his creativity, his
powerful oratory, and his life-long dedication to
preaching the gospel.

HONORING MARGIE CARLSON ON
HER 100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Margie Carlson on her 100th
Birthday. Ms. Carlson was born August 7,
1919 in rural Prophetstown, Illinois to the late
Letha and August Carlson.
Ms. Carlson grew up in Prophetstown and
went on to get her degree at Northern College
in DeKalb, now known as Northern Illinois Uni-
versity. Ms. Carlson went on to start her
teaching career at a country school called
Highland, and then taught in the Tampico
school system for 40 years before she retired.
She is a lifelong member of the First Lutheran
Church in Prophetstown, where a birthday re-
ception was held in her honor. Ms. Carlson
enjoys working with her quilting group every
Monday morning at church, and weather per-
mitting, taking walks every day. I am touched
to have such an example of heart in our com-
munity.
Madam Speaker, I would like to again for-
mally honor Ms. Carlson on her 100th Birth-
day. It is because of community leaders such
as Ms. Margie Carlson that I am especially
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict.
IN HONOR OF THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF CALEF’S COUNTRY
STORE
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 150th anniversary of Calef’s
Country Store. For a century and a half,
Calef’s Country Store has served both locals
and visitors with quality New Hampshire prod-
ucts and kept alive traditions integral to the
Granite State’s rural character.
Opened in 1869, Calef’s Country Store has
remained a pillar of the Barrington community
over all these years. Five generations of the
Calef family operated the beloved store, and
while the family no longer owns the store, it
remains deeply rooted in its traditions. It still
makes many of its products, such as ‘‘Snappy
Old Cheddar’’ cheese and wooden barrel pick-
les, and is a strong supporter of fellow New
Hampshire small businesses.
Calef’s employees are proud of the store’s
tradition and serve as ambassadors for our
state’s traditions and welcoming spirit. Joel
Sherburne, an employee for nearly 62 years,
shares stories and relays history to customers
at his deli counter, forging a strong sense of
community in the store. It is this focus on
community that makes Calef’s so special.
From its local products to its longtime employ-
ees, Calef’s is more than a store: it is a com-
munity center that keeps New Hampshire’s
rural traditions and customs alive.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
congratulate Calef’s Country Store on 150
years of service to its community and the
State of New Hampshire. Its commitment to
quality Granite State products and to New
Hampshire’s long held traditions have solidi-
fied its status as a landmark in our state. Let
us celebrate this anniversary by thanking
Calef’s Country Store and its current and
former employees for making New Hampshire
such a wonderful place to live, shop, and eat.

IN RECOGNITION OF NIOBRARA
STRONG DAY 2019
HON. LIZ CHENEY
OF WYOMING
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 4th annual Niobrara Strong
Day and the hard work of the local community
to put this event together.
Niobrara Strong Day began in 2016—ex-
actly one year after catastrophic flooding dev-
astated much of the county—as a way to revi-
talize the community. It is an event where the
community can come together and grow
stronger through car washes, food stands, and
rides for children of all ages. It is a day that
the community is reminded of their strength
and can celebrate how far they have come
since the devastating floods.
Again, Madam Speaker, I commemorate the
4th annual Niobrara Strong Day and admire
the resilience displayed by the people of
Niobrara County.
IN HONOR OF HECTOR FORESTIER
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today, I rise
to recognize and honor Hector Forestier for
his outstanding service in the United States
Air Force and his dedication to the State of
Texas.
Before his commission to the United States
Air Force, Hector earned his Bachelor’s De-
gree in Business Administration from the Uni-
versity of Puerto Rico and a Master’s degree
in Personnel Management from Webster Uni-
versity. As a well-rounded graduate, Hector
chose to serve his country as a Second Lieu-
tenant to the United States Air Force, launch-
ing a lifetime of public service to our nation
and state.
A leader from the start, Hector began his
distinguished 17 year career in the military by
earning the position of Cost and Management
Analysis Officer at Laughlin Air Force Base in
1979 in Del Rio, Texas. Soon after, he was
promoted to Wing Budget Officer. Hector con-
tinued his service both overseas and domesti-
cally as a Comptroller, Deputy Commander for
Resource Management, and the Chief Finan-
cial Advisor to the Wing Commander.
In recognition of his outstanding work ethic
and dedication, Hector was awarded the Meri-
torious Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clus-
ters. He was also awarded the Air Force Com-
mendation Medal, and his multitude of honors
and awards serves as a testament to his com-
mitment and success in the Air Force.
After retiring from the military in 1995, Hec-
tor found a new way to serve, and he held the
position of City Manager for multiple cities in
Texas. In 2009, our community was lucky to
have Hector appointed as the City Manager of
Willis, Texas. In this role, he emphasized need
for growth by encouraging economic develop-
ment while simultaneously preserving the his-
toric culture and values of Willis. Under his
leadership, Willis successfully welcomed a
Kroger and an Entergy power plant, and ex-
panded their sewer plant. All of these accom-
plishments have increased both overall growth
and economic opportunity for the proud resi-
dents of our community.
It’s no surprise that Hector’s involvement
continues far beyond his role as City Manager.
Hector is a proud member of the Conroe Ro-
tary Club, the Greater Conroe Economic De-
velopment Board, the City of Conroe Tourist
Council, the Texas City Managers Association
and was the Treasurer on the Montgomery
County United Way Board. Additionally, Hector
is the former Chairman of the Conroe/Lake
Conroe Chamber of Commerce, and a grad-
uate of Leadership Montgomery County.
Today, it is my honor to celebrate the dec-
ades of impactful service of a decorated vet-
eran and admirable civic leader. His vision,
leadership, and commitment have made our
region a better place. I am proud to join Hec-
tor’s wife Sarah, their three daughters, and his
many colleagues to thank Hector for his years
of service and wish him well as he begins his
well-earned retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENT
OF NEAL HENDERSON
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in congratulating Coach Neal Henderson
on his induction into the U.S. Hockey Hall of
Fame. Over the past 40 years, Coach Hender-
son has led the Fort Dupont Ice Hockey Club,
known as the Cannons.
Henderson fell in love with hockey at a
young age when his father, a Merchant Ma-
rine, was stationed in St. Catharines, Ontario
during World War II. After moving back to the
U.S., he settled in the District of Columbia in
the 1960s with his family. He shared his love
of hockey with those willing to learn and soon
recognized interest in the game far exceeded
the narrow streets of the District where he
taught neighborhood kids.
To meet the demand, Henderson started
renting ice space at the Fort Dupont Ice Arena
and, in 1978, he established the Cannons with
his high school classmate, Betty Dean. For the
next 40 years, he coached the Cannons at
Fort Dupont Ice Arena and continues to be a
community icon. Coach Henderson saw hock-
ey as an opportunity to give youth from pre-
dominantly low-income communities a chance
to play and develop greater connections
through the game. Henderson’s Fort Dupont
Ice Hockey Club is a developmental program
that provides local and inner-city youth with
the opportunity to participate in an organized
ice hockey program. The team colors are
black, gold and white, symbolic of African-
American history in the District—black sol-
diers, brass buttons and white officers.
The Cannons is one of the oldest minority
hockey club in North America. The team is
made up of 50 players between the ages of
8–18 predominantly from Southwest and
Northwest D.C. neighborhoods and has been
recognized by the Washington Capitals. Hen-
derson and his players had the unique oppor-
tunity to touch the Stanley Cup in June 2018
when the Capitals came to Fort Dupont.
Henderson’s organization has supported
over 1,000 children since its inception in 1978
and encourages students to succeed beyond
the rink. Coach Henderson’s program has an
85% high school graduation rate, and he in-
corporates educational activities, such as visits
to museums and colleges, when the team
travels for tournaments.
Henderson embodies the best values of the
District of Columbia and its residents. Madam
Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives
to join me in recognizing Neal Henderson for
his achievements and contributions to the Dis-
trict of Columbia and its children, and for his
well-deserved induction into the Hockey Hall
of Fame.

LEGENDARY POLITICAL ACTIVIST
DARREN PARKER
HON. KAREN BASS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, last month
California lost an esteemed political colleague
and tireless advocate, Mr. Darren Parker. He
championed racial equality and civil rights, es-
pecially for African Americans, and his career
was one of public service and selfless con-
tributions.
From a very young age, Darren showed a
strong interest in political engagement. At just
11 years old, he teamed up with a few family
members to found One Hundred Thousand
Students for the Freedom of South Africa,
gathering peers in his grandmother’s Compton
home to support the anti-apartheid struggles
half a world away.
His passion for politics continued through
his college years, then as a union rep with the
Communication Workers of America during his
20-year career with Pacific Bell. Early on, he
became involved with the Democratic Party, in
Los Angeles City, Antelope Valley, L.A. Coun-
ty, and the state of California. After years of
involvement, in 2007 he was elected Chair of
the California Democratic Party’s African
American Caucus, aiming to lift up the voices
of African Americans and encourage civic en-
gagement. He was particularly proud of signifi-
cantly increasing voter registration in the Ante-
lope Valley.
His passion for service continued with his
positions on many nonprofit boards and ap-
pointed offices over the course of his life, in-
cluding his appointment to the LA County
Commission for Children and Families.
Wanting to contribute directly to governing
the state, he ran for a seat in the California
Senate in 2011 and in the Assembly in 2016.
In between, he served in state government as
special assistant to California Assembly
Speakers John Pérez, Toni Atkins, and An-
thony Rendon. As a former Speaker myself, I
know how demanding and important that job
is, and I know that he contributed to suc-
cesses in each Speaker’s administration. Re-
markably, during that time he also served as
Executive Director of AFSCME Local 2620 for
two years.
I had the privilege of working with Mr.
Parker many times over the years. I offer my
sincere condolences to his family and friends.
He will be remembered for his influential activ-
ism, indomitable spirit, and life-long dedication
to public service.

IN HONOR OF RAUDE RAYCHEL
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Raude Raychel for her tireless
work on behalf of the Indonesian community in
New Hampshire.
Raude serves as President of the Indo-
nesian Community Connect (ICC), a non-profit
organization based in Somersworth, NH. ICC
hosts community events for the Indonesian
community, shares Indonesian culture and val-
ues with the broader community, and provides
support and information for those building lives
in the United States.
The daughter of immigrants, Raude’s par-
ents always instilled in her a drive to always
make her community stronger. Throughout her
life, Raude has been more than just a model
citizen—she is truly a pillar of our community.
In her role as President of ICC, Raude has
not only upheld and carried on the traditions of
the Indonesian community but also shared
these with the entire Seacoast region. The
contributions of the Indonesian community
have made Somersworth and all of New
Hampshire a better place to live. I am particu-
larly proud of her efforts to bring local munic-
ipal officials and the Indonesian Consulate and
Embassy together to discuss creating the
country’s first ‘Little Indonesia’ in
Somersworth.
Like so many other Granite Staters, I have
been lucky enough to learn about Indonesian
culture through ICC’s events and festivals. On
behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire’s
First Congressional District, I want to thank
Raude for her decades of dedication to our
community. I thank her for her tireless work for
our community, and for helping to make our
state such a wonderful place to learn, live, and
grow.

HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS

Friday, September 6, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Dorothy Stone around her 100th
Birthday. Ms. Stone was born August 6, 1919

Ms. Stone grew up in Erie, Illinois and grad-
uated from Erie High School in 1937. She
went on to get her teaching degree at Black-
burn College in Carlinville, Illinois and
Marycrest College in Davenport, Iowa. Ms.
Stone then had a long and successful teach-
ing career spanning 35 years in the Erie area
until she retired in the 1970’s. In that time, she
left a long lasting, positive impact on her com-
munity.
It is because of community leaders such as
Ms. Stone that I am especially proud to serve
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam
Speaker, I would like to again formally honor
Ms. Dorothy Stone on her 100th Birthday.

HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the life and military
service of Command Sergeant Major Johnny
Neal Marlow, who passed away on August
20th at the age of 68.
Mr. Marlow was born in Eupora, Mississippi
on May 28, 1951. He answered the call to
serve our great nation as Command Sergeant
Major for the United States Army. He pre-
viously served with the Mississippi Army Na-
tional Guard and was a retired Master Sgt.
with the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol.
Command Sergeant Major Marlow set an ex-
ample for his community by his extensive mili-
tary and public service. Before he passed, he
was currently serving as a Command Ser-
geant Major with the Mississippi State Guard,
as a Carroll County Sheriffs Deputy, as the
Carroll County Veterans Service Officer, and
was the president of Veterans Helping Vet-
erans in Carroll County.
Left to cherish his memory is his wife
Christy Costilow Marlow of Carrollton, Mis-
sissippi; his sons, Chris Marlow of Long
Beach, Mississippi and Jeff Marlow of Ocean
Springs, Mississippi; his sisters, Sheila
Newsom, Carolyn Hodges, Peggy Brister, and
Billie Garner; his brother Gayle Marlow; as
well as eight grandchildren, one great-grand-
child and many nieces and nephews.
Command Sergeant Major Johnny Neal
Marlow’s life was one of service, grace, love
for his family, and community. He will be
greatly missed by all whom he encountered.

CELEBRATING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE SAINT REST BAP-
TIST CHURCH
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate Saint Rest Baptist Church in
Fresno, California on the occasion of its 75th
anniversary. The church is a valuable part of
the community and strives to make West Fres-
no a better place for all residents.
The church began in 1944 when West Fres-
no was growing. Reverend A.W. White orga-
nized and raised money to build the church.
The first services were held at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. Levi Rogers. Reverend White did
not know it at the time, but he would be the
first of a long line of pastors of the Saint Rest
Baptist Church.
Over the years, Saint Rest continued to
grow. In its early days, congregants met in a
borrowed army surplus metal building. In
1948, the congregation moved into a former
retail storefront, before building its first church
in 1950.
Saint Rest was without a pastor for some
time, but finally Reverend Hudson Spencer
Moore was named the seventh pastor of the
congregation. Over the next two decades, the
church only continued to grow. As the church
expanded its programs and outreach, it was
clear it was also outgrowing its space. In
1978, church members constructed a new
worship facility.
The congregation of St. Rest have been
greatly involved in their community. Church
pastors and members have instituted a num-
ber of programs to benefit the community.
This includes a food and clothing ministry,
house-to-house revival program, and marriage
workshops. The church also supports local
nonprofits, such as the Poverello House and
the Fresno Rescue Mission. After being ap-
proved for 50l(c)(3) status, Saint Rest estab-
lished the Saint Rest Economic Development
Corporation to increase economic opportuni-
ties for the neighborhood and create a strong-
er quality of life.
This church has had many leaders in its 75-
year history, including Reverend M.F. Clay
who took leadership after Reverend White.
Reverend C.D. Davis started in 1946, then two
years later, Reverend J.L. Hall during the
metal building being dismantled. The first
printed Sunday bulletin started in 1951 during
Reverend Carter’s leadership. Reverend E.C.
Johnson became pastor and under his leader-
ship, the church’s mortgage was paid off. Rev-
erend Hudson soon became head pastor and
then Reverend Riggins.
In 2006, Reverend Shane B. Scott became
senior pastor and had the church address re-
named to 1550 E Rev. Chester Riggins. It was
one of the many successes that happened in
his tenure for Saint Rest Baptist Church. In
2013, Pastor DJ Criner became Senior Pastor
and has traveled throughout the United States
to preach. His dedication to the community
continues to make a difference.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Saint Rest Baptist Church as
it celebrates their 75th anniversary. I wish all
of the members of the congregation continued
health, happiness and prosperity.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DENA
GROSS LEAVENGOOD
HON. KATHY CASTOR
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to celebrate the life of Dena Gross
Leavengood, a tireless advocate for Florida,
our Tampa Bay community and indeed our
planet. Her determined advocacy has left a
profound impact on our community and almost
impossible shoes to fill.
A Florida native, Dena graduated with a
bachelor’s degree in Zoology from the Univer-
sity of Florida and received her master’s de-
gree right here at the University of South Flor-
ida. Dena was a driving force behind The Flor-
ida Aquarium because, even then, she real-
ized its key role in fighting climate change and
saving our planet. Dena served the Aquarium
in key positions, including director of edu-
cational outreach and community liaison.
There are so many areas where Dena was
indispensable. I remember her perhaps most
fondly when in my time as a County Commis-
sioner, she worked with me to fight for health
care for working families in her role as the
founder of the Hillsborough Health Care Coali-
tion. Dena was legendary in leadership roles
for women with the League of Women Voters
and Athena, to name a few. Tomorrow Matters
and the Sierra Club were among so many
other places where Dena left her inimitable
and indelible stamp. As a Hillsborough County
Commissioner, Member of Congress and as
her friend, I witnessed Dena’s tenacity and
steadfast commitment on behalf of her neigh-
bors, friends, Tampa Bay families and people
she would never know, except in her heart.
Dena’s decades of activism and profes-
sional accomplishments earned her the love of
our community and numerous accolades, in-
cluding the 2010 Education Award from the
Health Council of Pinellas County, the 2003
Human Rights Award from the Tampa Human
Rights Council. She also received national
recognition as community liaison with The
Florida Aquarium.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful and
saddened Tampa Bay community, we promise
to reflect on Dena’s life of service to improve
the lives of our neighbors, our community and
our country, and have it serve as a beacon
and inspiration as we undertake the hard work
of going forward without her—as Dena would
certainly insist on us doing. Dena earned a
special place in my heart and of the entire
Tampa Bay community. Dena would be sorely
missed in all times but especially in these
challenging times—we will strive to remember
our indefatigable, Happy Warrior, Dena, if ever
we get discouraged.

Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Meyer on competing and winning four gold
medals at the 2019 National Senior Games in

I am incredibly proud to call Gerry a con-
stituent, and his gold medals in track and field

tion that makes our state great.
Again, Madam Speaker, I want to congratu-
late Gerry Meyer on winning four gold medals,
and representing the best that Wyoming has
to offer.

IN HONOR OF ROGER GALATAS
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today l rise to
recognize and remember the life of a remark-
able member of The Woodlands, Texas com-
munity, Roger L. Galatas, who passed away
on August 29, 2019.
Although he called Montgomery County
home for the last 50 years, Roger was born in
Shreveport, Louisiana on September 21, 1935.
After graduating from Louisiana Tech in 1957
with a degree in geology, Roger served in the
United States Air Force as a meteorologist.
After three years of service, he began working
for Humble Oil & Refining, which later became
Exxon Mobile. A year later, he met his wife
Ann on a blind date, and they married three
months later. The two eventually made the
move to the great state of Texas, where they
settled down in the city of Conroe to raise
their two children.
In 1979, George P. Mitchell offered Roger a
job, and for the next 20 years, Roger served
as President of The Woodlands Operating
Company, L.P., a position he only retired from
after the company was sold. During his time
with the company, he played a key role in cre-
ating iconic landmarks in our community, in-
cluding the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion,
Lake Woodlands, The Woodlands Hospital,
and the John Cooper School.
Roger was a firm believer in the vision of
The Woodlands as a master planned commu-
nity, and helped form ‘‘George’s Coffee
Club’’—a group focused on planning the future
of the township. His love for The Woodlands
even inspired him to venture into the literary
world, and his book, ‘‘The Woodlands: The In-
side Story of Creating a Better Hometown’’
was an insider’s look into the history of his be-
loved hometown.
Passionate about education and family val-
ues, Roger served two terms as president of
the Conroe ISO School Board. His favorite
past-time was reading to the third grade class
at the local elementary school, which was later
renamed Galatas Elementary in his honor.
Though his legacy in The Woodlands is se-
cured for decades to come, none will miss
Roger more than his incredible family. He is
survived by his children, Susan McLean and
Bob Galatas; son- and daughter-in-law, Rich-
ard McLean and Carrie Galatas; and four
grandchildren, Mason McLean, Molly McLean,
Max Galatas, and Grace Galatas.
While the community mourns this tremen-
dous loss, we also celebrate Roger’s remark-
able life and remember his lasting legacy of
groundbreaking innovation. He was an inspira-
tion to all who met him, and I join his family,
friends, and the entire Eighth District of Texas
in honoring his wonderful life and endless de-
votion to our community. Roger, you will be
greatly missed.

RECOGNIZING REVEREND KEN-
NETH NELSON’S OPENING PRAY-
ER BEFORE THE U.S. HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES
HON. DAVID J. TRONE
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I would like
to take this opportunity to recognize Reverend
Kenneth Nelson, a Senior Pastor of the Sen-
eca Community Church. For over a decade,
Reverend Nelson has helped his church foster
a vibrant and robust community. His passion
and leadership have had a resounding impact
on the people of Maryland.
Throughout his time with the church, Rev-
erend Nelson has gone to great lengths to
meet the hunger, health, and job development
needs of his community. As Montgomery Col-
lege’s Director of Business and Community
Outreach for the Department of Workforce De-
velopment and Continuing Education, Rev-
erend Nelson offers academic and career ad-
vice to community members. Among his many
other roles, Reverend Nelson has also lent his
expertise to the International Council of Com-
munity Churches Ministers Group and the
Montgomery County Black Minister’s Con-
ference as a Ministerium President and an Of-
ficer respectively.
Over the years, Reverend Nelson’s work
has received broad recognition. Notably, in
2007 and 2010, he was program presenter for
annual Montgomery County’s Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. Celebration. He is one of the
2018 Montgomery County Human Rights Hall
of Fame Inductees.
On behalf of the great state of Maryland, I
thank Reverend Nelson for his dedicated serv-
ice and wish him the best in all of his future
endeavors.

RAY OSBORNE
HON. JAMES A. HIMES
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Chief Ray Osborne for his admi-
rable service and exemplary leadership as the
police chief in Darien, CT.
Throughout his 35-year career in Darien,
Chief Osborne has served the police depart-
ment in many roles. During his career, Chief
Osborne approved the creation of Juvenile
Review Board, a local diversion program
which allows first-time youth offenders to com-
plete community service and avoiding having
to go to juvenile court. Additionally, his efforts
to expand the department’s Domestic Violence
Liaison Unit, and his recruitment of high skilled
officers in the department will have a lasting
impact on public safety.
We have strong values in Connecticut. Pro-
tecting those values and allowing them to
flourish requires constant vigilance. The law-
enforcement officers and other first responders
who rush into harm’s way to not only ensure
that our values flourish but exemplify them
through their actions.
The Darien community and I are grateful for
Chief Osborne’s years of service and we wish
him the best of luck in his retirement, espe-
cially as he tackles new projects like the res-
toration of his ’67 Mustang. Congratulations.

Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise to

Post 133, which will celebrate its 100-year an-
niversary on September 21, 2019.
Originally chartered on December 18, 1919

Beach resident who died from wounds inflicted
in battle, the Post was incorporated in 1940
and was renamed to its current title, Post 133,
a year later.
Early in its history, Post 133 formed, funded,
and manned the Huntington Beach Volunteer
Fire Department, and Legionnaires have a
long legacy of working to make Huntington
Beach a stronger, safer place to call home.
This year, I am especially proud to join Post
133 in recognizing William Kettler and Fran
Ritchey, two World War II veterans who have
been with the Post for 74 and 70 years, re-
spectively.
I ask all Members to join me in commending
American Legion Huntington Beach Post 133
for 100 years as a fixture in the community,
and I look forward to joining Legionnaires later
this month to commemorate this milestone.

In 1983 he joined the Metropolitan Water

Raymond was considerate, but he also had a

spected when he retired in 2004 after working
ten years as an Executive Legislative Rep-

Raymond is survived by his wife, Debra,

IN RECOGNITION OF MICHAEL W.
BURNES AND THE TWENTY-
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF MISSIE
B’S
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to rise today to recognize and celebrate
the twenty-fifth anniversary of Missie B’s, an
institution that is instrumental to the identity of
the LGBTQ+ community throughout Missouri’s
Fifth Congressional District. Without places
like Missie B’s that encourage all individuals to
pursue their true and genuine selves, Kansas
City and its people would not be what and
who they are today.
Missie B’s first opened in April of 1994,
perched on the corner of Southwest Trafficway
and 39th Street, located in Kansas City’s his-
toric Westport entertainment district. Missie
B’s started as a piano bar, but within its first
few months of opening, the owner decided to
produce drag performances a few nights each
week. Today, Missie B’s has nightly drag
shows, dancing, karaoke, and the Late Night
Theatre program. Missie B’s has fostered arts
and entertainment in Kansas City for the past
twenty-five years while providing a place for
the LGBTQ+ community to flourish and thrive.
Michael W. Burnes, owner of Missie B’s,
has dedicated his life to serving and bettering
the people of his community. Before opening
several successful businesses and LGBTQ+
inclusive establishments throughout the United
States, he served his country during the Viet-
nam War, earning the Purple Heart after being
wounded while on active duty. Upon his return
to Kansas City in the 1980s, Mr. Burnes
opened his first LGBTQ+ bar, the Kon Tiki
Room and later, the Dixie Belle Saloon.
Throughout his career as an entrepreneur, Mi-
chael Burnes has dedicated his businesses to
being spaces for the LGBTQ+ communities to
express and enjoy themselves. When the
Dixie Belle Saloon was in operation, members
of the LGBTQ+ community faced discrimina-
tion from the rest of the country as a result of
uncertainty and fear caused by the AIDS epi-
demic. While running the Dixie Belle Saloon,
Mr. Burnes kept a supply of the limited HIV
medication behind the bar to give to those
who needed it but could not afford it. This is
merely one testament of the benevolent and
caring nature of Michael Burnes that has been
demonstrated throughout his life in all that he
does.
Missie B’s reflects Michael’s generous spirit
and is well known among Kansas Citians for
its involvement in numerous causes and char-
ities. Missie B’s actively fundraises for and is
involved in the Kansas City AIDS Walk, the
Good Samaritan Project, the Kansas City Care
Health Center, Saint Michael’s Veterans Cen-
ter, among many others. In 2016, after the
horrific and heartbreaking Pulse Nightclub
shooting in Orlando, Florida, Missie B’s joined
with Kansas City’s other LGBTQ+ bars and
nightclubs to raise $54,000 in one day for the
victims and their families. Missie B’s has not
just changed the lives of the members of the
LGBTQ+ community in Kansas City, but
across the country as well.
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing and thanking Missie B’s for all they
have done for Kansas City and Missouri’s Fifth
Congressional District. I am honored to have
such an impactful, inclusive and inspirational
institution be a part of the district I represent.

The Rotary Club of Sheridan is a staple of

munity that makes our country great. The

HONORING THE 10TH ANNIVER-

CLINIC
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the 10th Anniversary of the Veterans
Legal Clinic in Syracuse, NY, and to recognize
Mr. John Powers, Attorney and U.S. Army
Veteran, for providing pro bono legal assist-
ance to veterans. For 10 years, Mr. Powers,
through his work with the Veterans Legal Clin-
ic, has devoted himself to helping veterans,
working with over 600 former servicemembers
to provide access to readjustment after service
and legal services.
In July 2009, Mr. Powers entered into a
partnership with the Department of Veterans
Affairs’ (VA) Syracuse Vet Center to establish
the Veterans Legal Clinic. Mr. Powers works
with veterans from all branches of the military
and from all walks of life to provide free con-
fidential legal services. Through Mr. Powers’s
partnership with the VA, his clinic has become
a vital resource for veterans attempting to se-
cure earned benefits or upgrade a military dis-
charge. Additionally, Mr. Powers coordinates
and provides legal staff to support veterans
with ongoing legal needs.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
in the House join me in honoring the 10th An-
niversary of the Veterans Legal Clinic and Mr.
John Powers for providing professional legal
services to our community’s veterans. I com-
mend the Veterans Legal Clinic and all those
who donate their time to ensure veterans, who
have sacrificed so much for this country, have
access to legal services.

RECOGNIZING THE 11TH ANNUAL
DC BEER WEEK
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 11th annual ‘‘DC Beer
Week,’’ a week-long series of events cele-
brating the independent craft beer industry,
local beer culture and the rich brewing legacy
in the District of Columbia. Sponsored by the
District of Columbia Brewers’ Guild, DC Beer
Week will take place this year from September
8 through September 15. Many of the District’s
breweries, taverns, restaurants and cultural in-
stitutions will participate in more than 30 beer-
related events throughout the week to high-
light the successful rebirth of the brewing in-
dustry in the District, and the quality and diver-
sity of craft beer produced in our area and
across the nation.
DC Beer Week not only serves to celebrate
the brewing industry. It also serves as a nod
to the rich brewing history we have right here
in the District. The first brewery in D.C.
opened in 1796. The District became home to
dozens of breweries in every section of the
city, many right here in the shadow of the
Capitol. By the late 1800s, our area was home
to some of the most prosperous breweries and
recognizable beer brands in the nation, such
as the Christian Heurich Brewing Company in
the District and the Portner Brewing Company
in Alexandria. The District became especially
known for the introduction and production of
quality lagers in the southeast United States.
Although most of our breweries did not survive
prohibition, the Heurich Brewing Company re-
opened after the repeal of the 18th Amend-
ment in 1933 and remained operational until
1956. The legacy of Christian Heurich is pre-
served at his Victorian mansion—‘‘the Brew-
master’s Castle’’—in Dupont Circle, which is
operated by the Heurich House Museum.
Of course, DC Beer Week would not be
possible without the rebirth of the brewing in-
dustry in our city. After more than a 50-year
absence, over the past decade we have seen
the opening of more than a dozen D.C.-based
production breweries and brewpubs. Despite
limited industrial space, production breweries
such as DC Brau Brewing Company, Atlas
Brew Works, 3 Stars Brewing Company,
Hellbender Brewing Company and Right Prop-
er Brewing have gained a national reputation
for producing high-quality beer. In addition,

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1098 September 6, 2019
since the opening of the District Chophouse
and Brewery in 1997, District residents now
have several options to enjoy a quality meal
with their locally brewed beer at establish-
ments such as Bluejacket, Gordon Biersch-
Navy Yard, the Public Option, Right Proper
Shaw Brewpub and our newest additions, Red
Bear Brewing Company and Valor Brewpub.
These breweries not only provide great craft
beer for local consumers, but also provide
hundreds of jobs for local residents, make sig-
nificant contributions to our local tax base and
serve as anchors for economic development in
neighborhoods throughout the District. Our
tight-knit breweries are outstanding and active
citizens of our community and support various
charitable causes and community non-profit
organizations. They are also leaders in sup-
porting diversity and inclusion in our local
business community.
I urge all of my colleagues, constituents and
visitors to the District to come together to raise
a glass in support of DC Beer Week and the
local brewing community. There are great
events throughout the week, such as Fun Run
on Sunday from Right Proper to Red Bear, the
Kickoff Party at Bluejacket, a Home Brewing
Competition hosted by 3 Stars, a Record Fair
at Right Proper, a celebration of Women in
Beer at Red Bear and a Sunset Cruise hosted
by DC Brau. Taverns such as Roofers Union,
Boundary Stone, Churchkey and Church Hall
will be hosting exciting events featuring beers
from multiple local breweries, and there will be
the annual ‘‘Brewers on the Block’’ festival at
Union Market. In addition, the Heurich House
will be curating an Educational Events series
that will include opportunities to learn about
beer history, culture and the art of brewing.
There truly will be something for everyone.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing DC Beer
Week for its contribution to the District’s his-
toric beer culture and our local economy.

HONORING WILLIAM ‘‘DOC’’
SCHMITZ, NATIONAL COM-
MANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE VET-
ERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF
THE UNITED STATES
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
honor National Commander-in-Chief of the
Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United
States, William ‘‘Doc’’ Schmitz.
Doc was elected to this prestigious and
well-deserved post on July 24, 2019. Helping
and advocating for Veterans is not an uncom-
mon practice for Doc, but rather a continuation
of the work he does each and every day. His
unwavering dedication to his country and the
Veterans he serves is one of the many traits
I admire most about him.
While Doc currently serves Veterans, he
has also served his country well over the
years. Doc was in the United States Navy
from 1966 to 1970, during the Vietnam War.
During that time, he served as a Navy Corps-
man attached to the Marine Corp in Vietnam.
In recognition of his efforts, he received the
National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam
Service Medal and the Republic of Vietnam
Campaign Medal.
Doc does not allow politics to get in the way
of serving Veterans, which is another thing I
admire. He doesn’t look at their qualifiers or
whether they fit a certain criteria, but rather
helps people simply and solely to help them.
Previously, he worked for a Democratic Con-
gressman, but decided to stay on in my office
because of his commitment to the cause.
Doc is my resource for all things Veteran re-
lated and he contacts me personally with any
information on local, state and national Vet-
erans’ issues. He is a venerable source of in-
formation and experience that I rely on and
trust deeply.
I cannot think of a better National Com-
mander-in-Chief than the one we are honoring
today. We can all be assured that the man
leading this national organization has Vet-
erans’ needs as a first priority and he will fight
to make sure they are well taken care of. Con-
gratulations to you, Doc, for this new posi-
tion—and I thank you for all that you have
done and will do in the future. I know that Vet-
erans everywhere have just gained a staunch
defender, a wise leader and a genuinely hon-
orable and good man with you as their Com-
mander-in-Chief.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
honor National Commander-in-Chief of the
Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United
States, William ‘‘Doc’’ Schmitz.

HON. KENNY MARCHANT
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Richard Bradshaw on
his well-earned retirement from the Grapevine
Police Department. After twenty-four years of
service as a Crime Scene Technician, Richard
has created a lasting impact on the depart-
ment by working tirelessly to preserve the
public safety.
Richard began his career in law enforce-
ment by honorably serving as a military police
officer with the United States Army in 1972.
He continued his service as a Sergeant with
the police department in the Army Active Re-
serve until 1978. During that time, he also
earned his associate’s degree in Criminal Jus-
tice and served as a police officer for the
Penn Hill Police Department in Pennsylvania
until December of 1979.
In 1980, Richard joined the Baton Rouge
Metropolitan Airport Police where he served
as both a police officer and an aircraft rescue
firefighter. On August 14, 1995, Richard joined
the Grapevine Police Department as a Crime
Scene Technician and has proven invaluable
to the collection of critical evidence in major
criminal investigations.
During his tenure in Grapevine, Richard has
produced a quality of work that has earned
him the respect of his colleagues, supervisors,
and the community. His commitment to profes-
sional development has driven him to com-
plete more than 1400 hours of training and
stands as evidence of his outstanding service
and professionalism.
Richard’s contributions to law enforcement
operations have helped to ensure that count-
less officers have been adequately supported
in their mission to uphold the rule of law. His
legacy will leave a lasting mark on the City of
Grapevine for many years to come.
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to recog-
nize the dedication that Richard has devoted
to the city of Grapevine and the state of
Texas. I ask all my distinguished colleagues to
join me in recognizing Richard Bradshaw for
his many years of service.

today to honor and commend longtime Bell-

Frank Latorre, Camden County Town Hall Vet-

After graduating from Philadelphia Central
High School in 1942, Frank volunteered for
the Army Air Forces, and although he was ini-
tially turned down, shortly thereafter he re-
ceived a draft notice accepting him into the
United States Army.
In 1943, Frank boarded the RMS Aquitania
for England and two days later he was on a
truck to a town called Bridgewater and in April
1944 he participated in Exercise Tiger a D-
Day practice run, and after a battle with the
Germans at Slapton Beach, Frank departed
England for the D-Day invasion.
They departed for Normandy, France and
arrived at Utah Beach where Frank jumped
into the gun turret of his half-track and took
down a German fighter strafing the landing
troops, and after the D-Day invasion, Frank
and his unit later helped push back the Ger-
man counteroffensive at the Battle of the
Bulge and briefly occupied Berlin after the
German surrender.
Shortly after the bombs dropped at Hiro-
shima and Nagasaki, he received his military
discharge as a Private First Class and went
on to work for Pepsi-Cola, married in 1947,
had two daughters, and retired in 1987.
Today Frank enjoys golfing, the camara-
derie of fellow veterans and is an active mem-
ber of the Bellmawr Veterans of Foreign Wars
Post 9563.
In recognition of his valiant service to our
nation, Frank humbly received numerous med-
als and citations including the Bronze Star,
American Theater Service Medal and the Eu-
ropean African Middle Eastern Service Medal.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
honoring Private First Class Frank Latorre of
Bellmawr, New Jersey who is a constant re-
minder of the sacrifices that our men and
women of the military made so that we can
enjoy the liberties we do today.

plus years as a distinguished advocate for
Texas property owners with Texas REAL-
TORS.
Shortly after earning an accounting degree
from the University of Texas, Mark pursued a
career in public policy and has held a pres-
ence in Texas politics ever since. Throughout
his professional career, Mark has worked in
multiple positions at the national, state, and
local political levels. Mark served in the Texas
Legislature as the Chief of Staff for Texas
Senator Florence Shapiro, and then worked as
the Campaign Director for now-U.S. Senator
JOHN CORNYN’s successful race for Texas At-

Upon joining Texas REALTORS in 1998 as
Director of Governmental Affairs, Mark brought
a unique expertise that eventually ascended

Texas REALTORS, Mark has admirably
served many Texans by advocating for pri-
vate-property rights, providing reliable informa-
tion, and has gained respect among the Hous-
ton community.
Leading up to the historic passage of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Mark played
a significant role in gathering support for this
monumental legislation in the Houston area.
He also spearheaded oversight on economic
analysis that showed the positive impact tax
reform would have on Texas property owners
and American workers and families across the
country. Not only did he work hard in Texas,
Mark also led a team to Washington, D.C. to
inform lawmakers on their most up-to-date re-
search and findings-data that was instrumental
in giving America a new tax code.
In 2018, Mark was inducted into the REAL-
TORS Political Action Committee (RPAC) Hall
of Fame—a testament to his hard work and
success in the real estate field. Outside of his
professional career, Mark is also an avid writ-
er. He publishes two blogs, the first is a polit-
ical blog simplifying the legislative process for
his readers, and the second is a personal,
faith-based blog interwoven with his own fam-
ily history.
After twenty years of hard work, I am proud
to join Mark’s colleagues and friends in cele-
brating his well-earned retirement. Mark, thank
you for all you’ve done for our community. The
Houston community has been blessed by your
accomplishments, and I wish you well as you
begin your next chapter.

RECOGNIZING NORMA GIBBS FOR
A LIFE DEDICATED TO COMMU-
NITY SERVICE
HON. HARLEY ROUDA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor and recognize the life and legacy of
Norma Gibbs. Mrs. Gibbs, the City of Hun-
tington Beach’s first female City Council mem-
ber and Mayor, lived a life marked by extraor-
dinary compassion and public service.
Mrs. Gibbs passed away on Sunday, Sep-
tember 1, 2019, but the impact she made dur-
ing her lifetime will continue for generations.
During a time when politics was dominated
by men, Mrs. Gibbs encouraged women to
vote and play an active role in community de-
velopment. She would serve as the inspiration
for many women to run for office, and be-
cause of her hard work, the City where she
served as Mayor now boasts a City Council
whose members are primarily women.
In 1979, Mrs. Gibbs founded Interval House,
a nonprofit that cares for and supports sur-
vivors of abuse. From Interval House to the
opening of the Huntington Central Park Li-
brary, Mrs. Gibbs lived a life dedicated to up-
lifting everyone around her. Her lifetime of
public service would earn her the President’s
Lifetime Achievement award in 2015.
Today I ask that all Members join me in rec-
ognizing the amazing life and works of Norma
Gibbs.

Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today

gratulations to the Rotary Club of Lander on

HONORING ARLETT STEINERT ON
HER 100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Arlett Steinert around her 100th
Birthday. Ms. Steinert was born August 26,
1919 in Erie, Illinois.
Ms. Steinert grew up in Erie and graduated
from Erie High School in 1937. She went on
to get her teaching degree at Blackburn Col-
lege in Carlinville, Illinois—where she met her
husband William—and Marycrest College in
Davenport, Iowa. Following her college years,
Ms. Steinert had a long and successful teach-
ing career in the Erie area until she retired in
the 1970’s. Currently, Ms. Steinert is still ac-
tive in Whiteside County Retired Teachers
meetings. I am honored by her lifelong dedica-
tion to positively serving and impacting our
community.
It is because of community leaders such as
Ms. Steinert that I am especially proud to
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District.
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally
honor Ms. Arlett Steinert on her 100th Birth-
day.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN
CARBRAY
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and pay tribute to the life of Mr. John
Carbray, who passed away on August 10,
2019. John was the founder and first president
of the Fresno Grizzlies, Fresno, California’s
Triple-A franchise. He will be remembered for
his vision and efforts to bring baseball back to
Central California.
John Carbray was born in Paris, Arkansas
on November 9, 1938. John and his brother
Sam were raised by their mother Helen. When
John was six years old his family moved to
Inglewood, California. Sports played an inte-
gral part of his childhood and his biggest pas-
sion was baseball. He played at the collegiate
level, first at El Camino Junior College and
Pepperdine University. John would go on to
play semi-pro baseball in Wyoming and even
played in Canada for the Edmonton Eskimos
of the Western Canada League.
Eventually John traveled back to Los Ange-
les to work in a swimming pool business, be-
fore returning to Canada in 1963 after he was
named manager of the Calgary Giants. This
was the first stop of a storied career as a
sports executive, with stops in Oregon, Wash-
ington DC, Sacramento and a tenure as gen-
eral manager of two North American Soccer
League teams.
John pursued his love for athletics and en-
tertainment in different avenues. During his
time away from baseball, he founded Projects
West, a consulting firm that worked with major
sports teams to bring concerts to sporting
venues. However, he would not be away from
baseball for very long. After realizing the need
for baseball in Fresno, John and his wife
Diane worked tirelessly to return baseball to
the city after a ten-year absence. After much
hard work and persistence, the Tucson Toros
were purchased by the Fresno Diamond
Group and reborn as the Fresno Grizzlies.
John then pursued building a state-of-the-art
baseball stadium in downtown Fresno. On
May 1, 2002, the stadium, now known as
Chukchansi Park, hosted its first game with a
sell-out crowd of 12,792. The stadium paved
the way for the revitalization of downtown and
continues to host baseball game, concerts and
festivals.
Throughout his career, John was awarded
with recognitions for his dedication to the
world of sports. This includes being named
Sporting News Executive of the Year, Pacific
Coast Executive of the Year, his induction into
the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame and
he and his wife Diane were honored by the
Grizzlies with the Al Radka Award in honor of
their contributions to the community and base-
ball. His contributions to the City of Fresno
spanned beyond sports; he was also actively
involved with many nonprofits, including the

with him.

HONORING JOSEPH E. TIGHUE
HON. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of Joseph E.
Tighue, who passed away on August 24,
2019.
Joe was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania in
1932 to Eugene and Elizabeth Tighue. After
graduating Trenton High School in 1952, Joe
joined the Army and served overseas during
the Korean War. After his services, Joe stud-
ied business, real estate, and insurance at
Rider College and Rutgers University.
His natural skill and ingenuity led Joe to a
long and storied career in real estate and New
Jersey politics. With his high school sweet
heart, Marie Dileo, by his side, the young cou-
ple started the Tighue Realty Co. Later in life,
Joe returned to school to earn the MAI Ap-
praisal Designation. He served as president of
Certified Appraisal Service and as president of
the Mercer County Board of Realtors. Joe’s ef-
forts to give back to his community did not go
unnoticed and he was named ‘‘Realtor of the
Year’’ when he was recognized nationally for
starting a work release program that utilized
county workhouse inmates to rehab run-down
city houses.
In 1969, Joe was selected to run for Mercer
County Freeholder, and he went on to serve
for three terms. Later from 1980 to 1990, Joe
served as the Mercer County Surrogate and
Judge of the Probate Court.
Over the course of his 87 years, Joe and
his wife, Marie, built a large and loving family
that will continue to carry his legacy, including
his brother Thomas; children Gary, Robert,
and Susan; six grandchildren; and many neph-
ew and nieces.
Madam Speaker, I send my condolences to
the family and friends of Joe Tighue. I ask that
my colleagues join me in commemorating his
incredible life and legacy.
Rest in peace, Joe.

Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize my dear friend, Mr.
David J. Weiland, for being inducted into the
San Joaquin College of Law Alumni Hall of
Fame.
David was born and raised in California’s
San Joaquin Valley. He is a graduate of Cali-
fornia State University, Fresno, where he re-

David was motivated to work in engineering
after working his first job on a sandy survey
crew in the City of Armona in the hot summer
of 1965. During his engineering years, David
designed many public works and private
projects in Kings, Fresno and Tulare counties.
In 1988, while still working full time, David
fulfilled his lifelong intent of becoming an attor-

Weiland that December.
David went on to build a successful career

IN RECOGNITION OF GUADALUPE
CENTER INC.’S CENTENNIAL AN-
NIVERSARY
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the one hundredth an-
niversary of Guadalupe Centers Inc. Through-
out the century since the Guadalupe Center’s
formation, they have remained steadfast to
their founding objective to play an integral role
in the development and wellbeing of the Mexi-
can, Mexican-American and the Latino com-
munity-at-large in Kansas City. Guadalupe
Centers Inc. has expanded exponentially,
growing beyond its original Westside location
to provide immeasurable services for the
greater Kansas City metropolitan area.
Many families immigrated from Mexico to
Kansas City in the 1910s and 20s for the
growing meat packing and railroad industry.
Although there were a multitude of jobs, they
were often erratic and poorly paid. It was out
of the needs of this new community that the
idea for the Guadalupe Center was generated.
Guadalupe Centers Inc. was established by
eighteen young Catholic women in 1919 as a
part of the local Catholic Church in Kansas
City’s historic Westside. Both the Mexican and
Mexican-American population in the area used
the Center to create a unique cultural environ-
ment, separate from American mainstream so-
ciety at the time. Their idea was to unite the
growing population of Mexican and Mexican-
American families predominantly living in
Westside at the time into a ‘‘Colonia
Mexicana,’’ or a Mexican community.
Throughout the following decades, the Gua-
dalupe Center became a central pillar of the
Westside neighborhood, as well as Kansas
City at large. The leadership of Ms. Dorothy
Gallagher in the 1930s and 40s instigated a
new chapter in the Center’s history, as she or-
ganized the development of the Center and
spearheaded new initiatives. The original
stone building, purchased in 1919, remained
central to the organization and the large room
of the first floor was the ‘‘living room of the
neighborhood,’’ where weddings and other
events were held. Women cooked enormous
amounts of food in the kitchen, and a constant
stream of residents flowed in and out of the
space as it expanded to the building next
door. Celebrations like the Noche Buena party
in 1940 were viewed as cornerstones of the
year’s social calendar.
While expanding their range of programs,
the Guadalupe Center remained steadfast in
their commitment to social justice and em-
powerment. In the pivotal decades of the
1960s and 70s, when the Chicano movement
was gaining force in cities across the country,
the Guadalupe Center influenced the local
movement in Kansas City. Guadalupe Center
encouraged Mexican American communities to
flourish by creating a space where individuals
could have their unique cultural identity both
nourished and encouraged. American civil
rights leader Cesar Chavez acknowledged the
Center as a formidable force, visiting the Cen-
ter during his travels throughout the Midwest.
Today, Guadalupe Centers Inc. reflects the
same socially-minded ideas for which it was
originally founded. The Center has remained a
catalyst for greater Latino representation and
political activism throughout the years. Ms. Lali
Garcia, who is a dedicated volunteer at the
Guadalupe Center for over forty-five years, a
local activist, and a board member of organi-
zations like the pivotal La Raza Political Club,
is a prime example of this. Moreover, Paul
Rojas, the first Latino Missouri State Rep-
resentative, contributed greatly to the develop-
ment of Guadalupe Centers Inc. as Chairman.
Both as Representative and then as Chair-
man, Mr. Rojas fought politically and socially
for increased resources for the Latino Commu-
nity, whether for educational or training pro-
grams. Guadalupe Centers would not have

flourished as it has without the integrity of
partners like both Ms. Garcia and Mr. Rojas.
A central focus of the Center has been, and
still is, to provide social services for the com-
munity and create an intergenerational impact.
The social services provided by Guadalupe
Centers range from their Older Adults Pro-
gram, a Credit Union, to a large Food Bank,
to name a few. Furthermore, the Guadalupe
Centers Schools have become an integral part
of the Kansas City educational landscape.
Since their founding under the visionary lead-
ership of the school’s first superintendent, Gil-
bert Guerrero, the schools have provided aca-
demic access to historically under-served
Latino communities. In addition to the schools,
Guadalupe Centers Inc. inspires children and
young adults around the city through their ex-
pansive Sports, Recreation, and Youth Pro-
grams. The idea for these programs was
spearheaded and encouraged through the dili-
gent volunteer hours put in by pillars in the
community like Tony Aguirre who led by their
enthusiasm and diligence.
The wide range of cultural opportunities of-
fered by Guadalupe Centers reinforce a cele-
bration of the culture in the historic Westside,
as they have done since their earliest days.
These events also help raise the funds for the
expansive programs led by the Center. Both
the longevity and attendance of these celebra-
tions are a testimony to what the Center
means to the local community and the city-at-
large. Guadalupe Center hosted Kansas City’s
first Cinco de Mayo festival and one that has
run annually since 1922. Today, the Festival
draws up to 10,000 people over a two-day
span. The Tony Aguirre Latino Men’s Basket-
ball tournament has been a Kansas City tradi-
tion for over fifty years and is the oldest con-
tinually running event of its kind. These are
just several events out of a myriad offered by
the Centers.
Madam Speaker, please join with Missouri’s
Fifth Congressional District in honoring Gua-
dalupe Centers Inc. for the indelible mark their
one hundred years of service have left on our
community. Through the visionary leadership
of individuals from Dorothy Gallagher to Paul
Rojas and Chris Medina, Guadalupe Centers
have been and remain an integral part of, not
only the Mexican or Mexican American com-
munity, but the larger Latino community in
Kansas City. As Congressman in Missouri, I
am honored and privileged to serve the com-
munity alongside all those who have contrib-
uted and continue to pour into Guadalupe
Centers Inc. I encourage my fellow colleagues
and citizens across the country to reflect upon
the dedicated service of Guadalupe Centers
as an inspiration and to thank them for all they
have done and continue to do for the vibrancy,
wellbeing, and cultural heritage of our city.

RECOGNIZING JAMES NATHANIAL
SHORT JR.
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing James Nathanial Short Jr.,
a District of Columbia native and retired 33-
year veteran of the D.C. Fire and Emergency
Medical Services, on the occasion of his 73rd
birthday.
James Short Jr., who can trace his lineage
in the United States as far back as 1781, was
born to James N. Short Sr. and Ollie W. Short.
The couple raised their six children in the his-
toric Langston Terrace Dwellings, named for
John Mercer Langston, who was Dean of
Howard University Law School. Langston Ter-
race, the first public housing complex in
Washington, D.C. (3rd in our Nation), was
erected in 1938, designed by African-Amer-
ican architects and managed by Mr. Short’s
father. James Short Jr. learned the value of
God, family and community in this nurturing
setting.
During his tenure in the fire department, Mr.
Short continuously put his life on the line to
protect D.C. residents. At one point during his
career, a building collapsed on him, yet his in-
juries did not hold him back and he rose to
become Deputy Fire Chief. Mr. Short worked
with his colleagues to stop illegal businesses
in the District and to curb drug sales.
Mr. Short has been a member of Brown Me-
morial African Methodist Episcopal Church, on
Capitol Hill since 1966 and is also a member
of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand
Lodge of the District of Columbia (Redemption
Lodge #24).
Mr. Short has been a leader in the civic life
of the District. He is the former Chairman of
the Marshall Heights Community Development
Organization, Executive Board Member of the
National Kidney Foundation, former Boy Scout
master for Brown Memorial AME Church and
a member of the Hillcrest Community Civic
Association.
Mr. Short was educated in D.C. public
schools and became a certified public man-
ager upon graduating from the George Wash-
ington University Graduate School of Business
and Public Management. He also received the
District of Columbia’s ‘‘Center for Excellence
in Municipal Management’’ certificate. He was
a D.C. Master Barber for over 40 years and
owned and operated the Le Droit Park Barber-
shop on Florida Avenue, Northwest. Currently,
Mr. Short is President and CEO of Short Con-
sultation, LLC.
Mr. Short was granted membership in the
University Club of the District of Columbia in
2013 and remains a member in good stand-
ing. He enjoys hosting family, community and
business gatherings and celebrations there.
Mr. Short is blessed with two daughters,
Kym Elder and Nicole Short, five grand-
children, one great-granddaughter and a host
of family members scattered across the coun-
try.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing James
Nathanial Short Jr. for his outstanding
achievements and contributions to the District
of Columbia on the occasion of his 73rd birth-
day.

woman elected to the Santa Ana City Council,
and faithfully served her constituents for over
two decades.
On Monday, September 2, 2019, Mrs.
McGuigan passed away at the age of 85
years old, but her legacy lives on in Santa
Ana and Orange County.
Mrs. McGuigan, known to many as ‘‘Pat,’’
served as a Santa Ana Councilwoman at a
time when the City was growing increasingly
diverse. She was known for her ability to build
strong relationships with the City’s immigrant
populations and would go on to create the
Asian-Pacific Advisory Council of Santa Ana to
better help the refugees that now called the
City home.
After retiring from public office in 2002, Mrs.
McGuigan remained active in her community.
From the opening of the Salgado Community
Center to serving on the Orange County Sen-
ior Citizens Advisory Council, Mrs. McGuigan
exemplified what it meant to be a dedicated
public servant.
I ask that all Members join me in recog-

RECOGNIZING BARBARA GRIMM-
MARSHALL AS THE RECIPIENT
OF THE JOHN BROCK AWARD
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the distinguished accomplish-
ments and philanthropic work of Barbara
Grimm-Marshall. Barbara has been an exem-
plary member of our community, and was de-
servedly recognized yesterday with the 2019
John Brock Award for her distinguished serv-
ice to the communities of the 23rd District of
California, which I represent.
Barbara’s co-owned family farm, Grimmway
Farms, is the largest producer and exporter of
carrots on the globe. Grimmway Farms has
provided exceptional agricultural service to
Kern County since 1981 and has since been
a staple of the Bakersfield community. This
past June, Barbara was appointed to the Agri-
cultural Technical Advisory Committee for
Trade in Fruits and Vegetables, a recognition
of her expertise in agriculture. Through her
knowledge and experience in the trade realm,
her advice and counsel is unmatched and will
be most valuable to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and our country.
Beyond professional development and
achievement, Barbara is a community prob-
lem-solver, and it is no surprise that she re-
cently received the 2019 John Brock Commu-
nity Service Award for her charitable efforts,
particularly in the education realm. In 2017, I
spoke in this Chamber honoring Barbara for
her work and the establishment of The Rod &
Bob Memorial Scholarship Fund, which pro-
vides higher education access to hundreds of
prospective university students and bolsters
the success of many underprivileged children
in the congressional district I represent. Bar-
bara’s passion to see more children gain ac-
cess to education resources did not end with
a scholarship fund. She established the
Grimm Family Education Foundation and
Grimmway Academy for the purpose of edu-
cating underprivileged children in our commu-
nity from grades K–8. Barbara’s vision and
goals for these programs has only expanded
over time, as the Foundation now operates a
vast network of educational institutions and
partnerships throughout Kern County.
Barbara’s leadership in public service is an
inspiration to our community and a model for
effective problem-solving at the community
level. Her philanthropy and work shows that
solutions often depend on exceptional leaders
up to the task of bettering their community,
rather than sweeping governmental action that
often proves ineffective. Barbara does not sit
on the sidelines when she notices a problem,
but instead works to find a way to find a solu-
tion. Our community is proud of the work she
has done and I look forward to all that she will
continue to accomplish in the future. On behalf
of California’s 23rd Congressional District,
Judy and I want to thank Barbara, Darcy, and
the entire Grimm family for their continued
service to our community, and congratulate
Barbara for being this year’s recipient of the
John Brock Award.

IN HONOR OF THE FIRST BAPTIST
CHURCH HUNTSVILLE 175TH AN-
NIVERSARY
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise in
celebration of the 175th Anniversary of the
First Baptist Church of Huntsville, Texas.
On September 16, 1844, Rev. Z.N. Morrell,
Thomas Horsely, and Rev. Benjamin Fry es-
tablished the First Baptist Church of Hunts-
ville, Texas. The early congregation met in the
Dean School House until their first building
was constructed on the corner of 13th Street
and Avenue J, where the church still stands
today. The President of Baylor University, Dr.
Rufus C. Burleson, preached the opening
ceremony sermon.
Legendary Texas figure General Sam Hous-
ton and his wife were among the first mem-
bers of the First Baptist Church. In fact, a
swimming pool at Houston’s residence was
used by the early congregation for baptisms
and church ceremonies.
In 1891, the congregation built a second
building for worship services, which stood until
1924 when the congregation decided to con-
struct an elegant four-story, red-brick church
with tall white pillars and stained glass win-
dows on the second floor.
In a terrible tragedy, the new church build-
ing caught on fire in 1954, and congregation
member and college student James E.V.
Davis lost his life. Thankfully, members of the
congregation were able to save church
records, nursery furniture, an organ, and even
some pews. The church then held services in
a local high school auditorium until the fourth
and final church building opened on December
11, 1955. In 1985, the First Baptist Church
added a new Family Life Center, which offered
sporting facilities, locker rooms, a kitchen, and
a parlor to it’s members.
For the past 175 years, The First Baptist
Church of Hunstville, Texas has stood as a re-
minder of the meaning of community and resil-
ience. Please join me in celebrating this mo-
mentous anniversary, and remembering the
people whose desire to worship created a rich
history of knowing, following, and sharing in
Christ.

COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF SENATOR EVERETT
DIRKSEN’S PASSING
HON. DARIN LaHOOD
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to com-
memorate the 50th anniversary of Senator
Everett Dirksen’s death.
Senator Dirksen passed away on Sep-
tember 7, 1969, in Washington, DC, after
serving sixteen years in the United States
House of Representatives and seventeen
years in the United States Senate.
Before starting his career in public office,
Senator Dirksen served abroad as a second
lieutenant during the First World War. After re-
turning from war, Dirksen studied law at the
University of Minnesota College of Law at Min-
neapolis.
Senator Dirksen practiced law in his home
town of Pekin, Illinois, but public service was
always Senator Dirksen’s true passion. Dirk-
sen served as a Member of Congress from
1933 to 1949, representing the 13th District of
Illinois, then went on to represent Illinois in the
U.S. Senate from 1951 until his death in 1969.
As the Minority Leader of the Senate, Dirk-
sen played a vital role in shaping many major
pieces of legislation. Senator Dirksen earned
the reputation of being a true champion of civil
rights. It was his hard work and determination
that allowed Dirksen to ensure the passage of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting
Rights Act of 1965.
I include in the RECORD the essay, ‘‘Everett
Dirksen’s Last Days,’’ by Frank Mackaman.
Frank is not only a close friend, but also the
Director of The Dirksen Congressional Center
in Senator Dirksen’s hometown of Pekin, IL.
I am grateful for all the work that Senator
Dirksen did for our country, and I am proud to
represent his former congressional district.
EVERETT DIRKSEN’S LAST DAYS
(By Frank H. Mackaman, The Dirksen
Congressional Center, Pekin, IL)
On August 12, 1969, just before the U.S.
Senate recessed for a few weeks, Senator
Everett McKinley Dirksen held a press con-
ference in his office. It would be his last.
Dirksen seemed relaxed and in a genial
mood, chatting amiably with reporters and
joking with his staff. To the casual observer
everything seemed normal—but it was not.
Doctors had just told the Senate Minority
Leader he was seriously ill. They had discov-
ered a spot on Dirksen’s right lung and sus-
pected cancer. A second x-ray on the 14th
showed the tumor had grown, making an op-
eration necessary.
To prepare, the senator from Pekin rested
for three weeks at ‘‘Heart’s Desire,’’ his
home outside Washington DC, rummaging in
his beloved garden and working on a memoir
he would never complete. A realist, Dirksen
transferred title to most of his property to
his wife, Louella. He also gave her a pre-
signed resignation from the Senate if the op-
eration left him incapacitated. He loved the
Senate, and it was ever on his mind.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1103
September 6, 2019
Dirksen entered Walter Reed Hospital on
Sunday, August 31, to ready himself for the
operation two days later. He took with him
a briefcase loaded with work, the contents of
which were transferred to The Dirksen Con-
gressional Center several years after his
death. These documents show the amazing
breadth of his interests and the substantial
burden of his office.
The briefcase contained notes for upcom-
ing speeches, including one in his own hand-
writing entitled, ‘‘God, Country, and Grand-
children: Soliloquy with Grandchildren’’ in
which he mused about the legacy his genera-
tion would leave and harkened back to the
lives his parents had led in Pekin. He made
notes concerning the congressional session
about to end. Dirksen reviewed letters from
constituents, information about pending leg-
islation, requests for appearances, a plea
from lllinois Governor Richard B. Ogilvie to
revise the federal revenue-sharing calcula-
tion, letters about federal jobs, an early
draft of what was called the ‘‘Everett McKin-
ley Dirksen Library Project,’’ and much,
much more.
On Tuesday morning, September 2, at 8:45
a.m., Colonel Alan R. Hopeman and a team
of Army surgeons began to operate. The spot
on Dirksen’s lung could not be readily exam-
ined without surgery, but, in surgical terms,
it was in an almost ideal position, close to
the periphery of his chest, so that surgeons
could remove it with only a small incision.
They did so without difficulty. The tumor,
which had grown to an inch in diameter,
proved to be malignant.
As they had planned on this eventuality,
the surgeons took the next step of removing
the entire upper lobe of Dirksen’s right lung.
What had begun as a relatively simple oper-
ation became major surgery consuming three
hours. The doctors found no evidence the
cancer had spread, however.
Dirksen’s strong constitution and vigor
brought him through the procedure with fly-
ing colors, and his recuperation was rapid.
Mrs. Dirksen and their daughter, Joy, and
son-in-law, Tennessee Senator Howard H.
Baker, Jr., found him alert and cheerful
when they were first allowed to see him on
Wednesday, September 3. The next day, how-
ever, Dirksen complained of pain and became
confused and restless, perhaps the result of a
minor stroke, insufficient oxygen, or even
withdrawal symptoms from cigarettes (Dirk-
sen complained to his doctors and his son-in-
law about not being able to smoke). A second
procedure became necessary to replace the
tube draining his lung.
Senator Dirksen suffered a crisis that
evening, and it wasn’t until 8:00 Saturday
morning, September 6, that his doctors sta-
bilized him. This episode probably caused the
bronchopneumonia that soon developed. He
rallied, though, even sitting up in bed to eat
his meals. He spent a restful night and ate a
good breakfast with Louella. He appeared to
be past the immediate crisis of a post-oper-
ation heart failure and was already making
plans to resume a work schedule. He even
took a few minutes to go over the papers in
his briefcase. For example, a Seattle radio
station had requested a tape about the mari-
gold to which Dirksen replied with this
hand-written note:
Dear Day—Just now I’m languishing in a
hospital as a result of surgery. An op’g [oper-
ating] room no match for my marigold gar-
dens. Guess the tape must wait. Sorry.
The doctors assured Senator Baker that
Dirksen was well on the road to recovery and
that Baker could travel to California to join
President Richard Nixon. The optimism
proved premature.
Abruptly at 2:51 that afternoon, Sunday,
September 7, Dirksen collapsed and stopped
breathing, His heart, which had enlarged
over the years to twice-normal size as the re-
sult of emphysema, just quit. The desk ser-
geant at the Forest Glen section of the hos-
pital, Roger Brooks, received an urgent call
from the main hospital summoning a sur-
geon. Brooks took a police cruiser to pick up
a Col. Blake for the trip to Dirksen’s room.
Army doctors were already at his side, mas-
saging his chest, trying to restart his heart.
They gave him sodium bicarbonate, calcium,
and other medicines. They used a
defibrillator to try to shock his heart into
action. The doctors worked so vigorously
that they cracked five of his ribs. But Dirk-
sen did not respond. At 4:52 p.m., the doctors
pronounced him dead at age 73. Louella and
Joy were with him at the end. Fifty years
ago.
Mourning for the Senator was national and
of a personal quality, particularly among his
colleagues in Congress and his friends in
Pekin. His body lay in state under the great
dome of the Capitol, an honor accorded to
only three members of the Senate before
him.
In his eulogy to the fallen leader, Presi-
dent Nixon recalled remarks Daniel Webster
had made more than a century before in tes-
timony to a political opponent: ‘‘Our great
men are the common property of the coun-
try.’’ That described Dirksen well. His public
service spanned an era of enormous change,
and he played a vital part in that change.
Through six presidencies, as Nixon put it,
‘‘Everett Dirksen has had a hand in shaping
almost every important law that affects our
lives,’’ and while he never became president,
‘‘his impact and influence on the Nation was
greater than that of most Presidents in our
history.’’
Air Force One brought Dirksen home on
Thursday, September 11. Pekin deserves
much of the credit for Dirksen’s influence on
the national stage. The senator knew that,
and he said so on a return visit to his home-
town in 1961:
After long absences enforced by the duties
of office in Washington, there always comes
back to me some lines from that poem which
I learned long ago, ‘‘Breathes there a man
with soul so dead, who never to himself has
said, this is my own, my native land.’’ This
is my own, my native land, my native city,
where the family taproot went deep many
generations ago, and it will ever be so, no
matter what tasks life may assign me. All
the major decisions in my life have been
made here . . .
The inspiration which I received here from
a saintly mother, a devoted family, steadfast
friends, the constant faith of teachers who
taught me, the inspiration I found here in
church, and the atmosphere of a quiet and
will ordered community were the forces
which helped to fashion those decisions, and
for these I shall be always and eternally
grateful . . .
An estimated 80,000 people watched the fu-
neral procession proceed the 15 miles from
the Peoria airport, south on Route 24,
through Pekin on Route 9, to the Glendale
Memorial Gardens on the east side of town
where more than 6,000 stood in waiting.
Among the dignitaries accompanying the
procession were Vice President Spiro Agnew,
five members of President Nixon’s cabinet, 42
U.S. senators, and 27 U.S. representatives.
Dozens of state officials joined them, as did
over 200 members of the press.
The 1:00 p.m. ceremony itself was brief,
lasting only 15 minutes. Six pallbearers, rep-
resenting the armed forces, carried the cas-
ket to the gravesite. The Rev. Edward L.R.
Elson, chaplain of the Senate and pastor of
the National Presbyterian Church in Wash-
ington DC, conducted the service. The Rev.
Ralph Cordes, pastor of Pekin’s Second Re-
formed Church, and the Rev. Charles
Rechard, pastor of Woodland Presbyterian
Church in New Orleans and a friend of the
Baker family, also delivered prayers. Mem-
bers of the Pekin American Legion post
color guard participated in the ceremony,
too, along with the honor guard and the
Chanute Air Force band. Lt. Gen. Vernon P.
Mock, commanding general of the Fifth
Army, presented the American flag, which
had been draped over the casket, to Mrs.
Dirksen.
When the ceremony ended, mourners
passed by the casket. One of the first was
Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine,
who placed a spray of marigolds, Dirksen’s
favorite flower, on the casket. The two of
them had enjoyed a friendly rivalry over the
years to name the national floral emblem—
she a proponent of the rose.
The Rev. Elson had ended his eulogy fit-
tingly with these words, ‘‘The last march has
ended. A mighty man of God has answered
his last roll call. His battles are all fought,
his victories all won.’’

Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate and honor Rock Springs resi-
dent, and distinguished WWII veteran, John
Gatti on his 100th birthday.
Born August 29, 1919, John has served his
country with honor in WWII as a member of
the 325th Glider Infantry, 101st Airborne Divi-
sion. When he returned to Wyoming after the
war, he worked as miner for Union Pacific
Coal, and then went on to work for Mountain
Fuel Supply Company for twenty-eight years.
As he prepares to turn 100, John is still the
avid hunter and fisherman he has been his
whole life. Loved by his family, and revered by
his community, John represents the very best
that our country has to offer.
Again, Madam Speaker, I extend my con-
gratulations to John Gatti on celebrating his
100th birthday and a heartfelt thank you for
his service to our country.

Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today

tools to understand our resources and better
advise nutrient management decisions. The in-
stalled sensors provide real-time data to best
inform and guide farm-scale management de-
cisions. They showed innovation, passion, and
a drive to help our environment. Participation
in this challenge strengthened the connections
between scientists, advocates, and farmers in
Jo Daviess County and Northwest Illinois. The
prize will be used to continue to build a model
of cooperative problem-solving and improve
water quality in the Driftless Area of Northwest
Illinois.
It is because of community leaders such as
the League of Women Voters of Illinois that I
am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th
Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I
would like to again formally congratulate the Il-
linois Leagues of Women Voters on their ini-
tiative in the Water Quality Challenge put on

RECOGNIZING DOROTHY LOUISE
STRONG JOHNSON
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 6, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing the life and work of Dorothy
Louise Strong Johnson on the occasion of her
100th birthday.
Dorothy Louise Strong Johnson, daughter of
Willie M. Strong and Mary Lucilla Smith
Strong, moved to the District of Columbia from
North Carolina on July 15, 1937. Her parents
put her on a Seaboard Air Line Railroad coach
bound for Union Station to live with her Aunt,
Nora Roxanne, on 32 K Street NW.
Mrs. Johnson was born in Newport News,
Virginia but spent her childhood in Hamlet,
North Carolina. In school, she was known as
an inquisitive student and an active member of
the girls’ basketball team. During her last year
of high school, Mrs. Johnson was unable to
return to school until November. Instead, she
picked cotton and did other jobs so that she
could save money. Not only did she pick cot-
ton in the Hamlet area, she picked cotton as
far away as Bennettsville and McColl in South
Carolina.
After moving to D.C., Mrs. Johnson worked
for the United States Bureau of Printing and
Engraving from 1942 until 1974. She retired
as an assistant supervisor printing money for
the Department of the Treasury. During her
tenure, she also served as an acting super-
visor.
Mrs. Johnson married Ivory Johnson, and
they had eight children (Dorothy, Gwendolyn,
Reginald, Wanda, William, Dora, Wesley and
Sheldon). She raised them mostly as a single
parent. All of her children finished high school,
some attended and completed college, three
served in the United States Army and all were
employed in civil service occupations. During
Mrs. Johnson’s residency in D.C., she main-
tained homes in Northwest, Northeast and
Southeast. She is still the owner of two of
these homes.
When Mrs. Johnson arrived in D.C., her
aunt introduced her to the members of the
10th Street Missionary Baptist Church. After
worshipping with this congregation, Mrs. John-
son joined and became an active member.
Her activism includes being a member of the
Prayer Band, serving as a Sunday School
teacher, engaging with others in Bible study at
her home and serving as an outreach evan-
gelist. She engaged with others in the North
Carolina Club, and in later years, was named
a Mother of the Church. Upon the death of the
church’s pastor, she served as the vice chair-
man of the search committee, which invited
the Reverend A. Michael Charles Durant to
the pulpit as its present leader. Mrs. Johnson
is highly respected for her Christian walk and
passion. She remains supportive of the min-
istries at the 10th Street Missionary Baptist
Church.
For many decades, Mrs. Johnson volun-
teered at the Washington, DC VA Medical
Center every Monday. As a mother of three
veterans, she was fully aware of the needs of
these men and women. When she was not
serving coffee, she could be found engaged in
conversation. In her words, ‘‘They just needed
someone to talk with and know that someone
cared.’’
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize
the life and work of Dorothy Louise Strong
Johnson on the occasion of her 100th birth-
day. We recognize her for the profound impact
her life has had on others and for the love and
affection she generously shares.
