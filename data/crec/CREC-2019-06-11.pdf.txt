HONORING ALLEN PINGEE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the
life and service of Allen ‘‘Al’’ Pingee of
Lewis Run. Al passed away on Tuesday,
April 23, at his home, surrounded by his
family.
Al was a McKean County commis-
sioner at the time of his death, and I
flew a flag over the United States Cap-
itol to be presented to Al’s family and
his colleagues.
Prior to becoming a commissioner,
Al was a member of the city of Brad-
ford professional firefighters and re-
tired as a captain in 1988. He then
served as Bradford Township supervisor
for 14 years, 11 of those years as chair-
man.
Al was a proud Vietnam veteran. He
enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and
was honorably discharged as a corporal
in September 1970.
Mr. Speaker, Al Pingee has served his
Nation and his community.
Above all else, he was a family man,
a loving husband of 36 years to his wife,
Deborah, and father to his four chil-
dren, Andy, Scott, Jeff, and Jodie. He
was a grandfather, a brother, and a
friend to many.
We remember Al Pingee for his ex-
ceptional service to others.
May he rest in peace.
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
June as National Dairy Month.
Dairy products like milk contain
nine essential nutrients that may help
reduce the risk for high blood pressure,
osteoporosis, and certain cancers.
Whether it is a protein to help build
and repair the muscle tissue of active
bodies or Vitamin A to help maintain
healthy skin, dairy products are a nat-
ural nutrient powerhouse.
National Dairy Month started out as
National Milk Month in 1937 to sta-
bilize the dairy demand when the pro-
duction was at a surplus. Now, it has
developed into an annual tradition that
celebrates the contributions the dairy
industry has made to the world.
Proudly, the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania is one of the largest milk-pro-
ducing States in the Nation. I have a
bill called the Whole Milk for Healthy
Kids Act, which would allow for whole
milk, both flavored and nonflavored, to
be offered in school cafeterias.
Just last week, I introduced the
School Milk Nutrition Act with Con-
gressman JOE COURTNEY to expand
milk options for students and reverse
the decline of milk consumption in our
schools. Our bill reaffirms recent regu-
lation from the U.S. Department of Ag-
riculture by providing schools with the
option to serve low-fat milk with fla-
vor and requires that the milk offered
is consistent with the most recent Die-
tary Guidelines for Americans.
In November 2017, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture announced regu-
latory changes for the National School
Lunch and School Breakfast Programs,
including a provision that provides
schools with the option to serve low-fat
1 percent flavored milk.
The School Milk Nutrition Act for
2019 will codify this milk provision and
will maintain the option for schools to
offer low-fat 1 percent flavored milk if
it is consistent with the most recent
Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
I urge my colleagues to sign on to
these bills during National Dairy
Month and allow our students the op-
tion of consuming the type of milk
that they love and to receive the nutri-
tion that they need.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to being,
a week from today, in our State capital
of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at 11 a.m.
for a rally with all the advocates for
nutrition for children and certainly for
dairy farming, as we rally for whole
milk for healthy kids.

HONORING AVANT P. COLEMAN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD) for 5
minutes.
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the achieve-
ments of a great public servant, a fa-
ther, a dedicated man of faith, a friend
to many, and the longest-serving elect-
ed official in Wilson, North Carolina,
city government, the Honorable Avant
Patrick Coleman.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4394 June 11, 2019
Avant Coleman, Mr. Speaker, better
known as A.P., is a native of
Edgecombe County, but he has resided
in Wilson County for many decades. He
received his formal education, earning
his bachelor of science degree in agri-
culture and biology from historic
North Carolina A&T State University.
He went on to earn a master of science
degree in adult education with a minor
in sociology from North Carolina State
University and a graduate of the Ex-
tension Executive Development Insti-
tute.
Professionally, A.P. used the full po-
tential of his education and passion in
his career, which began with teaching
vocational agriculture in Lenoir and
Greene Counties. His desire to pour
into our youth a conviction for com-
munity engagement led him to join the
North Carolina Cooperative Extension
Service, where he worked for 31 long
years, retiring in March 1994. In this
role, Mr. Speaker, he was responsible
for countywide 4–H programs, a na-
tional initiative that embraces young
people of all beliefs and all back-
grounds and empowers them with lead-
ership skills training for the better-
ment of their lives and their commu-
nities.
A.P. Coleman has earned numerous
distinctions, honors, and achievements.
Elected in 1975, A.P. Coleman has
served for 38 long years as a member of
the Wilson City Council. He served as
mayor pro tempore from 1989 to 1995.
His campaign slogan embodied his
mantra of service to the community to
improve the lives of its people. He
would say, ‘‘A new way for a new day.’’
His early platform for service included
economic and business development,
balanced growth, housing, crime and
violence, and most importantly, con-
tact with citizens.
His retirement from elected office
was effective a few days ago on 31 May
2019.
A.P. Coleman has served on several
council-appointed boards and commit-
tees throughout the State and the city,
such as president of the North Carolina
League of Municipalities, 1991 to 1992;
chairman of Region L Council of Gov-
ernments, 1990 to 1992, 2006 to 2007; a
member of the Small Cities Council
and National League of Cities, 1988 to
1995.
He has served on the board of direc-
tors for Carolina Family Health Cen-
ters, Incorporated. That is our FQHC in
the city. He served as director since
1999 and even served as chairman.
Mr. Coleman previously served as a
board member for the local and re-
gional Nations Bank and was the re-
cipient of many leadership awards, in-
cluding the Extension Service Superior
Leadership Award. He received a cer-
tificate of appreciation after com-
pleting a 4–H caravan 6-week study
tour of the United Kingdom, honoring
his leadership roles in the States of
Maryland and North Carolina.
He has served, Mr. Speaker, as fi-
nance committee chair for Carolina
Smart Choices for Youth and as a
chairman of the Wilson Preparatory
Academy charter school.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Coleman has been a
very engaged individual for decades.
Throughout his years of public service,
A.P. Coleman has been active with his
local church, civic affairs, and other
charitable organizations. He is a mem-
ber of Calvary Presbyterian Church,
U.S.A., where he serves as an elder. He
is a past member of the board of direc-
tors for United Way, president of the
Wilson County chapter of the North
Carolina A&T State University Alumni
Association, vice president of Crime
Stoppers, past member of the Eastern
North Carolina School for the Deaf’s
human rights committee, member of
the Presbytery of the New Hope dis-
aster committee, and recipient of pres-
tigious accomplishments and awards.
Coleman is also a proud member of
Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity and a life
member of the NAACP.
The most important thing to Avant
Coleman has always been his family.
He was married to the late Willa Mon-
roe Coleman and is the proud father of
three, Elliotte, Wanda, and Jacqueline,
and a proud grandfather of one grand-
son, Juan.
Avant is a family man, dear friend,
and colleague to so many others. Mr.
Speaker, he is also my neighbor, my
next-door neighbor for the past 25
years. A man of principle and convic-
tion to the importance of brotherly
kindness, A.P.’s motto in life is the
golden rule: ‘‘Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you.’’
Finally, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Coleman
has lived an incredible life that, by the
grace of God, has impacted the lives of
so many. His selfless and lifelong dedi-
cation to public service and commu-
nity are beyond remarkable, and he is
truly a role model. His love for his fam-
ily, friends, church, and community
know no bounds.
I am honored today to pay tribute to
such a dedicated and honorable public
servant. I am proud to have A.P. Cole-
man as a constituent and friend. I
thank him for his dedication, service,
and continued role as an inspiration to
all of us. God continue to bless A.P.
Coleman and his family.
f
HONORING JANIE L. MINES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I
would like to recognize one of the most
accomplished constituents in the Fifth
District of South Carolina.
Janie L. Mines, who lives in Fort
Mill, encompasses what it means to
serve and honor one’s country. In 1975,
after the United States Congress au-
thorized the entrance of women into
our first-rate military service acad-
emies, Janie soon applied to enter the
United States Naval Academy in An-
napolis, Maryland.
Out of 81 women who entered the
academy in 1976, Ms. Mines was the
first and only Black woman to grad-
uate from her class and the first ever
Black woman to graduate from the
United States Naval Academy as a
whole.
After her departure from the acad-
emy with the rank of ensign and a
bachelor of science in engineering, Ms.
Mines was trained as a supply officer
and became a supervisor at the former
Naval Training Center in Orlando,
Florida. She proceeded to serve in the
former Naval Annex at the Pentagon,
aboard the USS Emory S. Land, and as
a senior adviser to the Secretary of the
Navy. In fact, she has continued her
work in the Armed Forces on the De-
fense Advisory Committee on Women.
Her exceptional accomplishments in-
clude being granted the position of
torchbearer for the 2002 Olympic
Games, starting a foundation that
tends to the needs of
socioeconomically disadvantaged boys,
and being honored by the United States
Navy with a business achievement
award in 2010.
In 2018, Ms. Mines wrote and pub-
lished the book ‘‘No Coincidences: Re-
flections of the First Black Female
Graduate of the United States Naval
Academy.’’ In it, she shows us the true
meaning of faith, patriotism, and per-
sistence. We can all learn from her
story and her deep love of this country.
I will end with a quote from her
book: ‘‘God has a plan for us all. If we
submit to His will, we need not fear.
We are prepared and protected.’’
We thank Ms. Mines for her contin-
ued service to this great country.
HONORING SOUTHSIDE FIRE DEPARTMENT
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I
rise in honor of the 50th anniversary of
the Southside Fire Department on
March 19.
The fully volunteer fire department
has protected the people and property
of Union County since 1974 when the
first call rang. The station has grown
from as little as five calls a year to 98
calls in 2018 alone.
The foundation of Southside Fire De-
partment was a community effort. The
seed was planted in 1969 when a meet-
ing was held at Roper Chevrolet to
hear the public’s opinion on the organi-
zation of a fire district for the local
area in Union County.
However, it was not until 1972 that
Southside received its first truck and
could finally open its station. Sup-
ported by the local community’s gen-
erosity, the fire department estab-
lished itself and eventually joined
South Carolina’s Firefighters Associa-
tion.
For almost 50 years now, Southside
Volunteer Fire Department has fought
fires to protect the great folks in the
district. The station currently has an
ISO Class 3/9 rating and serves over
3,500 residents.
As a Nation, we ask much of our citi-
zens. Yet, even on top of the burdens
and the toil of everyday life, some

choose to volunteer to save the lives
and property of their neighbors. With
nothing to gain and everything to lose,
they head straight toward danger.
I congratulate the fire chief, Michael
Lancaster, and the rest of the crew at
Southside Fire Department on this in-
credible milestone. We thank them for
their tireless, continued service to our
community and our great Nation.

HONORING OTIS WASHINGTON
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL) for 5 minutes.
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the extraor-
dinary life and legacy of the late Coach
Otis Washington.
A native of Selma, Alabama, Coach
Washington was a legendary Louisiana
Football Hall of Famer who instilled in
his players his winning spirit, strong
character, and quest for excellence.
b 1015
Sadly, Coach Washington passed
away on Friday, May 24, 2019, at the
age of 80.
Coach Washington was born on Feb-
ruary 12, 1939, in Selma, Alabama, to
Sadie and Otis Washington, Sr. He
graduated from R.B. Hudson High
School in 1957, where he was class
president and a star athlete. He then
graduated from Xavier University in
New Orleans, where he was captain of
the football team and an all-conference
guard and linebacker.
Coach Washington’s resume speaks
for itself. As the head football coach,
he led St. Augustine High School in
New Orleans, Louisiana, to three State
championships and, in his 11 seasons
there, he guided the Purple Knights to
11 consecutive winning seasons and
seven district titles.
In 1979, Coach Washington became
the first African American football
coach at LSU when he joined the staff
as offensive line coach. Later, Coach
Washington was hired as the head foot-
ball coach at Southern University,
where he led the Jaguars for six sea-
sons.
Because of his many outstanding
football achievements, Coach Wash-
ington was inducted into the Louisiana
Sports Hall of Fame in 2015 and the St.
Augustine Hall of Fame in 2017, among
many, many other honors.
His success on the football field was
matched by his many efforts in the
community to promote fairness, eq-
uity, and justice. Coach Washington
was a key figure in integrating the
Louisiana High School Athletic Asso-
ciation.
While Coach Washington was often
quick to downplay his role in inte-
grating the league, he did so as a hum-
ble man who knew his place, but, more
importantly, knew that his place was
rising above the stars and making sure
that his players knew that they were
just as good, if not better, than any
other player on the field.
Coach Washington was a devout
Catholic and a devoted member of the
Immaculate Conception Catholic
Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His
devotion to his faith began as a young
boy in Selma, Alabama, where he was a
member of the Don Bosco Catholic
Boys Club, founded by Father Nelson
Ziter in 1947.
He was also a devout husband to his
wife of 52 years, Linda Patterson Wash-
ington of Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
whom he met while coaching at St. Au-
gustine. He is also survived by his sib-
lings, Carol, Olivia, Charlene,
Theopolis, Sharon, and Irma; and many
godchildren, special grandchildren, as
well as nieces, nephews, relatives, and
friends. They will all miss him dearly.
On a personal note, I knew this amaz-
ing man as my ‘‘Uncle Otis.’’ He was
one of my father’s childhood best
friends growing up in Selma, Alabama.
Uncle Otis, my dad, Charles Williams,
and Ted Washington referred to them-
selves as the ‘‘Four Amigos’’ in gram-
mar school, a name that stuck with
them throughout their lives. These
men never forgot the lessons that they
learned from Father Ziter at the Don
Bosco Boys Club in Selma. Their love
for their hometown of Selma and their
commitment to service through sports
will always be remembered.
Uncle Otis and Auntie Linda were a
constant presence in the lives of my
twin brothers and myself. I could al-
ways count on them for words of en-
couragement and boasts of pride on my
many accomplishments. I know that I
stand today as Alabama’s first Black
congresswoman because of the love,
support, nurturing, and prayers of the
mentors, family, and friends like Uncle
Otis and Auntie Linda.
Like my dad, Uncle Otis will be
missed but never forgotten. The legacy
that Uncle Otis leaves behind will live
on in the many lives that he impacted.
May we find comfort in knowing that
his legend lives in us, and we are
stronger and better because Uncle Otis’
light shines bright within us.
On behalf of Alabama’s Seventh Con-
gressional District, I ask my colleagues
to join me in honoring the extraor-
dinary life and legacy of Selma’s own
Coach Otis Washington, a football
coaching legend and Louisiana hall-of-
famer. May we celebrate the totality of
his life today and honor always his
great accomplishments in sports and
contributions in shaping the hearts,
minds, and character of many men.

IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, while
the Judiciary Committee should be fo-
cused on securing the borders and over-
hauling a very broken immigration
system, they, instead, bring a clown
and circus show to town.
When I looked up yesterday and saw
John Dean, it took me back to the hot
summer of 1974, when we saw John
Dean and his cohorts on our television
screens for days at a time. In an era
with only three television stations—
that is right, Mr. Speaker, we only had
three stations growing up—Mr. Dean
was on all three of them for hours at a
time, for days on end.
Bringing another convicted felon,
and a biased one at that, a person who
has tweeted 970 times anti-Trump prop-
aganda, to bring this criminal to these
Chambers was yet another embarrass-
ment to the majority party. All of
America realizes the Democratic lead-
ership has dug a deep, deep hole for
itself and, for all practical purposes,
has started this impeachment process
and hearings. Nevertheless, in con-
tradiction to public wishes, it appears
the Judiciary chairman will continue
to dig a deeper hole by calling such a
slanderous, offensive witness and move
forward with impeachment.
After doing over 38 townhalls across
the State of Kansas since January, ev-
erywhere I go, folks tell me the same
thing: It is time to move on.
Mr. Speaker, we have real problems
that need to be addressed. My folks
back home are dealing with floods and
tornadoes. The farmers can’t get their
crops in the field, and China and the
European Union are blocking us from
exporting our commodities. All these
things are things we cannot control.
We have enough problems without the
Washington swamp adding to our mis-
ery.
Folks back home want our border se-
cured. They want a fair, streamlined
immigration system, which helps fill
the 70,000 open jobs we have across the
State. From agriculture, to the air-
craft industry, to high-tech jobs, Mr.
Speaker, we need more people who are
able and willing to work. And we all
know this immigration reform is ex-
actly what the Judiciary Committee
should be taking up as we speak. In-
stead of fixing real problems, the Dem-
ocrat-controlled House just keeps
digging deeper down this false im-
peachment hole they have initiated.
Mr. Speaker, I want to stop and ap-
plaud the President for his most recent
efforts to secure our borders. As we all
know, over the course of less than 2
weeks—record time for diplomacy in
this age—the President was able to le-
verage potential tariffs into real action
by the Mexican government. That is
right, real action with real results.
Thanks to these efforts, Mexico is
going to place 6,000 new troops to con-
trol their southern border. Addition-
ally, Mexico has agreed to shelter, feed,
and help those who apply for asylum in
this country. This all matters to Kan-
sans, and we thank the President for
his efforts.
This is huge. How huge is it? Well, I
have been to the border, almost a year
ago now, and I know a crisis when I see
it. It was a crisis then and, by all meas-
ures, this crisis has literally doubled.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4396 June 11, 2019
Every day, on average, we are now
apprehending almost 5,000 people cross-
ing the border illegally. We are hous-
ing, feeding, and providing healthcare
to over 40,000 people daily. We literally
have run out of bed space. We now have
over 900,000 people waiting for asylum
hearings, of which only 10 percent have
a legitimate claim.
Even in the words of the most liberal
of newspapers, the New York Times
agrees this is a crisis: ‘‘While law-
makers wring their hands and drag
their feet, tens of thousands of migrant
children are suffering.
‘‘Congress needs to get serious about
dealing with that suffering.’’
Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that Con-
gress won’t do its job, that we won’t se-
cure the border, and that we won’t
overhaul a broken immigration sys-
tem. Instead, the Democrats drive the
agenda that started, for all practical
purposes, an agenda that brings in the
ghost of Christmas past, a convicted
liar and felon, as their star witness for
impeachment hearings.
Mr. Speaker, I continue to learn les-
sons about leadership. Leaders must at
times endure criticism and attacks and
stay the course. Leaders keep their
word, they demand results, and they
hold people accountable. Leaders keep
the ship moving into high headwinds.
Leaders think outside the box. They
use the tools given them. They don’t
make excuses. They never, never give
up. Somehow, they always bring the
light back to the objective, the goal at
hand. When others won’t lift, they lift
the entire weight. They show the path,
they shine the light, and they go first
when others are afraid. Leaders don’t
repeat the mistakes of those who went
before them over and over again.
Mr. Speaker, great leaders all have
their own unique style. One of my he-
roes was President General Dwight
David Eisenhower, who was a vision-
ary, able to move pieces around for the
D-day invasion, but also had the vision
to see the need for an interstate high-
way system, a space program, and civil
rights.
Another hero of mine is John
Wayne’s Rooster Cogburn, the myth-
ical marshal from the movie ‘‘True
Grit,’’ who often, when he couldn’t get
people to follow, well, I guess I would
say, he just ran over them.
Mr. Speaker, I thank our President
for showing us what true leadership
looks like, and what true grit looks
like in real time, in real life.
Mr. Speaker, we need the President
to keep leading.
f
LETTER FROM A CONSTITUENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Ms. FUDGE) for 5 minutes.
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to read a letter from my con-
stituent, Pastor Dr. Ronald S. Wil-
liams.
Mr. Williams writes: ‘‘A mobster, con
man, gangster in the White House? I
think so.
‘‘This past week, Special Counsel
Robert Mueller gave a verbal synopsis
of his 2-year investigative report. He is
quoted as saying: ‘If we had confidence
that the President clearly did not com-
mit a crime, we would have said so.’ He
also said: ‘The Constitution requires a
process other than the criminal justice
system to formally accuse a sitting
President of wrongdoing.’
‘‘This process would be impeachment.
The question is, why hasn’t the United
States Congress started a formal im-
peachment investigation?
‘‘In our Nation’s Pledge of Alle-
giance, we state that the United States
of America is ‘one nation, under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for
all.’ Many of us have been taught to re-
cite this pledge since elementary
school. Today’s society compels one to
ask the question: Are we truly one na-
tion under God?
‘‘NANCY PELOSI is a woman who I re-
spect. However, I do believe her hesi-
tancy to impeach this President is her
opinion, based upon polls and her belief
that it would further polarize the coun-
try. However, the country is already
divided and polarized, which can be
greatly contributed to the madness of
the present executive administration
of the country.
‘‘As a pastor, a father, a grandfather,
and a friend of many, my answer to
this question is, no, we are not.
‘‘I recently engaged in a conversation
with a pastor’s wife who resided in the
small community that I attended grad-
uate school. I knew the town was small
and malignant with bigotry, ignorance,
and racism. As we conversed, I discov-
ered that she, too, was a bigot. She
stated that the present administration
was the ‘smartest and most intelligent
to ever reside in the White House.’
‘‘I asked her if she was out of her
mind. ‘What about Roosevelt and Ken-
nedy?’ she asked. I responded by asking
her what was she talking about. She
responded by saying, ‘They exploited
women, and it was Obama that divided
and polarized the Nation.’
‘‘I knew at that point that she was
steeped in her ignorant opinion. I re-
sponded by telling her that I was not
alive during the Roosevelt years and
during the administration of John F.
Kennedy we did not have internet and
the means of communication that we
have today. Regardless, at least they
both were sophisticated statesmen who
publicly presented themselves as lead-
ers. Secondly, the rightwing went after
Clinton for his indiscretions and
Obama was scandal free.
‘‘It is glaringly apparent that many
who support the present administra-
tion are either racist, steeped in reli-
gious beliefs, ignorant, or, as my moth-
er used to say, ‘just plain dumb.’ They
have chosen to support a president who
has a proven record of being sexually
condescending to women, will not op-
pose the resurgence of the Ku Klux
Klan and other hate organizations, is
indecisive, condescending to anyone
who challenges him, and hides behind
his Twitter account, rather than deal-
ing with the real issues in our country
and around the world, and, to put icing
on this cake, he is a proven liar.
‘‘I believe the crooked ascension of
Trump to the Oval Office is a gauge
that measures the declining patriotic
and moral values of many of the citi-
zens of America, as well as being the
revelation of the hidden bigotry,
judgmental attitudes that yet exist in
many of those who call themselves
evangelicals.
‘‘This President has surrounded him-
self with yes-men and -women who ap-
parently refuse to challenge his mad-
ness for fear of his wrath. I believe I
can safely assume that the United
States is no longer a democracy. A
democratic government is one that is
governed by the people or their elected
representatives. In 2 years, this man
has turned the tide and the Nation is
spiraling downhill quickly.
‘‘My growing concern is that the
Congress and Senate of these United
States have more of a personal interest
for themselves rather than a patriotic
duty to the people they represent. The
Republicans appear to have become a
Trump cult, and the Democrats refuse
to move against this man in a collec-
tive, decisive way.
‘‘I remember the time that we were
guided by principle and not by party.
Congress, Senators, you were not elect-
ed to collect a paycheck, you were
elected to be women and men of prin-
ciple and maintain the health of a
Democratic nation.
‘‘It does not take a genius to discern
that this man wants to be a dictator in
the truest sense of the word. He ap-
pears to be drawn to the evil of tyran-
nical dictators and is alienating our
country from our closest and most
trusted allies. This President praises
the leaders of Russia and North Korea,
while at the same time has been conde-
scending to the leaders of Canada, the
United Kingdom, and Germany, just to
name a few. Something is wrong with
this.
‘‘Despite all of this, there are still
many, including evangelicals and peo-
ple of color, who are resolute in their
support of this administration.
‘‘Thomas Paine wrote:’’
Men must conquer their own spirits. Even
in the shadows of the guillotine, we must
preserve and endure in spite of the threat.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will remind Members that re-
marks in debate may not engage in
personalities toward the President, in-
cluding by repeating remarks made
elsewhere that would be improper if
spoken in the Member’s own words.

IN HONOR OF SERGEANT CARL
MANN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the incredible life and
heroic service of Sergeant Carl Mann.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4397
June 11, 2019
This past week, on the 75th anniver-
sary of D-day, I visited Normandy,
France, where Sergeant Mann and
more than 150,000 American troops
stormed the beaches to gain a foothold
in mainland Europe.
For his heroic service, Sergeant
Mann, a native of Mount Vernon, Indi-
ana, received three Purple Hearts and
seven Bronze Stars while serving in the
5th Infantry Division of General
George S. Patton’s 3rd Army.
In fitting fashion of a true hero, Ser-
geant Mann was laid to rest in Arling-
ton National Cemetery on June 6, this
year, the 75th anniversary of D-day.
Today, I take a moment to honor the
selflessness that he and the Greatest
Generation made so that we and future
generations of Americans may enjoy
boundless freedoms.
My prayers are with his children and
grandchildren that carry on his legacy.
His memory will forever be a reminder
of a day of great tragedy, but also of
triumph.
Rest in peace and God bless.

TITLE X FAMILY PLANNING
PROGRAMS
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CASE). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tleman from New Mexico (Mr. LUJÁN)
for 5 minutes.
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Speaker, I am here
to speak on the importance of Title X
Family Planning programs and to con-
demn the Trump administration’s mis-
guided efforts to prevent patients from
making fully informed health deci-
sions.
This week, the House will begin to
reverse years of deep funding cuts to
this vital program, a slash-and-burn
approach that has had drastic impacts
on the health of women and families.
Consider this: 7 years of Republican
cuts left 1.2 million without access to
proper care.
This is shameful.
I am proud to have led, with the sup-
port of more than 190 of my colleagues,
the effort to urge the Appropriations
Committee to include $400 million for
the Title X Family Planning program
in fiscal year 2020.
Nearly 4 million people struggling to
make ends meet, including people of
color, LGBTQ people, immigrants, and
people in underserved rural commu-
nities, receive care at Title X centers.
We must support the health of mil-
lions of Americans by supporting Title
X and preventing States from discrimi-
nating against potential Title X pro-
viders.

THE NEWTOWN QUAKER MEETING
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize an outstanding
group of young citizens from Bucks
County, Pennsylvania, who are ac-
tively living out their faith and mak-
ing our community a better place.
Earlier this year, members of the
Newtown Quaker Meeting helped raise
$1,665 for the Mercer Street Friends’
Community Schools through a lasagna
dinner held at the Newtown Friends
Meetinghouse. The youth collected vol-
untary donations, served the meal, and
cleaned up after dinner.
This exemplary act of community
service is the norm, not the exception,
for young members of Newtown Quaker
Meeting.
Previously held lasagna dinners have
raised funds for Penndel Food Pantry,
Heifer International, Haiti Relief, and
Save Darfur, among other organiza-
tions. By serving simple meals twice a
year, they have now raised over $28,000
for charity over a 10-year period.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud the work of
these children, their parents, and
congregants of the Newtown Quaker
Meeting. I would like to particularly
thank members of the Children’s Reli-
gious Education Committee of New-
town Meeting, including Sarah Buxton,
Eileen Grant, and Kelly Lake for all of
their work.
IN MEMORY OF MALCOLM CROOKS
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life and mem-
ory of a resident of Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, who passed away last
month at the age of 96.
Malcolm Crooks, a lifelong resident
of Solebury Township, was a noted en-
vironmental and conservation leader.
He was the founding member of the
Honey Hollow and Aquetong Watershed
Associations and was a member of the
first Solebury Township Planning Com-
mission. He also served on numerous
boards that promoted environmental
protection, including those of the
Bucks County Audubon Society and
the Bucks County Planning Commis-
sion.
A man of devout faith, Malcolm was
a member of Solebury Friends Meeting,
and in the 1960s, he moved to Algeria
and led a team of Quakers to assist
local residents. Throughout his life,
Malcolm and his wife, Elaine, contin-
ued to travel the globe and immerse
themselves in world cultures.
Mr. Speaker, Malcolm made our com-
munity a better place. Generations will
continue to experience the beauty of
our home because of his selfless work.
I send my prayers and condolences to
Malcolm’s wife and his children—Syl-
via, Malcolm, and Catherine—along
with his entire family.
IN MEMORY OF PETE ROSSETTI
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it
is with a heavy heart that I rise today
to honor the life and memory of an
American patriot from Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, who passed away on
June 5 at the age of 96. Pete Rossetti,
a resident of Southampton, lived a life
in service to our country and our com-
munity.
Born in Philadelphia, Pete served
honorably in the United States Navy
during World War II. He earned the
American Theater, European Theater
Combat Medal and was also a Purple
Heart recipient. In January, Pete was
awarded the French Legion of Honor
Medal, the highest French military dis-
tinction, for his service. Pete served in
several campaigns during the war, in-
cluding the invasion of Sicily, Salerno,
Angelo, and Normandy.
A graduate of Temple University,
Pete earned a degree in business ad-
ministration from Temple University,
and he later worked as an employee
benefit consultant.
Mr. Speaker, I send my deepest con-
dolences to Pete’s children—Donna,
Sandra, Carla, Joseph, and Mary
Ellen—along with the entire Rossetti
family. May they take comfort that he
is now reunited with Annette and en-
joying his eternal reward.

OUR ECONOMY IS SICK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY) for 5
minutes.
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, this ad-
ministration continues to tell us that
our economic recovery is chugging
along, that it has even been
hypercharged under President Trump.
They say there is well over 7.5 mil-
lion unfilled jobs and 6 million people
looking for work, that wages are begin-
ning to pick up. The stock market has
reached record highs and the unem-
ployment rate, record lows.
So why aren’t our constituents cele-
brating, saving, and spending at equal-
ly historic rates?
Mr. Speaker, everyone in this Cham-
ber knows what I am talking about.
They can feel it. Why does it all seem
so fragile, like this country is walking
on economic eggshells?
Because that is how it feels to Amer-
ican families every single day. Because
in today’s America, you can work a 12-
hour shift, 7 days a week, year after
year—get in one car accident on your
way home from work and end up bank-
rupt.
Because the cost of a college edu-
cation is leaving a generation of grad-
uates with a high-interest mortgage
without the house.
Because the cost of childcare is be-
coming even more unaffordable than
that college degree.
Because the cost of a two-bedroom
apartment swallows up the income of a
full-time minimum wage worker in
every single neighborhood in our coun-
try.
Because nearly 40 percent of Ameri-
cans can’t afford an unexpected $400
medical bill, and skyrocketing pharma-
ceutical costs are forcing families to
open GoFundMe pages to keep their
kids alive.
Just over a decade after hitting rock
bottom, our economy is still sick for a
very simple reason: We haven’t cor-
rectly diagnosed the cause of that ill-
ness.
We are comforted by the improve-
ment of external symptoms, like stock

prices and unemployment rates; mean-
while, our economy’s heart is in dire
straits. Small businesses are shuttered,
factories are fleeing, family farms are
closing, and once-prosperous American
towns are barely scraping by.
To blame for this chronic illness is a
system that has whittled away protec-
tion, opportunity, justice, and dignity
for the American worker.
Our workers rise like their parents
before them—early. They work hard to
provide for their family for well into
the night; they skip lunch breaks; they
defer vacation; they trade with co-
workers to take an overtime shift—all
to care for the ones they love. And yet
the jobs that they hold won’t even
allow for that.
The whole point of a job is to earn a
living and make a life, to contribute to
something purposeful, to be able to
provide for your loved ones in return.
If American jobs can’t meet the
needs of Americans, then what is the
point? How will the greatest economy
in the world possibly endure if its peo-
ple can’t keep up.
Mr. Speaker, I read a story a few
weeks ago about a few local Home
Depot employees who built a walker
for a little boy whose parents were not
certain that insurance would cover a
proper one. And just yesterday, news
sites blasted a story of a 9-year-old lit-
tle boy in California who used his own
allowance to pay off the lunch debts of
his classmates.
The goodness of those workers, of
those children is incredible, and thank
God we have people like them among
us. But a moral, a just, a fair, an ac-
countable, and a decent economy
wouldn’t call those stories heart-
warming but heartbreaking, a damning
indictment of a system that bars
countless Americans of basic necessity,
particularly in their moments of deep-
est need.
A moral capitalism would put quality
on the same page as quantity. It
wouldn’t just ask for integrity and de-
cency from the public and private sec-
tors running our economic show, it
would demand it, with laws that work
in tandem to guarantee that when our
kids get sick, we can take care of
them; when our roof falls, we can re-
pair it; when our stomachs ache, we
can fill them; and when we tire, we can
rest.
Mr. Speaker, that shouldn’t be too
much for anyone to ask.

GUN VIOLENCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) for 5
minutes.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise
on behalf of the mothers, fathers,
brothers, and daughters, the class-
mates and coworkers, the surviving
family and community members, all of
whom have been robbed of loved ones
due to senseless acts of gun violence.
I rise on behalf of mothers with bro-
ken spirits and broken hearts.
I rise on behalf of fathers with deep
wounds and invisible scars, a lifetime
of guilt because they couldn’t keep
their child out of harm’s way.
b 1045
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of young
boys and girls, children traumatized
and sad because they have attended
more funerals than graduation parties.
I rise on behalf of survivors, commu-
nity organizations, and advocates who
selflessly trigger their own trauma to
stand on the front lines of justice and
movement building.
I rise on behalf of districts like mine,
the Massachusetts Seventh, that are
weighed down by systemic inequities,
generational poverty, and cycles of vio-
lence.
Today, in partnership with orga-
nizers, advocates, and survivors, I am
calling for a National Survivors of
Homicide Victims Awareness Month to
amplify the voices of families and com-
munities severely and disproportion-
ately impacted by gun violence; to cen-
ter their struggles, their stories, their
truths; to foster peace; and to seek jus-
tice.
Already this year, 16 families across
the Massachusetts Seventh have been
robbed of their loved ones. I rise in re-
membrance of them and in recognition
of those they left behind:
Emmanuel Molin, 32, survived by his
two sons, mother, father, and five sib-
lings;
Godfrey Jenkins Hall, 28, survived by
his son, brother, and aunt;
Carl Reynolds, 28, survived by his
mother, father, siblings, and daughter;
Gary Brown, 34, survived by his son
and sister;
Jeudy Romero, 29, survived by five
children, fiance, father, and siblings;
Juan Morales, 32, survived by his
three children;
Kasim Kahrim, 36, survived by his
sisters, aunts, and uncles;
Kendric Price, 32, survived by his
mother, grandmother, brothers, and
godchildren;
Haki Sanders, 33, survived by his
mother;
Eleanor Maloney, 74, survived by
three daughters, a son, six grand-
children, seven great-grandchildren,
and four siblings;
Michael Dukes, 53, survived by his
mother, father, five children, one
grandson, sister, and dear friends;
Kevin Boyd, 53, survived by his wife,
two sons, grandchildren, and brother;
Kevin Brewington, 33, survived by his
mother, father, son, brothers, and sis-
ters;
Donell Davis, 24, survived by his
mother, brothers, and sister;
Carl Brown, 43, survived by his child;
and
Luckinson Oruma, 60, survived by his
wife and five children.
Tomorrow will mark the anniversary
of 49 souls lost, lives we were robbed of
3 years ago at the Pulse nightclub in
Orlando, and the fear and trauma of
those who survived and the families
and loved ones that they left behind.
May we remember them. May we
speak up for them. May we fight to en-
sure that there is no one else like
them.
Long gone are the days of thoughts
and prayers. Now is the time for out-
rage, equitable outrage, policy, and
change. This is a public health crisis,
an epidemic.
Bullets do not discriminate. They
don’t care if we are a Member of Con-
gress, a World Series champion, a sen-
ior citizen, or a child.
It is up to Congress to demonstrate
courage, to do what is right for our
children, for our communities, for all
survivors impacted by gun violence.
Enough is enough. These survivors
deserve our respect. They deserve our
resources. They deserve healing. They
deserve justice.
In districts like the Massachusetts
Seventh, community-based organiza-
tions are doing their job every day: Vi-
olence in Boston, Operation LIPSTICK,
We Are Better Together, the Louis D.
Brown Peace Institute, the Justice Re-
source Institute, the Women Survivors
of Homicide Movement, and the Bobby
Mendes Peace Legacy project.
Our Suffolk County D.A., Rachael
Rollins, is fighting every day to im-
prove our clearance rates to get these
surviving family members the justice
they deserve.
It is time for Congress to do our job.
Enough is enough.

COMMEMORATING 75TH
ANNIVERSARY OF MIGHTY MO
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
KENNEDY). The Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) for
5 minutes.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the 75th birthday of one of the
most iconic ships ever to sail the seven
seas, the U.S. Navy’s USS Missouri.
Mighty Mo, our last battleship, was
commissioned June 11, 1944, after being
laid down and launched at the Brook-
lyn Navy Yard. She went on to one of
the longest and most distinguished ca-
reers of any Navy ship ever, earning 11
battle stars in three wars: World War
II, the Korean war, and Operation
Desert Shield/Desert Storm.
But she is best known for her role not
in war but in peace. For of course it
was on her decks at anchor in Tokyo
Bay on September 2, 1945, V-J Day,
that General Douglas MacArthur ac-
cepted the surrender of Japan, ending
World War II.
Mighty Mo was finally struck from
the register in 1995. For the last two
decades, she has been moored in a place
of honor at Pearl Harbor, alongside her
fallen sisters—most notably, the USS
Arizona—as a living museum under the
loving stewardship of the USS Missouri
Memorial Association in partnership
with the U.S. Navy.
On her decks next year, on Sep-
tember 2, we will recognize the 75th an-
niversary of the end of the Second
World War. But for today, let us simply

HONORING HENRY PARHAM
(Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Penn-
sylvania asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute
and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay
tribute to one of my constituents, Mr.
Henry Parham, who is believed to be
the last surviving African American
combat veteran from D-day. Mr.
Parham served in the 320th Barrage
Balloon Battalion, the only African
American combat unit to land in Nor-
mandy on June 6, 1944.
Men from the 320th were in the first
waves to land on Omaha Beach that
day. They had the vital task of pre-
venting enemy aircraft from attacking
the beaches where men in equipment
were pouring ashore. Their balloons
prevented enemy planes from making
effective attacks, but the balloons also
made excellent targets for enemy fire.
Back then, the Army, like most of
American society, was segregated. Nev-
ertheless, these African Americans
risked their lives to serve their coun-
try, even as Blacks faced Jim Crow
laws and racist violence back home.
Needless to say, the German bombs
and bullets didn’t discriminate. Two
thousand Americans died on Omaha
Beach that day, including men from
the 320th. Many more were wounded.
I want to recognize Henry Parham
from the 320th Barrage Balloon Bat-
talion for his heroic service to our
country. I am very proud to represent
Mr. Parham in Congress.

102 YEARS OF HONOR AT FORT
JACKSON
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, last week was the 102nd anni-
versary and Victory Week at Fort
Jackson in South Carolina.
Under the leadership of Brigadier
General Milford Beagle, Jr., and Com-
mand Sergeant Major Jeremiah Gan,
Fort Jackson is the bedrock for build-
ing readiness for all components of the
Army.
This week, the Greater Columbia Re-
gion is being honored as a Great Amer-
ican Defense Communities Award re-
cipient. The Columbia Chamber of
Commerce, led by President Carl
Blackstone and Chairman David
Lockwood, provided the nomination,
citing Fort Jackson, the South Caro-
lina National Guard, and McEntire
Joint Air Base.
Fort Jackson is the Nation’s largest
basic training base, conducting over
half of the Army’s basic combat train-
ing, with over 60,000 soldiers per year
and with about 10,000 soldiers in basic
combat training at any given time.
Fort Jackson also trains more than 60
percent of all women entering the
Army each year.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

Climate change is not a future
threat; it is a threat now, and we need
to take urgent action. The decisions we
make today will determine the future
we leave to our children.
We also need to prepare for the con-
sequences of climate change, which are
already affecting our environment, our
infrastructure, our economy, and, yes,
even our health.
More frequent and intense heat
waves are leading to higher rates of
heat stroke. Warmer temperatures are
also directly affecting vector-, food-,
and waterborne diseases and causing
longer allergy seasons.
We need to understand and prepare
for these changes. That is why I led a
letter to the House Appropriations
Committee urging support for the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention
Climate and Health Program to help
our city and State health departments
address and prepare for the effects of
climate change.
I am pleased that funding for their
important work has increased to $15
million in this year’s bill. I urge my
colleagues to support this provision to
help vulnerable communities adapt to
the health threats of climate change.

CONDITIONS OF MIGRANT DETEN-
TION FACILITIES ARE INHUMANE
(Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
I am joined today by my colleagues to
show our country the inhumane condi-
tions of migrant detention facilities.
As a grandfather and an immigrant,
my heart breaks every time another
child dies in U.S. custody.
Migrants are escaping some of the
harshest political and economic tur-
moil in Central America, only to have
their children die once they arrive
here. Like 1-year-old Mariee Juarez
and her mother who fled domestic
abuse in Guatemala, then she died in a
U.S. hospital after receiving inad-
equate care.
We don’t allow prisoners to die. How
are we allowing children to die in Fed-
eral custody?
Last week, the inspector general of
DHS confirmed what we already knew:
Conditions are dangerous and unsani-
tary.
This is cruel and un-American. This
cannot be the new normal. What the
President is doing is anything but nor-
mal.
When Attorney General Sessions ini-
tiated this, it was a bad way to move
forward.
Is this the message that President
Trump wants to send the world, that
the U.S. is where children come to die?
How many children must die before
this administration acts?

CELEBRATING NATIONAL
HOMEOWNERSHIP MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, June is National Home-
ownership Month, and it is the time
when we celebrate and recognize the
many benefits of owning a home.
For generations of Americans, own-
ing a home has been an essential ele-
ment in achieving the American
Dream. But since the Great Recession,
we have seen homeownership rates dip
to historic lows.
Young families often find themselves
unable to save for a down payment or
gain access to adequate credit, and
that is especially true for those living
in rural areas.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture
places emphasis on helping rural Amer-
icans buy homes. USDA provides mort-
gage loan guarantees through partner-
ships with private-sector lenders to
help low- to moderate-income rural
home buyers. USDA has helped more
than 4.4 million rural residents buy
homes since the National Housing Act
was passed 70 years ago.
Mr. Speaker, homeownership has
widespread benefits: It fortifies com-
munities, creates jobs, and strengthens
the local businesses that support our
towns.
I thank USDA for its commitment to
providing affordable housing for rural
Americans. By helping hardworking
Americans achieve this dream, it pro-
vides a strong foundation for more
prosperous rural communities.
f
AMERICA IS BETTER THAN THIS
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I have
seen with my very own eyes the way
migrants at the southern border, par-
ticularly children, are treated under
U.S. custody. It is so appalling, we
would not ever accept one of our own
children being treated in such condi-
tions in any country across the world.
Young toddlers go days without proper
hygiene, nutrition, or medical treat-
ment.
These awful conditions have led to
the deaths of minors at the hands of
our government, like Felipe Gomez
Alonzo, who was just 8 years old.
If this administration’s plan is to
mistreat refugees to prevent them from
coming here, it clearly is not working.
Just think, if they would rather risk
this treatment than remain in their
home countries, how bad must it be
there?
America is better than this. We must
treat immigrants better than this. We
must treat refugees better than this.
We must treat children better than
this.
Mr. Speaker, the whole world is
watching.
ADDRESSING HUMANITARIAN
CHALLENGES FACED AT SOUTH-
ERN BORDER
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, on May
31, the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’s Office of Inspector General pub-
lished an alarming report that con-
firms the terrible consequences of the
Trump administration’s failure to
truly address the humanitarian chal-
lenges we face at our southern border.
Instead of working with Congress and
leaders in our hemisphere on address-
ing root causes and policy that rep-
resents America’s values of compas-
sion, the administration, instead,
chooses cruelty.
As a result, agents and officers are
overworked, exhausted, and frustrated.
Communities like mine are stretched
beyond capacity, and migrants are in
inhumane conditions.
The photos and description of the
conditions at the Paso Del Norte Proc-
essing Center in my district are beyond
disturbing:
Migrants standing on toilets to make
room and gain breathing space;
A cell with a maximum capacity of 35
holding 155 migrants;
Detainees wearing soiled clothing for
days or weeks;
The list goes on.
I visited the PDN Processing Center
when I was home this weekend, and one
thing is clear: Congress must establish,
and DHS must abide by, humanitarian
standards. Not doing so is immoral and
un-American.

b 1215
ICE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to condemn the inhumane
treatment of immigrants at detention
centers around the country.
Recently exposed documents paint a
gruesome picture of ICE custodians
abusing the practice of solitary con-
finement on immigration detainees.
Often these detainees have not violated
rules or shown dangerous behavior,
but, in some instances, are being held
in isolation because they are disabled
or because they identify as gay.
Even under ICE’s own guidelines, sol-
itary confinement is a serious step that
requires careful consideration of all al-
ternatives. Yet, ICE is using this prac-
tice as a tool of first resort, not last re-
sort. One detainee noted that the
strain of the isolation made him lose
his mind.
These reported cases reveal what we
already feared: that this administra-
tion is committed to widespread abuse
of human beings simply because of who
they are and where they come from.
Mr. Speaker, I learned at an early
age that we are all God’s children. This
is not the way to treat God’s children.

June 11, 2019
GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS
MONTH
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker,
June is Gun Violence Awareness
Month, and I am so tired of watching
innocent children being lowered into
the ground.
A week ago, there was another mass
shooting in Virginia Beach. The shoot-
er had a sound suppressor and a large
capacity magazine. And it struck me:
these things which gave him an advan-
tage are banned in my home State of
New Jersey. We have one of the lowest
rates of gun violence of any State in
America.
Why is that? We have poverty, we
have crime, we have mental illness just
like other States, but we also have sen-
sible gun laws.
It has been just over 100 days since
the House passed a sensible gun bill
that the vast majority of Americans
support. Universal background checks
will save lives. The Senate could pass
this bill today, but the Senate major-
ity leader refuses to hold a vote.
Mr. Speaker, this is what the voters
who sent us here are most tired of: spe-
cial interests blocking action on what
most of us agree must be done.
It is time for the Senate to give the
American people the safety and com-
mon sense that they voted for and, at
long last, pass universal background
checks.
f
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
(Mr. CARSON of Indiana asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, everyone knows that Americans pay
too much for their prescription drugs,
and something must be done.
That is why I am pleased House
Democrats are addressing the rising
costs of these medications. We have
passed legislation like H.R. 987 and
H.R. 1503, both of which can lower the
cost of prescription drugs by helping to
bring a greater number of generic
drugs to market, but we can’t stop
there.
We must act boldly and in a bipar-
tisan manner, Mr. Speaker, to confront
the obstacles that stand between hard-
working Americans and affordable pre-
scriptions necessary for their well-
being. In the wealthiest nation in the
world, Mr. Speaker, no one should have
to face these barriers to affordable,
quality healthcare.
f
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY DETENTION FACILITIES
(Mr. CÁRDENAS asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. CÁRDENAS. Mr. Speaker,
Jakelin Caal Maquin, 7-year-old girl.
Felipe Gomez Alonzo, 8 years old. Juan
de Leon Gutierrez, 16 years old. Carlos
Hernandez Vasquez, 16 years old. All of
these children died under our custody
in the United States of America.
In the last 8 months, six children
have died in the United States of
America under the custody of the De-
partment of Homeland Security. It
pains me to say this because I am not
talking about some war-torn country
halfway around the world. This is hap-
pening right here in the United States
of America.
Over the past 2 years, under this
President, President Donald Trump, 24
men, women, and children who came
looking for a better life in the United
States of America died.
This administration’s treatment is
inhumane. What President Trump and
this administration are doing is shame-
ful.
Mr. Speaker, let’s be very clear: the
crisis at the border is a humanitarian
crisis that is the product of the Presi-
dent’s deadly policies. We need ac-
countability and this President will
need to answer for his role in the loss
of life, on our soil, at the United States
border.
f
GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS
MONTH
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, this is
Gun Violence Awareness Month. I rise
to commemorate the life of Ms. Briuna
Harps, a young woman with a bright
future in Fort Worth, who lost her life
in a senseless act of gun violence last
month.
Nineteen-year-old Briuna had just
finished her first year of pre-med class-
es when she was visiting her sister at
an apartment complex in Fort Worth
and was struck by a bullet in the cross-
fire between two gangs, two idiotic
gangs, in an idiotic gang war. Sadly,
Briuna’s death and deaths like it are
too commonplace in America. Each
day, nearly 100 people in our Nation are
killed by someone using a gun.
Recently, the city of Fort Worth
launched a local initiative to protect
our neighborhoods and curb gun vio-
lence. The Senate can help us in this
area by taking action to pass common-
sense gun safety legislation that the
House passed over 100 days ago. Taking
action is the best way that we can
honor the life of Briuna and the other
lives just like hers who were lost to
gun violence.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the community
and give special thanks to Pastor Mil-
ton Pace, Tiffany Pace Whitaker, and
Montreal Dukes for hosting a recent
dialogue on curbing violence in our
Fort Worth community.
But we need the Senate to do their
part. We need them to act. Pass the
legislation that we passed in the House
now.
FUTURE OF AMERICA’S FARMERS
(Mrs. CRAIG asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of family farmers
throughout the Midwest and in my
home State of Minnesota. We are fac-
ing a year of unseasonably wet condi-
tions, leaving many producers weigh-
ing their options for the future of their
farms.
I am proud to join my colleague, Rep-
resentative DUSTY JOHNSON of South
Dakota, in introducing the FEEDD
Act, a bipartisan bill to give farmers
flexibility to graze and harvest cover
crops on prevent plant acres.
Congress has a responsibility to do
right by our Nation’s farmers who feed,
clothe, and fuel our communities by
providing them the flexibility they
need to do their jobs successfully. This
bill will help alleviate concerns of a
forage shortage and improve soil
health through the use of cover crops.
This is a bipartisan, commonsense
solution, and we need a whole lot more
of that in this House. I encourage my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
come together and support this bill and
stand up for our farmers throughout
the country.
f
HONORING THERESA BURROUGHS
(Ms. SEWELL of Alabama asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the extraor-
dinary life and legacy of Theresa Bur-
roughs, a champion for voting rights
and a foot soldier of the civil rights
movement.
Sadly, Mrs. Burroughs passed away
on May 22, 2019, at the age of 89.
Mrs. Burroughs dedicated her life to
advancing equality and justice and
making sure that future generations
would learn about the sacrifices and
the bravery of foot soldiers who
marched, bled, and died for the right to
vote and for civil rights in this coun-
try.
She is best known for her steward-
ship in founding the Safe House Black
History Museum in Greensboro, Ala-
bama. The museum is located in the
same house in Hale County where Dr.
Martin Luther King hid out from the
KKK on a visit to west Alabama in
1968. The museum houses materials to
educate future generations of the local
struggle that happened in the Black
Belt of Alabama on behalf of all of us.
I am deeply honored to have known
Mrs. Burroughs, and, in fact, I had the
opportunity to present Mrs. Burroughs
with a Congressional Gold Medal for
her participation in the 1965 march
from Selma to Montgomery. I am deep-
ly honored because I know I stand on
the shoulders of Mrs. Burroughs. So
many of us do. Her bright light will al-
ways glow through the many lives that

REMEMBERING JAKELIN CAAL
MAQUIN
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in memory of Jakelin Caal Maquin, a 7-
year-old Guatemalan girl, who died in
December while in the custody of our
Federal Government.
Seven months ago, Jakelin joined her
father in fleeing the extreme danger
and poverty of her village in Guate-
mala. They fled from violence. How-
ever, Jakelin’s life was cut short in De-
cember when she died of sepsis while
under the responsibility of our Federal
Government.
As a physician, I know that the inhu-
mane conditions at our Border Patrol
facilities risk the lives of children
when under CBP custody. That is why,
this week, I am introducing the Hu-
manitarian Standards for Individuals
in CBP Act, legislation requiring CBP
to meet the humanitarian needs of
children and families in their custody.
My bill will require health screenings
and improved access to lifesaving
equipment and medications, and it will
set minimum standards to ensure ac-
cess to food, water, and shelter.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this commonsense bill to help
prevent future deaths of children at the
border and restore humanity to our
treatment of asylum seekers and fami-
lies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4403
June 11, 2019
Mr. Speaker, this rule pairs two bills
which demonstrate the commitment of
the House majority both to making
strong progress for the American peo-
ple in the areas of health, labor, and
education, at the same time that we
defend the Constitution of the United
States and the rule of law against the
obstructionism and the lawlessness of
the executive branch of government.
Let’s start with H.R. 2740, which is
designed to make government work for
our people. It provides $189.9 billion in
discretionary funding for the Depart-
ment of Labor, the Department of Edu-
cation, and the Department of Health
and Human Services.
It increases investment in the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, our coun-
try’s preeminent medical research
agency, a national treasure, which is
headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland,
in my district, to support research for
Alzheimer’s disease, HIV/Aids, breast
cancer, colon cancer, cystic fibrosis,
multiple sclerosis, childhood cancer,
heart disease, stroke, diabetes, mental
health, suicide prevention, and the
Cancer Moonshot initiative.
The people of NIH and their network
of allied entities and agencies and sup-
ported universities and research labs
across the country are making pro-
found progress in the struggle to uplift
the health of the people against all of
the killer diseases of our time.
And for the first time in more than 20
years, this bill contains funding to sup-
port gun violence and firearm injury
prevention research, and we are proud
of that.
This legislation increases funding for
Department of Education programs to
help America’s children succeed, pro-
viding critical resources for elemen-
tary and secondary schools, special ed
programs, and Federal student aid. Im-
portantly, the bill increases the max-
imum Pell grant to help America’s col-
lege and graduate students keep pace
with inflation and the high cost of liv-
ing.
H.R. 2740 also provides $56.4 billion in
funding for the State Department,
USAID, and the U.S. Institute of
Peace. We are making major strategic
investments in diplomacy, global
health, and international basic edu-
cation, the crucial ingredients for
maintaining peace and security around
the world.
This legislation provides essential
humanitarian assistance and critical
funding to improve maternal and child
health, to fight diseases like malaria,
and to support women’s reproductive
health and literacy across the globe.
We know that the key to improving so-
cial and economic development around
the world is the education of women
and the investment in family planning
programs and literacy about
procreation.
This legislation renews our Nation’s
commitment to addressing the climate
crisis by investing in directives on
adaption and renewable energy. It also
prohibits the use of any government
funds to withdraw from the Paris cli-
mate agreement.
Now, on the other legislation, which
deals with contempt, Mr. Speaker, we
know from Special Counsel Mueller’s
report that there was a sweeping and
systematic assault on America’s elec-
tions in 2016. There was a conscious ef-
fort and plan by Vladimir Putin and
the GRU to undermine and destabilize
the American elections by interfering
and hacking into the Democratic Na-
tional Committee, the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee,
Hillary Clinton’s offices to inject poi-
sonous ideological propaganda into the
body politic of America through
Facebook, through Twitter, through
YouTube and other social media enti-
ties and then to directly hack into the
State boards of election.
The Department of Justice launched
a special counsel inquiry. It was a Re-
publican Attorney General who named
a Republican special counsel, Mr.
Mueller, to do it.
The President of the United States,
according to Special Counsel Mueller’s
report, engaged in at least 10 different
episodes of efforts to interfere with
that investigation, to obstruct justice.
We received that report a couple of
months ago from the special counsel.
In the aftermath of it, President
Trump said, ‘‘We are fighting all sub-
poenas,’’ and declared that there would
be no cooperation from the executive
branch with legislative branch sub-
poenas, with our demands for docu-
ments, with our demands for witnesses,
with our demands for testimony from
the executive branch. He said: ‘‘I don’t
want people testifying,’’ and, ‘‘There is
no reason to go any further.’’ And since
then, they have drawn a curtain down
over the executive branch of govern-
ment and defied the lawful orders of
the Congress of the United States.
The Trump administration is
stonewalling, from pillar to post, con-
gressional investigations, defying val-
idly issued congressional subpoenas.
So, for example, Attorney General Barr
is refusing to produce the full
unredacted Mueller report and the re-
lated underlying evidence to the House
Committee on the Judiciary.
Every other independent special
counsel had simply turned their report
over to Congress and Congress did the
redactions, but Attorney General Barr
engaged in a series of games with the
Congress of the United States and con-
fused the American public, as Special
Counsel Mueller complained in a letter
that he sent to the Attorney General.
He is also defying a House Intel-
ligence Committee subpoena directing
him to turn over documents and mate-
rials related to Special Counsel
Mueller’s investigation, including all
counterintelligence and foreign intel-
ligence materials produced during the
investigation.
Don McGahn, the former White
House counsel, has defied a subpoena
issued by the House Committee on the
Judiciary without any substantial
legal basis at all.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is
defying a subpoena from the House
Ways and Means Committee directing
him to produce the President’s tax re-
turns under a statute that makes it
crystal clear that Congress has a right
to obtain the tax returns of the Presi-
dent or any other citizen of the United
States.
Commerce Secretary Ross and Attor-
ney General William Barr are refusing
to comply with duly authorized bipar-
tisan subpoenas from the House Over-
sight and Reform Committee, which is
investigating the administration’s
shadowy and illicit efforts to add an il-
legitimate citizenship question to the
2020 Census completely outside of the
Administrative Procedures Act proc-
ess. Several District Courts have
struck that down. But, in any event,
the administration is refusing to turn
over evidence, relevant evidence, to
Congress about this effort to impose
the citizenship question on the census.
The administration is refusing to
turn over documents, witnesses, and
testimony relating to the corruption of
the security clearance process in the
White House personnel office.
There were 25 different individuals
who were denied a security clearance
by the professional staff in the White
House personnel office, who were then
overruled by President Trump or polit-
ical appointees. We are trying to get
information as to what was the basis
for the original denial. It was, likely,
conflict with foreign governments or
financial conflicts of interest. It might
also have been drug or alcohol prob-
lems. But we want to get the details of
each one, and then we want to know if
there is any written documentation of
why the President and his subordinates
overturned those.
In all of these cases, Mr. Speaker, the
executive branch of government has
followed President Trump’s orders to
say, simply: We are not going to turn
anything over to Congress.
Now, understand, the Supreme Court
of the United States has held that it is
an essential and integral aspect of leg-
islative power to engage in investiga-
tion and factfinding. That is how the
people’s Representatives are able to
legislate: We are able to get informa-
tion. But if you shut down our ability
to get information, we cannot engage
in lawmaking. For that reason, we
have begun to win in all of these Fed-
eral District Court cases where we are
going out to try to get this informa-
tion.
But, Mr. Speaker, we cannot tie up
the floor of the House of Representa-
tives every time the executive branch
decides to follow the order of the Presi-
dent and simply deny us the informa-
tion that we seek.
My friends across the aisle know
from the Fast and Furious investiga-
tion, the Hillary Clinton email inves-
tigation, the Benghazi investigation it
is Congress’ right to investigate and to
obtain the documents that it wants.
They obtained millions of documents

H4404 June 11, 2019
in those investigations. We had a right
to get them then, and we have a right
to get all of these documents now.
Mr. Speaker, this legislation will
give the power, first of all, to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary to follow
through on the subpoenas that it has
issued. It will also empower and au-
thorize each chair of the House of Rep-
resentatives to enforce their lawful
subpoenas that are being dishonored
and violated by the executive branch of
government.
So we are very proud to bring for-
ward these two pieces of legislation,
one which makes good on our commit-
ment to the American people to con-
tinue to make progress in the fields of
education, healthcare, labor, and sci-
entific and medical research while, at
the same time, we defend the Constitu-
tion, the rule of law, the prerogatives
and powers of Congress against the
lawlessness and the obstructionism of
this administration.
We are the preeminent and primary
branch of government. The very first
sentence of the Constitution, Mr.
Speaker: ‘‘We the people of the United
States, in order to form a more perfect
Union, establish justice, insure domes-
tic tranquility, provide for the common
defense, promote the general welfare,
and secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity, do ordain
and establish this Constitution for the
United States of America.’’
The second sentence that follows is
all legislative power is vested in the
Congress of the United States.
b 1245
The sovereign power of the people
comes right through the preamble into
Article I, establishing us as the rep-
resentatives of the people. Then you
get dozens of paragraphs setting forth
all the powers of Congress: to declare
war, to raise revenues, to write budg-
ets, to impeach the President or other
executive branch officials who commit
high crimes and misdemeanors and to
remove them in the Senate, to set up a
post office, to govern the seat of gov-
ernment, and to establish a capital
city. Those are the prerogatives and
powers of Congress.
Then you get to Article II, and Arti-
cle II fixes the powers of the President.
What are the President’s core respon-
sibilities? To take care that the laws
are faithfully executed. That is the
President’s job: to take care that the
laws are faithfully executed.
It is even in Article II that the Presi-
dent can be impeached, in Section 4.
Just to make it clear, the President
works for the Congress; the Congress
doesn’t work for the President. And we,
the Congress, work for the people.
That is what it means to have a rep-
resentative democracy. We work for
the people.
Now, we have a President who is in
an unprecedented, wholesale, categor-
ical defiance of the powers of Congress
by denying us the information that we
seek to obtain, which is our right and
which is our need.
We are going to get it, and we are
going to get it by empowering Congress
to go to court to enforce our sub-
poenas.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my
good friend, the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. RASKIN), for yielding me the
customary 30 minutes, and I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I hadn’t had this in the
opening, but I want to disagree with
my friend right off the top. The Presi-
dent of the United States does not
work for the Congress of the United
States. He works for the American peo-
ple, and he heads up a branch of gov-
ernment that is a coequal branch of
government. So, on that, we will have
a long discussion.
Mr. Speaker, it has been a very
eventful week in the Rules Committee,
and it is only Tuesday. Last night, the
committee met and reported out a rule
that covers two drastically different
measures. H.R. 2740 is an appropria-
tions package that covered first 5 and
then 4 of the 12 appropriations bills for
fiscal year 2020. We also considered H.
Res. 430, a resolution that gives author-
ity to the Office of the General Counsel
of the House of Representatives to seek
to enforce certain subpoenas for docu-
ments through litigation.
Shortly after we finish here, the com-
mittee will again convene to consider
the remainder of the appropriations
package, which will be on the floor as
part of a separate rule tomorrow.
Meanwhile, our Members will at-
tempt the miracle of being in two
places at once as we continue to debate
H. Res. 430, which falls into our origi-
nal jurisdiction here on the floor.
Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 430 comes from
a dispute over documents relating to
the special counsel’s investigation into
Russian interference in the 2016 Presi-
dential election. The dispute also
stems from the inherent oversight au-
thority of Congress and our ability to
perform oversight functions over the
executive branch. It falls into the fuzzy
boundaries between the branches of
governments as to when and how we
may compel the executive branch to
turn over documents to the legislative
branch.
I lay out that framework because
there is an important point here that is
being lost. The Democratic majority
clearly wants to make this dispute en-
tirely about this President, this Attor-
ney General, this White House counsel,
this investigation, this subpoena of
documents. The Democrats want to
focus attention there because they
think it helps them politically to do so.
But this dispute really shouldn’t be
about just that. It should, rather, be
about the difficult and thorny ques-
tions that emerge in a system like ours
with three branches of government
with checks and balances.
In a sense, what the majority is seek-
ing to do here today is completely un-
precedented, both in its intent and in
its execution. Consider the only other
times the House has filed a lawsuit to
seek to enforce a subpoena for docu-
ments. It has happened twice before,
Mr. Speaker, once in 2007, to seek docu-
ments from former White House Coun-
sel Harriet Miers, and again in 2012, to
seek documents from then-Attorney
General Eric Holder as a result of the
congressional investigation into the
Fast and Furious scandal.
In both of these cases, the House had
already voted to hold both Miers and
Holder in contempt of Congress before
filing suit, which has not yet happened
in this case. In the Miers case, 138 days
elapsed from the first document re-
quest to the Judiciary Committee vot-
ing to hold her in contempt. In the
Holder case, it was significantly
longer, in that 464 days elapsed from
the first document request to the com-
mittee voting to hold him in contempt.
That was well over a year.
Here, the majority is forcing us to
rush forward at a much faster pace.
Just 44 days elapsed from the date of
the first document request to the At-
torney General until the Judiciary
Committee voted to hold him in con-
tempt. James Holzhauer has been
champion of ‘‘Jeopardy!’’ for longer
than that.
I don’t understand the majority’s
haste here. Without exhausting all
other options—continuing negotiation,
discussion, compromise, and turning to
a vote on contempt as the last resort—
the majority is, instead, pushing this
forward into litigation with the execu-
tive branch. In doing so, they may well
be placing the House in a position that
causes significant long-term damage to
the institution.
When this matter goes before the
courts, it will do so as a case of first
impression and under an untested legal
theory. In both the Miers and Holder
cases, the House previously voted to
hold those two individuals in contempt
of Congress. Nothing like that has been
done here. Using untested tactics like
this could set a dangerous precedent
that harms us all, Republicans and
Democrats, in the long run.
Finally, I would also note that it is
not clear what this resolution will ulti-
mately accomplish. Since the House
has not yet exercised all the tools in
its tool kit, and since it is not clear
that the negotiations with the Justice
Department and the White House over
the documents at issue are at an end,
this whole thing may be nothing more
than sound and fury. Indeed, given how
quickly the majority is rushing into
things, it seems unlikely that the only
course of action left in the House is to
file a lawsuit.
I strongly urge the majority to con-
tinue working with the Justice Depart-
ment and the White House to find a
resolution to these issues without re-
sorting to knee-jerk lawsuits that may
ultimately damage the House as an in-
stitution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4405
June 11, 2019
Today, we are also beginning consid-
eration of H.R. 2740, an appropriations
package covering 5 of 12 appropriations
bills: Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices, and Education; Legislative
Branch; Defense; State and Foreign Op-
erations; and Energy and Water Devel-
opment. These five bills cover over 70
percent of our total discretionary
spending for fiscal year 2020.
To be precise, Mr. Speaker, we were
to do five bills. At the last moment,
the majority pulled the Legislative
Branch appropriations bill. I will let
them explain why at their leisure.
As a longtime member of the Appro-
priations Committee, I am pleased that
we are beginning to move the appro-
priations bills to the floor. Unfortu-
nately, the bills before us have numer-
ous flaws, most notably that they are
marked to allocation levels that aren’t
realistic.
As we move forward through the ap-
propriations process, I think we need
to be clear about the challenges we
face this year.
At the end of September, fiscal year
2019 expires, and sequestration cuts
contained in the Budget Control Act of
2011 will automatically take effect for
fiscal year 2020. In order to prevent
that, we need to come to a bipartisan,
bicameral budget deal that the House,
the Senate, and the President can all
agree on. If we don’t, then it doesn’t
really matter what fake number the
House marks to. Sequestration will hit,
and our defense budget will automati-
cally be slashed by 11 percent and our
nondefense budget by 9 percent below
the allocations of 2019.
The spending levels in these appro-
priations bills are not just ambitious;
they are unrealistic. Not only are the
funding levels for many of these bills
too high, so high that the Senate and
the President will never agree to them,
but the allocations the Appropriations
Committee used reflect the misguided
notion that any increase in defense
spending must be matched by an in-
crease in nondefense spending that is
more than twice as high.
That is simply not a realistic assess-
ment of our national priorities or the
fiscal limitations imposed on us by our
rising national debt. The defense provi-
sion of this bill, for example, comes in
at $8 billion less than the President
told us was needed to adequately fund
the military, maintain readiness, and
be prepared to confront international
threats.
After years of severe underfunding of
our Armed Forces and at a time when
threats are emerging everywhere
around the globe, spending less than
the administration asks for on defense
in order to push more money into do-
mestic programs is not a wise course of
action.
I am disappointed that the majority
chose to strip out pro-life provisions
that have been carried in appropria-
tions bills for years. Instead, they
added controversial pro-abortion riders
that virtually guarantee no Republican
support whatsoever for this package.
As the former chair and current
ranking member of the Labor, Health
and Human Services, Education, and
Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am
familiar with the need for compromise
on that particular piece of legislation.
But by pushing forward with blatantly
partisan riders like these, the majority
is guaranteeing the outcome of these
bills: dead on arrival in a Republican-
led Senate and no chance of getting a
Republican President’s signature.
In the coming months, I hope we
work through these problems, as we did
last year, frankly. If the majority in-
tends to move forward with unrealistic
spending levels and insists on main-
taining partisan riders, then we are
simply guaranteeing a failed appropria-
tions process.
Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, our
failure has consequences. A best-case
scenario is a yearlong continuing reso-
lution that funds the government at
the exact same level as the current
year. That is the best scenario if we
fail. The worst-case scenario is another
government shutdown or sequestration
that automatically cuts all govern-
ment funding levels. Neither of these is
a good outcome for the House as an in-
stitution, for the Federal Government,
or more importantly, for the American
people.
Mr. Speaker, although I cannot sup-
port either bill before us today, I am
hopeful that, eventually, we will reach
a bipartisan, bicameral compromise on
spending that the vast majority of
Members in this House can support.
That requires realistic funding levels
and elimination of partisan riders from
this package. The spending package be-
fore us today may be a worthy starting
point, but it will take hard work and
compromise to move the final bill that
can become law.
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the
rule, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to hear
from my friend from Oklahoma about
both of these bills. We were here to-
gether last night until around mid-
night, working on the rules for these
bills.
On H.R. 2740, the appropriations
package that we have together, we
have authorized more than 100—I think
the number is 112—bipartisan amend-
ments. In fact, I think the first amend-
ment is one that is from the gentleman
from Oklahoma. We have made that
first.
I won’t be voting for it. I won’t be
supporting it, but he has the oppor-
tunity to make his case on the floor of
the House of Representatives and to
present it to colleagues.
We are proud of the fact that there
are more than 100 amendments. In fact,
I think we are meeting again this
afternoon, and we might adopt dozens
more amendments, for the consider-
ation of the full House.
But on the question of H. Res. 430,
which is to empower the Judiciary
Committee and the other committees
in Congress to enforce our right to ob-
tain information that we seek, I think
that this should be an overriding, bi-
partisan commitment within the Arti-
cle I branch, within the Congress of the
United States.
We simply cannot tolerate a posture
from the President of the United
States—and it is hard for me to think
of any other Congress that would tol-
erate it from any other President—of
noncooperation and absolute, com-
prehensive, and wholesale defiance of
the will of Congress in trying to seek
information.
My good friend from Oklahoma says
that the President does not work to en-
force the laws of Congress; he works for
the people. Well, we all work for the
people. That was my point. His job is
to take care that the laws passed by
Congress are faithfully executed. We
work directly for the people.
At least until we get a national pop-
ular vote for President, the President
is not elected by the people, as we
know from the 2016 election itself
where the popular vote winner, who
gained several million more votes than
Donald Trump did, lost the election be-
cause of the workings of the electoral
college.
b 1300
The Presidency was set up as an indi-
rect mechanism, and that is something
that I think that we should be replac-
ing. But I think it is not appropriate to
claim a popular mandate for the Presi-
dent when the President emerges from
the electoral college.
In any event, the President’s job is to
take care that the laws are faithfully
executed and also to be the Commander
in Chief in times of actual conflict, but
it is up to Congress to legislate. That is
what we do. That is why it is so prob-
lematic when the President of the
United States says:
I will not accept a bipartisan congressional
rejection of billions of dollars in funding for
my border wall; I am going to declare a na-
tional emergency and then reprogram money
from other lawfully appropriated purposes.
That is a violation of the spending
power of the Congress of the United
States. It is just like the President re-
jecting a bipartisan repudiation of his
involvement with the Saudi Govern-
ment in the Yemeni civil war. We have
not declared war with Saudi Arabia
against Iran or anybody else in the
Yemeni conflict, and so we don’t want
to be involved in it. We don’t want our
money going to that bloody humani-
tarian catastrophe, and yet the Presi-
dent simply rejects the majority will of
both Houses of Congress. That is a de-
cisive rejection in defiance of Congress’
power to declare war.
Now what we are getting is this com-
plete defiance of our ability to get the
information that we need. The Presi-
dent said it very clearly. He basically
said: No subpoenas, no witnesses—
enough—and no do-overs.
So he is not going to allow us to in-
vestigate the compromised security

clearance process and the White House
is not going to allow us to investigate
the completely suspect corruption and
distortion of the constitutional man-
date for a Census which we have got to
do by virtue of the Constitution every
10 years, and he is not going to cooper-
ate with any investigation into the
matters that were covered by Special
Counsel Mueller; the organized, sys-
tematic comprehensive, sweeping at-
tack on our elections by the GRU and
Russian agents or the more than 100
contacts they had with the Trump
campaign or the 10 different episodes of
Presidential obstruction of justice that
were set forth by Special Counsel
Mueller in his report.
We can’t accept that. So this legisla-
tion in H.R. 430 will give us the oppor-
tunity to go to court right away to en-
force our subpoenas against this un-
precedented defiance of congressional
power by the President of the United
States.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from the
great State of Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN
HERN).
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr.
Speaker, I thank my friend and col-
league from Oklahoma, and I thank my
friend from Maryland who reminds us
that our President was constitu-
tionally elected and that our President
was elected by the way our Constitu-
tion describes and outlines, and we
thank our President for the work he is
doing.
Mr. Speaker, I cosponsored an
amendment with Congressman COLE to
remove a dangerous poison pill in the
appropriations bill that would block
the free exercise of rights for the
American people. Congress has long
supported robust protections for rights
of conscience. The right to follow your
conscience on deeply held religious and
moral beliefs is a foundational value of
our country. In a free society like ours,
adherence to one’s convictions should
not be just tolerated but encouraged.
Our forefathers fought like hell to lib-
erate our country from a monarchy
that mandated what to believe and how
to behave.
How soon we have forgotten. It hap-
pens in small increments, with small,
minor changes here and there, but they
grow larger and more invasive. Some-
day you will find yourself back under
the yoke, with an oppressive govern-
ment telling you what to believe and
how to behave.
This conscience rule is absolutely
necessary to preserve the freedom of
expression that we hold dear in our
country. The rider in the Labor HHS
bill eliminating this rule is a poison
pill and does not belong in an appro-
priations package.
The Trump administration has vigor-
ously supported the right for our peo-
ple to act on their religious and moral
convictions. President Trump’s leader-
ship on this issue has encouraged mil-
lions of Americans who have seen these
protections start to slip away in the
past decade.
Who are we to force people to act
against their convictions and religious
beliefs?
It is a slippery slope to despotism,
but I think some of our colleagues
would have us go down that road in
pursuit of some greater good. I can as-
sure you that forcing the American
people to work against their convic-
tions and beliefs will lead us to nothing
but destruction, and I guarantee that
this bill will never be signed into law if
this language remains.
This amendment must be made in
order so that we can debate it and re-
move the poison pill from the final bill.
Otherwise, the time my colleagues
have spent on the Labor HHS bill is a
giant waste of time because it will
never make it to the President’s desk.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, all of us, of course, em-
brace and uphold the First Amendment
and the rights of religious freedom, the
right to not have government establish
a religion and to participate in the free
exercise of religion and to worship or
to not worship exactly as you please.
There is nothing in any of our legisla-
tion that would interfere with any-
body’s right to exercise precisely their
religious preference to worship exactly
as they please and to belong to what-
ever religious faith or denomination
they want.
I am not quite sure exactly what the
gentleman was referring to. We know
that the idea of a religious freedom to
discriminate has been asserted ever
since the 1960s with the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 where the hotel and motel,
lunch counter and department store
owners said that they had a religious
right to only serve the customers that
they wanted and that it violated their
religious faith to have interracial par-
ties seated in restaurants or at the
lunch counter. Our Supreme Court re-
jected that, and this Congress has re-
jected that.
There have been similar efforts to
say we have a constitutional right not
to serve gay and lesbian customers.
That has been rejected, and I hope that
this Congress will also reject it.
We passed the Equality Act very
proudly to add protection for LGBT
people to the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
and I hope that the Senate will go
along with it.
In any event, there is nothing in any
of the legislation before us and none
has been cited which violates any of
the free exercise rights of the people.
So with that, unless I hear anything
further, I am not moved by how any-
body is affected by this appropriation
negatively.
My other good friend from Oklahoma
referenced the phrase checks and bal-
ances, and that does appear in the Fed-
eralist Papers. I think it is in Fed-
eralist 51. It actually refers to the rela-
tionship between the House and the
Senate. That was the design of the
Framers of the Constitution that the
House and the Senate would check and
balance each other. But the Framers
were very clear that we were over-
throwing monarchy. We didn’t want
monarchy. That is why we got rid of
the king. The revolutionaries and the
rebels who gave us America and who
wrote the Constitution were trying to
institute a new form of government
representing We the People. That is
why we are so proud to be able to serve
in the people’s House here along with
our friends in the Senate.
But the President’s core job is to
take care that our laws are faithfully
executed. We have no kings here; we
have no monarchs here. That is why we
have the Emoluments Clause in the
Constitution which says that none of
us who serves in Washington can ac-
cept any present—any emoluments,
which just means a payment—any of-
fice or title from a prince, a king, or a
foreign government without the con-
sent of Congress.
That is a cardinal principle in the
Constitution. It is our original anti-
corruption principle because the Fram-
ers did not want the President or Mem-
bers of Congress selling out the coun-
try. They wanted complete, undivided
loyalty by those of us who come to
Washington, who aspire and obtain the
public office to have complete, undi-
vided loyalty to the American people
and not to lobbyists for foreign govern-
ments, agents, and saboteurs.
So that is another real problem that
this President seems not to recognize.
That provision obligates him whenever
he receives any money from a foreign
government through his hotel or his of-
fice towers or any of his going busi-
nesses that he has kept going in the
course of his tenure, whenever he re-
ceives any of that money, he has got to
come to Congress to ask for our per-
mission and for our consent.
Mr. Speaker, we can show you
records from lots of prior Presidents
who came to Congress to ask for a con-
sent because they received a Persian
rug, or a shawl, or cufflinks. Yet—at
least according to court reports and
media reports—this President has been
receiving hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars or millions of dollars from foreign
governments. In fact, the President I
think made a voluntary deposit he said
of the profits from foreign government
receipts of $350,000 to the U.S. Treasury
without any accounting to us, without
any receipts, and without asking for
our consent.
So even if the Constitution says that
you can’t accept the profits from for-
eign payments, which it doesn’t, it
says you can’t accept foreign pay-
ments. That would be insufficient be-
cause Congress has got to offer its con-
sent.
Look, we need to lay down the law
about all of these matters. When we
ask for a document, we want the docu-
ment. When we issue a subpoena from
the United States Congress, you com-
ply with the subpoena. When we ask for

a witness, the witness arrives. That is
what H.R. 430 is all about. We have got
to empower Congress to enforce its
will.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH).
My good friend is the most eloquent
advocate for life in this Chamber.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr.
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the
rule.
Earlier this year, Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Trump made it clear in a letter
that he will veto any piece of legisla-
tion that undermines or nullifies any
pro-life policy, regulation, or rule.
The bill facilitated by this rule re-
verses several life-affirming pro-life
policies, including conscience protec-
tion, Title X reform, the protecting life
in global health assistance, and more.
No one, Mr. Speaker—including doc-
tors, nurses, and LPNs—and no entity
like a hospital or a health insurance
plan should ever be compelled against
their will into performing, facilitating,
or subsidizing abortion.
First, the approps bill overturns the
conscience protection final rule, leav-
ing many at risk of pressure, harass-
ment and coercion.
Second, in late February, HHS pro-
mulgated the Protect Life Rule to re-
assert portions of President Ronald
Reagan’s Title X rule, including ending
co-location of abortion clinics with
family planning clinics subsidized by
Title X.
Third, H.R. 2740, the underlying bill,
repeals and bans future promulgation
by any President of protecting life in
global health assistance, a significant
reiteration and expansion of President
Reagan’s Mexico City policy, a policy
designed to ensure that U.S. taxpayers
are not funding foreign NGOs that per-
form or promote abortion as a method
of family planning.
Mr. Speaker, why is this so impor-
tant? Because women and children,
both home and abroad, deserve better
than the violence of abortion.
The humanity of the unborn child is
beyond doubt, yet the pro-abortion
movement, like some kind of modern-
day flat Earth society, continues to
cling to outdated, indefensible argu-
ments cloaked in euphemism. Even the
seemingly benign word ‘‘choice’’ with-
ers under scrutiny.
Choice to do what?
Dismember a baby?
Take pills to starve a child to death
and then forcibly expel her or him from
the womb?
Inject chemical poisons that kill the
baby?
At the end of this process, Mr. Speak-
er, important policies embedded in the
approps bill will be signed into law, but
reversal of pro-life policies will be ve-
toed. This legislation will be vetoed
and the veto will be sustained by this
Congress.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I still have not heard a single in-
stance offered from anybody whose re-
ligious freedoms under the Constitu-
tion of the United States are threat-
ened by any of the legislation here.
I do know that the ultimate logic of
the argument that we just heard here
is to support legislation like what was
just passed in the State of Alabama. In
Alabama today—please read an article
in the Washington Post this morning,
Mr. Speaker—in Alabama today if this
legislation is signed into law, a 15-year-
old girl who is raped by her step-uncle
not only would not be able to obtain an
abortion, because there is no exception
for rape or incest in the ban that the
legislature just passed, but she would
be compelled to have him involved in
the raising of the child because Ala-
bama protects the paternity rights of
the rapist. So it is one of only two
States in the country where a rapist
continues to have parenthood rights in
the child.
So get this straight. If what we are
hearing is actually enacted into law—
and I understand my colleagues to be
encouraging legislation like this
around the country, like the law in
Alabama—we will have a situation
where girls who are 15 or 14 or 13 or 16
years old who are raped by their step-
fathers or step-uncles must carry a
child to term, have the baby, and in
some States be forced to raise the baby
with the rapist.
So I don’t think that is where we are
today in America under Planned Par-
enthood v. Casey and Roe v. Wade, and
certainly the majority is going to
stand very strong for healthcare for
women and reproductive freedom for
women and men to make their own de-
cisions.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Maryland
for his courtesy.
Mr. Speaker, there is a document
that I hold in my hand that covers the
epidemic apparently that is taking
siege over America. It contains the
Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution of the United States.
The Declaration of Independence
paraphrases we are all created equal
with certain inalienable rights of life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
b 1315
I am honored to serve in this body
and, with honor, walk through the
halls and look at the historical depic-
tions of the early years.
Just coming back from D-Day in Nor-
mandy, I am reminded of the brave
men and, certainly, women who served
in the United States military, sup-
porters in World War II, but, in par-
ticular, the men who stormed the Nor-
mandy beach.
I am reminded, I am sure, of the
words of General Dwight D. Eisen-
hower, who said: The world is watch-
ing, and they will join you in marching
to victory.
This Constitution has the Ninth
Amendment, the right to privacy. It
has the right to freedom of religion and
freedom of access and freedom of
speech. And all that is being done here
today is to acknowledge not only the
poor 15-year-old, 13-year-old, and 14-
year-old that my good friend from
Maryland talked about, but, all over
the country, denying poor women ac-
cess to health services that should
really be based upon their faith, their
God, their family, and their medical
provider.
In some of the bills in Missouri and
in some of the bills that are being pro-
posed in Georgia, Alabama, and in my
own State of Texas, it is litigation that
would get you healthcare. It is no re-
spect of the individual human being,
the person, who may have to go back
to the antics of yesteryear, dealing
with the tactics of coat hangers of
which many of us are aware.
Let me also say that underlying in
this rule is the opportunity for the
force of the authority of the Article I
Congress to enforce individuals to
come before congressional committees,
such as the Committee on the Judici-
ary, which we will debate later.
It is invested in this Constitution,
because of Article I authority and the
collegial response that the Founding
Fathers wanted us to have, that there
are no unequal branches—there is a
number one branch—and one branch
should not ignore and disrespect the
other branch.
Therefore, if Article I branch, which
we are in, asks for witnesses and then
is blocked by another branch that has
no greater status—read the Constitu-
tion.
In this rule, we have tried to correct
the imbalance and inappropriateness
that is occurring in this body and in
this process, and so I ask my col-
leagues to support the rule and the un-
derlying legislation to restore the Con-
stitution.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ).
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from Okla-
homa for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to the rule that would provide for
consideration of H.R. 2740. This pack-
age provides funding for several items
that would benefit my district in
northeast Ohio, but it falls short in
several key regards, including funding
for key programs that would help keep
our children safe.
In particular, Mr. Speaker, this pack-
age fails to provide adequate funding
for the School Safety National Activi-
ties program, which gives grants to
schools to support safe learning envi-
ronments, including programs to com-
bat substance abuse and cultivate aca-
demic success.
This bill provides $80 million less in
funding than what the administration
requested. I offered an amendment to
raise that number by $10 million, but

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4408 June 11, 2019
my colleagues in the majority blocked
it from consideration.
I think we can all agree that school
safety is of the utmost importance and
an area that is vital for Congress to in-
vest in. I hope my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle will work with me to
assure that programs to protect our
children, like the School Safety Na-
tional Activities program, remain a
congressional priority.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. SMUCKER).
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my friend from Oklahoma for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly
oppose the rule and spending package
being debated before us. Not only does
this massive spending package blow
our budget caps by nearly $200 billion,
but this flawed legislation severely un-
dermines critical protections for the
lives of the unborn.
I am very proud of the work that the
Trump administration has been doing
to finally make Title X about family
planning and not a way of using tax-
payer money to fund abortions. The ad-
ministration’s new Title X provisions
draw a bright line between abortion
and family planning, while ensuring
taxpayer dollars are put towards com-
prehensive, preventive, and primary
care for women.
These new regulations will also make
it easier for faith-based clinics to pro-
vide care through the Title X program,
which will expand access to care for
families. Yet, under this partisan piece
of legislation, these protections are
stripped and taxpayer funding for abor-
tion clinics is increased. This is unac-
ceptable.
The fight to give a voice to the un-
born will not be swayed by partisan
poison pills. I urge my colleagues to
oppose this rule and the underlying
bill.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule immediately to bring
up H.R. 3056 for consideration under an
open rule.
The bill provides $4.5 billion of fund-
ing to address the immediate humani-
tarian crisis on the southern border.
This is a crisis of significant propor-
tions, Mr. Speaker.
Our facilities for holding new arriv-
als, particularly children and the vul-
nerable unaccompanied minors, are al-
ready at the breaking point. Simply
put, we need more resources, and we
need them today.
This is not the first time we have
needed to provide supplemental appro-
priations for this purpose. Back in 2014,
then-President Barack Obama asked us
for $3.7 billion in supplemental re-
sources for precisely the same purpose.
He got it. At the time, we had 60,000
unaccompanied minors who arrived in
2014. We face a similar and, frankly,
larger humanitarian crisis today.
President Obama was right to re-
quest supplemental funds to deal with
the crisis then. We would be right to
appropriate supplemental funds to ad-
dress that similar crisis now.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to
the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma?
There was no objection.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS).
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in strong opposition to this
rule. The rule demonstrates once again
that the Democrat majority refuses to
acknowledge, accept, or address the
very real crisis at our southern border.
New numbers recently came out il-
lustrating the magnitude of the crisis.
CBP detained more than 144,000 mi-
grants in the month of May. This was
the third consecutive month when we
had in excess of 100,000 migrants de-
tained at the border: 101,000 in March,
109,000 in April, and 144,000 in May. We
are on track to apprehend over 1 mil-
lion migrants this fiscal year, approxi-
mately the population of Austin,
Texas.
Smugglers and cartels continue to
preach that now is the time to come to
the United States. They call children
‘‘permisos,’’ or permits, and exploit
them to get scores of adults unrelated
to the children across the border.
These criminal organizations run an
international smuggling operation
filled with misery and abuse. Migrants
who survive the smugglers often arrive
in poor health, physically exhausted,
and in need of urgent medical care.
The men and women of CBP are
doing the best they can to respond to
this humanitarian crisis, but they have
run out of space to safely house and
process the unprecedented numbers of
family units seeking entry into the
United States. In the next couple of
weeks, Health and Human Services will
run out of funds to feed and shelter the
vulnerable unaccompanied children.
Four weeks ago, the President and
Congress sent an urgent request for
supplemental appropriations to address
this crisis. Ranking Member GRANGER
and I filed an amendment to the mini-
bus which would have provided the $4.5
billion requested by the President.
It would have replenished critical
funds needed to feed and shelter mi-
grant families and unaccompanied chil-
dren. It would have provided urgent
medical care and transportation serv-
ices, and it would pay the growing cost
of overtime for the men and women of
DHS working on the front lines of this
crisis.
Unfortunately, for the third time in
the last month, the majority refused to
make our amendment in order. Demo-
crats haven’t approved a dime for this
crisis.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the
gentleman an additional 30 seconds.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Because of
the political dysfunction in their own
Caucus, they stubbornly refuse to put
forward any solutions. It has gotten to
the point where editorial boards in
some of the Nation’s most liberal cities
are now calling Democrats out for
their inaction.
Democrats need to stop denying the
facts and blaming the President for
this crisis. The time has come to face
reality and work with the President
and Republicans in Congress to imme-
diately resolve this humanitarian cri-
sis.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to
defeat the previous question on this
rule. If we do that, we can finally bring
this critically needed supplemental
funding to the House for a vote.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time to close.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, my friend made ref-
erence a little bit earlier to amend-
ments. He talked about the total num-
ber of amendments, but he left out the
distribution of amendments. So, as the
House considers this rule, I think we
ought to take a look at how the Rules
Committee has handled making
amendments in order so far this Con-
gress.
The rule on the floor today is making
106 amendments in order, out of 540
submitted, with hopefully more to
come with tomorrow’s rule.
Today’s rule includes 22 amendments
sponsored solely by Republicans.
Sadly, this is considered an improve-
ment over the majority’s previous ef-
forts.
With today’s rule, in total, this Con-
gress, 73 percent of all amendments
made in order have been sponsored
solely by Democrats—73 percent. Just
16 percent are sponsored by Repub-
licans, with 11 percent bipartisan.
How does this compare with the last
Congress? When Republicans were the
majority party, 45 percent of all
amendments made in order were spon-
sored solely by Democrats. Only 38 per-
cent were sponsored solely by Repub-
licans, with another 17 percent being
bipartisan.
At the beginning of this Congress,
the Democratic majority repeatedly
promised a new, robust, and open proc-
ess at the Rules Committee. They
pledged that good ideas would be wel-
comed, no matter where they came
from, and that thoughtful amendments
would not be blocked.
Unfortunately, they have a long way
to go to keep that promise. I think the
numbers speak volumes.
We are 5 months into the 116th Con-
gress. Should we expect this trend of
shutting out minority party ideas to
continue? Should we expect the same
course of action in our rule tomorrow
and in our rule on the second appro-
priations package next week and in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4409
June 11, 2019
other rules in the weeks and months to
come?
When will the promises made by the
Democratic majority be kept? If not
now, when?
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge oppo-
sition to the rule. The rule will make
in order two measures: H. Res. 430 and
H.R. 2740.
H. Res. 430 is a premature and inef-
fective resolution that will push the
House forward into untested and ill-
timed litigation with the executive
branch over the subpoena of docu-
ments. While the House has an impor-
tant oversight role to play, we must be
careful to exercise that role wisely and
carefully, lest we cause long-term dam-
age to the institution.
H.R. 2740 is a package of 5 of the 12
outstanding appropriations bills that
use unrealistic allocation levels and
eliminate longstanding pro-life protec-
tions that must be restored before
these bills can garner any Republican
support.
I actually look forward to working
with my colleagues in the House and
the Senate as we move forward in the
appropriations process, and I urge the
majority to compromise with the Sen-
ate and the White House in order to
achieve a final spending deal that
avoids drastic sequestration cuts or,
worse yet, another government shut-
down.
I think that is actually the great les-
son of the appropriations process, Mr.
Speaker. We know we can do this. We
did it last year, and we did it pretty
well together.
But my friends have to get past the
idea that they can impose their will on
a Republican Senate and a Republican
President. They are simply not going
to be able to do that. They are going to
have to bargain to a middle ground and
compromise.
In the Appropriations Committee, as
a rule, we do that, and we do it pretty
well. I am hopeful that we can continue
going forward on that front.
I am concerned, however, that the
vitriol, if you will, that we see in the
investigative and oversight efforts of
our friends will spill into that process
and lead us into a very difficult situa-
tion in September.
So, as we move forward on the appro-
priations front, again, I hope all of us
relearn the virtues of compromise, un-
derstand that we were all sent here by
the American people, that we have to
work with one another to accomplish
something, and that none of us can im-
pose their will on the other.
With that, I look forward to working
with my friend and with his colleagues
and, certainly, through the appropria-
tions process to making sure that the
government is appropriately funded
and well governed.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
b 1330
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
It is a pleasure to work with the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) on
H.R. 2740 and H.R. 4340, and I do urge
all of our colleagues to support this
rule for this legislation.
I do hope my friend from Oklahoma
will tutor some of his colleagues, like
the last speaker, who referred to the
‘‘Democrat majority.’’ Democrat is the
noun. Democratic is the adjective for
our party, and I think that would be a
basic gesture of interparty civility if
they would follow that fairly easy
grammatical device.
Mr. Speaker, one of the other Mem-
bers from the other side, I think from
Oklahoma, talked about some edu-
cation matters, so I want to go to some
statistics that actually mean some-
thing to the American people. I think
we can refute all of the statistics that
were advanced by my friend from Okla-
homa, as I said.
There are more than 100 amendments
that we are going to be bringing up
today, and we are going to be adding
more of them, and we certainly don’t
want to endure lectures from people
who belong to the caucus that ran the
most closed Congress in the history of
the United States.
But here are some figures that actu-
ally mean something to the American
people. Our bill provides a total of $75.9
billion in appropriations for the Edu-
cation Department, which is $4.5 bil-
lion above the 2019-enacted level, and
$11.9 billion beyond what the President
asked for. So that means dramatic in-
creases in everything from IDEA spe-
cial education spending, to education,
innovation, and research programs, to
spending for teacher professional devel-
opment evidence-based models and so
on.
We are also increasing money for stu-
dent financial assistance for Pell
Grants for higher education, because it
has become too difficult for our young
people to make their way through col-
lege, and they are graduating, basi-
cally, with a mortgage of 100 or
$150,000, but they don’t have a house to
go with it. So this majority is com-
mitted to alleviating the burden on
America’s college students.
Mr. Speaker, we are trying to make
progress, under very difficult cir-
cumstances with this President, for the
American people in the realm of edu-
cation, healthcare, scientific and med-
ical research. We are making that
progress, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation.
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and
the previous question.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. COLE is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 431
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 8. That immediately upon adoption of
this resolution, the House shall resolve into
the Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union for consideration of the
bill (H.R. 3056) to provide supplemental ap-
propriations relating to border security, and
for other purposes. The first reading of the
bill shall be dispensed with. All points of
order against consideration of the bill are
waived. General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed one hour equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Committee
on Appropriations. After general debate the
bill shall be considered for amendment under
the five-minute rule. Points of order against
provisions in the bill for failure to comply
with clause 2 of rule XXI are waived. Clause
2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during con-
sideration of the bill. When the committee
rises and reports the bill back to the House
with a recommendation that the bill do pass,
the previous question shall be considered as
ordered on the bill and amendments thereto
to final passage without intervening motion
except one motion to recommit with or with-
out instructions. If the Committee of the
Whole rises and reports that it has come to
no resolution on the bill, then on the next
legislative day the House shall, immediately
after the third daily order of business under
clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Com-
mittee of the Whole for further consideration
of the bill.
SEC 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not
apply to the consideration of H.R. 3056.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time, and I
move the previous question on the res-
olution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-
minute vote on ordering the previous
question will be followed by 5-minute
votes on:
Adoption of the resolution, if or-
dered; and
Agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of
the Journal, if ordered.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 227, nays
190, not voting 15, as follows:

THE JOURNAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
BUTTERFIELD). Pursuant to clause 8 of
rule XX, the unfinished business is the
question on agreeing to the Speaker’s
approval of the Journal, which the
Chair will put de novo.
The question is on the Speaker’s ap-
proval of the Journal.
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.
f
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Committee on
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 962, the
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act, and ask for its immediate
consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I urge the
Speaker to immediately schedule this
important bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not recognized for debate.
f
AUTHORIZING THE COMMITTEE ON
THE JUDICIARY TO INITIATE OR
INTERVENE IN JUDICIAL PRO-
CEEDINGS TO ENFORCE CERTAIN
SUBPOENAS
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 431, I call up
the resolution (H. Res. 430) authorizing
the Committee on the Judiciary to ini-
tiate or intervene in judicial pro-
ceedings to enforce certain subpoenas
and for other purposes, and ask for its
immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 431, the
amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute recommended by the Com-
mittee on Rules, printed in the resolu-
tion, is adopted, and the resolution, as
amended, is considered read.
The text of the resolution, as amend-
ed, is as follows:
H. RES. 430
That the chair of the Committee on the Judici-
ary of the House of Representatives is author-
ized, on behalf of such Committee, to initiate or
intervene in any judicial proceeding before a
Federal court—
(1) to seek declaratory judgments and any and
all ancillary relief, including injunctive relief,
affirming the duty of—
(A) William P. Barr, Attorney General, to
comply with the subpoena that is the subject of
the resolution accompanying House Report 116-
105; and
(B) Donald F. McGahn, II, former White
House Counsel, to comply with the subpoena
issued to him on April 22, 2019; and
(2) to petition for disclosure of information re-
garding any matters identified in or relating to
the subpoenas referred to in paragraph (1) or
any accompanying report, pursuant to Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), including Rule
6(e)(3)(E) (providing that the court may author-
ize disclosure of a grand-jury matter ‘‘prelimi-
narily to... a judicial proceeding’’).
Resolved, That the chair of each standing and
permanent select committee, when authorized by
the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, retains
the ability to initiate or intervene in any judi-
cial proceeding before a Federal court on behalf
of such committee, to seek declaratory judg-
ments and any and all ancillary relief, includ-
ing injunctive relief, affirming the duty of the
recipient of any subpoena duly issued by that
committee to comply with that subpoena. Con-
sistent with the Congressional Record statement
on January 3, 2019, by the chair of the Com-
mittee on Rules regarding the civil enforcement
of subpoenas pursuant to clause 8(b) of rule II,
a vote of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group
to authorize litigation and to articulate the in-
stitutional position of the House in that litiga-
tion is the equivalent of a vote of the full House
of Representatives.
Resolved, That in connection with any judi-
cial proceeding brought under the first or sec-
ond resolving clauses, the chair of any standing
or permanent select committee exercising au-
thority thereunder has any and all necessary
authority under Article I of the Constitution.
Resolved, That the chair of any standing or
permanent select committee exercising authority
described in the first or second resolving clause
shall notify the House of Representatives, with
respect to the commencement of any judicial
proceeding thereunder.
Resolved, That the Office of General Counsel
of the House of Representatives shall, with the
authorization of the Speaker, represent any
standing or permanent select committee in any
judicial proceeding initiated or intervened in
pursuant to the authority described in the first
or second resolving clause.
Resolved, That the Office of General Counsel
of the House of Representatives is authorized to
retain private counsel, either for pay or pro
bono, to assist in the representation of any
standing or permanent select committee in any
judicial proceeding initiated or intervened in
pursuant to the authority described in the first
or second resolving clause.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution, as amended, shall be debatable
for 1 hour, equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Rules.
The gentleman from Massachusetts
(Mr. MCGOVERN) and the gentlewoman
from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO) each will
control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Massachusetts.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H. Res. 430.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, this is a dark time. This
Congress is being tested—in this case,
not by a foreign adversary but by our
own President, a President who is un-
dertaking a relentless campaign of ob-
struction and stonewalling.
We have never seen anything like
this. Never before, Mr. Speaker, has a
President from either party so fla-
grantly ignored Congress’ constitu-
tional oversight authority and our Na-
tion’s separation of powers.
You don’t have to take my word for
it. President Trump has declared, ‘‘We
are fighting all the subpoenas,’’ and, ‘‘I
don’t want people testifying.’’ These
words make Richard Nixon look like an
Eagle Scout.
His Attorney General, William Barr,
is apparently more than willing to fol-
low the President’s command. He has
refused to release the full, unredacted
Mueller report and any underlying evi-
dence until a compromise was finally
reached yesterday. That is after the
Judiciary Committee had already
voted to hold him in contempt of Con-
gress. Apparently, the Attorney Gen-
eral went from being America’s lawyer
to being the defense counsel for the
President of the United States.
I hope the Justice Department acts
in good faith on this new agreement.
These are documents that Congress
needs to see in response to Special
Counsel Mueller’s findings. But if they
do not, and if the Attorney General
holds back key information, then all
options need to be on the table, includ-
ing enforcing these subpoenas. That is
in addition to the fact that some docu-
ments and testimony we deserve to ob-
tain could very well fall outside the
bounds of this agreement.
The Mueller report is just the tip of
the iceberg. The President is using
every trick in the book, including false
claims of executive privilege, absolute
immunity, and lack of legitimate legis-
lative purpose, all to obstruct legiti-
mate inquiries into matters that im-
pact Americans’ daily lives. This in-
cludes the President’s attack on afford-
able healthcare coverage for millions
of Americans, including those with pre-
existing conditions; his family separa-
tion policy that has torn apart vulner-
able immigrant families; his misappro-
priation of military funds for his offen-
sive border wall; and his decision to
roll back landmark civil rights protec-
tions.
This is exactly the sort of con-
centrated power in the hands of the few
that the Founders intentionally pre-
vented through the creation of the
three separate but coequal branches of
government, each branch with unique
powers and responsibilities and each
branch expected to act as a check on
the power of the others.
But the President is trying to take
this balance of power and centralize it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4412 June 11, 2019
in one place, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave-
nue. He is acting as though the law ap-
plies to every American but himself.
The President’s strategy here is
clear. Tweet by tweet, quote by quote,
he has laid it bare for all of us to see.
The question is whether this Con-
gress will have the courage to take a
stand against it and whether we will
confront it for what it is, an attack on
the very notion of Congress as a co-
equal branch of government. I can’t
speak for my friends on the other side
of the aisle, but this Democratic ma-
jority will not allow this President to
turn a blind eye to the rule of law.
That is why I introduced this meas-
ure, H. Res. 430. It is a civil enforce-
ment resolution that will strengthen
our hand in court as Congress tries to
get the documents this administration
is currently trying to hide, so we can
uncover the truth and follow the facts,
wherever they may lead.
The first part of this resolution fol-
lows past precedent used by Demo-
cratic and Republican majorities, this
time to allow the Judiciary Committee
to go to court to enforce subpoenas
issued to the Attorney General and
former White House General Counsel
Don McGahn.
The second part reaffirms key lan-
guage in House rules, making clear
that every committee chair retains the
ability to go to Federal court to seek
civil enforcement of their subpoenas
when authorized by the Bipartisan
Legal Advisory Group. That includes
those already issued, as well as any fu-
ture subpoenas.
I know some of my colleagues on the
other side will be quick to claim this
resolution is unprecedented. To them, I
would ask this: What is the precedent
for an administration refusing to com-
ply with any congressional oversight—
no documents, no information, noth-
ing? There isn’t one.
We have never seen anything like
this before, so we need an appropriate
response like this because of this ad-
ministration’s constant obstruction.
I am proud that my fellow committee
chairs quickly joined in cosponsoring
this resolution, including Oversight
and Reform Committee Chairman CUM-
MINGS, Foreign Affairs Committee
Chairman ENGEL, Judiciary Committee
Chairman NADLER, Ways and Means
Committee Chairman NEAL, Intel-
ligence Committee Chairman SCHIFF,
and Financial Services Committee
Chairwoman WATERS.
I urge all of my colleagues to join us.
This deserves support from both sides
of the aisle.
I know the silence from some of my
Republican friends to what this Presi-
dent is doing has been deafening, but
this moment demands you finally
speak up and say enough is enough.
This resolution is not about politics or
partisanship. It is about defending the
rule of law and the very notion of sepa-
ration of powers.
The challenge here is so great that if
we don’t stand up to President Trump
today, then we risk losing the power to
stand up to any President in the fu-
ture.
I strongly urge my colleagues: Let’s
make clear that the law still matters,
even in Donald Trump’s America. We
can do that by voting ‘‘yes’’ on this
resolution and making clear that no
one is above the law, not even the
President of the United States.
Let’s do right by the American peo-
ple. Let’s restore the dignity of this in-
stitution. Let’s pass this resolution.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion of H. Res. 430.
It is disappointing that we are here
again debating a measure that will
have absolutely no impact on the lives
of our constituents. Instead of fixing
pressing issues like the security and
humanitarian crisis at our southern
border, the Democrats continue their
focus on influencing the 2020 election
at taxpayer expense. Americans are
tired of this witch hunt.
For nearly 2 years, Democrats
claimed that the President colluded
with the Russians to interfere in the
2016 Presidential election. After 22
months, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 warrants,
40 FBI agents, and spending $35 mil-
lion, Special Counsel Mueller con-
cluded there was no collusion between
President Trump and Russia and did
not charge him with obstruction.
Yet, my Democratic colleagues con-
tinue to attempt to undermine the
President of the United States because,
all I can think of is, they haven’t ac-
cepted the fact that he won the elec-
tion. It is clear to me that the Demo-
crats are trying to influence the 2020
Presidential election at taxpayer ex-
pense.
Americans have real problems that
we can and should be tackling instead.
In May, the U.S. Border Patrol appre-
hended a jaw-dropping 133,000 people at
our southern border. That is only the
people they caught. Yet, we are here
debating subpoenas targeting the
President, probably because it will pro-
vide Democrats free airtime.
This unprecedented resolution should
not even be on the House floor today.
It has never been done before in the en-
tire history of the United States.
The House has only sued for docu-
ments twice before. In both cases, the
individuals in question were first found
in contempt of Congress at both the
committee level and by the full House.
This has not happened here.
On top of that, the relevant sub-
poenas seek material that includes
grand jury materials that, by law, can-
not be made public. The Democrats are
asking Attorney General Barr to vio-
late the law.
When my colleagues and I tried to
improve this resolution, the Democrats
blocked us at every turn.
I offered an amendment that would
let the American people know how
much money this resolution would cost
taxpayers. Democrats blocked it. Re-
publicans offered amendments to pre-
vent taxpayer money from going to
lobbyists, to disclose contracts with
lawyers, and to disclose where this tax-
payer money was coming from to fund
this witch hunt. Democrats blocked
each and every one.
One amendment in particular high-
lights the partisan political, media-
grabbing motives of this resolution.
Republicans offered an amendment re-
quiring the Judiciary Committee
chairman to certify that he made a
good faith effort to negotiate with the
Attorney General, but the Democrats
blocked that amendment, too.
The Attorney General has been
transparent, and the Department of
Justice has attempted numerous ac-
commodations, including just yester-
day when the Department of Justice
agreed to let members of the com-
mittee view an unredacted report ex-
cluding grand jury material, which, by
law, cannot be released.
b 1430
But even as the Attorney General has
attempted to work with the Committee
on the Judiciary, Chairman NADLER
has moved at unprecedented speed,
moving from a demand for an
unredacted report to subpoena to this
resolution in a matter of mere weeks.
From the Democrats’ actions and prior
statements, it is difficult not to view
the purpose of this resolution and this
debate as anything but political.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. WATERS), the distin-
guished chairwoman of the Financial
Services Committee.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Massachusetts
(Mr. MCGOVERN) for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.
Res. 430, which authorizes litigation to
compel Attorney General Barr to pro-
vide key evidence underlying the
Mueller report and the unredacted re-
port itself, authorizes a civil suit to
compel Don McGahn to provide the
Committee on the Judiciary with docu-
ments and testimony, and, prospec-
tively, allows committee chairs to
bring civil actions on behalf of their
committees to enforce their subpoenas
without a subsequent full House vote
when authorized by the bipartisan
legal advisory group.
H. Res. 430 is key to ensuring that
Congress is able to efficiently exercise
its constitutional responsibilities in
light of the unprecedented
stonewalling by the Trump administra-
tion and a President who has openly
said such things as: ‘‘We’re fighting all
the subpoenas,’’ and, ‘‘I don’t want peo-
ple testifying.’’
Who does he think he is? A dictator?
The committees have requested in-
formation that we are constitutionally

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4413
June 11, 2019
entitled to, as a coequal branch of gov-
ernment, and that we need to fulfill
our legislative and oversight respon-
sibilities. In the Financial Services
Committee, for example, we have sub-
poenaed documents from financial in-
stitutions, including Deutsche Bank
and Capital One, as part of our inves-
tigation into the integrity of the
United States financial system, bank
safety and loan practices, and anti-
money laundering policies, including
as they apply to and involve the ac-
counts of President Trump and family
members. So, ladies and gentlemen, in
another display of stonewalling, Presi-
dent Trump sued to prevent the banks
from complying with the committee’s
valid subpoenas.
I will continue to support efforts to
ensure that our critical oversight is
not impeded.
Who does he think he is?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to refrain from
engaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 7
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. COLLINS), ranking member of
the Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res.
430, a resolution authorizing the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary to initiate or
intervene in judicial proceedings to en-
force certain subpoenas, and for other
purposes.
This resolution is an assault on this
body’s constitutional oversight au-
thorities. By proceeding in this unprec-
edented manner, the House is putting
the judicial branch in an unfortunate
position.
Never before has the House author-
ized the general counsel to sue without
first exhausting all our constitutional
remedies to gain compliance with our
oversight demands. Proceeding in this
manner risks weakening our ability to
carry out our oversight responsibil-
ities.
On May 8, the Committee on the Ju-
diciary voted 24–16 to hold Attorney
General Barr in criminal contempt of
Congress. The committee did not pur-
sue contempt against Donald McGahn.
Mr. McGahn’s case is unique, and I will
address it in more detail later.
Contrary to press reports, Mr. Speak-
er, we are not acting today on the con-
tempt citation reported by the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. We are au-
thorizing the House to sue the Attor-
ney General, Mr. McGahn, and any
other official or private citizen any
committee chair deems contemptuous
in the future.
This is a novel, untested, and risky
proposition. I will give it to you this
way, Mr. Speaker: The majority is defi-
nitely audacious in their request.
The media and the Democrats rou-
tinely rail against the President being
quick to sue. Well, Mr. Speaker, that is
exactly what the majority is doing.
Having rushed to contempt, we are now
bypassing that remedy altogether and
going straight to court.
Constitutional scholar Jonathan
Turley recently wrote, Democrats’ liti-
gation strategy ‘‘is clearly driven more
by political than legal calculations.’’
This is the problem I have, Mr.
Speaker: These tactics weaken the
House, aggrandize the executive
branch, and cede decisionmaking to the
judicial branch.
This is a problem. The majority can
mess up oversight however they want
to. The majority can rush to judgment
whenever they want to.
My chairman has subpoenaed most
everything that moves, and it seems
other committees are wanting to as
well. But here is the problem: When
you are rushing to this and you are
taking it on grounds that are not le-
gally sound—and which, by the way, at
this same hearing where Mr. Turley
was, all three of the Democrat wit-
nesses also agreed that the subpoena of
the Attorney General was not legal in
the sense that it was asking him to do
something illegal.
The other issue here is, when you
practice proper oversight, we are get-
ting documents on election results, we
are also getting documents on immi-
gration and others from this adminis-
tration. Where the rub has come is in
overbroad illegal subpoenas from these
committees.
Now, they may want to screw it up
now for their purposes, but I don’t
want it in the future, going forward,
where this House’s oversight ability
has been tampered by a rush to judg-
ment. Let’s think about this institu-
tion more than our next headline.
This is a problem because it is uncer-
tain here, Mr. Speaker, the House will
even be granted standing in court since
we have declined to exercise all of our
constitutional remedies, namely, con-
tempt, in its many forms.
This is not the only impediment fac-
ing Democrats. At every turn, as we
have discussed in our minority views to
the committee’s contempt report, the
majority refused to engage with DOJ in
the requisite negotiations and accom-
modation processes.
During our markup of the contempt
resolution, the chairman made several
damaging admissions—this is the
chairman of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary:
First, he conceded the Attorney Gen-
eral cannot lawfully comply with his
subpoena demanding grand jury mate-
rial.
Second, he stated the subpoena was
the beginning of a dialogue. I am not
sure what first-year law student will
believe that a subpoena is the begin-
ning of a dialogue.
Third, he admitted the subpoena was
intentionally broad to give the com-
mittee clout in court.
Again, I am not sure which Black’s
Law Dictionary we are looking up
under ‘‘subpoena,’’ but that is not part
of it.
All along, the goal has been to get to
court, not to get information and con-
duct legitimate oversight of Russian
interference or secure our elections. If
Democrats were interested in these
good government issues, they would
have accepted DOJ’s offer to review the
nearly unredacted Mueller report.
Today, Mr. Speaker, the chairman,
even, has not done so. The goal is to
clearly haul the administration into
court in an attempt to pacify a base
rabid for impeachment.
When Congress exercises its over-
sight powers, it must take advantage
of every offer of information from the
other branch. It is disingenuous to de-
cline the free information Democrats
so strongly claim to want. It shows the
majority does not want the informa-
tion; they want a fight.
In addition to the subpoena being
overly broad and requiring the Attor-
ney General to violate the law to com-
ply, the chairman failed to establish a
valid legislative purpose for his de-
mands. There are other avenues the
chairman could seek to get the infor-
mation he wants. Congress could pass a
law granting itself an exemption to
grand jury secrecy rules, but the ma-
jority has not brought that up.
The most alarming aspect of this ac-
tion, however, is the unprecedented
speed—a mere 44 days passed between
the chairman’s first request to the At-
torney General and the date the com-
mittee held him in contempt. In stark
contrast, 464 days passed from the date
that Chairman Issa requested informa-
tion from Attorney General Holder on
Fast and Furious and the date the
Committee on Oversight and Reform
held him in contempt, 138 days for Har-
riet Miers and the date the committee
held her in contempt.
The action the majority is author-
izing today against Don McGahn, how-
ever, Mr. Speaker, is far more egre-
gious for many reasons. Mr. McGahn is
not the custodian of the documents the
committee and the chairman demand.
The White House is. Yet we are smear-
ing a private citizen’s reputation and
dragging him into court—at taxpayer
expense—in an effort to redo the
Mueller investigation because the ma-
jority and the media didn’t like the
outcome.
Democrats again have failed to lay a
foundation for any action against Mr.
McGahn. Chairman NADLER has never
formally objected to the President’s
protective assertion of executive privi-
lege or other common law privileges
asserted by Mr. McGahn.
Under Supreme Court precedent, the
chairman must take this important
procedural step to pursue further ac-
tions against a witness. The witness
should be given a clear-cut choice be-
tween compliance and noncompliance,
between answering the question and
risking prosecution for contempt. Here,
the witness is being hauled into court
without proper notice.
Evidence of this glaring error is in
the RECORD. On May 31, Chairman NAD-
LER wrote Mr. McGahn’s counsel and
stated he did not agree with the White
House or Mr. McGahn and offered to

continue negotiating, but the chairman
also gave Mr. McGahn a deadline of
June 7—this past Friday—to respond.
Meanwhile, the Rules Committee no-
ticed a markup of this resolution on
June 6, one day before the deadline.
I think we are seeing the pattern
here. This is a revealing error. But er-
rors occur when you are pushing action
through at light speed and ceding your
power to the judicial branch. A court
will decide whether the House has
standing, whether the case is right, and
whether the Congress is entitled to the
information outside of an impeach-
ment inquiry.
As also has been said, the propo-
sitions are a gamble. Here, Mr. Speak-
er, we are gambling with the power of
a coequal branch. This approach is un-
tested and can do significant harm to
Congress’ Article I authority.
Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I must make
mention, the authorization of the gen-
eral counsel to seek pro bono legal
services circumvents the House ethics
rules.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 1 minute to the gentleman.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, those rules provide an exception for
Members to bring civil action chal-
lenging the lawfulness of an action of a
Federal agency or an action of a Fed-
eral official taken in an official capac-
ity provided that the action concerns a
matter of public interest rather than a
matter that is personal in nature.
This resolution contravenes ethics
rules by giving the general counsel the
authority, in Mr. McGahn’s case, to so-
licit a gift: pro bono level services. I
am not sure that was the majority’s in-
tent, but the inconsistencies result
when Democrats aim to rush resolu-
tions through the House outside of reg-
ular order.
Mr. Speaker, the majority may wish
to change the rules. This majority may
wish to get to the finish line quicker.
The majority may wish to circumvent
everything that is present in this
House—and we have seen a lot of it
over the past 51⁄2 months—but I wish
they would take into account that they
may not be the majority forever, hope-
fully, and if they mess up oversight of
a coequal branch, it is on their hands.
That is what the vote for ‘‘yes’’ is on
this resolution. That is why a Member
of this body should vote ‘‘no’’ for the
integrity of this House.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me
just assure the gentleman from Geor-
gia that there is nothing novel about
this legislation. It is not novel because
everything in this bill goes to the Bi-
partisan Legal Advisory Group, and
that has been the case in the past.
What is novel, however, is a Presi-
dent of the United States who says ‘‘ig-
nore subpoenas’’ and ‘‘we will not co-
operate’’ and tells people not to testify.
That is not only novel, it is shocking.
Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my
friends on the other side: You are going
to have a choice today to either vote
for this resolution and stand up for this
institution and support the rule of law,
or you are going to vote in a way that
is going to be complicit with this
President’s obstruction and disrespect
for this institution and disrespect for
the rule of law. I urge you to vote with
us.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
4 minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. CUMMINGS), the distinguished
chairman of the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
in strong support of this resolution.
Mr. Speaker, the Trump administra-
tion is engaged in one of the most un-
precedented coverups since Watergate,
and it is not just about Russia. It is so
much broader than that. This coverup
spans across numerous investigations,
and it extends from the White House to
multiple Federal agencies of govern-
ment to completely separate outside
parties.
The administration officials now
question the fundamental basis of Con-
gress to conduct oversight. They object
to committee rules and precedence
that have been in place for decades
under both Republican and Democratic
leaders, and they make baseless legal
arguments to avoid producing docu-
ments and testimony. The Trump ad-
ministration is challenging the very
constitutionality of congressional
oversight, and it is happening in broad
daylight.
Several weeks ago, President Trump
vowed, ‘‘We’re fighting all the sub-
poenas.’’ Since then, he has refused to
work on legislative priorities such as
infrastructure until Congress halts
oversight and investigations of his ad-
ministration. He wants us to forgo our
responsibility under the Constitution
as a condition of passing laws to help
our constituents and his constituents.
The President’s arguments are base-
less. He suggests that all subpoenas
that Congress puts out are partisan and
somehow related to the Russia probe,
but that is simply not correct. In the
Oversight and Reform Committee, we
have issued eight subpoenas: six of
them are bipartisan and none of them
are about Russia. They involve issues
like the census, immigrant children
being locked in cages and separated
from their families, and the President’s
finances.
b 1445
This entire year, the White House
has not produced one document to the
Oversight and Reform Committee. Let
me say that again: In all of our inves-
tigations, the White House has not pro-
duced one single shred of paper in re-
sponse to our requests.
The hurricanes in Puerto Rico, the
White House has produced nothing. Se-
curity clearance abuses, the White
House has produced nothing. Efforts to
transfer nuclear technology to Saudi
Arabia, the White House has produced
nothing. Hush-money payments, the
White House has produced not a thing.
Even on issues like spending taxpayer
dollars to pay for private jets, the
White House has produced absolutely
nothing.
Over and over again, it does not mat-
ter what the topic is, the tactics are
the same. This begs the question: What
are we covering up?
Tomorrow, our committee will vote
on whether to hold the Attorney Gen-
eral and the Secretary of Commerce in
contempt of Congress for refusing to
produce documents relating to the Cen-
sus. Again, these subpoenas are bipar-
tisan, and this issue has nothing to do
with Russia. Yet, the Trump adminis-
tration has delayed, stonewalled, ob-
structed, and challenged the authority
of the Congress on even those ques-
tions.
I support today’s resolution because
it makes clear that in addition to seek-
ing criminal contempt on the House
floor, committees may seek authority
to enforce their subpoenas directly in
civil court actions. Nobody is above the
law.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Maryland.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, no-
body is above the law, not even the
President of the United States.
Today’s resolution reaffirms that
Congress has the independent author-
ity under the Constitution to inves-
tigate waste, fraud, abuse, and wrong-
doing so that we can pass laws that are
effective and efficient on behalf of all
of our constituents.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Before
proceeding, Members are again re-
minded to refrain from engaging in
personalities toward the President.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS), my friend.
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding. I oppose this
resolution.
The subpoena for Attorney General
Barr is unenforceable on its face. It de-
mands the full and unredacted Mueller
report, including grand jury material
that the Attorney General cannot law-
fully disclose, and the Democrats know
this.
In a hearing last month, Chairman
NADLER admitted that Attorney Gen-
eral Barr could not lawfully release
grand jury material. He therefore ad-
mitted that the Attorney General
could not lawfully comply with the
subpoena.
Instead, the chairman suggested that
the subpoena is a starting point in ne-
gotiations. Rarely have I heard that
term used with regard to a subpoena.
In fact, I never heard it before that
time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4415
June 11, 2019
In the Judiciary Committee’s hearing
on executive privilege last month, one
of the majority’s own witnesses testi-
fied that ‘‘one of the categories of in-
formation presently sought by the
committee appears so broad as to put
the executive branch officials to a
nearly impossible task. . . . The com-
mittee cannot in good faith expect
compliance; accordingly, the burden is
on the committee to substantially nar-
row this aspect of its request.’’
My friends talk about the rule of law,
but the Democrats have admitted in a
hearing in the Judiciary Committee
that the subpoena was overly broad
and that objects of the subpoena that
are prohibited from disclosure, such as
6(e) material, were not subject to the
subpoena. But they didn’t fix their sub-
poena. They didn’t issue a new sub-
poena. They didn’t amend the sub-
poena. They just attempted to amend
their contempt citation.
The defendant’s confusion over what
is subject to a subpoena is adequate
evidence that the subpoena itself is le-
gally deficient as being confusing and
overly broad. A court will not be able
to read the collective minds of our
Democratic colleagues and will not ex-
pect such clairvoyance from the Attor-
ney General nor from the former White
House Counsel.
The administration is currently ne-
gotiating in good faith. We see that an
agreement was reached just yesterday.
The same Democrat, when discussing
the assertion of executive privilege by
the administration, stated, ‘‘These de-
velopments do not, however, relieve
the committee of its obligation to con-
tinue to negotiate.’’
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 15 seconds to the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, just as the
subpoena is overly broad and, quite
frankly, unprecedented, as well as le-
gally deficient, this resolution is also
overly broad and unique in the annals
of American history.
When the chairwoman from Cali-
fornia referred to the President of the
United States as a dictator, her lan-
guage was rancorous and unparliamen-
tary, but it seems to have been filled
with projection, as this resolution pro-
vides unique authorities.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am
proud to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI),
the distinguished Speaker of the
House.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank
him for giving us this opportunity to
protect and defend the Constitution of
the United States, which is our oath of
office.
Let me salute the chairs of the com-
mittees of jurisdiction who have led us
down this path of great respect for law,
precedent, and the oath we take: Con-
gresswoman MAXINE WATERS, Congress-
man CUMMINGS, Congressman NADLER,
Congressman RICHARD NEAL, and Con-
gressman ELIOT ENGEL, all of whom
have been fighting the fight and gath-
ering the facts to protect and defend
our Constitution.
The oath of office that we take is
why we are on the floor today, to hold
Attorney General of the United States
Barr and former White House Counsel
McGahn in civil contempt for their re-
fusal to comply with Congress’ sub-
poenas. We must follow the facts and
uncover the truth for the American
people.
At the birth of our democracy, amid
war and revolution, Thomas Paine said
the times have found us. We are here
today because the times have found us.
While we do not place ourselves in the
same category of greatness as our
Founders, we do recognize the urgency
of the threat to our Nation that we
face today.
This body has a solemn duty, Mr.
Speaker, to protect and defend our de-
mocracy, honoring the oath we take
and the Constitution that is the foun-
dation of our freedom. That Constitu-
tion begins with our beautiful pre-
amble, ‘‘We the People.’’
Immediately following those words of
the preamble is Article I, establishing
a Congress in which ‘‘all legislative
Powers herein granted are vested.’’
The Founders conferred upon the
first branch responsibilities that are
sweeping in scope. We set an agenda.
We hold the power of the purse. We
write the laws that all of us are bound
by, including the President of the
United States and those who surround
him.
Fundamental to those responsibil-
ities is oversight of the executive
branch and all the areas essential to
the well-being of the American people.
Oversight is our institutional duty,
to ensure against the abuse of power,
protect the rule of law, and expose the
truth for the people who are ‘‘the only
legitimate fountain of power,’’ in the
words of James Madison.
To conduct that oversight, the Con-
gress is both constitutionally obligated
and legally entitled to access and re-
view materials from the executive
branch, which it can subpoena.
Yet, the President and the adminis-
tration have shown an unprecedented
and unjustifiable refusal to furnish
Congress with that information. Presi-
dent Trump himself has said, ‘‘We’re
fighting all the subpoenas,’’ and, ‘‘I
don’t want people testifying,’’ and, ‘‘No
do-overs.’’
His administration has employed
every tool it can find to obstruct legiti-
mate committee oversight, everything
from witness intimidation to blanket
stonewalling to spurious claims of ex-
ecutive privilege, absolute immunity,
and lack of legislative purpose.
This obstruction violates decades of
established legal precedent. Through-
out our history, the courts have made
absolutely clear that the House has the
authority to follow the facts to un-
cover the truth for the American peo-
ple and that ‘‘the power of the Con-
gress to conduct investigations is in-
herent in the legislative process.’’
Our oversight responsibility con-
tinues to be resoundingly affirmed in
the courts again and again. Last
month, the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia ruled in the
Mazars court decision that ‘‘there can
be little doubt that Congress’ interest
in the accuracy of the President’s fi-
nancial disclosures falls within the leg-
islative sphere.’’
That same week, the judge ruled in
the Deutsche Bank case that Congress’
‘‘subpoenas are all in service of facially
legitimate investigative purposes.’’
The administration’s obstruction not
only violates long-established prece-
dent, but it also endangers our very de-
mocracy. We need answers on the many
questions left unanswered by the
Mueller report, which made clear that
the Russians waged an all-out attack
on our democracy, and the Mueller re-
port documented 11 instances of ob-
struction from the White House itself.
This is a grave threat to our democ-
racy, but the President calls it a
‘‘hoax’’ and refuses to protect our de-
mocracy. Why is that? We take an oath
to protect our Constitution from all
enemies, foreign and domestic. What
the White House and the administra-
tion are doing is a danger and a threat
to our democracy.
At the same time, the administra-
tion’s campaign of stonewalling ex-
tends far beyond the Mueller report.
The administration is obscuring the
truth behind its disastrous policy deci-
sions, from attacking Affordable Care
Act coverage for millions of Ameri-
cans, including those with preexisting
conditions, taking it to court to over-
turn it while saying to the American
people that it supports preexisting con-
ditions coverage; to tearing apart vul-
nerable immigrant families at the bor-
der; to stealing military funds for an
ineffective, wasteful border wall; to
rolling back key civil rights protec-
tions for women, LGBTQ Americans,
and people of color. The list goes on
and on.
In court, they also tried to defend
their abuse of power when it comes to
the Census, which the Constitution is
very clear about, that every 10 years
the people of the country will be enu-
merated. They want to put a citizen-
ship phrase in there to put a chilling
effect on our getting an accurate
count.
The well-being of the American peo-
ple and the integrity of our democracy
are imperiled by this brazen behavior.
Senator MCCONNELL declares ‘‘case
closed,’’ enabling this campaign of
blanket, unprecedented obstruction.
We see the obstruction in this House
to trying to uphold our proceedings,
but we have the votes to proceed. The
United States Senate has a responsi-
bility to protect and defend the Con-
stitution, but they are ignoring that.
As Members of Congress, we have a re-
sponsibility to honor our oath of office

and strengthen the institution in
which we serve for the people.
We have a responsibility under the
vision of our Founders and the text of
the Constitution to ensure that the
truth is known. No one is above the
law. Everyone will be held accountable,
including the President of the United
States.
The people’s House will continue to
fight to make the truth known for the
American people and will defend Con-
gress’ role under Article I.
I urge a strong bipartisan vote for
this resolution to hold Attorney Gen-
eral Barr and former White House
Counsel McGahn in civil contempt for
their refusal to comply with Congress’
subpoenas and to honor the oath of of-
fice that they take.
I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK).
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker,
there is a reason for the abusive rhet-
oric from the left. For 21⁄2 years, they
peddled a monstrous lie that Donald
Trump is colluding with a hostile for-
eign government. They concocted it
with a phony dossier commissioned by
the Clinton campaign and promoted by
the highest officials in the FBI, our in-
telligence agencies, and the Justice De-
partment, first in a failed attempt to
interfere with the 2016 Presidential
election and then to undermine the
constitutionally elected President of
the United States.
Now, despite spending $25 million on
an outrageously biased team of par-
tisan zealots assembled by Mr. Mueller,
which initially included the now-infa-
mous Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and
using some of the most abusive pros-
ecutorial tactics ever employed in this
country, they could find no evidence to
support the lie.
b 1500
So what to do?
They had to think up another lie and
think it up quick. So now we hear cries
of obstruction and coverup. Good luck
with that.
Coverup of a crime that never hap-
pened?
Obstruction, by turning over every
document Mueller requested and even
waiving executive privilege to allow
the White House counsel to testify?
Now, Mr. Speaker, you compare that
to Hillary Clinton’s willful destruction
of 30,000 emails under subpoena and
you get a sense of the double standard
involved here.
This is a desperate scavenger hunt to
salvage their false narrative, and their
time and the Nation’s patience is run-
ning out. The other shoe is about to
drop. Broad investigations are now well
underway and will soon reveal how this
lie was perpetrated and promoted. Two
governments interfered in our elec-
tions, the Russians through ham-hand-
ed propaganda, and the Obama admin-
istration by turning the most terri-
fying powers entrusted to our govern-
ment against our political process.
The reckoning is coming. As Long-
fellow said:
The wheels of the gods grind slow, but they
grind exceedingly fine.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN).
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this is an
opportunity for Congress to reassert
itself as an equal branch of govern-
ment. The fact that it is supposed to be
three equal branches of government is
not totally accurate.
When we came up with the Constitu-
tion, we decided that we didn’t want to
have an autocratic king rule us. That
is why we had a revolution. When the
men met to write our Constitution,
they made Congress Article I. There
was a reason they made Congress Arti-
cle I, because the Congress represents
the people. It is not a king, it is not an
autocrat, and it is not a despot. It is
the Representatives of the people who
make the laws. We are supposed to
really be the embodiment—and we are
the embodiment—of the American peo-
ple.
This President has thumbed his nose
at the Representatives of the people by
not complying with lawful requests for
documentation and lawful requests for
testimony for Congress to do its con-
stitutionally delegated purpose of over-
sight of the executive branch and laws
that are necessary for the betterment
of this Nation.
This is about time Congress did act.
I am proud of Congress for bringing
these bills, and I am shocked at the op-
position for not wanting the people’s
House—their House, their legislative
body—to stand up for future Con-
gresses as well as this Congress for the
rightful power that it deserves to do
oversight and perform its functions
with the best possible witnesses and
testimony and materials that could aid
it in its efforts.
I support the contempt citations. I
condemn the parties that have
thumbed their noses at us, subpoena
under law, they are supposed to arrive
with documentation and appear to tes-
tify. If they object, they can object
there and then, not just disregard Con-
gresses’ subpoenas that are lawful.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. WOODALL).
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my friend on the Rules Committee for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to
the debate intently. I don’t disagree
with much of what my friend from Ten-
nessee had to say. It is a bad habit that
both parties have gotten into over the
decades of my lifetime putting party
above Article in terms of judicial over-
sight, executive branch oversight, and
even our responsibilities here, such as
declaring war.
But what you have not heard here
today, Mr. Speaker, and what you will
not hear is why the passage of this res-
olution advantages us in any way.
There is not one piece of information
that the Speaker of our House—our
Speaker—just came and asked for that
we are not empowered to request
today.
The difference, Mr. Speaker, is if we
pass this resolution, rather than the
House requesting this information—as
has historically been true—we would
begin to request information one com-
mittee chairman at a time.
Does that advantage us in Article I,
going to court one committee chair-
man at a time, or are we advantaged
when the Speaker speaks on behalf of
us all?
I don’t know the answer, Mr. Speak-
er. I am not a legal scholar, and in the
Rules Committee where we had origi-
nal jurisdiction on this, we did not call
any legal scholars to help us answer
that question. In the Judiciary Com-
mittee they did not call any legal
scholars to help to answer this ques-
tion.
Mr. Speaker, I tell you there is not a
Member of this institution on either
side of the aisle who cares more about
Article I and our exerting the respon-
sibilities the Constitution gives to us
and our constituents expect us to do
than I do. Perhaps there is someone in
here who cares as much, but there is no
one who cares more.
Are we disadvantaging the institu-
tion for life by taking what has tradi-
tionally been the responsibility of our
Speaker to do on behalf of all of us and
putting it in the hands of committee
chairmen?
We don’t know, and anyone who tells
you that they do isn’t telling you the
truth. We are going to continue to
argue about the White House and what
they have turned over and what they
didn’t turn over and what they ought
to turn over, Mr. Speaker. That is not
what this bill does today. There is not
one piece of information that is re-
quested that we do not have the au-
thority to request today. Let’s not
move in ways that disadvantage us for
generations to come.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER),
who is the majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to follow the gentleman from
Georgia.
I have a card in my hand. This is a
Member’s identification. There is no
designation of party on this card. This
card designates 435 of us when we are
at full complement as Members of the
Congress, the people’s Representatives.
I urge all my colleagues to use this
card in a few minutes on behalf of the
people and on behalf of this institution.
Mr. Speaker, when Democrats won
the majority in this House, we did so
on a promise to the American people to
hold the executive department ac-
countable. That is our responsibility.
The Constitution gives us that respon-
sibility, and we swear an oath to up-
hold the Constitution. That is what the
committees have been doing, and it is
what the whole House is doing today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4417
June 11, 2019
Now, the previous speaker said we
have the right to ask for any informa-
tion. That is accurate. What he did not
then say is we have asked, and we have
been refused. Not only have we been re-
fused in the particular, we have been
refused in the general because the
President of the United States has di-
rected his people not to give us any in-
formation and not to respond to any
subpoenas, whatever the rationale may
be.
Why?
Because he believes the House of Rep-
resentatives is not acting properly.
Mr. Speaker, you imagine anybody
who doesn’t want to give us informa-
tion would say, I am not going to give
it to you because you are not asking
properly?
Of course, that is what they do; and
the House, on behalf of the American
people, would be unable to perform its
constitutional duty. This is not polit-
ical. It is constitutional. It is about
separation of powers. It is about re-
sponsibility. It is about accountability.
The House is exercising its responsi-
bility to uncover all the facts and dis-
cover the truth on behalf of the Amer-
ican people. We represent, each us,
about 750,000 people. We are not asking
on our own behalf. We are asking for
the people, so that the people have the
information they need in a democracy
to make the decisions that they are
called upon to make in a very solemn
exercise we call voting.
Attorney General Barr and former
White House Counsel McGahn have
both refused to respond to subpoenas to
testify before the House, and the Attor-
ney General refuses to allow Congress
to see the full and unredacted report by
the special counsel, Mr. Mueller. You
can see entire pages blacked out, Mr.
Speaker.
The Attorney General’s efforts to
prejudge the conclusions of that report
before it is released, as he did, and his
public mischaracterization of its con-
clusions are, in my opinion, evidence of
the contempt with which he refuses to
answer questions and respond to sub-
poenas. It seems contemptuous as well
of the basic principles of the rule of law
and checks and balances.
The American people deserve to
know the full extent of Russia’s efforts
to interfere in our elections and sub-
vert our democracy.
Mr. Speaker, you didn’t have to lis-
ten too closely to Bob Mueller to un-
derstand that he believed that there
was much more to be found or to miss
the fact that he said to Congress: Do
your duty and make sure the American
people know the facts.
The American people deserve to
know whether the President or anyone
in his administration or inner circle of
confidants were involved and tried to
cover it up.
Now we have been accused of doing
awful things, but I remember watching
conventions where they said, ‘‘lock her
up, lock her up.’’ Flynn—General
Flynn—who was the National Security
Advisor said: ‘‘Lock her up.’’
Well, the fact is they locked him up,
and many others who were associated
who lied about their involvement with
the Russian Government and, yes, with
other foreign countries. So there is rea-
son for the Congress to want to get to
the bottom of this serious invasion of
our election process.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to stand up for
our Constitution and vote for this reso-
lution. I thank the chairman of the
Rules Committee, Mr. MCGOVERN. I
thank Chairman NADLER, Chairman
SCHIFF, Chairman CUMMINGS, Chairman
NEAL, Chairman ENGEL, and Chair-
woman WATERS, all who have jurisdic-
tion over various facets of the informa-
tion that is needed, and I thank the
members of their committees for their
hard work to conduct necessary over-
sight on behalf of the American people.
Mr. Speaker, that is what this vote is
about. I presented that card. It has no
party designation on it. It just has a
designation of us—each of us—as Rep-
resentatives of the people. Let us make
sure that today we vote for the people
and stand up for our Constitution, for
this House, and for the rule of law.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. CHABOT), who is my fellow Judici-
ary Committee member.
Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding, Mr. Speaker, and I
rise in opposition to this resolution.
It seems to allow Democrats on the
Judiciary Committee to go to essen-
tially whatever court they want to get
a court order to get whatever docu-
ments they want—even grand jury doc-
uments and those that relate to our na-
tional security—all because they don’t
want, or are afraid to, really, hold At-
torney General Barr or former White
House Counsel Don McGahn in con-
tempt of Congress, just as they are
afraid to institute impeachment pro-
ceedings against President Trump or
accept the fact that the Mueller inves-
tigation found that there was no collu-
sion and Attorney General Barr found
no obstruction.
They just can’t get it through their
heads that that is the case, and they
don’t want to focus on the real issue
threatening our democracy which is
that Russia actually attempted to
interfere in our national elections back
in 2016 while Barack Obama—not Don-
ald Trump—was President, and the
Obama administration did absolutely
nothing about that.
They really don’t seem too concerned
that the Russians or another foreign
entity might attempt to do so again in
2020. That is what they ought to be
using their oversight powers—very
powerful things the power that the ma-
jority has—they ought to be using it
about that, not this charade.
b 1515
How many documents have the
Democrats requested that relate to
Russian interference in our elections?
None. How many hearings? Zip. How
many Obama-administration officials
and others connected to Russia’s ef-
forts have they subpoenaed to testify
before the Judiciary Committee? Zero.
By continuing with this fake im-
peachment, the Democrats are doing
the American public a disservice. My
Democratic colleagues ought to be em-
barrassed.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me
correct the RECORD in response to the
gentleman of Ohio. The Russians didn’t
attempt to interfere in our election;
they did interfere in our election.
And, if my friends read the Mueller
report, they would realize they inter-
fered in the election to help Donald
Trump get elected.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. NAD-
LER), the distinguished chair of the
Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, when a congressional
committee issues a subpoena, compli-
ance is not optional. We expect wit-
nesses to testify when summoned. We
expect the administration to comply
with subpoenas and to provide us with
the materials we require to do our jobs.
Of course, there may be differences
between the Congress and the execu-
tive branch as to what information can
be produced on a timely basis. When
those differences arise, we are required
to seek a reasonable accommodation.
We first requested access to the full
Mueller report and the underlying evi-
dence on February 22. After refusing
for almost 4 months, the Department
of Justice, in the last few days, has fi-
nally agreed to permit us to view the
special counsel’s most important files.
We are hopeful this will provide us
with key evidence regarding allega-
tions of obstruction of justice and
other misconduct.
Given this potential breakthrough,
we will hold the criminal contempt
process for Attorney General Barr in
abeyance for now.
But President Trump has blocked
other key witnesses from testifying be-
fore the Judiciary Committee, includ-
ing his former White House counsel
Don McGahn, whose account of the
President’s actions was featured in the
Mueller report.
The President has claimed absolute
immunity for critical witnesses to pre-
vent them from even showing up. He
has invoked executive privilege to pre-
vent us from seeing documents that
stopped being privileged long ago, if
they were ever privileged to begin
with.
He has done the same in response to
Congress’ important work unrelated to
the Mueller report, and he has ordered
the agencies not to cooperate with
even our most basic oversight requests.
This unprecedented stonewalling by
the administration is completely unac-
ceptable. The committees have a con-
stitutional responsibility to conduct
oversight, to make recommendations
to the House as necessary, and to craft

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4418 June 11, 2019
legislation that will curb the abuse of
power on full display in the Trump ad-
ministration.
This is why it is important that the
Judiciary Committee be able to act in
such matters using all of our Article I
powers, as contemplated in this resolu-
tion and described in both the Rules
Committee report and the House Judi-
ciary Committee’s contempt report.
Now, I heard what the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL) said a few
minutes ago, and he is exactly right.
This resolution gives committee chairs
the power, with the approval of the Bi-
partisan Legal Advisory Group, to go
to court on behalf of the House to en-
force our subpoenas.
This has not been done before, but
neither have we ever seen blanket
stonewalling by the administration of
all information requests by the House.
We have never faced such blanket
stonewalling.
The President himself said—and they
have been as good as their word—they
will oppose all of our subpoenas.
We must go to court to enforce the
subpoenas without a separate floor
vote each time if we are going to en-
force our subpoenas and reject the ar-
rogant assumption of power by the ad-
ministration and denigration of the
power of the House and of the Con-
gress.
We cannot afford to waste all the
floor time every single time the admin-
istration rejects one of our subpoenas,
which is every time we issue a sub-
poena.
That is why we must pass this resolu-
tion.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this resolution so that we can
get into court and break the stonewall
without delay.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), our Republican
leader.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, Special Counsel Mueller
officially ended his investigation sev-
eral weeks ago. His office is closed. Be-
cause of Attorney General Barr, his re-
port is public.
And his findings are very clear: No
collusion and no obstruction. This is
the bottom line of the Mueller report.
But, Mr. Speaker, Democrats refuse
to accept it. Mr. Speaker, even the
chairman of the committee refuses to
go read the portion that he is allowed
to read, only six lines. He refuses to
read it, but he wants to come here
today.
They continue to believe their worst
conspiracy theories about the Presi-
dent, despite all the evidence to the
contrary.
Mr. Speaker, it is even reported in
newspapers that, in the campaign to
become chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, one said he campaigned for
the position because he would be the
best with impeachment.
Mr. Speaker, even on the floor of this
House, there were more than 60 Mem-
bers on the other side of the aisle who
voted for impeachment before the
Mueller report was ever presented to
the public.
At its core, H. Res. 430 is just a des-
perate attempt to relitigate the
Mueller investigation. That is why I
urge my colleagues to oppose this reso-
lution.
It does not strengthen Congress’
oversight powers, contrary to what you
may hear from the other side, Mr.
Speaker. Fundamentally, it is an im-
peachment effort in everything but
name.
Mr. Speaker, just look at the unnec-
essary contempt citation against At-
torney General Barr. Less than a
month after Barr received the Mueller
report, Mr. Speaker, Chairman NADLER
issued a subpoena that would have re-
quired the Attorney General of the
United States of America to break the
law.
That is not my opinion. Let’s be very
clear whose words those are: Jonathan
Turley’s. Mr. Speaker, probably every-
body in this body not only knows who
Jonathan Turley is; he has, probably,
the utmost respect. He is one of the
most respected legal scholars in this
country.
Now, he told the committee, Mr.
Speaker:
You have to tie your request carefully to
your authority to demand information . . . if
Bill Barr had actually complied with the
subpoena as written, he would have violated
Federal law.
If he would have complied, he would
have violated Federal law.
Mr. Speaker, that is why we are here.
Not only, Mr. Speaker, does the chair-
man of that committee ask the attor-
ney general to break the law or he will
try to hold him in contempt; he won’t
even go read the report.
On May 8, only a few weeks after the
first subpoena was issued, House Judi-
ciary Democrats voted to hold A. G.
Barr, the Attorney General of the
United States, in contempt.
Why would they vote to hold him in
contempt? Because they were so angry
that the Attorney General wouldn’t
break the law. They wanted him to
break the law; then he won’t be held in
contempt.
In a May 24 letter to the Attorney
General, Chairman NADLER offered, for
the first time, to negotiate and narrow
the scope of his subpoena request.
Then, you know what? He changed his
mind.
Yesterday, the Department of Justice
reached an agreement with the Judici-
ary Committee to turn over documents
related to the Mueller report.
Now, if the public is watching, this
just looks so disorganized. You wonder,
from that committee, Mr. Speaker,
wouldn’t they know better than to ask
the Attorney General to break the law?
Mr. Speaker, wouldn’t you know
that, when you get to this point in a
career, you wouldn’t be so upset that
someone just doesn’t do exactly what
you want—and you ask them to break
the law—that you would vote to hold
them in contempt and force your side
of the aisle just to vote that way.
That is not how it has happened in
this body before. If the public wants to
see a good example of congressional
oversight, then let’s look at something
that is comparable: the House’s con-
tempt vote against Attorney General
Holder in 2012.
The House Committee on Oversight
and Reform took two important ac-
tions before suing in Federal court.
First, it negotiated with Attorney Gen-
eral Holder in good faith for 15
months—not a few days. It never asked
him to break the law either.
After narrowing the scope of its
original subpoena, and only after ex-
tensive back-and-forth negotiations
failed, did it vote to hold him in con-
tempt.
Second, it got the full House to vote
on it and approve—you know what—a
bipartisan contempt.
Now, I am not sure why the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, Mr. Speaker,
would not know this, but I did a little
research because I was here during that
time. You know why they didn’t realize
it was the best way to do it and it was
bipartisan? Because, Mr. Speaker, a lot
of them stormed outside of the Cham-
ber.
Yep. You heard me right. Even
though 17 Democrats voted in favor of
the criminal contempt resolution
against Holder and 21 voted to enforce
civil citation, a number of them
stormed outside and protested, took
their ball and ran home. Mr. Speaker, I
guess, to the public, it looked like they
had just thrown another fit.
Now, that is pretty significant. As
many of you remember, it was conten-
tious. I remember, Mr. Speaker, watch-
ing then-Minority Leader PELOSI, Mi-
nority Whip HOYER, and Congressman
NADLER lead 100 Democrats off the
House floor to protest the vote.
Mr. Speaker, you won’t see that on
our side. We believe in the rule of law.
Mr. Speaker, we would have done the
exact same thing the Attorney General
did, that Jonathan Turley said, that
you would have had to break the law to
try to appease somebody’s own per-
sonal vendetta.
The idea, Mr. Speaker, that someone
would run for a position to say that
they would be best to impeach some-
body and even vote to impeach without
even having a report and then, when
you get a report and you could go down
and read just those six lines that you
want to complain about, but you
won’t—the same person, Mr. Speaker,
that would run outside and say: I got
elected to Congress, but I am going to
pout and I am going to go outside.
Mr. Speaker, that may be the same
person that would want to bring this to
the floor today.
But what is so different about today
than all the others? Well, we are doing
something we have never done before.
We are doing something that is going
to take the power away of every Mem-
ber in this body and give it to a select
few.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4419
June 11, 2019
Mr. Speaker, if this vote passes
today, Members of this body are going
to say: Don’t bring it here and let me
represent my own people and vote
about going to court. Let’s just give it,
really, to three people. Let’s give it to
Speaker NANCY PELOSI, Majority Lead-
er HOYER, and to the majority whip.
Because that is what BLAG is.
I know the courts are going to sit
there and say that is not what Con-
gress is supposed to do. Congress has
never done that before. But, you know
what? If this new majority thinks all
they want to do is make an attorney
general break the law, I guess they
could break every rule, every history,
every point of representation there is
inside this body.
Did we wonder if this would happen?
Do we wonder why you wouldn’t take
the months, as they have shown in the
time before, and actually come to a bi-
partisan conclusion?
I think the plan was already written.
I don’t know if people can talk about
the word ‘‘patient’’ because, Mr.
Speaker, I remember Congressman
HANK JOHNSON of the Rules Com-
mittee—this is the Speaker’s com-
mittee, so everybody understands cor-
rectly, that is just appointed by the
Speaker on the majority side—said,
Mr. Speaker: ‘‘Donald Trump will
stand for reelection again in a very
short period of time, and we don’t have
400 days to wait. . . .’’
So, don’t care about the rule of law.
Don’t care about asking him to break
the law. Just break every historical
trend and try to take the power away
from millions of Americans and from
the Members of Congress who represent
them here.
I didn’t know today would come. Mr.
Speaker, I didn’t know if someone
would go this far.
I didn’t know, just because someone,
Mr. Speaker, despises somebody else,
that an election didn’t turn out the
way of the desire—Mr. Speaker, I have
been on losing sides before, but I would
never think I would break the law just
because of losing an election.
I would never think of asking some-
body in as high an office as the Attor-
ney General of the United States of
America to not give due process, to
come to the floor and strip the power
of 430 Members and put it in a select
few.
Mr. Speaker, I have to be honest. I
don’t put anything past what this new
desire is about.
b 1530
Mr. Speaker, Democrats say we are
in a constitutional crisis, and they are
right, but not because of Attorney Gen-
eral Barr. The constitutional crisis is
this: When Democrats can’t win, they
change the rules.
I just heard it on the floor, Mr.
Speaker, that, yes, from the other side
of the aisle, said this has never been
done before, and, yes, this is nothing
this House has ever desired to do. But
it is also no way to govern.
The American people deserve a ma-
jority that is serious about coming up
with solutions, not subpoenas. There
are plenty of important challenges that
we can be working on to solve.
Just yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I
opened The New York Times. It is not
a paper that I think I always agree
with, but it had an editorial not for the
first time, but for the second time, and
it was talking about the crisis on the
border.
As I read this editorial, I found my-
self agreeing with it greatly. When I
read it, it talked about the border,
talked about Washington needing to
stop dithering and do something about
it.
I looked and wondered what com-
mittee would be most responsible for
this challenge? Lo and behold, it was
the Judiciary. So I turned it on in
hopes that I would see a hearing,
maybe I would even see a markup.
No, Mr. Speaker, who did I see? I saw
John Dean. John Dean, who pleaded
guilty in Watergate. The same indi-
vidual who has put more than 900
tweets out against the President, many
before any Mueller report came forth.
He was the expert witness—the same
individual who is paid by CNN, the
same individual who said the Presi-
dency of George Bush was worse than
Watergate.
I guess this new majority will go to
no end. It doesn’t matter if the facts
don’t go where they want; just change
the rules.
I wonder, all these new freshman
Democrats, Mr. Speaker, when they
swore in to uphold the Constitution,
does that mean trying to make the At-
torney General break the law? Does
that mean giving their power away to
a select few?
There is a crisis on the border. The
New York Times knows it. The country
of Mexico knows it. I think almost ev-
erybody in America knows it except,
Mr. Speaker, I guess, this majority.
The committee of responsibility is
more concerned about bringing some-
body in who pleaded guilty in Water-
gate, who makes their money off, Mr.
Speaker, writing books claiming every
Republican President there is is worse
than Watergate and then asking the
Attorney General to break the law.
That is not a legacy I would be proud
of. It is not a legacy I would want to be
a part of.
But, Mr. Speaker, I will say on this
floor: I will vote against taking the
power away, even the power away from
people on the other side of the aisle. I
won’t lead a protest, and I won’t go
outside, and I won’t take my ball, and
I won’t run home. I believe in the rule
of law.
Mr. Speaker, I had the responsibility
and the opportunity to go read the re-
dacted portions of the Mueller report,
just as some on the other side of the
aisle could. It is just six lines. Not that
I think it was just my responsibility,
but as an elected official I thought it
was a responsibility, so I went. But,
Mr. Speaker, the people leading this
today, they have not. They think they
know better.
I don’t know if they know better, but
one thing I do know: They are chang-
ing the rules of the House simply be-
cause they cannot win. That is not the
American way.
Those are the reasons why we stand
up. Those are the things that America
unites behind, the rule of law. This will
not be a day that is proud. This will
not be a day that, when they look back
in history, the individuals who vote for
this will talk about.
It is one when they get asked the
question later in life, Mr. Speaker, is
there something they regret, they will
regret that emotion overtook them.
They will regret their own personal
dislike drove them.
I am not sure if they are proud of the
day when they storm out of the build-
ing, even though there is a bipartisan
vote here. But I guess that same emo-
tion, the same, Mr. Speaker, lack of
ability to actually look at the rule of
law and work toward something in-
stead of just changing the rules be-
cause you can’t have your way, that is
what today is about.
The worst part of it all is removing
the power of individual Members and
putting in a select three. But then
again, Mr. Speaker, when you study
history and forms of government, that
is what socialism is all about.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
The distinguished minority leader
began by saying that the Mueller re-
port makes it clear that there was no
collusion and no obstruction. Maybe
that is what you would conclude if you
just read Barr’s summary which tried
to cover up what the Mueller report
said, but I would urge the distinguished
minority leader to read the report. I
am happy to lend him my bifocals if he
has trouble reading it.
But the report doesn’t say that. It
doesn’t say no collusion. And on the
issue of obstruction of justice, it says:
If we were convinced that he, the Presi-
dent, did not commit a crime, we would
have said so.
That is what the report says. And I
would remind my colleagues that ob-
struction of justice is a crime.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from California (Mr. TED
LIEU).
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Speaker, the issue today is very sim-
ple. It is simply about the right of the
American people and Congress to get
information. That is it.
All this resolution does is allow us to
enforce congressional subpoenas. These
are documents and witnesses we want,
and it allows us to go to Federal court
to enforce it. That is all this resolution
does.
Why are Republicans so scared of this
resolution? Because they know we are
going to win in court. We have won
three times against the Trump admin-
istration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4420 June 11, 2019
But why do we even have to go to
court to do this? Because the Trump
administration is engaging in unprece-
dented obstruction. And it is not just
about the Mueller report; it is about all
areas.
So, for example, right now, the
Trump administration is suing to
eliminate healthcare coverage for peo-
ple with preexisting conditions. We
want to know more about that. We
can’t get it. We want to know about a
lot of areas that we cannot get, so we
want to go to Federal court to get this
enforced.
What are Republicans doing? They
are making stuff up. They are saying
somehow we are asking the Attorney
General to do things that will make
him violate the law. That is wrong,
wrong, wrong.
I am just going to end with this sim-
ple example.
The Attorney General of the United
States gave the Republican ranking
member of the Judiciary Committee
the right to see their unredacted
Mueller report. Was that illegal? No.
But I can’t see it.
That is wrong. There is no basis for
that. We are simply going to go to Fed-
eral court. We are going to litigate it,
and we are going to win.
All this resolution does is it allows
us to enforce congressional subpoenas
in Federal court. It is about not allow-
ing the Trump administration to cover
things up.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GOHMERT).
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this is
about harassing the President, and it is
about delaying the inevitable.
I would have hoped that my friends
across the aisle, especially in the Judi-
ciary Committee that had concerns in
2005 and 2006 about the overreach that
was possible through the FISA proce-
dures, would have seen that there was
no collusion, that the Russians did try,
but nobody with the Trump campaign
bought.
So we are left with the fact that the
real collusion here was between the
Clinton campaign, with Fusion GPS
hiring a foreign agent, Christopher
Steele, who talked to people he now ad-
mits could well have been agents of
Vladimir Putin, who gave false infor-
mation about Trump, the candidate,
that was used in a dossier that was
used to manipulate the FISA court
into giving a warrant to start spying
on the Trump campaign. That is what
this was about.
And what people are calling obstruc-
tion of justice is exactly what you have
when you have somebody falsely ac-
cused of colluding, conspiring with the
Russians, and he knows he didn’t do
that, and he sees his family being har-
assed, and everybody that worked with
the campaign that can be pushed and
shoved and blackmailed, as happened,
and bankrupted, you want to bring it
to an end. You want to see justice
done.
But instead of my friends in Judici-
ary coming together with us who have
been concerned about the abuses of the
FISA system so that it doesn’t happen
to other Americans, instead, they come
with this resolution to push the matter
down the road a little further to the
2020 election.
It has got to stop. Let’s stop now.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
think it is appropriate to correct a
number of statements that have been
made on the floor.
First of all, this is not the end. Direc-
tor Mueller made this the beginning.
When he concluded the report, he left a
very large direction to the United
States Congress. He recognized that he
could not follow up because of policies
at the DOJ regarding indictment in the
process of the administration.
So the Congress, in its due diligence,
took the responsibility not to target
anyone, but to simply uphold the rule
of law. In upholding the rule of law, we
had an empty seat by Attorney General
Barr, an empty seat by Mr. McGahn, an
empty seat by Ms. Hicks, Ms. Donald-
son, and we hope not an empty seat of
the author of the report.
So all this resolution does is author-
ize the committee to seek civil enforce-
ment of its subpoenas against Attorney
General Barr, requiring him to provide
Congress with the key evidence under-
lying the Mueller report as well as the
unredacted report itself, and former
White House Counsel Donald F.
McGahn, requiring him to provide doc-
uments and appear for testimony.
He is not covered by executive privi-
lege. In fact, executive privilege does
not cover—his duty is to the White
House Office of the General Counsel, or
the White House counsel’s office, not to
the individual officeholder, the Presi-
dent. He has personal lawyers.
And we didn’t break the law. 6(e),
which is grand jury materials, our
committee diligently said let’s work
with the Department of Justice, go to
court, and decide what we can see.
We are simply following this little
book that many have died for, and that
is the Constitution of the United
States, and those words in the Declara-
tion of Independence that said we all
are created equal, with certain
unalienable rights of life and liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
the gentlewoman from Texas an addi-
tional 1 minute.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. The American
people would not want a Congress that
turned its back on, frankly, the rule of
law.
For those of us who had the special
privilege of going to Normandy this
past week, we got a great sense of
pride, of the courage of Americans, the
bravery of those young men, and all I
could think of is how important it is to
all of us to adhere to those wonderful
principles.
So, again, there is no targeting here.
This is not a way to do policy or legis-
lation. We can fight that battle on the
floor of the House.
But if you read those volumes and
end it in the last pages of Volume 2,
you know that Director Mueller asked
us to finish the task of looking into
elements that he did not or could not
and the underlying issues.
Let me also say, as we do that, we do
it forthrightly because, in 2020, we
want to make sure that every Amer-
ican has the right to vote and every
American is not undermined by a for-
eign operative interfering and taking
the election away from you.
I support the resolution. We must
stand for the rule of law.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.
Res. 430, authorizing the Committee on the
Judiciary to initiate or intervene in judicial pro-
ceedings to enforce certain subpoenas and for
other purposes.
It is an honor to serve in this body.
We are the successors and heirs to an au-
gust freedom earned centuries ago, expanded
for successive groups and defended through
the blood, sweat and tears of the nation’s
fighting forces.
It is this debt that took me to the beaches
of Normandy to pay my respects on the 75th
Anniversary of the D-Day invasion.
We are heirs to this legacy, and we are
heirs to this ingenious system of separation of
powers.
The system they laid down presumes equal-
ity of power among the branches.
As custodians of Article I, we have a duty to
ensure the rigors of the Constitution are
upheld.
This includes that when the Second Branch,
Article II, flouts the investigative prerogatives
of the Congress, there must be recourse and
accountability.
As a senior member of the House Judiciary
Committee, I have to say that it is regrettable
that we are here.
This is because a hallmark of our constitu-
tional republic is that no person is above the
law.
Congressional oversight has been the tradi-
tion going back to the first years of our repub-
lic.
And the congressional prerogative of over-
sight has been a tool in the Article I arsenal
as a way of asserting our power and pro-
tecting against the worst excesses of an exec-
utive.
This comports with the founding of our gov-
ernment, which sought to prevent the con-
centration of power in an autocratic executive,
which was anathema to the Founders.
Which is why the events of the last many
months have been so confounding.
The decision by this executive to flout all
lawfully authorized subpoenas has been un-
precedented.
This dispute between the political branches
should work itself out, but because of this
presidential obstinacy, we are in this predica-
ment, which is why we must pass this H. Res
430, Authorizing Subpoena Enforcement Liti-
gation.
This Resolution, H. Res. 430, builds on the
House Judiciary Committee’s contempt finding
against Attorney General Barr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4421
June 11, 2019
The resolution authorizes the Committee to
seek civil enforcement of its subpoenas
against: (i) Attorney General Barr requiring
him to provide Congress with the key evi-
dence underlying the Mueller Report as well
as the unredacted report itself; and (ii) former
White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn, II
requiring him to provide documents and ap-
pear for testimony.
The resolution further affirms that all com-
mittee chairs, when authorized by the Bipar-
tisan Legal Advisory Group, retain the ability
to seek civil enforcement of their own sub-
poenas.
The resolution adds that when committees
proceed to court, they have any and all nec-
essary authority under Article I of the Constitu-
tion, ensuring that they have the maximum
range of legal authority available to them.
For example, on other key issues—such as
the Department of Justice defying a subpoena
to produce counter-intelligence documents re-
lating to Russia’s interference with the 2016
election, or the Commerce Department defying
a subpoena to produce documents relating to
the addition of a citizenship question to the
2020 Census—the committees can enforce
these subpoenas without a floor vote.
This resolution ensures the House can con-
duct meaningful oversight on issues critical to
Americans’ lives while continuing to deliver on
pocketbook issues.
The President’s disregard for congressional
oversight allows the Administration to cover-up
his many disastrous policy decisions such as:
attacking affordable healthcare coverage for
millions of Americans including those with pre-
existing conditions, tearing apart vulnerable
immigrant families, misappropriating military
funds for his ill-conceived border wall, and roll-
ing back landmark civil rights protections for
minorities.
The information subpoenaed by various
congressional committees, including docu-
ments and testimony, is information to which
Congress is constitutionally entitled and that
past Administrations have routinely provided.
President Trump has prevented fact wit-
nesses referenced in the Mueller Report from
testifying or providing documents to Congress.
This is despite the fact that the Report de-
tailed the Russian government’s sustained at-
tacks on our elections; over 170 contacts be-
tween President Trump’s campaign and asso-
ciates and agents of the Russian government;
as well as numerous efforts by President
Trump to impede or thwart House investiga-
tions scrutinizing his own conduct and that of
his Administration.
In keeping with the President’s sweeping
public refusal to comply with congressional
subpoenas, the White House and the Adminis-
tration are fighting to keep the truth from the
American people.
This resolution ensures we can conduct
oversight on issues that are critical to Ameri-
cans’ lives while continuing to deliver on pock-
etbook issues.
The information subpoenaed by various
congressional committees, including docu-
ments and testimony, is information Congress
is constitutionally entitled to and which past
Administrations have routinely provided.
Congress not only is constitutionally entitled
to the underlying evidence in the Special
Counsel’s Report and key fact witness testi-
mony, it requires this information so that it can
fulfill its legislative, oversight, and other con-
stitutional responsibilities.
This resolution follows past precedent used
by Democratic and Republican Majorities while
reinforcing an important principle in the House
Rules.
This Administration’s disregard for the legis-
lative and judicial branches has reached a tip-
ping point.
Despite representing a coequal branch of
government, this Administration is flagrantly
disregarding the role Congress and the Judici-
ary must play in our democratic system.
Mr. Speaker, the foregoing has been the
basis for this Resolution.
It was my hope that this was not needed.
But the President has proven me wrong,
which is why this Resolution is needed.
I urge passage of the Resolution.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE), a fellow Judiciary
Committee member.
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding time, and I
want to recognize the gentlewoman
from Texas for her remarks because, as
a fellow member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, we all stand for the rule of law.
I, too, carry a Constitution with me.
The Constitution explicitly creates a
system that is representative of the
people, where the people are elected by
their constituents to come up here and
represent their views in Congress and
vote for them. It is not to come up here
and to hand off control, to hand their
vote to the majority leader, to the
Speaker, and to the majority whip and
let them vote for them and for the peo-
ple of their district whether or not to
go to court.
The votes to enforce subpoenas, the
votes to hold in contempt should be
votes of the Representatives of the peo-
ple. That is why this resolution today
is such a travesty.
b 1545
Mr. Speaker, I have only been a
Member of this body for a few months,
and I was proud to be named a member
of the Judiciary Committee, but unfor-
tunately, the circus that I have wit-
nessed over the last few months is
shocking, as the Democratic majority
tries to find some reason, any reason,
to impeach this President now that the
Mueller investigation has wrapped up
with no crimes found.
If they want to go back and repeat
the last 2 years of the investigation,
the millions of dollars, the hundreds of
subpoenas, they are certainly entitled
to do that, but I would argue it would
be a waste of time for the American
taxpayer and the American people.
Mr. Speaker, we had a hearing earlier
today on the 9/11 Victim Compensation
Fund, and the chairman did a master-
ful job of arguing in favor of that legis-
lation, of which I am a cosponsor. It is
bipartisan legislation. It is going to be
marked up tomorrow. That is the way
that this Judiciary Committee should
operate.
Instead, we have hearings with
empty chairs for the Attorney General,
we have a hearing with an empty chair
for the White House counsel.
Finally, yesterday we had a hearing
with people in the seats, but they were
all MSNBC and CNN commentators.
Mr. Speaker, this is a travesty of jus-
tice. I would urge my colleagues to de-
feat this resolution.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the Committee on the
Judiciary is one of the most venerable
in the House of Representatives, and I
am honored to have been selected to
join its ranks.
It has jurisdiction over intellectual
property, during a time of exponential
scientific breakthroughs. It has juris-
diction over election interference, dur-
ing a time when we are concerned
about Russians interfering with our
election. It has jurisdiction over immi-
gration issues, during a time of an un-
precedented security and humanitarian
crisis on our southern border.
I am disappointed to see how the
Democratic majority has chosen to
waste this authority. I am disappointed
to see that it has chosen to ignore its
responsibilities to the American people
in favor of sound bites and photo ops.
Instead of legislating, the Demo-
cratic majority prefers posing with
buckets of fried chicken for the na-
tional media in crude attempts to un-
dermine our President and his adminis-
tration.
Really?
It is time to move on and tackle the
real issues that Americans care about.
The American people elected us, they
elected me, to Congress to get things
done. Let us secure the border. Let us
improve healthcare. Let us improve
education.
Let us stop this political theater that
happens meeting after meeting and
hearing after hearing in multiple com-
mittees in what I believe is a blatant
attempt to influence the 2020 presi-
dential election using taxpayer re-
sources.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have
no further speakers. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time I have left and
how much time the other side has left?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 1 minute remaining.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I am going to use my 1
minute to actually refute these blatant
allegations and fantasies, I believe, by
my fellow Democrats, and that is how
somehow the President and the Depart-
ment of Justice has been stonewalling
them.
Let me go over the timelines really
quick.
On March 22, the Attorney General
immediately notified the chairmen and
the ranking members of the House and
Senate Committees on Judiciary that
they had received the confidential re-
port from the special counsel.
VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:45 Jun 12, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A11JN7.008 H11JNPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4422 June 11, 2019
The next day, the Attorney General
informed Congress of the special coun-
sel’s principal conclusions.
March 29, he updated the Congress on
what could be done and what
redactions had to be made.
Then on April 18, less than a month
after receiving it, the Attorney Gen-
eral made the redacted confidential re-
port available to Congress and the en-
tire public.
The same day, the Attorney General
released the confidential report and
made the minimally-redacted version
of the confidential report available for
review.
Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ‘‘no’’
vote on this resolution, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the remainder of my time.
Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other
side have responded to this legislation
with the same old same old.
They are circling the wagons around
this President and his team. They are
deliberately turning a blind eye to the
corruption, to the deception, to the il-
legality that has surrounded this White
House.
But let me remind them all of why
we are here today. We are here because
the American people elected each of us
to write laws and to ensure those who
execute them are accountable.
We all took an oath when we were
sworn in to uphold and defend the Con-
stitution. That is our job.
None of us were sent here to play de-
fense for the President of the United
States.
There are some things that are more
important than politics, and I hope
that even in this day and age, there are
still some things that are more sacred
than partisanship, like the rule of law
and the separation of powers.
I mean, each of us took the same
oath. We now have a choice whether or
not to uphold it.
The choice should be a simple one: to
stand up to President Trump and to de-
fend the Constitution.
Mr. Speaker, I remember when many
of my Republican friends ran for office
claiming to be constitutional conserv-
atives. Well, this is their chance to
back up their campaign slogan with
their vote.
We have a President that publicly
states: ‘‘We’re fighting all the sub-
poenas.’’
And I don’t want people to testify.
Those are his words. Those are the
words of the President, not some mob
boss.
As we heard from the chairman of
the Oversight and Reform Committee,
Chairman CUMMINGS, the White House
hasn’t turned over a single document, a
single piece of paper that his com-
mittee has requested to do their over-
sight work, not one piece of paper.
At the core of this resolution is Con-
gress getting the appropriate docu-
ments, so we can do the appropriate
oversight. That is part of the job.
How can anybody be against that? To
be against that is to be part of the
coverup, is to be complicit with the ob-
struction that this White House dem-
onstrates each and every day.
Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues
that history will judge how we react to
this moment. So I urge all of my col-
leagues, do not let this moment pass us
by. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution, and
let’s hold the President accountable.
Nobody is above the law in the
United States of America, not even the
President of the United States.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to refrain from
engaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I urge
a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 431,
the previous question is ordered on the
resolution, as amended.
The question is on agreeing to the
resolution.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, on that I
demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-
minute vote on adoption of the resolu-
tion will be followed by a 5-minute vote
on the motion to suspend the rules and
pass H.R. 2609.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 229, nays

So (two-thirds being in the affirma-

bill was passed.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I was un-
able to vote on June 11, 2019 as I had an-
other commitment that did not allow me to
make it back to D.C. in time for votes. Had I
been present, I would have voted as follows:
‘‘no’’ on rollcall No. 245; ‘‘no’’ on rollcall No.
246; ‘‘no’’ on rollcall No. 247; and ‘‘yes’’ on
rollcall No. 248.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to
vote on June 11, 2019 because I was return-
ing to Washington, D.C. Had I been present to
vote, I would have voted YEA on H. Res.
430—Authorizing the Committee on the Judici-
ary to initiate or intervene in judicial pro-
ceedings to enforce certain subpoenas, and
YEA on H.R. 2609—DHS Acquisition Review
Board Act of 2019.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to ask unanimous consent that the
Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of
H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act, and ask for its
immediate consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, if this
unanimous consent request cannot be
entertained, I urge the Speaker and the
majority leader to immediately sched-
ule the Born-Alive bill because sur-
vivors of abortion deserve protection,
and the American people deserve a vote
on this bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not recognized for debate at
this time.
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. For
what purpose does the gentleman seek
recognition?
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the
Chair has previously advised, the re-
quest cannot be entertained absent ap-
propriate clearances.
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker?

The SPEAKER pro tempore. For
what purpose does the gentleman seek
recognition?

amongst us.

tleman has not been recognized for de-
bate.

LGBT PRIDE MONTH
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate LGBT Pride Month,
which occurs every June.
Pride Month is the time when the
LGBT community comes together to
celebrate their ability to live freely.
For many people across the country,
Pride events held in this month of June
are the occasion where they can ex-
press themselves freely in their com-
munity.
This year’s LGBT Pride Month
marks an important turning point in
LGBT history, the 50th anniversary of
the Stonewall uprising. While LGBT
Pride events today center on celebra-
tion of good times, they are rooted in
the LGBT community’s fight for sur-
vival.
Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago this
month, police raided the Stonewall
Inn, a gay bar in New York City. Raids
weren’t uncommon at the time, but
this time, the gay community rose up
in protest. They set off a national
movement of LGBT rights, which still
is going on today.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to cele-
brate these great strides in LGBT
rights in this country. I ask that my
colleagues join me in celebrating
LGBT Month and commit to protecting
the rights and safety of LGBT people.
f
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE GIRL
SCOUTS OF COLLIN COUNTY
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker,
today, I rise to congratulate 24 young
women from high schools across Plano,
Texas, who were presented with the
Gold Award by the Girls Scouts of
Northeast Texas for their dedication to
our community.
The most prestigious accolade to
earn, the Gold Award requires each
young woman to work tirelessly on a
community project of their choice for
up to 80 hours.
I want to thank each of these Girl
Scouts for their exemplary service
within Collin County and for dem-
onstrating that age should never deter
one from leading within their commu-
nity.
It is with pleasure I ask my col-
leagues to congratulate these young la-
dies on their success.
LET’S USE OUR POWER TO STOP
GUN VIOLENCE
(Mr. CRIST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I stand
before you 2 days before the third anni-
versary of the mass shooting at Pulse
nightclub in Orlando, Florida, to tell
this body, the people’s House, that we
have work to do.
The Pulse shooting shook us all to
our core, and for so many in the
LGBTQ community, these wounds may
never fully heal.
We honor the memory of those whose
lives were taken, but for those 49 peo-
ple, their families, and, importantly,
their chosen families, thoughts and
prayers will never be enough.
‘‘Orlando Strong’’ and ‘‘Never Again’’
are only words until we take action.
We are united by the power our con-
stituents have given to us to make
laws. We must use that power to stop
gun violence.
What does it say to the victims at
Pulse, Marjory Stoneman Douglas,
Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, Aurora, Vir-
ginia Beach, and too many others to
list? Do we not care?
Making life safer for our constituents
is not right versus left; it is right
versus wrong.
Madam Speaker, I urge action on this
national epidemic.
f
MEXICO’S COMMITMENT TO HELP-
ING SECURE OUR COMMON BOR-
DER
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to commend President
Trump on the early success in getting
Mexico to increase its commitment to
helping secure our common border.
There has been no shortage of doubt-
ers, perhaps even some who wished the
President would fail because he has
taken an approach that hasn’t been
tried before. But I thank the President
for his vision and for his commitment
to securing our southern border, which
has long been at crisis levels.
We are not done, by any means—we
must now ensure that Mexico honors
their commitments—but this is signifi-
cant progress that we haven’t seen yet
to this point.
If Mexico is true to their word, that
means House Democrats are now the
only ones preventing the U.S.-Mexico-
Canada Agreement from becoming a re-
ality. This agreement would be ex-
traordinarily beneficial for the Amer-
ican economy, and it is time to ratify
it here in this House.
I thank President Trump for apply-
ing pressure on Mexico and forcing
them to step up their efforts to secure
our border and trade.
f
HONORING HARRY YOA
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
Harry Yoa is a 101-year-old World War
II veteran. He is living in Ocean City,
New Jersey.
He was only 23 years old when he en-
listed in the Army in 1942, working as
a truck driver and newly married to his
wife, Valerie.
In the 321st Bombardment Group in
the 12th Air Force, Harry was stationed
in the south of France, where he com-
pleted 63 missions as an aerial engineer
and as a tail gunner.
He now, unfortunately, suffers from
dementia and doesn’t remember much
from the war, but he says he hasn’t for-
gotten the intensity of his missions,
where he was tasked with repairing the
aircraft and defending the craft
through the weapons in the rear of the
plane.
After the war, Harry was awarded
multiple medals and three Bronze
Stars for his service.
In the wake of the 75th anniversary
of D-day, we remember the sacrifices of
many Americans and the many Ameri-
cans who made them in World War II.
Harry is truly one of the great ones,
and God will bless him.
f
LIBERTY SHIPS
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to remember the
Liberty ships and those who built them
during World War II in Savannah,
Georgia.
Just after the U.S. entered the war,
the Maritime Commission awarded a
contract to the Southeastern Ship-
building Corporation to start building
cargo ships for military service.
The first completed ship was called
the USS Oglethorpe, named after the
city’s founder. By the end of the war,
46,000 employees had produced 88 Lib-
erty ships at the Savannah location.
These were America’s lifeline to the
war in Europe and the workhorses that
transferred necessary supplies back
and forth across the Atlantic Ocean
filled with dangerous obstacles.
Unfortunately, the USS Oglethorpe
was lost, torpedoed by a German U-
boat in 1943. Today, a model of that
ship stands at the Savannah trade cen-
ter to thank and remember all those
who served in the Savannah shipyards,
constantly working to help win the
war, as well as those ship captains who
risked their lives crossing the ocean.
This generation truly deserves the
name the Greatest Generation, and
with them rested the fate of the en-
tirety of Western civilization.
I am proud of this group in the First
Congressional District of Georgia and
their contribution to the effort during
World War II.

SUPPORTING ROHINGYA
REFUGEES
(Ms. OMAR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to speak out against the horri-
fying human rights abuses that our ad-
ministration fails to confront.
There are more than 1.3 million
Rohingya refugees who have fled the
genocide in Burma. About half a mil-
lion were driven out by a deliberate,
coordinated campaign by the Burmese
state to destroy Rohingya villages.
According to Human Rights Watch,
refugees who arrived in Bangladesh in
2018 reported continued abuses by Bur-
mese security forces, including
killings, arson, enforced disappear-
ances, extortion, severe restrictions on
movement, and lack of food and
healthcare.
They also reported sexual violence
and abduction of women and girls in
villages and at checkpoints along the
route to Bangladesh. Returnees to
Myanmar faced arrest and torture by
authorities.
There are more than 128,000 Rohingya
still in detention camps, where they
have been confined since 2012.
At its peak, Rohingya refugee reset-
tlement in the United States was 2,573
refugees in fiscal year 2015. That num-
ber has dropped to just 207 in fiscal
year 2019.
We are supporting Rohingya refugees
through funding programs in refugee
camps, but we must do more and help
them resettle here in the United
States.
f
INVESTIGATE FALSE ACCUSATION
(Mr. GAETZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, after
the Mueller report, we now know that
President Trump was falsely accused of
engaging in a criminal conspiracy with
Russia for 22 months. So the question
is, what to do now that we are aware of
that false accusation?
Democrats believe that the right ap-
proach is to tweeze through all the
President’s reactions to being falsely
accused. Republicans believe that we
should figure out what the root was of
the false accusations in the first place.
As we endeavor upon that work, we
see across the rotunda in the Senate
that harassment of the First Family
continues. Donald Trump, Jr., will be
hauled before a Senate committee to-
morrow because his prior testimony
purportedly conflicts with the testi-
mony of Mr. Gates and Mr. Cohen, peo-
ple who are either in prison for lying or
going to prison for lying.
It is past time to stop the harass-
ment of the President and the First
Family, acknowledge those who en-
gaged in false accusations for an ex-
tended period of time, and figure out
how in the world such an accusation
was able to be funded by the DNC,
cooked up in the Obama White House,
and then polluted by Russians.
We can do a lot better, and we are
going to figure out what happened.
f
CELEBRATING 50TH ANNIVERSARY
OF ‘‘APOLLO 11’’
(Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk
about an important achievement that
changed the world as we know it.
In just over a month, we will cele-
brate the 50th anniversary of the
Apollo 11 mission. On July 20th, 1969,
for the first time ever, human beings
walked on the Moon.
Apollo 11 was indeed a giant leap. It
inspired and continues to inspire gen-
erations to explore. The discoveries
and technology that come out of Amer-
ica’s investment in space not only help
us better understand the universe but
fundamentally change our modern life.
Apollo 11 is one of America’s greatest
achievements, and I am proud to work
with my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle, as well as in both the House and
the Senate, on resolutions that com-
memorate and celebrate this achieve-
ment.
Celebrating the Apollo 11 mission en-
sures that future generations will not
just remember, but also take us further
into space exploration.
As a lifelong Oklahoman, I also want
to acknowledge the unique contribu-
tions of Oklahoma astronauts. In each
week leading up to the Apollo 11 mis-
sion celebration, I will highlight Okla-
homans who shaped our knowledge and
discovery within space.
f
THANKING AMERICANS FOR
SPEAKING AGAINST CONGRES-
SIONAL PAY RAISES
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to thank the American people
for sending a message to this Congress
that they do not want the pay raises
for Members of Congress to go through.
However, their work is not done, and
they need to keep it up.
They have successfully delayed the
Legislative Branch appropriations bill
from being considered as part of this
omnibus bill that is going to be consid-
ered tomorrow, but it has only been de-
layed. It hasn’t been removed just yet,
so stay on the phones, stay on the
emails, and stay on Facebook.
Get in contact with Members of Con-
gress to let them know that their con-
stituents don’t think that they deserve
a pay raise. They have more work to
do. There is much to be done, in terms
of addressing the crisis at the border
and continuing in the economic success
that we have. Instead, we have many
committees that are holding officials
in contempt of Congress.
We have more to do, so I ask the
American people to keep up the great
work.
f
DEBATE OUT-OF-CONTROL
SPENDING
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, at the
start of this Congress, the new Demo-
cratic majority promised that legisla-
tion would be considered under regular
order. Six months into Congress, it is
evident that that promise has been
abandoned altogether.
Instead, the majority has used a pro-
cedural tactic to set spending levels
and circumvent the normal budget
process. There is now no sign of a 2020
budget resolution coming before the
House to set spending levels, so the full
House has no opportunity to debate
these levels as a standalone bill.
The national debt exceeded $22 tril-
lion this year. The American people ex-
pect us to debate and vote on a budget
that will outline the direction of our
Nation. However, without having
passed the budget, the House will con-
sider a massive spending bill this week
that combines five appropriations bills.
Altogether, the package includes near-
ly $1 trillion in spending. Members will
take this vote to spend with no plan or
agreement between the House and Sen-
ate on an overall budget.
I call on the majority to follow
through on its promise of regular order
and bring a budget before the House so
that we can debate the out-of-control
spending and how it can be reined in
and reined in now.

CHAOS ON THE SOUTHERN BOR-
DER AND CROWDSOURCING ENVI-
RONMENTAL DATA
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
PORTER). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
SCHWEIKERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker,
just so staff knows, this will probably
be a bit abbreviated because of all the
chaos we have going on around us.
There is something I wanted to start
with. Typically, we come to the floor
to spend time talking about what is
happening in the country economically
and demographically and what we must
do to keep our promises. I sit on the
Ways and Means Committee, and I do
trade and tax policy.
Before we put that up, I need to
touch on something that is incredibly
frustrating. Being from Arizona, obvi-
ously, we have a border issue. We talk
about it; we do nothing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4426 June 11, 2019
How many have seen the news in the
last couple of days that we have gun
battles going on just south of Douglas,
Arizona? We may have 9 or 10 people
who have lost their lives. We had a
teenager get hit by a stray bullet. We
have had a couple of folks—apparently,
one crawled to the border and is now in
an Arizona hospital. A couple are in
Arizona hospitals.
Where is the press? Where is the dis-
cussion of what is going on? Appar-
ently, we have a war going on in Agua
Prieta, just south of Douglas, between
these cartels that not only move drugs,
but they also exploit human beings.
These are the very cartels that are
taking humans, smuggling them and
trafficking them up to the border.
They are using assault weapons and
killing each other. Of course, we would
care about that, wouldn’t we? Except it
doesn’t get any news here because it
doesn’t fit the narrative.
If you love and care for people, could
we at least have an honest discussion
of what the President has asked for,
with some money for humanitarian aid
to take care of those who have pre-
sented themselves at the border for ref-
ugee status? Understand the violence
that is spilling over into my State of
Arizona and what is going on.
I guess I come to this microphone
just frustrated that this story broke
yesterday in Arizona. Where is the na-
tional outcry? Where is the national
understanding of the chaos that is hap-
pening along our southern border and
the lives that are being lost? Do we or
do we not care about people?
There were two things I wanted to
do, and I know we are up against a very
tight time, so I am just going to do one
of them.
We have this theory that basically
says, if you look at U.S. demographics,
in 8.5 years, it is two workers, one re-
tiree. In 8.5 years, 50 percent of the
budget from this body, less interest,
will be to those 65 and older.
Demographics aren’t Republican.
They are not Democratic. They are
math.
We must do a number of things to
keep the economic vitality of this soci-
ety going if we are going to keep our
promises. One of those things in our
five points is the way we deal with reg-
ulations. We have this one area we talk
about, whether it be tax policy, trade
policy, or regulatory policy. Just in a
couple of minutes here, I wanted to ex-
plain what smart regulation is.
So often when hearing the rhetoric,
we will have: Well, we need to deregu-
late. We need to reregulate.
That is wrong. We all walk around
with these supercomputers in our pock-
ets. It turns out, technology is the ra-
tional place where regulation should
go.
Here is my thought experiment. Let’s
use our own neighborhoods. We are the
businesses in those neighborhoods. We
need to get air quality permits for
manufacturing. Does filling out a
bunch of paper and shoving it in file
cabinets make air quality cleaner in
our neighborhoods? Do file cabinets
full of paperwork at the local, county,
State, wherever our regulators are,
does that make the air quality in our
communities better? Of course not. It
just creates a lot of documents so that
we have someone to sue for the trial
lawyers and those things.
I want to propose the concept of
crowdsourcing environmental informa-
tion, particularly for air quality. It
turns out, we are living in a time
where there are now sensors we can at-
tach to our phones that are highly ac-
curate that will do PM10, hydro-
carbons, and volatile organics. What
would happen in our communities if we
were willing to take this tradeoff?
We are not going to make everyone
fill out lots of paperwork. We are going
to promote businesses, let them grow.
But here is the trick: If they screw up,
we catch them instantly.
Also, the clowns painting cars behind
everyone’s houses in their backyards,
we are going to catch them, too.
This thought is very simple. We have
a YouTube cartoon that is about 1.5
minutes that walks through this con-
cept of crowdsourcing environmental
data. It shows that it is time to use
this type of technology. Think of the
economic growth tradeoff.
We are not going to fill up file cabi-
nets full of paperwork. Because we are
going to be crowdsourcing environ-
mental data, when there is a bad actor,
or someone’s scrubbers are out of com-
pliance, or there are clowns painting
cars in backyards, we will catch them
instantly.
Wouldn’t that be a lot more powerful,
where environmental regulators of
communities, States, and counties are
now a quick reaction force that goes to
where the bad acts are happening in-
stead of basically being paperwork
domiciles?
That is an example of smart regula-
tion. It makes communities healthier.
It makes air quality better. It still has
businesses growing because they are
not buried under consultants and
mounds of paper. That is an example of
smart regulation.
How do we drag this institution into
understanding the incredible opportu-
nities that technology is bringing in
crashing the price of healthcare and
making the environment healthier? In
the coming weeks, I am going to come
back to dive into this much deeper, but
let me salt the mine a little bit for a
thought experiment.
What would happen if we had tech-
nology that could protect houses of
worship, schools, this body, and public
buildings? It turns out that it exists
today.
I want to propose that this body put
together an XPRIZE for nonlethal pro-
tection of our buildings and our houses
of worship. We already know there are
experiments out there with pods that
go on the wall, so if someone comes in
and is engaged in a bad act or dis-
charges a firearm, instantly, just like
the Taser darts, it lays them down.
Yes, innocent people will get hit with
them, but they don’t die.
It turns out that there are tech-
nology solutions that will make us
safer.
b 1700
How do we drag the conversations
around this place to understand there
are really great, exciting opportunities
for all of us out there, whether it be in
smart regulation, whether it be the end
of killing using technology, whether it
be the fact we are about to get dra-
matically healthier, and that the cures
that are about to come on the market
for diseases that have been with us for
so long, we are in a time of amazing
disruption?
How do we future-proof our policies,
and how do we get this body to stop
thinking everything is either Democrat
or Republican, but understand there
are actual solutions, you just have to
be forward-thinking with technology?
With that, Madam Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.

Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor
of Pride Month, I would like to honor
Dr. George Wallace.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4427
June 11, 2019
Dr. George Wallace was born in New
Hampshire and moved to central Flor-
ida in 1992. He returned to New England
in 1995, and after finishing his under-
graduate degree, he returned to Florida
in 2002.
George spent the first half of his ca-
reer advocating and working with per-
sons with disabilities as a case man-
ager and later turned his passion for
arts into a career as a senior leader of
the Orlando Fringe.
During the Pulse tragedy, George
was serving on the board of the LGBT+
Center of Orlando. Knowing that he
wanted to continue serving his commu-
nity, he accepted the role as executive
director of The Center in Orlando in
2017. Dr. Wallace has since grown the
organization to include a programming
center at its satellite office in Kis-
simmee in our district.
George is a very visible leader within
central Florida and enjoys travel, pho-
tography, and cheering on the Boston
Red Sox in his free time.
For that, Dr. George Wallace, we
honor you.
HONORING ERIC ROLLINGS DURING PRIDE MONTH
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor
of Pride Month, I would like to honor
Eric Rollings.
After 30 years of change, of loss, and
of victories, Eric Rollings continues to
be one of the most active and visible
LGBT leaders in Orange County.
Eric started volunteering at the Hope
and Help Center in the early 1990s be-
cause he witnessed the injustices and
stigma that his friends suffered from
HIV/AIDS as they were dealing with it
every day. In 1993, he was awarded the
Volunteer of the Year for his dedica-
tion.
In the present day, Eric is serving his
sixth term on the Community Develop-
ment Block Grant Board and helps se-
cure funding for the LGBT+ Center of
central Florida and helps make rec-
ommendations for housing and services
for people living with HIV/AIDS and
low- to moderate-income households in
the Orlando area.
In Eric’s early small business career
he was discriminated against for being
gay. He saw an opportunity to help
educate other business entrepreneurs
and worked to provide a safe business
environment. With that, he helped
grow the Metropolitan Business Asso-
ciation, the LGBT Chamber of Com-
merce, serving on the board of direc-
tors twice.
Eric, with many of his friends and ac-
tivist allies, was instrumental in pass-
ing ordinances and protections for the
LGBT people of the city of Orlando and
Orange County. In the early days,
nothing was certain, but because they
did not give up on Orlando and Orange
County, today our home is one of the
most inclusive, welcoming, and eco-
nomically vibrant areas in the Nation.
After the Pulse tragedy, all of Or-
lando came together and became Or-
lando United. Eric was honored with an
Orlando United Medal from Mayor Te-
resa Jacobs. Eric was elected as one of
the first openly LGBT people to serve
in an Orange County-wide position. He
worked as chairman of our Soil and
Water Conservation Board. He con-
tinues to work now politically to im-
prove our environment and to stand up
for equality for all, including a ban on
conversion therapy.
For that, Mr. Eric Rollings, we honor
you.
HONORING RICARDO NEGRON-ALMODOVAR
DURING PRIDE MONTH.
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor
of Pride Month, I would like to honor
Ricardo Negron-Almodovar.
Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Ri-
cardo obtained a master’s degree in
education, a juris doctorate, and is a li-
censed attorney in Puerto Rico.
In 2015 Ricardo moved from Yauco,
Puerto Rico, to Orlando, Florida. Dur-
ing his first year in Florida, he taught
English to adults and became involved
in civic engagement efforts to register
new voters.
After the Pulse tragedy on June 12,
2016, of which he is a survivor, Ricardo
worked to empower the LGBTQ Latinx
community and has advocated against
discrimination and gun violence. Ri-
cardo currently serves as a legal serv-
ice coordinator for LatinoJustice
where he has had the opportunity to
assist those transitioning from Puerto
Rico to Florida after Hurricane Maria
devastated my family’s native island.
Recently Ricardo obtained a master’s
degree in nonprofit management and
launched the community organization
Del Ambiente, which is an effort led by
the LGBTQ Puerto Rican community
to build up the LGBTQ Puerto Rican
community in Florida’s activism in en-
vironmental work.
For that, Ricardo Negron-Almodovar,
we honor you.
HONORING KAREN CASTELLOES DURING PRIDE
MONTH
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor
of Pride Month, I would like to honor
Karen Castelloes.
In 1971, Karen graduated from the
University of Cincinnati with a BA in
Spanish. After moving to Orlando in
1975, she attained her master’s degree
in education from Nova University and
was employed by Orange County Public
Schools as an English to Speakers of
Other Languages teacher, an ESOL
teacher, for 31 years.
She retired in 2007 and became in-
volved in volunteer work. She is the
cofounder of the Jefferson R. Voss

you.
HONORING DAVID ARTHUR JONES DURING PRIDE
MONTH
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor
of Pride Month, I would like to honor
David Arthur Jones.
David Arthur Jones, son of Mary Lou
Jones and the late Arthur Henderson
Jones, Jr. was born and raised in a
union household in upstate New York.
The environment of David’s upbringing
provided a foundation of values associ-
ated with human rights to which he
has been largely committed to over the
course of his lifetime.
After surviving a raucous adoles-
cence, David served with the United
States Jaycees and the New York
Young Democrats and was awarded the
prestigious Governorship Award which
confers an honorary lifetime member-
ship. Among his proudest works was
the establishment of a spacious town
park in Whitestown, New York.
David went on to enroll at the Mo-
hawk Valley Community College and
Utica College of Syracuse University
where he earned his degree in occupa-
tional therapy.
Together, John and David moved to
Lake Wales, Florida, in 2004, in Flor-
ida’s Ninth Congressional District. As
a committeeman, David incorporated
LGBT issues as part of meetings of the
Polk County Democratic Committee.
In 2001, David and his life partner,
John, officially certified their love for
each other by virtue of marriage in
Utica, New York. David and John
spearheaded the effort to establish the
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender,
and Allies Democratic Caucus of Polk
County. In that same year, David be-
came a Florida LGBTA Democratic
Caucus regional director serving six
counties, including Polk, Lake, Osce-
ola, Orange, Seminole, and Volusia
County, of which I am proud to rep-
resent much of that area.
David is now in his fifth term serving
as the area’s regional director. Cur-
rently David Jones is focusing on se-
curing all-inclusive human rights ordi-
nances in municipalities within Polk
County. Thus far, David has spoken be-
fore the commissions of three Polk
County cities and has recruited a num-
ber of supporters to do the same in the
quest to secure fundamental rights for
all, and our office has helped in that ef-
fort.
David is extremely grateful for the
public support that has been given by
Florida House Representative Sam Kil-
lebrew and our office, Team Soto, to-
wards securing all-inclusive human
rights ordinances, securing the effort
as being one of bipartisanship.
For that, David Arthur Jones, we
honor you.
HONORING ANTHONY H. SANDONATO DURING
PRIDE MONTH
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor
of Pride Month, I would like to honor
Anthony H. Sandonato.
Anthony is a proud Orlando resident,
human resources executive, LGBTQ
community advocate, and a member of
the Human Rights Campaign’s national
board of governors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4428 June 11, 2019
Originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-
vania, Anthony currently resides with
his husband, Tracer Foster, in down-
town Orlando, Florida.
After completing his bachelor’s de-
gree in education from Edinboro Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, Anthony relo-
cated to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in
1995 to pursue his career. It was there
that he took on his first role in human
resources with a Miami-based retailer.
Anthony began volunteering to effect
change for the LGBT community. He
took on volunteer leadership roles with
south Florida’s volunteer committee
for the Human Rights Campaign, the
Nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy
group and political lobbying organiza-
tion in the United States.
Anthony volunteered through HRC to
protect Miami-Dade’s hard-won human
rights ordinance and to attempt to
stop the passage of Florida’s 2008
amendment which ultimately banned
gay marriage and civil unions in that
State until 2015.
At the Federal level, Anthony cham-
pioned HRC’s efforts in south Florida
to achieve the passage of the Matthew
Shepard Hate Crimes Act, the repeal of
the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, and
the decade-long effort to pass the Em-
ployment Nondiscrimination Act, oth-
erwise known as ENDA.
Anthony moved to Orlando in 2012.
Shortly after relocating, he joined
HRC’s Orlando/central Florida volun-
teer committee and continued his
LGBTQ advocacy as a political and
community engagement leader. His
focus in central Florida has been to
continue his efforts to influence policy
by coordinating local get-out-the-vote
campaigns and by working with com-
munity leaders and Members of the
House and Senate for repeal of the cur-
rent administration’s transgender mili-
tary ban and the passage of the Equal-
ity Act, which I am proud, Madam
Speaker, we passed out of this House
earlier this year.
For that, Anthony H. Sandonato, we
honor you.
HONORING NIKOLE PARKER DURING PRIDE
MONTH
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor
of Pride Month, I would like to honor
Nikole Parker.
Nikole Parker is a transgender
woman of Puerto Rican, Italian, and
African American descent. She was
born and raised in Orlando, Florida,
and at the age of 19 left her job and her
home to begin her transition. After 3
years of black-market hormones and
unsafe lifestyle practices she came
back to Orlando to restart her life.
Nikole’s passion in advocating for
the rights and dignity of transgender
and gender-nonconforming community
is legendary in central Florida. She
currently works for onePULSE Foun-
dation as the event and community
outreach coordinator. Nikole also sits
on various nonprofit boards within the
community, including the LGBT+ Cen-
ter and the Orlando United Assistance
Center.

cused on community building and ad-
vocacy efforts for the central Florida
transgender community.
In 2018, Nikole was honored with the
Humanitarian of the Year Award by
the Miss Glamorous Pageant for her
ongoing advocacy and empowerment of
the transgender community and work
with the onePULSE Foundation.
She hopes to educate individuals
from the community on healthy and
safe ways to undergo transition, pro-
viding resources so black-market hor-
mones and unsafe lifestyles can be
avoided.
For that, Nikole Parker, we honor
you.

HONORING DIEUSEUL BERTO DURING CARIBBEAN
HERITAGE MONTH
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor
of Caribbean Heritage Month, I would
like to honor Dieuseul Berto.
Dieuseul Berto is a Haitian American
immigrant who was a former kick
boxer and founder of Tiger’s World
Martial Arts and Boxing Fitness,
founded in Winter Haven, Florida, in
Florida’s Ninth Congressional District.
He competed in the UFC.
Berto was known as the man who
helped so many people. He was recog-
nized for his conception of a cardio-
vascular weight loss training program.
Although Berto was injured in a hor-
rendous car accident that left him in a
wheelchair for over a year, he did not
let the accident define or confine him.
Therefore, Dieuseul Berto began cre-
ating ways to self-train in his wheel-
chair by including pushups and the use
of a punching bag, which served as a
catalyst for his cardio program. He
then incorporated those techniques
used in the workout.
Berto’s fitness program is credited
with helping more than 1,200 people
gain access to better health by shed-
ding unwanted and unhealthy pounds,
resulting in lowering blood pressure
and cholesterol concerns over the past
20 years. He is considered a pioneer in
helping people with their health and,
consequently, their self-confidence.
He was also a family man who helped
many kids and tried to keep them out
of trouble with his kids program. Berto
also mentored children and encouraged
them to never sell themselves short by
reiterating that any dream is possible
and attainable with hard work and
dedication. He is credited with teach-
ing children to set larger-than-life ex-
pectations for themselves.
He interacted, impacted, and inspired
people from all aspects of life.
Berto and his wife are the parents of
seven children, including Andre Berto,
a two-time former welterweight world
champion; Edson and Revelina, who are
also professional mixed martial artists;
and his son Cleveland, who is an actor.
Madam Speaker, for that, we honor
Dieuseul Berto.

HONORING SHELLEY BRIGGS DURING CARIBBEAN
HERITAGE MONTH
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor
of Caribbean Heritage Month, I would
like to honor Shelley Briggs.
Shelley Ann Briggs was born in Lon-
don, England, on July 5 to the late
Joan Ann Grant. Joan had migrated to
London from Georgetown, Guyana, to
complete her studies, and, due to hard-
ships, Shelley was sent to Georgetown,
Guyana, to live with her grandmother
when she was a baby.
Seeking better opportunities and a
better life for her family, her grand-
mother migrated to the United States
of America when Shelley was 4 years
old, soon settling in Brooklyn, New
York.
As a child growing up, Shelley was
raised under Guyanese traditions and
customs, and, even though she lived in
Brooklyn, the neighborhood reflected
the West Indian culture Shelley grew
to admire.
Shelley attended several private
schools and graduated from Catherine
McAuley High School. During this
time, she also became a U.S. citizen
through the help of her mother, who
had joined the family in the U.S. when
Shelley was 10 years old.
After high school, Shelley made the
decision to join the United States
Army after attending college for one
semester. Shelley then relocated to
Florida to help take care of her moth-
er, who had been diagnosed with can-
cer.
While in Florida, her mother intro-
duced her to the Caribbean and Flo-
ridian Association, and soon Shelley
became a member. She has served
CAFA in a variety of capacities over
the last 20 years, and currently she is
chairperson for the Service and Edu-
cation Committee.
She is currently employed as a dean
at Gateway High School, located in
Osceola County School District in
Florida’s Ninth Congressional District.
Shelley’s life passion has always been
children, and there has been a special
place in her heart for children whose
parents left their home country and
came to the United States in search of
a better life for their family.
Shelley is happily married to Dennis
Briggs and is the proud mother to
Jada; Jourard; Dennis, Jr.; and
Deyonce.
Madam Speaker, for that, we honor
Mrs. Shelley Briggs.

ance of my time.

The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was

tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Hear our prayer, O Lord. Thank You
for Your love and mercy that comes
fresh daily. You keep us from dwelling
in darkness, illuminating our path
with the light of Your wisdom. Today,
open the eyes of our lawmakers to the
wonders of Your grace. May they see
the majesty of Your inclusive love for
people everywhere. Inspire our Sen-
ators to behold the works You are al-
ready doing to heal our Nation.
Lord, deliver us from all of the de-
structive forces that hinder us from
doing Your will, for we find our shelter
in You. Teach us to fulfill Your pur-
poses on Earth as we strive to bring
honor to Your Name.
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa is
recognized.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business for 30 seconds.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f
FOREIGN THREATS TO TAXPAYER-
FUNDED RESEARCH
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President,
last week, I held a hearing on foreign
threats to taxpayer-funded research,
and a classified briefing was held on
the very same subject. We learned a
great deal of information regarding the
very real and ongoing threat from for-
eign governments to U.S. research.
Congress must continue its oversight
to ensure that the Federal Government
has the right mix of authorities as well
as focus to protect our research and in-
tellectual property. The government
spends billions and billions of dollars a
year on research. Congress and the ex-
ecutive branch have a responsibility to
the taxpayers to get the job done.
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER

f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. This week, the
Senate is making more progress in the
personnel business. Since returning to
more prompt consideration for
unobjectionable, lower level nominees,
we are continuing to fill important va-
cancies around the executive branch
and on the Federal bench.
Yesterday we confirmed several more
well-qualified nominees to important
seats on the Federal judiciary—Ryan
Holte of Ohio and Richard Hertling of
Maryland to the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims and Rossie David Alston, of Vir-
ginia, to the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia. These
brandnew judges possess impressive
legal and academic credentials.
In the case of Mr. Holte, who taught
law school for several years, 125 former
students wrote our colleagues on the
Judiciary Committee to say their
former professor would ‘‘provide impar-
tial, unbiased, and principled decisions,
and will apply the law faithfully no
matter the litigants.’’
That is exactly what this body
should look for in every nominee we
consider for the Federal bench. So I am
glad we will have the opportunity this
week to consider six more distin-
guished judicial nominees.
First up today will be Sarah Daggett
Morrison, tapped by the President to
serve the Southern District of Ohio.
Ms. Morrison is a graduate of Ohio
State University and Capital Univer-
sity Law School. Earlier this year, the
Judiciary Committee reported her
nomination favorably on a voice vote.
After Ms. Morrison’s nomination is
confirmed, we will turn to consider
Pamela Barker for the Northern Vir-
ginia District of Ohio, Corey Maze for
the Northern District of Alabama, Rod-
ney Smith for the Southern District of
Florida, Thomas Barber for the Middle
District of Florida, and Jean-Paul
Boulee for the Northern District of
Georgia.
Following them, we will fill two more
executive branch vacancies, one each
at the State Department and in the
diplomatic corps. I hope my colleagues
will join me in voting to confirm each
of these nominees with strong bipar-
tisan support on the floor.
f
HONG KONG
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on an entirely different matter, like
many of my colleagues, I watched im-
ages from Hong Kong this weekend and
could not help but be moved by the
residents of that metropolis. They are
mounting a bold stand to preserve
Hong Kong’s autonomy from China
and, by extension, defend their lib-
erties.
Over the weekend, more than 1 mil-
lion residents, a staggering proportion
of the population—about one in seven—
took to the streets to protest a draft
law that would allow the people of
Hong Kong to be extradited to main-
land China. Hong Kong residents right-
ly view this measure as another ero-
sion of the rule of law and tightening
of Beijing’s grip on their imperiled au-
tonomy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3300 June 11, 2019
These are not just students or law-
yers or intellectuals who have taken to
the streets but a broad cross-section of
Hong Kong’s diverse society—all age
groups, all professions, all walks of
life—all committed to preserving the
personal freedoms and judicial inde-
pendence that have made Hong Kong
such a special and prosperous city.
The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992,
which I sponsored, has, for nearly three
decades, enshrined America’s commit-
ment to preserving Hong Kong’s special
status and its freedoms. This draft law
is inconsistent with the Hong Kong
Policy Act and puts Hong Kong on the
path of becoming just another one of
China’s cities subject to Beijing’s
whims.
As the Vice President stated last au-
tumn, ‘‘For a time, Beijing inched to-
ward greater liberty and respect for
human rights. But in recent years,
China has taken a sharp U-turn toward
control and oppression of its own peo-
ple.’’
I regret that reports from Guangdong
to Xinjiang continue to prove him
right as Beijing’s grip on its own peo-
ple grows tighter, even as the rest of
the world marks its 30th anniversary of
the violence in Tiananmen Square.
I encourage the administration to
stay engaged and express our concerns
with the authorities in Hong Kong be-
fore this proposal becomes law and the
Chinese Communist Party further ex-
tends its control over the people of
Hong Kong.
f
TARIFFS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on one final matter, last week’s an-
nouncement of progress in negotiations
with Mexico was a welcome develop-
ment. It staved off the threat that tar-
iffs would disrupt an important trading
relationship and secured a promise
that Mexican authorities will take
more responsibility for their own bor-
ders, but, as I said yesterday, while
this was a critical step, it does not ab-
solve Congress of our duty to finally
act—not even close.
It was May 1 when the administra-
tion first transmitted to Congress its
urgent request for supplemental border
funding. That will be 6 weeks ago to-
morrow that the administration set up
a request for supplemental funding for
the crisis at the border—6 weeks—and
this emergency request is essentially
falling on deaf ears among our Demo-
cratic colleagues.
In the meantime, we should note that
the month of May marks a third
straight month with more than 100,000
individuals apprehended at the south-
ern border. In fact, last month’s total
of more than 140,000 was the largest in
the last 13 years of CBP data.
By the way, that includes more than
84,000 family units and more than 11,000
unaccompanied children. These are
enormous numbers of people showing
up at our border. The American per-
sonnel who are charged with securing
our Nation and looking after these in-
dividuals are simply overwhelmed. The
agencies are overwhelmed. The facili-
ties are overwhelmed. It is a true hu-
manitarian crisis, totally
unsustainable for these individuals for
whom our national security and rule of
law dictate that we need to detain.
At overcrowded facilities, beds are in
short supply, medical care is wearing
thin, money and personnel from across
the Department of Homeland Security
are being diverted from other impor-
tant missions on an emergency basis to
cover shortfalls, but even that cannot
go on much longer.
This is from John Sanders, the Act-
ing Commissioner of Customs and Bor-
der Control. He said: ‘‘We are at a full-
blown emergency . . . the system is
broken.’’ The system is broken—that
from the head of Customs and Border
Patrol.
The professionals whom our Nation
has entrusted to keep America safe and
care for these people have been beg-
ging—literally begging—for more re-
sources for 6 weeks. Their calls have
solidified a national consensus that
spans the entire political spectrum.
More than 1 month ago, the editorial
board of the New York Times—not
what you call devoted admirers of the
Trump administration—wrote an edi-
torial they titled—listen to this head-
line: ‘‘Congress, Give Trump His Border
Money.’’
That is the New York Times. They
wrote:
Something needs to be done. Soon. [But]
unfortunately, political gamesmanship once
again threatens to hold up desperately need-
ed resources.
That was the New York Times in
early May, at the time both Houses of
Congress were negotiating the supple-
mental funding bill for recent natural
disasters, but Democrats chose to come
down to the left of the New York
Times’ editorial pages—that is pretty
hard to do—and decided to deny the
White House this border money.
One Member of the House Democratic
conference complained that the need
for border money was ‘‘political.’’ Po-
litical.
Another House Democrat admitted to
reporters that his own side was the
problem. This is what he said: ‘‘In my
opinion, we do have to come up with
some money. But we’ve got to convince
our more progressive friends.’’
Again, these are not resources for
any remotely controversial cause. We
are talking about humanitarian fund-
ing for caring for families and children
who show up at the border in need of
help. That is what we are talking
about. This is not a subject where the
political left should need week after
week of convincing, but apparently our
liberal colleagues just could not get
past their animosity for the President,
even on something like this.
During these last 6 weeks, the House
has found plenty of time and energy for
purely partisan things. There has been
plenty of histrionics and political the-
ater. We have seen hearing room melo-
drama. We have seen some partisan
messaging votes. We have seen plenty
of political theater, opposing the Presi-
dent for the sake of opposing him.
They have had time for all of that but
nothing—nothing—for the urgent bor-
der crisis.
So, May 5, the New York Times:
‘‘Congress, Give Trump His Border
Money.’’
May 23, ‘‘Democrats balked at allo-
cating billions of dollars more toward
border security.’’
June 9, very recently: ‘‘When Will
Congress Get Serious About the Suf-
fering at the Border?’’ Two New York
Times editorials say: Give Trump the
money for the border crisis. This is
breathtaking—the alliance between the
New York Times editorial board and
the Trump administration being ig-
nored by our Democratic colleagues.
So look, the question we have been
asking ourselves every day as the
House continues to ignore this crisis is,
What is the problem here?
I suspect it is the question men and
women we ask to secure the border are
asking one another every day. When
will our Democratic colleagues get se-
rious about this?
Believe me, we know that our Demo-
cratic counterparts are not charter
members of Donald Trump’s personal
fan club. We get that. They have made
that abundantly clear over and over
again. Their entire political agenda
these days seems to be repeating that
fact nice and loud, over and over again
in case we hadn’t already heard it.
We are all plenty familiar with ‘‘the
resistance.’’ We have seen that here in
the Senate. That is why we have had so
many nominations clogged up. But,
look, ‘‘the resistance’’ doesn’t pay the
bills. ‘‘The resistance’’ doesn’t produce
the funding that the border facilities
desperately need. ‘‘The resistance’’
doesn’t plug the holes in our Nation’s
border security or improve humani-
tarian conditions down on the border.
There is only one way to fix this—bi-
partisan legislation with supplemental
border funding. That is what we need
to do.
So for everyone’s sake, I think the
entire country is hoping that Demo-
crats remember their job is governing,
not resisting. It is far past time to get
serious about this and solve this prob-
lem.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

YEAR-ROUND SALE OF E15
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I
came to the floor last week to talk
about the challenges facing farmers
right now. While the broader economy
is thriving, a combination of low com-
modity prices, protracted trade dis-
putes, and natural disasters and weath-
er-related issues have left many farm-
ers and ranchers struggling.
In my home State of South Dakota,
farmers and ranchers are dealing with
the aftermath of severe winter storms,
heavy rainfall, bomb cyclones, and
spring flooding. Planting is behind
schedule, and many farmers will not be
able to plant at all this year. Yet,
while the news has generally been
tough for farmers and ranchers lately,
there are a couple of recent happenings
that are worth celebrating.
Japan’s announcement that it was
lifting age limits on U.S. beef imports
is a win for America’s ranchers, who
will be able to substantially increase
their sales to Japan. Also, the adminis-
tration’s move to lift the ban on the
year-round sale of E15—15-percent eth-
anol-blended fuel—went live in the
Federal Register yesterday. This is
great news for corn producers in South
Dakota and around the Nation.
I have been advocating for higher
blends of ethanol for more than a dec-
ade, and I have spent a lot of time ad-
vocating for the year-round sale of E15.
Year-round E15 is a win-win-win-win
situation. It is a win for consumers and
for our economy. It is a win for the en-
vironment. It is a win for our Nation’s
energy security. It is also a big win for
our Nation’s agriculture industry.
Year-round E15 will not only provide
consumers with a cheaper alternative
at the pump, but it will keep gas prices
lower. Plus, the year-round sale of E15
means more ethanol can be sold each
year, for gas stations will have a great-
er incentive to sell E15 now that they
will no longer have to go through the
costly process of reworking and re-
labeling E15 pumps at the start of the
summer’s driving season and then of
converting them back in the fall. In-
creased demand will fuel further
growth in the ethanol industry, which
already supports hundreds of thousands
of U.S. jobs and contributes tens of bil-
lions of dollars to our economy.
Year-round sales of E15 are also a win
for our environment in that ethanol is
a cleaner burning fuel than is regular
gasoline, which means fewer green-
house gas emissions. In fact, ethanol
reduces greenhouse gas emissions by
more than one-third. Biofuels like eth-
anol are key to there being a lower car-
bon energy future, and the next genera-
tion of advanced biofuels will further
lower emissions.
Another major advantage to ethanol
is that it diminishes our dependence on
foreign oil. Ethanol is a homegrown
fuel, and the more we are producing
here at home the less we have to rely
on unstable countries or far-off sources
to meet our fuel needs.
Finally, of course, the year-round
sale of E15 is a big win for our Nation’s
corn producers. America’s farmers
don’t just feed our country. They help
fuel it, too. Roughly half of the corn
produced in my home State of South
Dakota goes into ethanol production.
Increased demand for ethanol as a re-
sult of the administration’s decision
could boost demand for corn by up to 2
billion bushels. That would be a signifi-
cant boost to U.S. corn producers at
any point, but it is an especially big
deal given the challenges the agri-
culture sector has faced over the past
several years.
U.S. corn producers are one of the
main reasons I have been a relentless
advocate for higher blends of ethanol,
and I am very happy the President has
delivered on his commitment to year-
round sales of E15. As we move for-
ward, I will continue to advocate for
biofuels and the environmental and
economic benefits they bring. Conven-
tional ethanol has laid the foundation
for advanced biofuels, which will have
even lower life cycle emissions.
American ingenuity has turned the
corner to create ethanol from other
parts of plants like corn kernel fiber,
boosting yields, but we need the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency to end
the yearlong delays and approve reg-
istrations.
I will also continue to urge the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency to stop
its practice of granting small refiner
exemptions to the renewable fuel
standard that discourage demand for
ethanol. These so-called hardship waiv-
ers should be limited only to instances
where small refiners would no longer
be profitable or competitive if they
comply with their blending obligation.
They should not be granted to refiners
who are posting billion-dollar profits
and seeking to game the system. We
need to make sure the EPA is granting
waivers appropriately and in a trans-
parent manner.
That said, the year-round sale of E15
will actually help refiners because it
will incentivize higher ethanol blend-
ing and drive down compliance costs.
I am thankful that President Trump
made good on his commitment to our
farmers to get the E15 rule done, and I
am glad he is back in the heartland
today so he can hear firsthand about
the difference this will make in farm
country.
While we have a long way to go to
get the agricultural economy thriving
again, I am heartened by this victory
for our corn producers, and I will con-
tinue to make our Nation’s farmers
and ranchers a priority here in Wash-
ington.
Madam President, I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

EQUAL PAY
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, later
this afternoon, the U.S. women’s soccer
team will begin its quest for another
World Cup title with its opening match
against Thailand. As the entire Nation
cheers them on as they take the field,
I want to shine a light today on an
issue the women’s national team has
been fighting for off the field: pay eq-
uity. The women make just as much of
a sacrifice, put in just as much mental
and physical energy, absorb just as
much risk of injury as the men who
play for the national team. Yet when
you break it down, a women’s national
soccer team player earns a base salary
of $3,600 per game while a men’s player
earns $5,000. Over the course of a sea-
son, if both the men’s and women’s
teams have the same record, a male
player could earn $30,000 more than his
female counterpart.
Female soccer players who earn the
privilege of representing their country
on the world stage get a much smaller
bonus, $15,000, than male soccer players
who earn the same privilege, $55,000.
When a woman’s national team wins a
World Cup, something the U.S. women
have done three times—with some New
York State players helping—it wins a
percentage of what a men’s team gets
if it wins at all, something the U.S.
men have never done.
For the sake of comparison, U.S. soc-
cer awarded the men’s national team a
$5.4 million performance bonus for los-
ing in the round of 16 in the 2014 World
Cup. It awarded the women $1.7 million
for winning the World Cup.
Let me repeat that so you get the
contrast. The women won the Cup and
were given $1.7 million. The men got
into the final 16 and got $5.4 million.
That is discrimination staring us all in
the face.
This is an issue of basic fairness. Per-
formances aside—and the women have
been excellent and often dominant over
the past two decades—we shouldn’t re-
ward women less for doing the same
work as men. We shouldn’t say to gen-
erations of girls and boys who look up
to these talented stars that women’s

sports is in any way ‘‘less than’’ be-
cause it is not. These women, who in-
spire our country with their poise, te-
nacity, skill, and excellence every time
they take the field, deserve to be fairly
compensated.
Right now, the Senate could take a
meaningful step to support the wom-
en’s international team by passing leg-
islation that aims to end gender-based
wage discrimination. The House passed
a paycheck fairness bill months ago,
which languished here in the Senate in
Leader MCCONNELL’s legislative grave-
yard. Bill after bill comes from the
House, has the support of large per-
centages of Americans, gets Republican
support in the House, and Leader
MCCONNELL just lets them lie there—
another tombstone in the graveyard.
As the women of Team USA take the
field today, I call on Leader MCCON-
NELL to bring up the House legislation
already passed that would aid in their
fight for equal pay.
I will be rooting for Team USA
women to kick off their campaign with
a win against Thailand.
HUAWEI
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, Huawei, according to public re-
ports, the Acting Director of the Office
of Management and Budget, Russell
Vought, is pushing a 2-year delay—a 2-
year delay—in the implementation of
key portions of a law intended to pro-
tect U.S. agencies and government con-
tractors from Chinese telecom tech-
nology, chiefly Huawei.
This is deeply concerning for two rea-
sons. First, from a national security
standpoint, the FBI, CIA, and other
members of the intelligence commu-
nity have testified that the technology
from Chinese telecom companies, such
as Huawei and ZTE, present a national
security risk, potentially allowing
China to build backdoors into our net-
works, enabling their cyber theft and
cyber espionage for which they are, un-
fortunately, well known. That is why
Congress banned U.S. Government
agencies and contractors from using
this technology—because they are our
highest valued targets. We have been
encouraging our European allies to do
the same.
Why on Earth, then, is the Acting Di-
rector of OMB, Russell Vought, asking
for a 2-year delay in these rules? We
passed the law more than a year ago.
President Trump has signed it, and our
agencies and contractors have had time
to make sure their technology doesn’t
come from Huawei.
There is simply no reason, in my
mind, for such a lengthy delay. It
would only extend a window of oppor-
tunity for what is already a dire threat
to our national security.
The second reason this news concerns
me so is that it is about the Trump ad-
ministration’s broader approach to
China. Across many issues in the
Trump administration, it sometimes
feels as though the right hand doesn’t
know what the left hand is doing. A
few weeks ago, the administration
issued an Executive order largely ban-
ning U.S. companies from selling
equipment to Huawei, an action I
praised. But then the Commerce De-
partment abruptly delayed that deci-
sion by 3 months. Now we have this ad-
ditional request from OMB to soft-
pedal a different set of restrictions on
Huawei.
China needs to understand that the
United States is serious when it comes
to our trade relationship. We must
have a consistent policy implemented
with rigor. This idea of reciprocity, of
barring China’s companies from doing
business here until they let our biggest
companies do business there, is an im-
portant part of our overall effort to in-
crease pressure on China to agree to
meaningful economic reforms.
I am very troubled by the OMB’s re-
quest, and I plan on strenuously oppos-
ing the approval of the delay here in
Congress.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.

Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise
today in defense of net neutrality. In
April the House of Representatives
took an important step in passing the
Save the Internet Act, legislation that
would overturn the Trump administra-
tion’s Federal Communication Com-
mission’s wrongheaded decision and re-
store net neutrality protections. An-
other way of saying it is that net neu-
trality is nondiscrimination online.
That is what it is. It is the principle of
nondiscrimination online so that large
companies just can’t discriminate
against smaller voices, smaller compa-
nies, and startups.
In the Senate, we have already suc-
cessfully passed the same proposal last
year. In April of 2018, my Congressional
Review Act resolution passed in the
Senate on a bipartisan vote of 52 to 47.
In April 2018, on a bipartisan basis, we
debated net neutrality and the Senate
decided to join the majority of Ameri-
cans and support a free and open inter-
net.
In that vote we sent a message to
President Trump about what that
means: an internet, free of corporate
control and open to all who want to
communicate, engage, and innovate.
We made it clear that Congress will not
fall for President Trump’s special in-
terest agenda and his broadband baron
allies who just want to block, slow
down, or discriminate against content
online just to charge Americans more
on their cable bills.
Unfortunately, the rules for the Con-
gressional Review Act that allow just
30 Senators to force the majority to
schedule a vote is not an option in this
Congress. So, instead, on this, the 1-
year anniversary of President Trump’s
net neutrality repeal going into effect,
we will call for an immediate vote on
the Save the Internet Act. Unfortu-
nately, our Republican colleagues are
failing to listen to the voices of their
constituents and plan to block the vote
from happening.
Let’s be clear. Net neutrality is just
another way in which the Republican
Party refuses to side with the ordinary
people in our country—regular fami-
lies, small businesses, and startup soft-
ware companies. How do they get ac-
cess to the internet in a way in which
they cannot feel that corporate pres-
sure restricting their ability to use
this incredible invention to further the
democratization of access to oppor-
tunity or, at the same time, to inno-
vate in a way which continues to
change not only our own country but
our own world?
We can’t let big companies discrimi-
nate against individual consumers. We
can’t let big companies stifle speech.
Once you pay your monthly internet
service bill, you can go anywhere you
want on the internet without your pro-
vider slowing down or blocking your
path to a website of your choosing.
This is a fight. It is a fight for inno-
vation, for entrepreneurialism, for the
American economy, and a fight for free
speech—the cornerstone of our democ-
racy—and a fight for the most powerful
platform for commerce and commu-
nications in the history of the planet.
The Save the Internet Act does exactly
what the American people want. It re-
stores the rules that ensure that fami-
lies aren’t subject to higher prices,
slower internet speeds, and even
blocked websites because the big
broadband providers want to pump up
their profits.
Under Senator MCCONNELL’s leader-
ship, the Republicans are trying to
bury this bill in a legislative grave-
yard. Instead of acting on legislation,
which, again, passed the Senate a year
ago—it just passed in the House in
April of this year—Leader MCCONNELL
has been doing little but confirming
unqualified, extreme-right nominees
for the Trump administration.
Just listen to the bills the Senate Re-
publicans refuse to act on: the Violence
Against Women Act, no votes out here
on the Senate floor; voting on democ-
racy reform, no votes out here on the
Senate floor; gun background checks,
passed in the House but no vote here in
the Senate; paycheck fairness; the
Paris climate agreement—no, no, no.
But the Senate majority leader and
his Republican colleagues can keep
populating the legislative graveyard at
their political peril because this is the
agenda that the American people want
to see the Senate debating, and they
want to see these laws put on the books
to protect families in our country.
That is because the issues they are
blocking are enormously popular, most
with strong bipartisan support.
Take net neutrality. Now, 86 percent
of Americans do not approve of the

June 11, 2019
Federal Communication Commission’s
action to repeal net neutrality rules,
including 82 percent of Republicans,
and we are not going to have a vote out
here on the Senate floor.
On background checks for gun pur-
chases, 97 percent of Americans sup-
port requiring background checks for
all gun buyers, but we are not going to
have a vote out here on the Senate
floor.
On staying in the Paris climate
agreement, nearly 70 percent of reg-
istered voters believe the United States
should keep its promise and stay in
that historic agreement to combat cli-
mate change, but the Republicans will
not allow us to even have a vote on
that out here on the Senate floor.
The only place where these issues
don’t have Republican support is in
Senator MCCONNELL’s office. Across the
country, there are huge bipartisan
numbers on each and every one of
those issues. It is time that we do right
by the American people, and we can
start with the Save the Internet Act to
protect the internet as we know it.
More than 100 outside advocacy orga-
nizations wrote to Senate leadership
today urging a vote on the net neu-
trality legislation. They want action
now, and Democrats are committed to
fighting on their behalf.
I am joined today by some of our
greatest fighters for net neutrality in
the Senate and across our country. The
ranking member of the Commerce
Committee, MARIA CANTWELL from
Washington State, will be out here in a
few minutes, but now I am joined by
Senator RON WYDEN of Oregon.
Senator WYDEN and I introduced net
neutrality legislation 15 years ago in
the House and in the Senate. Nobody
understands this issue better than Sen-
ator WYDEN does. Partnering with Sen-
ator CANTWELL, we are going to con-
tinue this battle. Whether it is on the
floor of the Senate or in the House or
whether it is in the courts, we will not
stop fighting until net neutrality is re-
stored.
So, from my perspective, right from
the very beginning, Senator WYDEN and
I have been on the right side of history.
We have been fighting for an issue that
has overwhelming public support, and
we are not going to give up until we
have won this fight.
At this point, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am
pleased to be able to join my friend
Senator MARKEY here today. It has
been exactly 1 year since the Trump
FCC engineered the repeal of net neu-
trality, and I am going to spend the
next few minutes making sure people
understand what the effect of that has
been. I want to begin by picking up on
a point Senator MARKEY made with re-
spect to what this is all about.
Net neutrality may still be a term
that some people aren’t familiar with,
but what it is all about is a free and
open internet. It means, in simple
English, that after you pay your inter-
net access fee, you get to go where you
want, when you want, and how you
want. That is what net neutrality is all
about, and that is the essence of a free
and open internet. As Senator MARKEY
said, we wish we had had this policy
embedded once and for all in Federal
law. We wish it had happened eons ago,
because we have been working both in
the Senate and in the House to do it.
Now, if you are just picking up on
this, you probably want to know: Well,
the Senators are saying how the Trump
FCC changed things in the last year;
exactly what has happened? I am not
sure the sky is falling and the like. So
what I am going to do for a few min-
utes is to talk about actually what has
happened over the last year.
Suffice it to say that the big cable
companies are counting on making
these changes. As for these changes,
which are going to hurt consumers in a
steady, creeping way, my sense is that
the American people ought to know,
for example, what these changes are
doing to them and their service and
what they pay for it.
There is one example that you have
already seen. The big carriers are sell-
ing so-called unlimited data plans that
totally throw away the definition of
the word ‘‘unlimited.’’ To understand
the complicated limits on internet ac-
cess in these kind of new, newfangled
unlimited plans, you almost need a de-
gree in big-cable legal jargon. Con-
sumers might be forced to swallow
hard and accept it, but that doesn’t
make it acceptable.
Big cable companies and the enter-
tainment giants are also reshaping
their industries through megamergers.
As big carriers merge, there is less
competition and consumers have fewer
choices. Some of those new
megacorporations also own the content
they distribute, and they want to reach
as many consumers as possible. That
means that what is happening now is
that the internet is starting to frac-
ture.
Sign up for internet service with one
company, and you will be able to see
their preferred bundle of content in
high definition at top speeds. If you
want to go outside their bundle of
websites and streaming services, plan
to pay a whole lot more.
That is a bad deal for the American
consumer. American consumers ought
to be able to access what they want
and when they want to. As Senator
MARKEY and I and Senator CANTWELL
have talked about, it is also a night-
mare for the startup companies, the
engines of innovation in America that
will not be able to afford special treat-
ment and will not be able to compete
with these behemoths.
Now, the Trump FCC repealed net
neutrality—and I will close with this—
by making some very farfetched prom-
ises. They said, for example, that there
would be new innovation. They can
produce new innovation, Senator MAR-
KEY, without any regulation. That
hadn’t happened.
The Trump FCC said the level of pri-
vate investment in telecom would
boom. We are still waiting on that one
too. The Trump FCC spun a tale about
voluntary net neutrality. We could all
do this voluntarily—claiming that the
big cable companies would do the right
thing on their own. That doesn’t even
pass the smell test.
By the way, colleagues, if the compa-
nies were fine with net neutrality, why
would we need to get rid of it? They
sure put a lot of effort into getting rid
of this altogether.
The bottom line is, the Trump FCC
has put consumers, from sea to shining
sea—from Oregon, all the way across
the country—basically at the hands of
Big Cable. That is what they did when
they repealed net neutrality.
I want to take some time to outline
the changes we have seen in just the
last year because not all of these
changes are going to come at once. In
fact, I think it is fair to say the big
cable companies are counting on Amer-
icans not noticing sometimes when the
terms of their contracts get worse, but,
bit by bit, people are going to notice
when their prices start rising. The frac-
tures in the internet—I guess the big
cable companies will try to figure out a
way to say that, too, was a good deal
for consumers, a discount on the con-
tent within one bundle rather than a
price increase and data limits on every-
thing else.
I will close with just one final point.
That last example violates everything
that Senator MARKEY, Senator CANT-
WELL, and I have stood for, which is an
open and free internet after you pay
your internet access fee. I say this
today, as Senator CANTWELL gets ready
to close this for us, we still envision
what Senator MARKEY and I proposed,
as I call it, eons ago. We still have
made it clear that we are going to be
out here fighting to embed, once and
for all, in Federal law, an open and free
internet. That means, after you pay
your access fee, you get to go where
you want, when you want, and how you
want, and nothing less—nothing less—
keeps pace with the American con-
sumer.
I thank my colleagues, Senator MAR-
KEY, for his leadership on this, and
Senator CANTWELL, our leader on the
Commerce Committee, and I look for-
ward to working with both of them.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I
come to the floor to join my colleague,
the Senator from Oregon, who has been
a long proponent of a very strong inter-
net economy and privacy rights. I very
much appreciate his leadership on so
many of these technology issues. He
and I represent a very strong tech-
nology economy in the Pacific North-
west, and we want to fight to keep that
innovation.
He and I actually held a summit in
our adjoining communities just about
the app economy. This was several
years ago—probably 7 or 8 years ago

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3304 June 11, 2019
now. He and I worked together to for-
mulate, with our colleges, Washington
State University and Oregon, literally
just the app economy.
I think about the applications we saw
7 years ago. Some of them were for hik-
ing trails, some of them were for solu-
tions for our law enforcement to have
better information, and some of them
were just pure business applications. I
think about how much we have grown
that app economy in the last 7 to 10
years and how much it will be im-
pacted by an internet that is not an
open internet and universal in giving
people access to service. I say this be-
cause those new startups know more
than anybody else that if they are not
the big behemoth in the market and
they are a new interest competing
against an existing business or if they
have a new idea and they don’t have
the clout to have fast internet speeds,
they are not going to reach consumers;
they are not going to reach their cli-
ents; and they are not going to have a
business model that is successful.
So I thank Senator WYDEN for his
leadership for decades on these impor-
tant issues. I thank my colleague Sen-
ator MARKEY for organizing us this
morning to say one thing loud and
clear: After 1 year, we already know
what is happening on the internet. One
thing the Senate can do is protect con-
sumers from big cable companies from
overcharging them. That is why we are
out here to say that we should have a
vote to protect consumers, to protect
companies that produce 20 percent of
our economy over 377,000 jobs in my
State. I guarantee you I will be here
this morning to articulate why an
internet service needs to be protected.
We know we have to fight back against
companies that want to gouge con-
sumers or suppress competition.
It has been 1 year since the FCC de-
cided to turn back protections for the
internet. We are here today because we
know we have already seen the
inklings of what is more to come—com-
panies that are doing things such as
slowing down speeds or charging con-
sumers more. We know more than 20
million people stood up and told the
FCC they want strong internet protec-
tions, and they do not want to see
large-scale companies overcharging or
gouging them.
I don’t even know how we can talk
about getting broadband service if
there are not going to be strong rules
on the internet that protect consumers
from being overcharged. The truth is,
we know today that the internet is a
great economy for us. It is helping us
to research. It is helping us in life-
saving healthcare. We had one of the
FCC administrators out in the North-
west looking at healthcare applica-
tions, and they are phenomenal for
helping everything from PTSD to look-
ing at ways to deliver just-in-time
healthcare for those who are in remote
parts of our State.
We know the internet is a great
equalizer. It is helping people from dif-
ferent backgrounds participate in the
economy, and it is helping with eco-
nomic empowerment, but innovative
businesses in every small town and
every city need to have an internet
that is going to give them access to
create jobs and move their local econo-
mies forward. Today, in the United
States, three cable companies—just
three cable companies—have control of
internet access for 70 percent of Ameri-
cans, and 80 percent of rural Americans
still only have one choice for high-
speed broadband for their homes and
businesses. We are not likely to get
competition where the consumer can
just say: You are artificially slowing
me down and charging me too much; I
am just going to the competition. That
is not likely to happen. That is why we
need a strong FCC approach to pro-
tecting an open internet and saying
they shouldn’t block, throttle, and ma-
nipulate internet access. Without these
protections, Big Cable can move faster
in charging more. So I ask my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to
say it is time to hold these companies
accountable and put consumers ahead
of these big cable profits.
I can guarantee that the American
people know better. Literally, it
doesn’t matter what political affili-
ation you have, the majority of Ameri-
cans all oppose repealing protections
that make for an open internet. They
know it is time for us to protect con-
sumers and that this is only going to
get more complex as our economy de-
pends more and more on an open inter-
net.
As my colleague from Oregon has
said, the Trump FCC has given a green
light to companies, basically, to keep
doing whatever they want and to con-
tinue to take more out of consumers’
pockets.
Today, on the Senate floor, we have
an opportunity. My colleague from
Massachusetts, who has been as much a
great leader on these issues and has
been working to protect an open inter-
net for decades, has an opportunity to
say where we stand in protecting the
American consumer. Just last year, a
bipartisan majority in the U.S. Sen-
ate—49 Democrats and 3 Republicans—
joined together to overturn the FCC’s
repealing of internet protections. We
were here together to say we want the
internet protected.
Now the House of Representatives
has done its job. It has basically pro-
tected the internet and taken an initia-
tive. It is time for Leader MCCONNELL
to put the big cable companies on no-
tice and to allow debate on the Senate
floor and hold them accountable so we
can say we want an open internet, and
this type of practice should be fought
against.
I hope our colleagues will be given
the opportunity for this debate, to look
at why it is so important to protect
consumers, the innovation economy,
and a free and open internet.
Tomorrow there is an FCC hearing
before the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee, and I hope we will be able to
ask these important questions about
why cable companies are continuing to
gouge consumers in many areas.
I thank the Presiding Officer, and I
yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts.
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I think
Senator CANTWELL and Senator WYDEN
have done an excellent job in laying
out the parameters of the problems
that exist if we do not have net neu-
trality enshrined as the law of the
land.
We believe the principles of non-
discrimination—the principles that en-
sure that the internet is open and ac-
cessible to the smallest voices as well
as the largest voices. We need laws to
protect the smallest voices. We need
protections to ensure that they are
going to be heard, that they can inno-
vate, that they can take their entre-
preneurial zeal, their insights into the
additional changes that can be made in
this longstanding—now a 20-year his-
tory of dynamic changes that have
taken place in the online commercial
world and that they will be able to in-
novate.
They should not have to get permis-
sion to innovate. They should not have
to get permission to be able to change
the way in which people communicate
in our country. We shouldn’t have to
hire lawyers to negotiate with the law-
yers of the biggest companies in the
United States in order to ensure that
investors aren’t going to lose all their
money as the small company gets
tipped upside down and has all of their
resources absolutely devastated by
anticompetitive activity. That is what
this is all about—democracy and cap-
italism, entrepreneurial spirit, the
ability to innovate, the ability to be
able to go to the marketplace.
In order for capitalism to work, it
has to have a conscience. Capitalism
without a conscience allows for unfet-
tered large corporations to take advan-
tage of small companies, startups, and
individuals in our society. It has to
have a conscience. Net neutrality is
the conscience for the online world we
live in. It ensures that there is fair-
ness, openness, and it ensures that the
apertures that are there cannot be nar-
rowed just because of the corporate
agenda of an individual huge company.
That is the essence of this whole de-
bate. It is something we believe is at
the heart of what this 21st century
platform of commerce should include.
It will be, in a lot of ways, the defining
issue of whether this entire era is one
that is characterized by fairness or one
that is characterized by monopolistic
or duopoly practices.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1644

CANTWELL and Senator WYDEN and my-

of the Federal Communications Com-

read a third time and passed; and that
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with
no intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object—
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi.
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I don’t
think the answer to the question is
going to be a surprise to my friend
from Massachusetts. I will only say
this, and I will try to do it briefly. I
have been amazed, over the last 11⁄2
years and even longer, at the intense,
overblown rhetoric about this issue of
net neutrality and the hyperbole we
have heard on the floor of the Senate
and elsewhere.
About 11⁄2 years ago, the FCC voted
on the Restoring Internet Freedom
Order. It went into effect. It repealed
what most of us considered a heavy-
handed approach based on a law that
took effect back in 1934.
When the FCC implemented this new
restoring internet freedom order back
a year and a half ago, I was just as-
tounded by what was being said by my
friends on the left. One Senator warned
that this was practically the end of
Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon. An-
other cautioned:
They want to get rid of the Federal Com-
munications Commission’s net neutrality
rules so that . . . Internet Service Providers
can indiscriminately charge more for inter-
net fast lanes, slow down websites, block
websites, make it harder and maybe even im-
possible for inventors, entrepreneurs.
One tweet from my friends on the
Democratic side said: ‘‘If we don’t save
net neutrality, you’ll get the internet
one word at a time.’’ That quote got
three Pinocchios from even the Wash-
ington Post.
These things never happened. As a
matter of fact, people on the other side
of the issue who actually have taken
the position of the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts have admitted that ISPs are
delivering on consumers’ expectations.
They are not throttling websites.
As a matter of fact, here is what has
happened since the FCC order went
into effect a year and a half ago:
Broadband providers large and small
have deployed fiber networks to 5.9
million new homes—the largest num-
ber ever recorded. More Americans are
connected at higher speeds than ever
before. Capital expenditures have re-
bounded from the slump they suffered
when the internet was subjected to
title II.
This should surprise no one because
the internet has thrived during Demo-
cratic and Republican administrations
and during Democratic majorities on
the FCC and Republican majorities on
the FCC when we have taken the light-
touch regulatory approach.
The issue seems to be title II regula-
tion of rates. I would simply say to my
brothers and sisters on the other side
of the aisle that we can pass a law to-
morrow afternoon providing Americans
with all the protection they want from
blocking, throttling, and preventing
paid prioritization. What we will not do
and what this President will not sign is
legislation authorizing the Federal
Government to set internet rates in
the old 1934 Bell System of title II reg-
ulations. For that reason, I do object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Massachusetts.
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, despite
the Republican objections today, Sen-
ator CANTWELL, Senator WYDEN, and I,
and tens of millions of people across
this country will not stop fighting
until net neutrality is fully restored.
Whether in the Halls of Congress or in
the courts of our country, this is going
to be a fight that is fought until it is
finally won.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
OPIOID EPIDEMIC
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this
Congress, I have the great privilege of
cochairing the Senate Caucus on Inter-
national Narcotics Control with the
senior Senator from California, DIANNE
FEINSTEIN. As more families across the
country lose their loved ones to the
scourge of opioids, the work of this
caucus could not be more important.
Today, people in our country are
more likely to die from an opioid over-
dose than a car crash, but that hasn’t
always been the case. Our country’s
opioid abuse epidemic began in the
1990s when pharmaceutical companies
promoted aggressive pain management,
assuring the medical community that
patients would not become addicted to
these drugs. As a result, doctors began
to prescribe more and more of them.
We know what happened next. In the
decades since, we have faced a steady
increase in opioid abuse and have un-
dertaken aggressive efforts to address
this epidemic.
There has been a concerted effort
across the country to attack overpre-
scribing of opioids in the hope of pre-
venting more people from becoming ad-
dicted. But that alone cannot be our
sole focus. Of the more than 70,000
overdose deaths in America in 2017,
more than half were the result of her-
oin and synthetic opioids, not prescrip-
tion drugs.
The more we step up our efforts to
limit prescription opioid diversion, the
higher the demand for other illicit
drugs, many of which are funneled into
our communities by criminal organiza-
tions operating across international
borders. These groups run sophisti-
cated drug trafficking operations, mov-
ing vast amounts of cocaine, meth-
amphetamine, heroin, fentanyl, and
other illegal drugs through Central
America and Mexico and into the
United States. With Customs and Bor-
der Protection personnel spread thin
because of the current humanitarian
and security crisis at the border, these
criminal organizations have no prob-
lem exploiting the security gaps.
I can say confidently that without
coordinated government response, the
problem is going to get worse and
worse, which means more and more
Americans will die as a result of drug
overdoses.
In the past, this caucus has examined
everything from prescription drug
abuse, to the expansion of fentanyl, to
trafficking across our southern border.
As these and other hearings have illus-
trated, there is no single contributor to
this crisis and no silver bullet.
The opioid epidemic is called a crisis
for a reason: It is pervasive and all-en-
compassing. We can’t look at the prob-
lem through a soda straw, focusing
only on how the drugs get here or how
to more effectively treat those who are
already addicted. We need to take a
more holistic approach that focuses on
reducing supply by reducing demand
and eliminating the myriad of factors
that fueled this fire.
The International Narcotics Control
Caucus will hold a hearing this after-
noon to examine how the U.S. Govern-
ment can expand our international ef-
forts against drug abuse and narcotics
trafficking and take the first step to-
ward developing a comprehensive
strategy.
Our first witness will be the Sec-
retary of State, Secretary Pompeo,
whose Department works across the
U.S. Government and with our partners
around the world to combat this
transnational crime. We look forward
to hearing from him, as well as other
experts on the second panel about the
growing epidemic and what Congress
must do, working in a bipartisan effort,
to address it.
As I said earlier, our whole-of-gov-
ernment strategy must focus on supply
and demand. Last Congress, we passed
landmark legislation to combat the
opioid crisis, which President Trump
called ‘‘the single largest bill to com-
bat a drug crisis in the history of the
country.’’ Through the collaboration of
70 bipartisan proposals in the Senate,
this law aims to not only stem the tide
of drugs coming across the border but
to offer some support and hope to those
suffering from drug addiction. It was a
major bipartisan accomplishment and
one that I hope we can continue to
build on in this Congress because a
great deal of work remains to be done.
Beyond supply and demand, we need
to take aim at the criminal organiza-
tions that traffic drugs and engage in a
whole host of criminal activity. As oth-
ers have pointed out, these criminal or-
ganizations are commodity-agnostic—
they will engage in human trafficking,
migrant smuggling, money laundering,
counterfeit goods, public corruption,
and the list goes on and on. What they
are really about is making money.
They don’t care anything for the mi-
grants or the people affected by their
crimes. The real kicker here is that
while these criminal organizations are

perpetuating the opioid epidemic, fuel-
ing a cycle of violence, and abusing in-
nocent civilians, they are growing rich-
er and richer by the minute.
Targeting these organizations means
more than stopping the flow of drugs
into our country; it means ending a
cycle of crime and violence and work-
ing together with Mexico and Central
American countries to help them es-
cape the savage grip of these criminal
organizations.
Additionally, we need to strengthen
security cooperation with our inter-
national partners so that they are able
to more effectively fight side by side
with us. Mexico and Central and South
American nations often lack the abil-
ity to adequately counter the traf-
ficking occurring within their borders,
and corruption serves as a major road-
block in efforts to stop criminal activ-
ity.
There are a number of programs in
place already—many of which began
through the Merida Initiative—which
have yielded positive results, but we
need to look at all of these and make
sure we understand what works and
what does not work so we can justify
the expenditure of U.S. taxpayer dol-
lars in this fight. By strengthening and
expanding these operations, we can
help our southern neighbors fight
drugs, crime, and corruption within
their own borders, which would more
effectively reduce the flow of drugs and
other illicit goods moving across our
southern border.
Finally, if we want any of these ef-
forts to be sustainable, we can’t just
focus on law and order; we must look
at ways to invest in economic develop-
ment to help these countries build
stronger economies. These are beau-
tiful, vibrant countries that are also
victims of endemic crime in the region.
Helping them promote economic secu-
rity will carry immense benefits for
the entire region, and it is something
we need to discuss more in the coming
months.
Senator FEINSTEIN and I have worked
together in the past on legislation to
address the drug epidemic, such as the
Substance Abuse Prevention Act,
which is now the law of the land. This
Congress, we will continue our impor-
tant work together on the Inter-
national Narcotics Control Caucus. I
look forward to hearing from our dis-
tinguished witnesses this afternoon
and engaging in a larger discussion—
hopefully a nationwide discussion—
about how we can reverse the devasta-
tion caused by the opioid crisis and
drug overdoses in America.

FOREIGN AGENTS DISCLOSURE AND
REGISTRATION ENHANCEMENT ACT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President,
for nearly 2 years Special Counsel
Mueller’s investigation captivated
Washington. Most of the media report-
ing focused on speculation and false al-
legations of a criminal conspiracy be-
tween the Trump campaign and the
Kremlin. This reporting was fueled by
critics eager to all but guarantee the
President’s guilt. After a very exhaus-
tive investigation—and, of course, mil-
lions and millions of taxpayer dollars
being spent by the Mueller investiga-
tion—many of those same critics still
can’t accept that Mueller and his in-
vestigative team of Democratic donors
found no collusion or crime.
The continuing political noise over
the last 2 years, however, risks drown-
ing out critical siren warnings of an-
other real threat—self-interested and
surreptitious foreign influence in our
political discourse. Mueller’s team in-
dicted dozens of Russians for a scheme
to sow discord in American politics
through our social media and the re-
lease of hacked emails. However, not
enough attention has been paid to for-
eign interests secretly enlisting Amer-
ican cutouts to directly influence our
laws, our public policies, and, most im-
portantly, public opinion to destroy
our social cohesion.
This is a very serious problem that
should send shivers down the spine of
anyone in government who meets with
lobbyists. If lobbyists or public rela-
tions firms are pushing policy pref-
erences at the behest of foreign powers
and foreign interests, we ought to
know about it.
This week I introduced legislation to
strengthen and also fine-tune enforce-
ment authorities to better expose clan-
destine foreign influence campaigns.
My bipartisan bill, the Foreign Agents
Disclosure and Registration Enhance-
ment Act, will encourage greater com-
pliance with a very often ignored re-
quirement for lobbyists working on be-
half of foreign entities to tell the U.S.
people who they are working for. It ac-
complishes this by creating critical up-
dates to one of our Nation’s oldest lob-
bying disclosure laws.
Way back in 1938, Congress first
passed a bill to accomplish a way to ex-
pose this foreign influence in America,
particularly within our government.
That bill passed in 1938 is called the
Foreign Agents Registration Act. The
bill was meant to unmask Nazi propa-
ganda and identify foreign attempts to
influence Congress and the American
public. Until recently, however, this
Foreign Agents Registration Act has
been seldom used.
Now—get this—only 15 violators of
this act have been criminally pros-
ecuted since 1966, and 1966 was the date
when this law was last updated. Of
course, now I am trying to update it
again. About half of these prosecu-
tions, of the 15, stem from the work of
Special Counsel Mueller’s investiga-
tion, though that is not due to the lack
of foreign influence efforts to affect
our Federal decision making.
As part of my oversight efforts, I
first raised concerns about the shoddy
Foreign Agent Registration Act en-
forcement in 2015. Now, I did this be-
fore Donald Trump launched his Presi-
dential campaign. I did it when a
former Clinton White House staffer and
a lawyer for a Georgian political party
failed to register as foreign agents.
I also raised concerns about work for
Ukranians by Paul Manafort and the
Podesta Group, and about reports that
the Democratic National Committee
worked with Ukraine to undermine the
Trump campaign. I raised concerns
when the firm behind the discredited
Steele dossier failed to register for its
lobbying work to repeal U.S. sanctions
against Russia.
Now, as it turned out, that is the
same lobbying effort that was behind
the bait and switch at the Trump
Tower in June of 2016. I don’t have to
go into details about that Trump
Tower meeting. That is a very famous
and well documented meeting.
I even subpoenaed Manafort to tes-
tify at the Judiciary Committee hear-
ing on lax Foreign Agents Registration
Act enforcement, and I praised Mueller
for dusting off the law that had been
ignored by lobbyists and prosecutors
for so long because they really didn’t
want the American public to know that
they were working for a foreign coun-
try.
Now, that may sound like that is
something illegal. What is illegal is
that you don’t tell the American peo-
ple whom you are working for. It is
not, as far as I know, illegal to work
for the interests of another country, as
they might have some legitimate inter-
est in our policymaking, but the point
is that the public ought to know whom
they are working for.
Now, I talked about subpoenaing
Manafort, and in the end Manafort, his
colleague Rick Gates, and former
Obama White House Counsel Greg
Craig were among those indicted for
violating this Foreign Agents Registra-
tion Act.
My Foreign Agents Registration Act
oversight activities have been done
without regard to power, party, or
privilege. I happen to have a reputation
as an equal-opportunity overseer to see
that the laws are faithfully enforced,
and I believe that this very act of reg-
istration of foreign agents ought to be
better enforced and enforced equally.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3307
June 11, 2019
Now, all of this talk about this law
may have started as a creative tactic
by an aggressive team of investigators
to pressure Manafort into spilling non-
existent details on the Trump cam-
paign, but Mueller’s probe had the posi-
tive effect of shining a light on the
Justice Department’s registration unit
on the enforcement of this law of 1938,
and it also has shown light, as well, on
a legion of lobbyists who work for for-
eign agents who had flown under the
radar for very many years.
Now, because of all this trans-
parency, the charges spurred a rush on
K Street. New foreign agent registra-
tions increased by 50 percent from 2016
to 2017. Now, I can’t believe a single
one of those people registering of that
50 percent increase in registration
didn’t realize this law existed, but they
probably thought they could get away
with something that most people have
been getting away with for decades.
Now, Attorney General Barr also re-
cently pledged to prioritize enforce-
ment of that law as he heads up the
Justice Department, and, of course, we
all ought to be pleased to hear that
from the Attorney General.
However, even though the 1938 law is
finally being taken more seriously,
that law still lacks key enforcement
authorities needed to investigate and
hold accountable covert conveyors of
foreign interests.
The 1938 law also includes a broad ex-
emption for anyone already registered
with Congress as a lobbyist. It is time
that we ask whether this exemption
continues to serve the public interest
and operates as intended.
Moreover, even those registered
under the 1938 law aren’t required to
clearly disclose that they are working
on behalf of a foreign government or
entity if they happen to be meeting
with Capitol Hill or administration of-
ficials. Policymakers need to know
when these meetings are driven by for-
eign interests.
Now, getting back to the legislation I
am introducing, this bipartisan bill,
based on my oversight work, grants
Federal investigators a lot of new
tools, such as civil investigative de-
mand authority to help the Justice De-
partment gain access to material need-
ed to identify covert foreign influence
and improve the act’s compliance. This
bill strengthens the Justice Depart-
ment’s hand in rooting out those who
attempt to shield their operation from
the American people and policymakers.
We have to ensure accountability,
and to accomplish that goal, my bill
provides key controls on who in the
Justice Department can use the new
authority, and it provides due process
protection. This authority will also
sunset after 5 years, requiring the Jus-
tice Department to demonstrate that
the law has been appropriately used if
Congress is to reauthorize it.
In addition, the bill requires a review
of the new authority by the Justice De-
partment’s inspector general.
This bipartisan bill also improves de-
terrence by strengthening the penalties
that scofflaws face for violating the
law’s registration and disclosure re-
quirements.
It also requires foreign agents to im-
mediately disclose their clients. That
way, policymakers—including those of
us in the Senate—can evaluate their
positions in light of those associations.
Even my own office has, in the past,
been targeted by secretive lobbying ef-
forts orchestrated by foreign powers,
whose policy interests were diamet-
rically opposed to those of our great
country. I saw through the ploy, but
anyone in government should have full
awareness into who they are meeting
with and why those meetings are tak-
ing place.
The bill requires the Justice Depart-
ment to craft a comprehensive enforce-
ment strategy for the law to better co-
ordinate agency efforts, to analyze the
law’s current exemptions and fee struc-
ture, and to promote transparency by
ensuring the ongoing proactive release
of the law’s advisory opinions.
Finally, it establishes a review of the
Lobbying Disclosure Act exemptions to
determine whether and to what extent
it has been abused to conceal foreign
influence.
Legitimate interests engaging in le-
gitimate conduct shouldn’t bear an un-
necessary burden. Hopefully, in the
way we have written this law, that un-
necessary burden is avoided. But, at
the same time, we must also be certain
that this exemption hasn’t created an
opportunity for abuse by those who
wish to operate in the dark. With this
increase in registration under the 1938
law, we find that a lot of people must
have been operating in the dark.
This bill is a product of my years-
long oversight into the 1938 law as well
as bipartisan cooperation. It reflects a
consensus that the curtain over foreign
influence has to be peeled back.
This year, compared to the bill I in-
troduced last year—and we had com-
petition with other bills last year—we
have been able to find a bipartisan ef-
fort that combines what other Mem-
bers’ thinking is on the subject. So I
am happy to announce that Senators
FEINSTEIN, CORNYN, SHAHEEN, RUBIO,
and YOUNG are cosponsors at the time
of this introduction, and I hope that
other Members will join us as well.
The Mueller investigation might not
have brought the legal charges that
many of the President’s critics were
hoping for. They were hoping for an ex-
cuse to get President Trump out of of-
fice. But at least that investigation by
Mueller was a powerful indictment of
our government’s lax enforcement of
the Foreign Agents Registration Act
and also of our willingness to take the
bait of foreign powers seeking to wreak
havoc on our civic discourse.
In the wake of the Mueller investiga-
tion, it is on us, right here in the Con-
gress, to keep our eye on the ball. It is
on us to strengthen our defenses
against hidden foreign influence and
preserve the voice of the American peo-
ple. I believe with the introduction of
the bipartisan Foreign Agents Disclo-
sure and Registration Enhancement
Act that we will accomplish these ends.
Again, I welcome a lot of additional
cosponsorship of my colleagues. This is
definitely a good government piece of
legislation.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

SIDY). The clerk will call the roll.

FLOODING IN ILLINOIS
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Satur-
day morning, I was in Alton, IL. This
picture here is what we saw. You have
to look closely to understand what I
am looking at here. These grain ele-
vators are in downtown Alton, IL, and
this is the Mississippi River, which has
now risen to the point that it is just
below this red line. I know this red line
a little bit because it marks the 1993
flood level of the same Mississippi
River, so we are almost there. We were
hoping over the weekend that the river
would crest and that Alton and so
many other communities in the Mid-
west would be spared further flooding.
The interesting thing is, when I went
down there to talk to the people en-
gaged in the recovery effort and trying
to help fight these floodwaters, there
was an insight I was really surprised to
hear. I asked them what is different
about this flood, because we get lots of
floods in the Midwest. The difference
with this flood, according to those who
have done the research, is this is a
flood of longer duration than any flood
we have seen since 1927.
When I spoke to the mayor of the
town of Alton, IL, I said: So this comes
and goes? He said: It never goes, Sen-
ator. We have had six floods in the last
10 years that were supposed to be
breaking historic records.
So let’s step back for a minute and
take an honest look at this, if we can,
and realize that we are living in a little
different world this year than we did
just a few years ago. The extreme
weather events, which we hear reported
every single day, suggest that some-
thing is going on beyond just changes
in the weather. When we see rainfall
and snowfall in the upper Midwest,
which is now responsible for this flood-
ing situation here, we have to ask our-
selves the obvious question: Is this just
a one-off event, or are we seeing the
new normal? And if this is the new nor-
mal, are we prepared for it?
When these floodwaters hopefully re-
cede in the very near future, there will
be a lot of repair work to be done.
There is a lot of damage to homes,
businesses, and families. But then
there will be a big question: What do
we do next? If this is the new normal in
our weather patterns, if we are in fact
seeing a change in our climate around

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3308 June 11, 2019
the United States and around the
world, how will we respond? My first
concern, of course, is my home State of
Illinois and the folks who are kind
enough to let me serve them in the
U.S. Senate.
I want to do everything I can to work
with the Army Corps of Engineers,
which is a critical part of flood protec-
tion for the Midwest. These earthen
levees you will see along the shorelines
of the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers
have been sorely taxed by these flood-
waters. When they are drenched and
soaked over long periods of time, they
tend to weaken. We count on the Army
Corps of Engineers and the good people
locally to step forward and help us for-
tify these levees. We need to continue
to do that, maybe even more so be-
cause of the frequency of the floods we
are seeing in the Midwest.
But we have a responsibility here in
Washington too. What are we doing
about the climate change that is hap-
pening around the world? What are we
doing to make sure our kids and
grandkids will inherit an Earth that is
habitable and that won’t face these
kinds of awful occurrences on a regular
basis? Are we willing to make sac-
rifices and changes in the comfort of
our own lives just a little bit so that
our kids and grandkids have a world
that they can live in, a world that is
habitable, that they can pass on to the
next generation? I don’t think that is
too much to ask.
There was an agreement reached a
few years ago in Paris. Every nation in
the world signed up to do something.
Every single nation in the world signed
up to do something to reach a common
goal of stopping the warming of this
planet and everything that has fol-
lowed. Then what happened with the
election of this President? President
Trump stepped forward and said: Count
us out. The United States is not in the
Paris Agreement any longer. We are
the only nation in the world to step
away from that agreement. The rest of
the world understands the gravity of
this challenge. Today, it is the floods
in the Midwest. Tomorrow, it will be
that tornado in Oklahoma. The list
goes on and on and on.
I stand ready to work with everyone
I can locally to deal with this, but I
also plead with this administration—
open your eyes to the reality of cli-
mate change in the world and what it
is doing to the extreme weather pat-
terns we currently face.
Our Governor, J. B. Pritzker, has de-
clared a disaster in 34 of Illinois’s 102
counties—about a third of the State.
Four hundred Illinois National Guard
men and women members are working
sometimes around the clock to do their
part, and my hat is off to them and
their families for their extraordinary
sacrifice.
The levees, like the Nutwood Levee,
which isn’t far from Alton, IL, were
breached by floodwaters, and over the
past week, a small town was evacuated.
State and local officials have urged ev-
eryone there to be careful and make
certain that they do everything they
can to protect themselves and their
property.
When you take a look at this picture
taken in Alton, IL, you don’t see the
real story. There are a few people, fam-
ilies who are looking at floodwaters,
but the real story is the coordinated ef-
fort, which is heartwarming. It is not
just the Federal agencies, like the
Corps of Engineers and the Coast
Guard; it is not just the State agencies,
like the Illinois Emergency Manage-
ment Agency; it is the local units of
government, like the city of Alton and
so many other cities, that have come
together to coordinate their efforts and
to make the best of what they have.
It is also an effort by a lot of chari-
table organizations. As you might ex-
pect, the Red Cross was on the scene
almost immediately, and we also know
the Salvation Army has been involved
as well. They are all doing their part to
make sure we work together.
But the one group that should be rec-
ognized—they may not have a formal
title—are the men and women, the
families and community leaders who
stepped up and rolled up their sleeves
to fill the sandbags to help their neigh-
bors. It is not just a midwestern thing,
but it is a midwestern thing, as far as
I am concerned. Our people and our
families across my State time and
again step up to lend a helping hand to
one another. In this time of need with
this kind of flooding damage in Alton
and all across our State, it does my
heart proud to see that these folks
have once again responded to this call.
I yield the floor.

S. 546
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I
rise for the swift passage of bipartisan
legislation I am leading with Senator
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND known as the
Never Forget the Heroes: Permanent
Authorization of the September 11th
Victim Compensation Fund Act.
I will never forget the images of the
brave men and women running into
danger to save lives during the Sep-
tember 11 terrorist attacks. I never had
the privilege or honor of going to New
York City prior to September 11, 2001,
but I will never forget my first visit
after September 11, 2001, going to
Ground Zero, watching the firetrucks,
with their flag, heading to Ground Zero
to continue to work, and now that has
become absolutely emblazoned in the
minds of the people of this country.
The work they did wasn’t just for
those in Manhattan who suffered in-
credible loss but the work they carried
forth for our country—they became
symbols of our security, symbols of our
freedoms, symbols of our country’s
willingness, effort, and tenacity to
fight back.
This legislation would ensure that all
9/11 first responders and survivors who
have been injured by the toxins at
Ground Zero would receive their full
compensation through the September
11th Victim Compensation Fund now
and into the future as more and more
become ill with 9/11-related cancers.
When I visited Ground Zero, I will
never forget that smell—a burning,
acrid odor. These men and women
didn’t just visit it once but time and
again to carry out the cleanup of
Ground Zero. Unfortunately, thousands
of first responders and survivors, in-
cluding many who reside in my home
State of Colorado, now suffer from ill-
nesses and diseases from the toxins
they inhaled day after day during the
recovery efforts at Ground Zero.
It is unacceptable for this Congress
to fail these heroes and their families.
It is unacceptable to fail the families
and heroes of September 11. There is no
time to waste as Congress debates this
issue. More and more people are be-
coming ill, more and more people are
suffering. Today people such as Lou Al-
varez came to Washington, DC, post-
poning a chemotherapy treatment to
advocate for his fellow heroes.
The fund expires at the end of this
year if we do not act. These men and
women have already been forced to re-
duce their compensation. We have seen
a reduction of their compensation for 9/
11 first responders due to the impend-
ing insolvency.
Jon Stewart, a longtime advocate for
the 9/11 responders, testified today be-
fore the House Judiciary Committee,
expressing the urgency of making sure
these first responders receive the care
they deserve. He testified before mem-
bers of the committee in the House
about the need to act now because time
is of the essence. He said that these
men and women ‘‘responded in 5 sec-
onds. They did their jobs, with courage,
grace, tenacity, humility . . . 18 years
later’’ it is time for Congress to do its
job.
That is what I hope my colleagues
will do—our job. Pass this important
bipartisan legislation, recognizing the
service and the sacrifice of these great
heroes of 9/11.
Tomorrow the House companion leg-
islation will be marked up in the Judi-
ciary Committee. Congress must do the
right thing. The Senate must do our
job, and it must act on this legislation.
I urge my colleagues to join this legis-
lation to cosponsor the bill, to support
this effort, and to support the effort in
the House and Senate to swiftly pass
this legislation to ensure these heroes
receive the care they need and deserve.
We didn’t know what was going to
happen on September 11, but for the
thousands of people involved at Ground
Zero, we know what will happen if Con-
gress fails to act. It is unacceptable.

VIRGINIA BEACH CITY HALL SHOOTING
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to
talk about a sad tragedy that occurred
in Virginia on May 31—the shooting
deaths of 12 individuals in Virginia
Beach.
It was a Friday. I was in Virginia
Beach that day having meetings in the
community on the boardwalk at a
hotel with the Old Dominion Bar Asso-
ciation. It was a meeting about sea
level rise with interested constituents.
I had just left Virginia Beach to drive
back to my home, and after I left,
within a couple of hours, I got word
about a shooting at the Virginia Beach
City Hall.
This is a city hall I know well. I was
the mayor of Richmond and used to
work closely with the mayor of Vir-
ginia Beach at that time. I also tried
cases in the courthouse right there
near Virginia Beach City Hall when I
served as a private attorney in private
practice.
I rise to talk about these 12 victims
but also talk about my hope that the
Virginia Beach shooting will lead us to
stop being bystanders and take mean-
ingful action to reduce gun violence.
If I could say a few words about each
of the 12 individuals who were killed at
Virginia Beach: Laquita Brown was a 4-
year employee of the department of
public works. She was known for her
love of travel, her friends, and her abil-
ity to light up a room with her pres-
ence.
Ryan Keith Cox was a 12-year em-
ployee of the city. He had worked with
the department of public utilities, was
known for his kindness and beautiful
singing voice. He became known just in
the hours after the shooting as some-
body who ran into danger looking for
more people to save after ensuring his
workers were sheltered in a barricaded
room. He saved many lives on that hor-
rible day and was killed himself doing
so.
Tara Gallagher was a 6-year em-
ployee at the city of Virginia Beach.
She worked as an engineer to provide
clean drinking water to people. She
was murdered in the shooting.
Mary Louise Gayle had worked for 24
years for the city in public works. She
was known as a cheerful coworker and
devoted mother and grandmother.
Alexander Mikhail Gusev was a 9-
year employee of the city, emigrated
from Belarus to Virginia Beach to find
a better life. He was known as a gen-
erous and devoted coworker, friend,
uncle, and brother. He was murdered
that day.
Joshua Hardy worked for the city for
4 years in the department of public
utilities. He was known for his kind-
hearted nature, love for family and
faith.
Michelle ‘‘Missy’’ Langer worked for
the city for 12 years and was known for
her beaming smile and passion for the
Pittsburgh Steelers. We have a lot of
Steelers fans in Virginia. She had plans
to retire soon. She was murdered that
day.
Rick Nettleton was a 28-year em-
ployee of the city. He was a selfless
leader in regional utility system plan-
ning and a veteran of the 130th Engi-
neer Brigade of the Army.
Kate Nixon was a 10-year employee of
the city who was known for her intel-
lect. She was a loving wife and mother
of three.
Chris Kelly Rapp had just been there
11 months as a city employee. He was
known for his kindness and passion for
playing the bagpipes. I met a couple at
the memorial whose wedding he had
graced with his bagpipe playing. He
was devoted to his wife.
Bert Snelling was one of the 12 who
was not a city employee. He was a con-
tractor. He had come to the municipal
center to get a permit that day, like so
many people who walk into the build-
ing permits office to get a permit. I
learned a lot about Bert because he was
a contractor who had done the car-
pentry renovations on the mayor’s
home. The mayor talked about be-
friending this wonderful contractor in
the community.
Then, finally, there was Bobby Wil-
liams. Bobby had worked for the city
for 41 years in the department of public
utilities. During the course of his time
with Virginia Beach, he was awarded
with eight service awards in recogni-
tion of his devoted work for the city,
and he was planning on retiring later
this year.
These were 12 beautiful people—12
lives lost—who had track records of ac-
complishment and more to give. They
were new employees, 41-year employ-
ees, single, married with children,
grandchildren. All just wanted to serve
their colleagues. That is why they were
there. They wanted to serve their fel-
low citizens of Virginia Beach.
I want to commend the response of
city employees. Some of them alerted
coworkers and pulled them into the
shelter, saving unknowable numbers of
lives.
I want to commend Virginia Beach
officers. They responded within min-
utes of the first shootings. They hero-
ically risked their lives, all four of
them. Although they had all trained,
including a training session the day be-
fore, most had not trained together.
Imagine that you get this call and the
four of you are going into a building
where there is a shooting underway.
You haven’t trained together, but you
are trying to put your training to use.
They did remarkable work.
One of the officers was shot while
confronting the gunman. He survived
because he was wearing a bulletproof
vest that was likely funded by a bullet-
proof vest program through which the
Senate and the House have, for years,
enabled local jurisdictions to have bul-
letproof vests.
The gunman, who was killed in the
firefight, was carrying high-caliber
handguns with high-capacity ammuni-
tion magazines. By some reports, the
magazines allowed the gun to fire up to
30 rounds in automatic succession. And
he was carrying suppressors that sup-
pressed the noise of these weapons,
which made it more difficult for the re-
sponding officers to determine where
the shooting was happening.
I want to commend the emergency
personnel for treating the wounded and
also those who have responded to the
mental health needs of the families of
the wounded and killed, of other city
employees, of friends of the city em-
ployees, and of the entire community
that was brutalized by this. These
deaths have robbed Virginia Beach of
some wonderful neighbors who served
their communities in many ways.
I went to a memorial service a week
after the shooting, last Thursday, June
6. I went to the memorial and saw the
mountains of flowers that had been left
by crosses with each of the names of
the 12 on them. While I was there, I vis-
ited with everyday people who were
coming by to pay respects. They want-
ed to tell me how proud they were of
their city, the city employees, the
bravery and heroism, and people pull-
ing together. I met a couple for whom
one of the guys had played bagpipes at
their wedding. I met the mother of one
of the victims and family members of
others.
When they saw elected officials
there, they wanted to talk about their
pride in their city, but they also want-
ed to share with us as elected officials
that we need to do something. It was a
reminder that no place is safe and no
place is immune to the epidemic of gun
violence. Again and again, what people
said to me is ‘‘I couldn’t have imagined
that this would have happened here.’’
But we have said that about schools;
we have said that about night clubs; we
have said that about concerts; we have
said that about colleges; we have said
that about communities all over this
country—churches, synagogues, Sikh
temples: ‘‘I couldn’t have imagined
that this would happen here.’’
We can’t forget that sometimes in-
stances like this, in which there is
mass violence, get headlines. We had a
9-year-old girl in Richmond who was
killed at a neighborhood park by a gun-
shot a couple of weeks back. We had a
shooting in Chesapeake, VA, near in
time to the massacre of these 12, where
many were injured—a mass shooting
that affected a backyard barbecue.
Many of those people were injured and
were taken to the hospital.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3310 June 11, 2019
I have had painful experience with
this. I was the Governor of Virginia
during what, at the time, was the worst
shooting in the history of the United
States—the massacre at Virginia Tech
on April 16, 2007. It was the worst day
of my life. It is always going to be the
worst day of my life, responding and
immediately going to a campus and
dealing with 32 families who had lost
their kids, their spouses—students,
grad students, professors, trying to
deal with them in their grief, trying to
provide answers, and trying to come up
with solutions.
I was the mayor of Richmond at a
time when our city had the second
highest homicide rate in the United
States.
Both of those experiences have given
me a lot of scar tissue, so much so that
when I hear of an instance like this in
Virginia—just as other Virginians have
the same feeling—you have both the
fresh emotions of horror and sadness,
and you feel like a bandaid has been
torn off because you are reliving expe-
riences that we have had to go through
too many times.
Yet the one thing I have learned—
and I have learned a lot, but the one
thing I have learned is that we don’t
have to stand by and say that nothing
can be done. I have learned that the
pain is real, but there are solutions. In
the midst of a horrible crime epidemic
in Richmond, we took meaningful steps
that brought the homicide rate down
by 60 percent and reduced violent crime
dramatically. You can take action. If
you can take action that will keep peo-
ple safer, then you have an obligation
to take action.
In the aftermath of the shooting at
Virginia Tech—where a deranged indi-
vidual got the weapons of destruction
that killed 32 people and wounded an-
other couple dozen—we learned he got
his weapons because of a glitch in the
background check system. I was able
to fix part of it with an executive
order. There was more I wanted to do
to make background checks universal
and to make sure guns would not go
into the hands of individuals deemed
too dangerous to have them by Federal
laws that have been on the books for
decades, but some of what I wanted to
do legislatively I couldn’t get my legis-
lature to do. At least we learned that if
you have a better background check
system, more people will be safer. If we
banned high-capacity magazines, more
people would be safer.
We have learned that there are steps
you can take to keep people safer, and
if you can take those steps, yet you
choose not to, you are a bystander to
this horrible violence.
On Monday morning, just yesterday,
I met with community leaders in Char-
lottesville to discuss gun violence.
Charlottesville is a community that
has been deeply affected by violence in
the last couple of years because of the
riot led by White supremacists and
Neo-Nazis, which caused the deaths of
three people in August 2017. They un-
derstand violence. They understand the
pain of it. They understand missing
people who are contributing members
of the community. They wanted to talk
about what we needed to do. They were
frustrated. They were frustrated by a
General Assembly of Virginia and a
Congress of the United States being by-
standers and not being willing to take
actions we need to take.
One teacher in our meeting told a
very vivid story about how she has had
to rearrange her classroom. She keeps
a filing cabinet next to the front door.
The door opens from the hall into her
classroom. She has positioned a full fil-
ing cabinet next to the door, and she
has figured out how to race to that
cabinet and tip it over to block the
door from being opened. Imagine that
you go to school to be a teacher. You
are trained in pedagogy. You are
trained in how to motivate youngsters
of all kinds. They don’t teach you how
to stop an active shooter, but we have
to start teaching all our teachers how
to do it. This teacher talked about it.
The teacher talked about the drills
they have to have in the first week of
school every year. She has to take her
class of elementary students into a
bathroom, which is their designated
hiding spot. She is taught to stand in
front of the door of the bathroom and
block it from being opened, so if there
were a shooting going on and there
were shots being fired through the
door, she would be the one who would
be injured or killed rather than her
students. Imagine expecting that of our
elementary school students in the
United States circa 2019.
We have a sickness when we expect
elementary school teachers to have to
herd their kids into bathrooms. Imag-
ine what the little second and third
graders think when going into these
drills. Even if they never have an ac-
tive shooting incident, imagine what
impression the drills make on their
minds. We have a sickness.
The Virginians I talked to yesterday
said: Look, we have to do something
about it. Virginians are asking our
General Assembly and our Congress to
take action.
I am encouraged that the Governor of
Virginia has undertaken a fairly un-
usual step. He has called the General
Assembly back into session. The ses-
sion is over in Virginia. He has called
them back for a session on July 9 to
consider gun safety measures that he is
going to put on the table. Everybody
can be held accountable. They can vote
yes or no and propose amendments. No-
body will be able to hide. People have
to be held accountable as to whether
they are willing to take steps to keep
people safe.
No single fix will prevent all gun vio-
lence. Each incident is different. Each
person, each perpetrator, each victim
is different. There is not one thing we
are going to be able to do that is going
to end gun violence or violence gen-
erally. That is not in our capacity to
do.
I will tell you something. If there
were a bridge collapse on an interstate
in my State, we would be there imme-
diately, trying to figure out how to fix
the highways of our State. If there
were an epidemic, we would be imme-
diately figuring out how to come up
with a vaccine.
When we have this repetitive catas-
trophe of gun deaths in this country,
then we also have to be challenged to
act. I applaud my Governor for recog-
nizing that and pulling my legislature
back on July 9. I wish them the best.
I hope we will do something here. We
haven’t had a meaningful debate about
gun violence and gun safety regula-
tions and laws on the floor of this body
since April of 2013. I remember it well.
I had just come to the Senate. It was
almost precisely on the sixth anniver-
sary of the shooting of Virginia Tech.
We had a debate on the floor of the
Senate about universal background
checks, which 90 percent of Americans
support. We had that debate in April of
2013. It was in the aftermath of the
shooting at Sandy Hook. Little kids
were massacred in their elementary
school by these high-capacity weapons,
and we had that debate.
The families of many of the victims
of Sandy Hook were sitting in the Gal-
lery surrounding us. Some were sitting
next to family members for Virginia
Tech or other shootings who had come
to provide them support. There is a
beautiful phrase in the letter of Paul to
the Hebrews that talks about being
surrounded by a ‘‘great cloud of wit-
nesses.’’ That day, we had an oppor-
tunity to act to keep Americans safer,
and we were surrounded by a ‘‘great
cloud of witnesses’’ who were sitting in
the Gallery, just hoping that we might
act to reduce the likelihood of crimes
of this kind happening in the future,
and we fell a few votes short. What a
horrible day.
You don’t want to fall short on some-
thing that is important, and you espe-
cially don’t want to fall short when
people whose lives have been irradi-
cably torn up by violence are sitting
around, hoping that you will do the
right thing. Yet we fell a few votes
short.
We have an opportunity now. We can
return—it is interesting, isn’t it? I am
thinking of the pages who have been
here most recently. We haven’t had
that discussion for the last 6 years.
There have been a lot of shootings in
the last 6 years. Tomorrow is the anni-
versary of the shooting at the Pulse
nightclub where 49 people were killed.
We had the shooting at the Pulse
nightclub that killed 49 people. More
than 50 people were gunned down in a
concert in Las Vegas. There were
shootings at synagogues in California
and Pittsburgh, shootings in Christian
churches in Charleston—gun crime
after gun crime in neighborhoods, sui-
cides facilitated by guns, children find-
ing loaded guns that were unlocked and
killing themselves or killing or wound-
ing others. There has been tragedy

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3311
June 11, 2019
after tragedy after tragedy. Yet there
has not been a debate on the floor of
the Senate since April of 2013.
I think it is time to have a debate.
Guess what. We have an opportunity.
There are two bills that have been
passed by the House, by strong mar-
gins, that are now pending before this
body. I ask that the Senate leadership
allow us to have debates and votes on
these bills.
One is a bill that would require back-
ground checks on all firearm sales in
the country. There is a bipartisan con-
sensus that certain people should not
have weapons—felons, folks adju-
dicated mentally ill and dangerous,
folks who are subjected to domestic vi-
olence protective orders. Yet the only
way we can enforce those laws is by
having a working background check
system to make sure that before a
weapon gets put into somebody’s hand,
we ensure that he is not prohibited
from having a weapon.
One of the House bills would make
the national background check system
universal. We should take that bill up
and debate it and vote on it on the
floor of the greatest deliberative body
in the world, the U.S. Senate.
The second bill that is pending here
also deals with the background check
system and deals with the quirk that
has been known as the Charleston loop-
hole. Just like with the Virginia Tech
shooter, he got his weapons but
shouldn’t have been able to have got-
ten them because of his mental health
adjudication. He got them because of
there being a weakness in the back-
ground check system. In Charleston,
another weakness showed itself. The
individual who got the weapons and
perpetrated that horrible atrocity in
the church was not able to get a weap-
on, but there was a problem with the
background check system. Current
Federal law says, if you try to buy a
weapon and then the background check
is run on you and the check isn’t done
in 3 weeks, they have to put the weap-
on in your hand even though the check
isn’t done, even though you are prohib-
ited from having a weapon. If they
can’t do it in 3 weeks, you get the
weapon even though it is illegal for you
to have the weapon. What kind of sense
does that make? That is known as the
Charleston loophole.
The House has passed a bill that
would end that, that would say that
you don’t get the weapon until it has
been confirmed that you are legally
able to have that weapon. That bill is
in the Senate right now, and we should
be able to take it up.
I hope we will take up Federal legis-
lation that I have filed with others to
restrict high-capacity magazines to 10
rounds. I have introduced these bills in
the past. So often, the police stop a le-
thal shooting, not at the start but
when somebody is changing out a mag-
azine. That gives some precious sec-
onds to trained law enforcement offi-
cers to stop a crime before it gets
worse. In the Parkland shooting in
Florida last year, police stopped the
shooter because, as he was changing
out the weapon, putting in the next
magazine—he was not a trained marks-
man—he jammed the gun. That was
what enabled the police to stop him or
the carnage there would have been
worse.
I would like to ban high-capacity
magazines and limit them to 10. We
should be able to do this because we al-
ready do it. In Virginia, as in virtually
every State, we have a magazine limit.
We put a limit on the number of rounds
you can put in a magazine if you are
hunting a bird or, in many States, if
you are hunting a deer. Why do we
have limitations on magazines that are
used by hunters? Because it wouldn’t
be fair to the animal. It would not be
fair to an animal to allow somebody
with a high-capacity magazine to hunt
it.
Are our sensibilities about animals
so different than they are about hu-
mans? Do we want to protect animals
more than we want to protect humans?
If we accept bans and limitations on
magazines that are used in hunting,
why wouldn’t we embrace a well-craft-
ed limitation on high-capacity maga-
zines that go into weapons that aren’t
for hunting animals but that are de-
signed to kill or to wound people?
I think Congress can encourage
State, local, and Tribal governments to
adopt extreme risk protection orders
that would remove firearms from the
hands of individuals who exhibit signs
of mental health crises—weapons that
can be returned to them once the signs
of crises are over. I also hope we will
consider legislation—Senator KLO-
BUCHAR of Minnesota has promoted this
for years—to prevent domestic abusers
from keeping guns.
The bottom line is this. After each
tragedy, we have an opportunity to
learn and improve. There are Ameri-
cans, even those who support guns in
my State and even NRA members, who
strongly support many of the common-
sense measures that I have mentioned.
The question is, Are we just going to
keep offering platitudes or are we
going to act to actually protect our
communities?
Finally, after a high-profile shooting,
it is common for us to offer thoughts
and prayers to the victims. Some peo-
ple get mad about that. I don’t. That is
really important. We should be offering
thoughts and prayers to victims. It is
an instinctive and common response
that is a good response, and we should
do it.
We also ask questions about per-
petrators. What was the motive? Why
did the person do this? We have a lot of
unanswered questions about the city
employee who shot 12 people in Vir-
ginia Beach—answers that we don’t
know and, in some instances, may
never know. We don’t yet have a good
explanation for the motivation, for ex-
ample, of the shooter who killed more
than 50 people in Las Vegas.
Yet, while thoughts and prayers for
victims are appropriate and questions
about perpetrators are appropriate, I
think what the rest of us ought to do is
look in the mirror and ask some ques-
tions about ourselves. It is hard for evil
to exist in the world sometimes if there
aren’t bystanders. For most of the evil
that exists in the world, there are by-
standers who could stop it. Sadly, in
recent years, the Congress of the
United States and my State legislature
have been bystanders.
There are questions that we have to
ask ourselves as we have bills pending
in the Senate that could be considered
right now after the latest one of these
tragedies. Are we going to continue to
be bystanders? Will we respond to these
tragedies with more than just thoughts
and prayers when there are steps to be
taken that we know will keep people
safer? Will we have a meaningful de-
bate and, hopefully, find a path forward
with regard to them or will we con-
tinue the kind of gag rule that we will
not take these matters up and not talk
about them?
Those are the questions that are on
the floor for the body, and I hope that
the Senate will show courage and lead-
ership in addressing these matters.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.

REMEMBERING DR. MARY
PAULINE FOX
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
my privilege to pay tribute to Dr. Mary
Pauline Fox, a pioneer of public health
in the Commonwealth of Kentucky,
who passed away earlier this year at
the age of 87. Mary’s remarkable life
included more than four decades of
service to eastern Kentucky commu-
nities, and the full effect of her legacy
will continue to be felt throughout the
region for years to come.
Mary began her exceptional career at
the age of 19, graduating from Union
College in Barbourville, KY. A trail-
blazer in her time, she then attended
the University of Louisville’s medical
school as one of only five women in a
class of 100. Mary also holds the dis-
tinction as one of the early women to
participate in the Reserve Officers
Training Corps.
Soon after beginning her career as a
doctor, the Kentucky Department of
Health appointed Mary as a regional
director, and for the next 7 years she
oversaw healthcare delivery in 20 east-
ern Kentucky counties. Afterward, she
served as the director of the Pike
County Health Department for more
than two decades. Mary only agreed to
retire from her position after funding
was secured to build the current health
department facility located in
Pikeville. To this day, that facility
continues to operate in the same build-
ing, which now bears her name.
Even at the end of her career, Mary
refused to slow down. In coordination
with the U.S. Department of State, she
was part of the first public health
group in our country invited to China.
She remained committed to her com-
munity, giving sought-after lectures on
public health issues throughout the
Commonwealth.
As a healer and a teacher, Mary made
our Commonwealth a better place.
Elaine and I commend her for her life-
time of service to others, and we send
our condolences to her family and
friends.
f
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH
AMENDMENT
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on a
Spring day in April 1891 in Lombard,
IL, Ellen Martin, an attorney, and 14
other women marched to their voting
place at the local general store to do
something most of us take for granted
today. They demanded to be allowed to
vote. The town charter enfranchised all
citizens and did not mention sex.
Stunned polling judges were forced to
allow Ellen Martin and the 14 to vote.
One account had a judge so flab-
bergasted that he fell into a flour bar-
rel.
But this momentary right to vote
was short-lived. The Lombard town
council quickly changed the charter to,
once again, allow only men to vote, but
the spark had been struck. Four
months later, the Illinois State charter
was changed to allow women to vote in
local school elections.
It took 28 years after that day in
April for American women to achieve
the right to vote. On this 100th anni-
versary of the passage of the 19th
Amendment, we honor Ellen Martin
and the countless other supporters of
women’s suffrage.
Sadly, Ellen Martin died in 1916. She
did not live to see the 19th Amendment
pass.
The women of my home State of Illi-
nois won limited voting rights in 1913
through the legendary work of Grace
Wilbur Trout, Jane Addams, Frances
Willard, and countless others. Women
had the right to vote only for Presi-
dential electors and most local offices,
but not for Governor, State representa-
tives, or Members of Congress.
In Chicago, icon Ida B. Wells-Barnett
founded the Alpha Suffrage Club in 1913
to educate African-American women
about the right to vote. Their power at
the polls helped elect Chicago’s first
Black alderman, Oscar DePriest, in
1914.
Women continued to organize across
the country as many States granted
suffrage. Both parties’ Presidential
candidates endorsed women’s suffrage
in 1916, and Montana elected Jeannette
Rankin to the House of Representa-
tives. There were still many fights
ahead, but slowly, the country came
around to women’s suffrage.
Five years after Illinois gave women
the right to vote in some elections,
Congress passed the 19th Amendment
giving women the right in all elections.
This was the same amendment Susan
B. Anthony brought to Congress in
1878. More than 70 years after the Sen-
eca Falls Convention, the suffragettes
had persevered and succeeded.
I am proud to say Illinois was the
first State to ratify the 19th Amend-
ment, but the work is unfinished.
This Congress has the most women in
its ranks in the history of the body.
The first woman Speaker of the House
NANCY PELOSI returned to her leader-
ship post with 102 women as her col-
leagues in the House of Representa-
tives, including Representatives CHERI
BUSTOS, ROBIN KELLY, JAN SCHA-
KOWSKY, and LAUREN UNDERWOOD of my
home State. I am privileged to work
with 25 powerful women Senators, one
of whom was the first Senator, TAMMY
DUCKWORTH, to ever give birth while in
office.
The force of history is demanding we
do more to make this a fairer and equal
country. We have more women in office
than ever, and women are 51 percent of
the electorate, but less than a third of
elected legislative bodies are women.
President Kennedy signed the Equal
Pay Act in 1963; yet the pay gap be-
tween men and women is just as real
today as it was then. Women are still
earning 78 cents for every dollar earned
by men. For women of color, the gap is
even greater with African-American
women making 64 cents, while Hispanic
women make only 56 cents.
State after State are imposing draco-
nian laws on reproductive rights. Roe
v. Wade has never been in more danger.
We have the duty and privilege of hon-
oring the sacrifice of those who
marched for women’s suffrage by en-
suring their heirs have the right to
choose.
As we honor the passage of the 19th
Amendment, let’s not forget that we

are still waiting to pass the Equal
Rights Amendment. In 2023, it will be

the Equal Rights Amendment was in-
troduced. Women have waited long
enough for its ratification. Our genera-
tion must get it done.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
25TH ANNIVERSARY OF PROJECT
SHARE
∑ Mr. KING. Madam President, today I
wish to recognize the 25th anniversary
of the Salmon Habitat and River En-
hancement Program, known as Project
SHARE. SHARE has spent the last
quarter of a century focused on river
habitat restoration in Downeast Maine,
specifically for Atlantic salmon.
Thanks to SHARE and its many part-
ners, hundreds of restoration projects
have been completed, improving
Maine’s waterways for marine life.
Founded in 1994, SHARE was built on
the recognition that, without direct ac-
tion, Atlantic salmon would go extinct
from habitat destruction and over-
fishing. SHARE’s work has focused on
improving Maine’s streams and rivers,
a crucial habitat for salmon, as they
require freshwater to breed. The orga-
nization uses a diverse range of meth-
ods during their projects, from the ad-
dition of clamshells to the stream or
river in order to balance pH levels, to
adding open bottom arch culverts and
bridges to more effectively spread nu-
trients and ease passage in the water-
ways. While the goal of these projects
is to help Atlantic salmon, the rest of
Maine’s marine life benefit from the
improved living conditions in our
fresh-water streams and rivers.
A hallmark of SHARE’s success has
been its emphasis on building partner-
ships in order to achieve its goals.
SHARE has valued these partners since
the beginning, when a wide range of
State agencies, land owners, research
and conservation groups, and more
signed on as charter members. Their
focus on cooperation between public
and private entities has clearly paid
off, as they have completed more than
250 restoration projects in just the last
15 years. A key part of these partner-
ships is the work SHARE does with
Maine’s students. Including students
from local schools and universities in
their restoration projects has allowed
SHARE to pass on the methods used to
improve the safety and habitability of
our waterways and the importance of
Atlantic salmon to Maine and the rest
of the country.
I would like to thank Project SHARE
for their 25 years of commitment to
improving Maine’s waterways for At-
lantic salmon and other marine life.
Thanks to their hard work, 2,800 habi-
tat units have been improved, with
many more projects planned in the
years to come. SHARE’s dedication to
protecting and restoring outdoor habi-
tats ensures that Maine’s wildlife will
continue to thrive. Congratulations
Project SHARE on reaching this im-
pressive milestone, I look forward to
seeing your work over the next 25
years.∑

June 11, 2019
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–81. A concurrent memorial adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona
urging the United States Congress to exclude
federal reserved water rights from any future
designation of federal lands in Arizona; to
the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources.
HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 2004
Whereas, states are the primary authority
for allocating, administering, protecting and
developing water resources, and are pri-
marily responsible for water supply planning
within their boundaries; and
Whereas, states have the ultimate say in
managing their water resources and are best
suited to speak to the unique nature of water
law and hydrology, particularly in western
states such as Arizona; and
Whereas, states have primary authority to
issue and manage water rights and are re-
sponsible for controlling and managing sur-
face water and groundwater located within
their boundaries, subject to international
treaties, interstate agreements and judicial
decrees; and
Whereas, Congress recognized states as the
sole authority over non-navigable waters, in-
cluding groundwater, and the United States
Supreme Court has upheld this authority;
and
Whereas, federal reserved water rights
apply to waters within various types of fed-
eral land designations, including national
parks, national forests and wildlife refuges;
and
Whereas, federal reserved water rights dif-
fer from state appropriated water rights and
may take priority over the water rights of
individuals whose application dates are es-
tablished later than the date of the federal
withdrawal, even if the individuals are using
the water at the time of withdrawal; and
Whereas, the exclusion of federal reserved
water rights on any new federal designations
in this state would allow Arizona to inte-
grate the federal reserved water rights with
the state administratively adjudicated water
rights so that water sources can be managed
with greater certainty. Wherefore your
memorialist, the House of Representatives of
the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring,
prays:
1. That the United States Congress take
steps to require that any new federal areas
designated within the State of Arizona not
include any water right that prevents the
State of Arizona from comprehensively man-
aging its water resources.
2. That the Secretary of State of the State
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial
to the President of the United States Senate,
the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives and each Member of Con-
gress from the State of Arizona.
POM–82. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico re-
questing the United States Congress pass
H.R. 2360 which seeks to establish a Renew-
able Energy Grant Program within the
United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) for the purpose of promoting renew-
able energy in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Is-
lands of the United States; to the Committee
on Energy and Natural Resources.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 1084
Congressman Ted W. Lieu, the Resident
Commissioner of Puerto Rico in Washington
D.C., the Hon. Jenniffer González-Colón, and
Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett introduced
H. R. 2360 on April 25, 2019, which directs the
Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Re-
newable Energy Grant Program for the pur-
pose of awarding funds to not-for-profit enti-
ties so they may develop and use renewable
energy systems.
This legislation, which shall be known as
the ‘‘Renewable Energy for Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands Act,’’ seeks to pro-
mote investment in renewable energy, en-
ergy efficiency, energy storage, and
microgrid and smart grid projects. The orga-
nizations that are awarded these grants may
receive technical assistance from the De-
partment of Energy national laboratories.
Furthermore, the measure appropriates
funds for the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct a study regarding
renewable energy and energy efficiency in
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands of the
United States not later than one hundred
and eighty (180) days after the date of enact-
ment of the Act. The study shall consider
the potential to modify existing electric
power systems, use renewable energy
sources, expand the use of microgrids, and
improve energy resiliency.
It is worth noting that H.R. 2360 is con-
sistent with the recently approved Act No.
17–2019, known as the ‘‘Puerto Rico Energy
Public Policy Act,’’ which seeks to trans-
form our electrical system into one that is
robust, resilient, reliable, eco-friendly, and
affordable, and that serves as the basis for
the Island’s economic development. Act No.
17, supra, directs the elimination of electric
power generation from fossil fuels in Puerto
Rico and, for such purpose, establishes a new
and ambitious Renewable Portfolio Standard
that requires that forty percent (40%) energy
generation from renewable sources by 2025;
sixty percent (60%) by 2040; and one hundred
percent (100%) by 2050. In addition, it encour-
ages the use of energy storage technology for
all consumer levels, promotes the integra-
tion of distributed generation and
microgrids, and seeks to attain thirty per-
cent (30%) energy efficiency by 2040.
However, it is a fact that Puerto Rico and
the Virgin Islands are exposed to suffering
the consequences of catastrophic hurricanes
such as Irma and Maria which left millions
of U.S. citizens without electric power serv-
ice for a long period of time. The passage of
these two hurricanes in 2017 and the reality
of climate change has once again raised
awareness of the importance of having an
electrical system that is resilient to weather
events that have become stronger and more
frequent.
H.R. 2360 complements the efforts made by
the Government of Puerto Rico to transform
our electrical system and contributes to-
wards achieving one hundred percent (100%)
energy generation from renewable sources by
2050, therefore, the Senate of Puerto Rico
supports this important initiative.
Be it resolved by the Senate of Puerto Rico:
Section 1.—To express the support of the
Senate of Puerto Rico to, and request the
United States Congress to pass H.R. 2360
which seeks to establish a Renewable Energy
Grant Program within the United States De-
partment of Agriculture (USDA) for the pur-
pose of promoting renewable energy in Puer-
to Rico and the Virgin Islands of the United
States of America.
Section 2.—Upon its approval, a copy of
this Resolution translated into English shall
be delivered to the leadership of the United
States Congress, congress members Ted W.
Lieu and Stacey Plaskett, and the Resident
Commissioner of Puerto Rico in Washington
D.C., Jenniffer González-Colón.
Section 3.—This Resolution shall take ef-
fect upon its approval.
POM–83. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana
urging the United States Congress to take
such actions as are necessary to review and
consider eliminating provisions of federal
law which reduce Social Security benefits
for those receiving pension benefits from cer-
tain federal, state, or local government re-
tirement or pension systems, plans, or funds;
to the Committee on Finance.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 20
Whereas, the Congress of the United States
of America has enacted both the Government
Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal
and survivor Social Security benefit, and the
Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), re-
ducing the earned Social Security benefits
payable to any person who also receives a
public pension benefit; and
Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a
spouse or survivor receiving a federal, state,
or local government retirement or pension
benefit who would also be entitled to a So-
cial Security benefit earned by a spouse; and
Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the
spousal or survivor Social Security benefit
by two-thirds of the amount of the federal,
state, or local government retirement or
pension benefit received by the spouse or
survivor, in many cases completely elimi-
nating the Social Security benefit even
though their spouses paid Social Security
taxes for many years; and
Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on
hundreds of thousands of citizens and under-
mines the original purpose of the Social Se-
curity dependent/survivor benefit; and
Whereas, according to recent Social Secu-
rity Administration figures, more than half
a million individuals nationally are affected
by the GPO; and
Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons
who have earned federal, state, or local gov-
ernment retirement or pension benefits, in
addition to working in employment covered
under Social Security and paying into the
Social Security system; and
Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned So-
cial Security benefit using an averaged in-
dexed monthly earnings formula and may re-
duce Social Security benefits for affected
persons by as much as one-half of the retire-
ment benefit earned as a public servant in
employment not covered under Social Secu-
rity; and
Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking in-
dividuals to lose a significant portion of the
Social Security benefits that they earn
themselves; and
Whereas, according to recent Social Secu-
rity Administration figures, more than one
and a half million individuals nationally are
affected by the WEP; and
Whereas, in certain circumstances both the
WEP and GPO can be applied to a qualifying
survivor’s benefit, each independently reduc-
ing the available benefit and in combination
eliminating a large portion of the total So-
cial Security benefit available to the sur-
vivor; and
Whereas, because of the calculation char-
acteristics of the GPO and the WEP, they
have a disproportionately negative effect on
employees working in lower-wage govern-
ment jobs, like policemen, firefighters,
teachers, and state employees;
Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort
to improve the quality of life of its citizens
and to encourage them to live here lifelong,
yet the current GPO and WEP provisions
compromise their quality of life; and
Whereas, the number of people affected by
GPO and WEP is growing every day as more
and more people reach retirement age; and
Whereas, individuals drastically affected
by the GPO or WEP may have no choice but
to return to work after retirement in order
to make ends meet, but the earnings accu-
mulated during this return to work can fur-
ther reduce the Social Security benefits the
individual is entitled to; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3318 June 11, 2019
Whereas, the GPO and WEP are established
in federal law, and repeal of the GPO and the
WEP can only be enacted by congress: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana
does hereby memorialize the United States
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to review the Government Pension
Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provi-
sion Social Security benefit reductions and
to consider eliminating or reducing them;
and be it further
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be
transmitted to the presiding officers of the
Senate and the House of Representatives of
the Congress of the United States of America
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation.
POM–84. A joint resolution adopted by the
Legislature of the State of Maine urging the
President of the United States and the
United States Congress to support the re-
form of the Social Security offsets of the
Government Pension Offset and the Windfall
Elimination Provision; to the Committee on
Finance.
HOUSE PAPER NO. 1204
Whereas, under current federal law, indi-
viduals who receive a Social Security benefit
and a public retirement benefit derived from
employment not covered under Social Secu-
rity are subject to a reduction in the Social
Security benefits; and
Whereas, these laws, contained in the fed-
eral Social Security Act, 42 United States
Code, Chapter 7, Subchapter II, Federal Old-
Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
Benefits, and known as the Government Pen-
sion Offset and the Windfall Elimination
Provision, greatly affect public employees,
particularly women; and
Whereas, the Windfall Elimination Provi-
sion reduces by a formula the Social Secu-
rity benefit of a person who is also receiving
a pension from a public employer that does
not participate in Social Security; and
Whereas, the Government Pension Offset
and the Windfall Elimination Provision are
particularly burdensome on the finances of
low-income and moderate-income public
service workers, such as school teachers,
clerical workers and school cafeteria em-
ployees, whose wages are low to start; and
Whereas, the Government Pension Offset
and the Windfall Elimination Provision both
unfairly reduce benefits for those public em-
ployees and their spouses whose careers
cross the line between the private and public
sectors; and
Whereas, since many lower-paying public
service jobs are held by women, both the
Government Pension Offset and the Windfall
Elimination Provision have a disproportion-
ately adverse effect on women; and
Whereas, in some cases, additional support
in the form of income, housing, heating and
prescription drug and other safety net assist-
ance from state and local governments is
needed to make up for the reductions im-
posed at the federal level; and
Whereas, other participants in Social Se-
curity do not have their benefits reduced in
this manner; and
Whereas, to participate or not to partici-
pate in Social Security in public sector em-
ployment is a decision of employers, even
though both the Government Pension Offset
and the Windfall Elimination Provision di-
rectly punish employees and their spouses;
and
Whereas, although the Government Pen-
sion Offset was enacted in 1977 and the Wind-
fall Elimination Provision was enacted in
1983, many of the benefits in dispute were
paid into Social Security prior to that time;
now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, re-
spectfully urge and request that the Presi-
dent of the United States and the Congress
of the United States work together to sup-
port reform proposals that include the fol-
lowing protections for low-income and mod-
erate-income government retirees:
1. Protections permitting retention of a
combined public pension and Social Security
benefit with no applied reductions;
2. Protections permanently ensuring that
level of benefit by indexing it to inflation;
and
3. Protections ensuring that no current re-
cipient’s benefit is reduced by the reform
legislation; and be it further
Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso-
lution, duly authenticated by the Secretary
of State, be transmitted to the Honorable
Donald J. Trump, President of the United
States; the President of the United States
Senate; the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States; and each
Member of the Maine Congressional Delega-
tion.
POM–85. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
designating May 2019 as ‘‘Amyotrophic Lat-
eral Sclerosis Awareness Month’’ in Pennsyl-
vania; to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 122
Whereas, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) is better known as Lou Gehrig’s dis-
ease; and
Whereas, ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative
disease characterized by degeneration of cell
bodies of the upper and lower motor neurons
in the gray matter of the anterior horn of
the spinal cord; and
Whereas, The initial symptom of ALS is
weakness of the skeletal muscles, especially
those of the extremities; and
Whereas, As ALS progresses, the patient
experiences difficulty in swallowing, talking
and breathing; and
Whereas, ALS eventually causes muscles
to atrophy and the patient becomes a func-
tional quadriplegic; and
Whereas, Patients with ALS typically re-
main alert and are aware of the loss of motor
functions and the inevitable outcome of con-
tinued deterioration and death; and
Whereas, ALS affects military veterans at
twice the rate of the general population; and
Whereas, ALS occurs in adulthood, most
commonly between 40 and 70 years of age,
peaking at approximately 55 years of age,
and affects both men and women without
bias; and
Whereas, More than 5,000 new ALS patients
are diagnosed throughout the nation each
year; and
Whereas, In Pennsylvania there are cur-
rently more than 1,000 individuals who have
been formally diagnosed with ALS; and
Whereas, The $750,000 in State funding ap-
propriated by the General Assembly for ALS
support services for 2018–2019 provided serv-
ices to nearly 1,000 constituents and substan-
tial savings to the State budget and tax-
payers; and
Whereas, The ALS Association reports
that on average, patients diagnosed with
ALS only survive two to five years from the
time of diagnosis; and
Whereas, ALS has no known cause, preven-
tion or cure; and
Whereas, ‘‘Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
Awareness Month’’ increases the public’s
awareness of ALS patients’ circumstances
and acknowledges the negative impact this
disease has on ALS patients and their fami-
lies and recognizes the research being done
to eradicate ALS: Now therefore be it
Resolved, That the Senate of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania designate the month
of May 2019 as ‘‘Amyotrophic Lateral Scle-
rosis Awareness Month’’ in Pennsylvania;
and be it further
Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be
transmitted to the President of the United
States, the presiding officers of each house of
Congress and to each member of Congress
from Pennsylvania.
POM–86. A concurrent memorial adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona
urging the United States Congress to enact
legislation to provide medical treatment and
other benefits for deported veterans of the
United States Armed Forces; to the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs.
HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 2001

By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms.
ROSEN, Ms. MCSALLY, and Ms.
KLOBUCHAR):
S. 1784. A bill to provide for the
issuance of a Stamp Out Elder Abuse
Semipostal Stamp; to the Committee
on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, along
with my colleagues, Senators JACKY
ROSEN, MARTHA MCSALLY, and AMY
KLOBUCHAR, I am introducing the
Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act of 2019, a
bill that seeks to help combat the
abuse and financial exploitation of our
Nation’s seniors. Our bill would create
a semipostal, or fundraising, stamp
that would allow Postal Service cus-
tomers to make a voluntary contribu-
tion to raise awareness and combat
elder abuse by purchasing this special
stamp.
The proceeds from this stamp would
go to the Department of Health and
Human Service’s (HHS) Administration
on Community Living (ACL) and the
Department of Justice (DOJ). The
funding would allow the ACL to further
support the development and advance-
ment of emerging practices to prevent
and respond to the abuse of older
adults, and would assist DOJ in im-
proving prosecution, data collection,
litigation support, and initiatives that
prevent elder abuse. Notably, this bill
would help to provide needed addi-
tional revenue to tackle elder abuse
without costing the Federal govern-
ment a single penny.
Abuse of older Americans is sadly
prevalent—no matter the person’s gen-
der, race, religion, or ethnic or cultural
background. Each year, hundreds of
thousands of adults over the age of 60
are abused, neglected, or financially
exploited. Abuse can happen in many
places, including a person’s home, a
family member’s house, an assisted liv-
ing facility, or a nursing home. Just as
abuse can occur in various settings,
there are many types of elder abuse, in-
cluding physical abuse, emotional
abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, abandon-
ment, and financial exploitation, to
name a few. Although there are dif-
ferent types of abuse, it is common for
a victim to experience more than one
form of abuse.
According to the National Council on
Aging, approximately one in ten Amer-
icans aged 60 years old or older have
experienced some form of elder abuse.
According to the GAO, financial fraud
targeting older Americans is a growing
epidemic that costs seniors an esti-
mated $2.9 billion annually. We know,
however, that the true number is prob-
ably much higher since many of these
cases are never reported because the
victim is too often embarrassed to re-
port abuse, particularly when it in-
volves a family member. In fact, the
National Center on Elder Abuse reports
that only one in 14 cases are reported
to the authorities.
In Maine—the State with the oldest
population by median age—an esti-
mated 33,000 seniors each year are the
victims of some kind of abuse or finan-
cial fraud. Moreover, in as many as 90
percent of financial cases, the senior is
victimized by someone he or she knows
well. A 2017 report of financial exploi-
tation of Maine’s older adults found
that in most cases, financial exploi-
tation is perpetrated by a family mem-
ber, typically the victim’s own adult
child.
In a recent case in Maine, police
charged a pastor in York County,
Maine, with exploiting an incapaci-
tated elderly woman. They say the
man befriended the woman while he
was volunteering at the assisted-living
community where she lived. According
to police, the State determined the
woman to be incapacitated and as-
signed her a guardian and conservator.
The pastor allegedly took the woman
to her bank, withdrew money to have
the locks changed on her former home,
which had been on the market, and he
took down the ‘‘for sale’’ sign.
Police say the pastor told the woman
he would help her return to her house,
even though it was not equipped for the
wheelchair access she required. He sug-
gested his daughter could live with the
woman to care for her. Police say his
goal was to ingratiate himself and have
access to this woman’s financial ac-
counts and property. Fortunately, in
this case, the conservator, who was le-
gally responsible for protecting the

woman’s assets, identified and reported
the suspected criminal activity to the
police.
Combatting elder abuse of seniors is
primarily the responsibility of State
and local agencies, particularly adult
protective services agencies. Preven-
tion and response to cases of abuse re-
quire coordinated efforts, including
State and local agencies, law enforce-
ment, the social work and medical
community, and financial institutions.
The Federal government also plays
an important role in providing leader-
ship to combat this problem. The Elder
Justice Coordinating Council, led by
HHS and DOJ, has brought other Fed-
eral agencies to the table to coordinate
efforts to protect older individuals
from abuse. Last year, the DOJ took a
major action by directing all 94 U.S.
Attorneys’ offices to each designate an
elder justice coordinator, who will de-
velop strategies to protect seniors in
their districts. This will promote
greater cooperation between the DOJ
and its law enforcement partners.
While the best way to intervene in the
problem of elder abuse is to prevent it
from happening in the first place, when
abuse does occur, it is crucial that the
perpetrators of the crimes not go
unpunished.
I worked closely on the Stamp Out
Elder Abuse Act of 2019 with Philip C.
Marshall. Philip is the founder of Be-
yond Brooke, a campaign named to
honor Philip’s late grandmother,
Brooke Astor, a well known philan-
thropist, recipient of the Presidential
Medal of Freedom, and victim of elder
abuse and financial exploitation. In
2015, Mr. Marshall testified before the
Senate Aging Committee about how his
father mistreated his grandmother and
mismanaged her assets while she suf-
fered from Alzheimer’s disease. In addi-
tion, I am pleased that the non-par-
tisan Elder Justice Coalition, which
represents more than 3,000 members,
along with the National Center for Vic-
tims of Crime, the National Sheriffs
Association, and the National Associa-
tion on Area Agencies on Aging all sup-
port our bill.
Mr. President, I ask that letters from
these organizations appear in the
RECORD immediately following my re-
marks.
Preventing and combating elder
abuse require law enforcement and so-
cial service agencies at all levels of
government to work collaboratively
with the private sector. The Stamp Out
Elder Abuse Act would assist the Fed-
eral government’s role to help make
that happen. I urge my colleagues to
support this bill.

Hon. SUSAN COLLINS,

U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN COLLINS: On behalf of the
nonpartisan Elder Justice Coalition which
represents more than 3,000 members, I write
to congratulate you and Senators Rosen,
McSally, and Klobuchar on the introduction
of the Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act of 2019,
which will create a semi-postal stamp to pro-
vide additional funding to the federal gov-
ernment for programs to address elder abuse,
neglect, and exploitation. The EJC is proud
to have worked closely on this legislation
with you, your staff and Philip C. Marshall,
founder of Beyond Brooke, a cause-based
campaign named to honor Philip’s late
grandmother, Brooke Astor, who was a well-
known philanthropist, recipient of the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom, and a victim of
elder abuse and elder financial exploitation.
We are pleased that the bill will direct the
United States Postal Service to develop the
semipostal stamp and use the proceeds from
its sales to provide funding to augment the
elder justice initiatives at both the Adminis-
tration on Aging in the Department of
Health and Human Services and at the De-
partment of Justice. These programs include
prevention, education, data collection, serv-
ices to protect and support victims, and dem-
onstration projects, in addition to initiatives
to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of
elder abuse and financial exploitation. Fur-
ther, the departments will be able to use
their resources to support dissemination of
the stamp.
Thank you again for your leadership on
this and other elder justice issues. Please let
us know if we can be of assistance in secur-
ing passage of the Stamp Out Elder Abuse
Act of 2019.

Hon. SUSAN COLLINS,
U.S. Senate,

DEAR SENATOR COLLINS: On behalf of the
National Sheriffs’ Association (NSA) and the
more than 3,000 elected sheriffs nationwide, I
write to endorse the Stamp Out Elder Abuse
Act of 2019 proposed by Senator Collins. This
Act initiates a semi postal stamp that not
only raises elder abuse awareness, but also
dedicates the proceeds to elder justice pro-
grams within DOJ and HHS.
As you may know, the NSA was one of the
founding groups in the National Association
of Triads, Inc. National Triads serves as a
clearinghouse of information, best practices
and early alert system for local Triads. Triad
is a national community policing concept
that partners law enforcement agencies with
older adult volunteer groups and older adult
related community services to educate older
adults on crime and fraud, to reduce crime
against the elderly, and eliminate the un-
warranted fear of crime.
After twenty-two years in existence, there
are Triads in more than 680 counties in 36
states. Triad serves 16 million seniors na-
tionwide—nearly half of America’s senior
population. The National Sheriffs’ Associa-
tion and local sheriffs have long recognized
the need to ensure the safety and quality of
life for the growing number of senior citizens
by supporting the formation of community
partnerships under the auspice of Triad.
Triad has a clear vision and a simple mis-
sion—to keep seniors safe from crime.
The Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act of 2019
makes a clear effort to increase awareness
and support for the elderly community. We
applaud the efforts to support prevention
and education, investigation and prosecu-
tion, and victims’ services in an effort in
combat elder abuse.
Sincerely,
JONATHAN F. THOMPSON,
Executive Director and CEO.

SENATE RESOLUTION 244—EX-
PRESSING SUPPORT FOR FREE,
FAIR, AND TRANSPARENT ELEC-
TIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF
GUATEMALA IN ORDER TO IN-
CREASE PROSPERITY, SECURITY,
AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR
ALL GUATEMALANS
Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. LEAHY,
Mr. CARDIN, Mr. BROWN, Mr. BOOKER,
and Mr. VAN HOLLEN) submitted the
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations:
S. RES. 244
Whereas Guatemala will hold general elec-
tions on June 16, 2019, and more than 7,600,000
Guatemalans are registered to vote for their
next president, vice president, congressional
representatives, and more than 300 mayors
around the country;
Whereas, in the process leading up to the
elections in Guatemala, there have been a se-
ries of troubling developments related to
presidential candidates, with 6 of the 24 can-
didates facing allegations related to illicit
activities, and at least 4 candidates having
been excluded from the race;
Whereas, on April 17, 2019, Mario Estrada, a
Guatemalan presidential candidate with the
center-right National Change Union political
party, was arrested in the United States and
charged by the Department of Justice with
conspiring to import cocaine into the United
States, soliciting millions of dollars from
the Sinaloa Drug Cartel, and other firearms
offenses;
Whereas the case of Mario Estrada high-
lights the existence of linkages between cer-
tain Guatemalan political actors and
transnational criminal organizations, and

the manner in which such criminal organiza-
tions have sought to influence the Guate-
malan political system;
Whereas, on May 15, 2019, a Guatemalan
court issued a politically motivated ruling
that Thelma Aldana—Guatemala’s former
Attorney General who led efforts to tackle
corruption in Guatemala—was ineligible to
run in Guatemala’s presidential election;
Whereas, according to Guatemalan media,
approximately 150 candidates running for a
seat in Guatemala’s legislature have been
cited with irregularities, including having
received suspicious government contracts,
not meeting electoral requirements, and pos-
sible linkages to narcotics trafficking;
Whereas Guatemala has a long history of
debilitating corruption due to the pervasive
influence of narcotics trafficking and orga-
nized crime, with the Department of State
estimating earlier this decade that as much
as 80 percent of the cocaine that eventually
reached the United States had passed
through Guatemala;
Whereas Guatemala’s endemic corruption
and criminality led to the 2006 agreement
that established the United Nations Inter-
national Commission Against Impunity in
Guatemala (CICIG) as an independent body
tasked with working with the Public Min-
istry to combat corruption, organized crime,
and institutional impunity;
Whereas the United States Government
provided considerable funding and political
support for CICIG during both Republican
and Democratic administrations, yet the
Trump Administration has been notably si-
lent on President Morales’ efforts to under-
mine CICIG;
Whereas a May 2019 report to Congress by
the Department of State report stated that
Guatemala, with the support of CICIG since
2007, previously took steps ‘‘to root out clan-
destine networks of corrupt actors, including
the uncovering of a massive corruption
scheme in 2015 led by former President
Perez-Molina and former Vice President
Baldetti’’;
Whereas the May 2019 report also noted
setbacks to Guatemala’s fight against cor-
ruption and stated that ‘‘since announcing in
2018 it would not renew the [CICIG’s] man-
date, the Guatemalan Government has im-
peded anti-corruption efforts, attacked judi-
cial independence, and misused U.S.-donated
equipment’’;
Whereas setbacks to the fight against cor-
ruption weaken the rule of law and demo-
cratic governance in Guatemala;
Whereas weak rule of law, violence, corrup-
tion, human rights abuses, impunity, and
failure to take effective actions to amelio-
rate widespread poverty in Guatemala con-
tribute to the outflow of refugees and mi-
grants towards the United States, including
the more than 165,000 Guatemalan nationals
who have been apprehended on the United
States-Mexico border during the current fis-
cal year alone;
Whereas it is in the strategic interest of
the United States to support free, fair, and
transparent elections and encourage contin-
ued efforts to strengthen the rule of law and
democratic governance in Guatemala; and
Whereas the Trump Administration an-
nounced in March 2019 that it will reprogram
United States assistance for Guatemala, El
Salvador, and Honduras, thereby under-
mining the ability of the United States Gov-
ernment to address challenges to security,
the rule of law, and economic development
in the Northern Triangle of Central America:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports the people of Guatemala as
they prepare to exercise their fundamental
democratic right to vote in their country’s
upcoming June 16, 2019, general elections;
(2) encourages all Guatemalan political ac-
tors and institutions to take continued steps
to uphold a free, fair, and transparent elec-
toral process;
(3) expresses grave concerns about—
(A) the involvement of certain Guatemalan
presidential candidates in illicit activities;
(B) efforts by international criminal orga-
nizations to influence the Guatemalan polit-
ical system;
(C) the politically motivated disqualifica-
tion of certain competitive, independent can-
didates in order to restrict the choices avail-
able to the people of Guatemala; and
(D) ongoing evidence of corruption of offi-
cials that permitted an estimated 1400 met-
ric tons of cocaine to pass through Guate-
mala destined for the United States last
year;
(4) encourages Guatemalan presidential
candidates to commit to taking strong and
sustained action following the election to
strengthen the rule of law, combat corrup-
tion and impunity, and address human rights
abuses and the underlying conditions of pov-
erty in the country;
(5) urges the next president of Guatemala
to take effective steps to strengthen the rule
of law, address the influence of criminal or-
ganizations and drug cartels on Guatemala’s
political system, and combat corruption and
impunity, including by reestablishing the
mandate of the United Nations International
Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala
(CICIG);
(6) condemns the efforts of President of
Guatemala Jimmy Morales to expel and un-
dermine CICIG;
(7) expresses dismay about the Trump Ad-
ministration’s failure to demonstrate Amer-
ica’s commitment to democracy, human
rights, and the rule of law in Guatemala; and
(8) opposes the Trump Administration’s de-
cision to reprogram United States assistance
to Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.

SENATE RESOLUTION 245—DESIG-
NATING JULY 17, 2019, AS ‘‘GLIO-
BLASTOMA AWARENESS DAY’’
Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Ms.
MCSALLY, Ms. SINEMA, Ms. WARREN,
Mr. MCCONNELL, and Mr. MARKEY) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 245
Whereas an estimated 13,310 new cases of
glioblastoma will be diagnosed in the United
States in 2019;
Whereas glioblastoma is—
(1) the most common malignant (can-
cerous) brain tumor, accounting for 47 per-
cent of all primary malignant brain tumors;
and
(2) the most aggressive, complex, difficult
to treat, and deadliest brain tumor;
Whereas it is estimated that more than
15,000 people in the United States will suc-
cumb to glioblastoma every year;
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for glio-
blastoma patients is only 5.6 percent and the
average survival for glioblastoma patients is
estimated to be only 12 to 18 months;
Whereas glioblastoma is described as a dis-
ease that affects the ‘‘essence of self’’, as the
treatment and removal of glioblastoma pre-
sents significant challenges because of the
uniquely complex and fragile nature of the
brain, the primary organ in the human body
that controls not only cognitive ability, but
the actions of every organ and limb;
Whereas brain cancer has—
(1) the highest per-patient initial cost of
care for any cancer group, with an
annualized mean net cost of care approach-
ing $150,000; and
(2) the highest annualized mean net costs
for last-year-of-life care, relative to other
cancers, at $135,000 to $210,000 (depending on
age and gender) per patient;
Whereas, although research advances may
fuel the development of new treatments for
glioblastoma, challenging obstacles to accel-
erating progress toward new treatments for
glioblastoma remain, and there are no
screening or early detection methods;
Whereas, although glioblastoma was first
described in medical and scientific literature
in the 1920s, and despite its devastating prog-
nosis, only 4 drugs and 1 medical device have
been approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration to treat glioblastoma since the
1920s, and the mortality rates associated
with glioblastoma have changed little during
the past 30 years; and
Whereas there is a need for greater public
awareness of glioblastoma, including both
the urgent unmet medical need, as well as
the opportunities for research and treatment
advances for glioblastoma patients: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates July 17, 2019, as ‘‘Glio-
blastoma Awareness Day’’;
(2) encourages increased public awareness
of glioblastoma;
(3) honors those individuals who have lost
their lives to that devastating disease or are
currently living with it;
(4) supports efforts to develop better treat-
ments for glioblastoma that will improve the
long-term prognosis of individuals diagnosed
with glioblastoma;
(5) expresses its support for those individ-
uals who are battling brain tumors, as well
as the families, friends, and caregivers of
those individuals; and
(6) urges a collaborative approach to brain
tumor research, which is a promising means
of advancing understanding of, and treat-
ment for, glioblastoma.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) Since the end of World War II, the Fed-
eral Government has designated specific pe-
riods of war, the dates of which are impor-
tant for qualification for certain benefits or
membership in veterans organizations estab-
lished by Congress.
(2) In between those recognized periods of
war, during so-called peacetime eras, the
United States military has been involved in
not fewer than 12 known eras, which are un-
recognized by the United States Government
as periods of war, resulting in numerous
United States personnel combat casualties.
(3) Those 12 unrecognized war eras oc-
curred at the direction of the then President
of the United States, with full knowledge
and consent of the then Congress.
(4) The first of those 12 unrecognized war
eras involving active United States military
personnel was the Greek Civil War, fought in
Greece from 1946 to 1949 between the army of
the Government of Greece, supported by ac-
tive military personal of the United States

China Cold War, not fewer than 16 members
of the Armed Forces of the United States

States.
(15) The fifth unrecognized war era involv-
ing active United States military personnel
was the Lebanon Crisis of 1958, which in-
volved more than 14,000 United States per-
sonnel and resulted in the death of one mem-
ber of the Armed Forces who sacrificed his
life in service to the United States and five
non-combat deaths.
(16) The sixth unrecognized war era involv-
ing active United States military personnel
was the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961.
(17) The Bay of Pigs invasion was a failed
military invasion of Cuba undertaken by a
United States military group sponsored by

sulted in not fewer than one death of a mem-
ber of the Armed Forces who sacrificed his
life in service to the United States and 19
non-combat deaths.
(18) The seventh unrecognized war era in-
volving active United States military per-
sonnel was the Cuban Missile Crisis, which

tary intervention by the United States
which resulted in the deaths of 8 members of
the Armed Forces who sacrificed their lives
in service to United States.
(25) The tenth unrecognized war era involv-
ing active United States military personnel
was the Salvadoran Civil War.
(26) The Salvadoran Civil War lasted more
than 12 years, through the terms of two Pres-
idential administrations of the United
States, and resulted in the deaths of 22 mem-
bers of the Armed Forces who sacrificed
their lives in service to the United States, 15
non-combat deaths, and 35 other casualties.
(27) The 11th unrecognized war era involv-
ing active United States military personnel
started on April 5, 1986, when the La Belle
discotheque in West Berlin, Germany, was
bombed, killing two United States soldiers
and wounding 79 other members of the
Armed Forces, which triggered what became
known as the Libyan Conflict.
(28) The military operations of the Libyan
Conflict included numerous air strikes by
United States military forces and resulted in
the deaths of two members of the Armed
Forces who sacrificed their lives in service
to the United States.
(29) The Libyan Conflict led to the 12th un-
recognized war era involving active United
States military personnel, known collec-
tively as the Persian Gulf Conflicts, which
lasted from July 24, 1987, through September
26, 1988.
(30) The Persian Gulf Conflicts involved
United States military missions to protect
Kuwaiti-owned oil tankers which represented
the largest United States naval convoy oper-
ation since World War II.

numerous military operations and the deaths
of not fewer than 39 members of the Armed
Forces who sacrificed their lives in service
to the United States and 31 wounded.
(32) Since the armistice that ended the hos-
tilities of the Korean War on January 31,

ice to the United States in South Korea, and
more than 132 people of the United States
have been wounded in-country.
(33) Since January 1, 1947, through all of
the unrecognized war eras involving active
United States military personnel, not fewer
than 778 combat and non-combat members of
the Armed Forces have sacrificed their lives

than 797 have been wounded.
(34) Since January 1, 1947, the unrecognized
war eras involving active United States mili-
tary personnel who were wounded and killed
serving their country were administered

and with the consent of Congress, proving
that the United States has been conducting
deadly wartime service to protect the coun-
try consistently since December 7, 1941.
(35) Eligibility for membership in The
American Legion is determined by Congress
through the establishment of specific dates
of declared and officially recognized hos-
tilities in which United States military per-
sonnel are on active service.
(36) The American Legion provides invalu-
able services to its members and supports
the community of veterans who sacrificed in
service of the United States.
(37) Membership in The American Legion
allows veterans to engage in public service
activities, such as supporting Boys and Girls

(40) The American Legion has commended
the heroic actions of all military personnel
who risked their lives in defense of freedom
during each of the unrecognized war eras in-
volving active United States military per-
sonnel.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that, in accordance with the his-
tory, tradition, and purposes of The Amer-
ican Legion, it is fair, proper, and reasonable
that the privilege of membership in The
American Legion should be extended to all
military personnel who served on active
military duty during all of the unrecognized
war eras involving active United States mili-
tary personnel.

IN RECOGNITION OF DENVER EAST
HIGH SCHOOL’S ‘WE THE PEO-
PLE’ NATIONAL FINALS FIRST
PLACE WIN
HON. DIANA DeGETTE
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Denver East High
School on its first-place finish in the 2019 na-
tional finals of the ‘We the People’ competition
sponsored by the Center for Civic Education.
The students and teachers of the Denver East
High School team should feel exceptionally
proud of this outstanding achievement.
After winning the Colorado statewide ‘We
the People’ competition, Denver East High
School traveled here to Washington, D.C.
where they prevailed over the competition to
bring home first-place. The students of the
Denver East High School team demonstrated
exceptional skill and character as they worked
towards this well-deserved win. I know that the
lessons learned, and knowledge gained
through this experience will be invaluable to
the students throughout their lives and future
careers, no matter what path they take.
Each year over 1,200 high school students
from across the nation come together to learn
about and debate the issues of the day. They
participate in simulated congressional hear-
ings, testifying as constitutional experts before
panels of judges acting as congressional com-
mittees. Students demonstrate their knowl-
edge of the U.S. Constitution as well as a vari-
ety of topics connected to our country’s histor-
ical and political heritage.
Robust civic education is the foundation of
our democracy and is key to its future suc-
cess. Informed citizenship in our youth is a pri-
mary factor of this future success. The stu-
dents who participate in this competition in-
spire us all to be more informed citizens.
Madam Speaker, I would like to give special
recognition to the incredible teachers who led
the Denver East High School team. Susan
McHugh and Matt Fulford have provided vital
mentorship and guidance to these students,
and their work with this team is a testament to
the quality of teachers we have in the Denver
Public school system. The winning team in-
cluded Sam Anderson, Grant Austin, Kennedy
Austin, Jack Beardshear, Max Boubin, Re-
becca Chapman, Hayden Christopher, Henry
Fox, Jessica Freedberg, Aidan Glennie,
Sophie Goldberg, Alexa Goldstein, Ethan
Gutterman, Ben Hamik, Anja Hutson, Marco
Jimenez, Aiden Kahn, Ballard Kauffman, Madi-
son Moore, Maggie Morrison, Matthew Nekritz,
Amelia Nugent, Maddie Parker, Isabella
Sanderson, Abby Schuman, Lulu Scully, Ella
Snyder, Kacey Tanner, Elena Thoman, and
Walker Young. Congratulations to all, and we
are all so proud of their wonderful accomplish-
ment. I wish them continued success in all
their future endeavors.
REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND
LEGACY OF MR. HOWELL BEGLE
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
ask the House of Representatives to join me
in celebrating the exemplary life of Mr. Howell
Begle—a veteran Army captain, lawyer, advo-
cate for R&B singers’ rights and my dear
friend.
Howell’s life was spent in service to his
country and helping others. After receiving his
law degree from the University of Michigan in
1968, Howell was commissioned a captain in
Okinawa and served in the Judge Advocate
General’s Corps. His wife, Julia, would tell you
that he was particularly proud of his work in
the JAG Corps, defending soldiers who were
being tried for minor transgressions like grow-
ing their hair too long or neglecting to salute
an officer, and explaining the Geneva Conven-
tion to soldiers who were being shipped out to
fight in Vietnam.
Howell left the Army in 1973 and began
working in Washington, D.C. as a successful
corporate lawyer specializing in media merg-
ers. His many prestigious clients included the
Kennedy Center, the American Film Institute,
and the Academy Awards. A lifelong fan of
R&B music, Howell began advocating for R&B
artists after learning that one of his favorite
singers, Ruth Brown, hadn’t received royalties
from her former record company, Atlantic
Records, in decades.
Using his years of experience working in the
legal profession, Howell helped Brown pres-
sure Atlantic records to eventually dispense
her royalties in 1988—28 years after they
were due. Howell’s pro bono work led to in-
dustrywide royalty reform and Atlantic Records
recalculating royalties for its numerous R&B
artists, many of whom were African American
and living in poverty due to unfair payment
practices. That same year, Atlantic Records
helped create the Rhythm and Blues Founda-
tion, which gives grants to artists in need.
Howell served as the foundation’s first execu-
tive director.
Howell’s work touched many lives, but his
most significant accomplishment was the fam-
ily he loved and cherished. He was deeply
committed to his wife Julie, his children Mark,
Matthew, Charles and Kristin and his three
grandchildren.
In an interview, Howell once told The Wash-
ington Post: ‘‘Too often in one’s professional
career, you don’t get a chance to be on the
right side of the right issue.’’ Today, I thank
Howell for being on the right side of the right
issue and for his years of committed service.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Howell Begle’s distinguished life and
legacy.
RECOGNIZING COLONEL TIMOTHY
HOLMAN
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
today I recognize Colonel Timothy Holman of
the United States Army for his extraordinary
dedication and service to our Nation. Colonel
Holman will soon transition from his current
assignment as the Chief of the United States
Army House Liaison Division in the House of
Representatives to the Deputy for the Army’s
Unity and Inclusion Office.
With an impressive and proven record of
leadership, including combat tours in Iraq as
the Brigade Operations Officer of the 130th
Engineer Brigade and in Afghanistan as the
Battalion Commander of the 54th Engineer
Battalion, Tim was chosen to serve as the
Chief of the House Liaison Division in 2017
after serving as a Chief of Staff of the Army
Senior Fellow with the Center for a New
American Security. Colonel Holman’s out-
standing work led to him being selected as the
Chief of the United States Army House Liaison
Division. His first-hand knowledge of the mili-
tary, its culture, and traditions was a tremen-
dous benefit to Army senior leaders and Con-
gressional offices. Tim was especially effective
in his service to Members and staff as he es-
corted them on fact-finding and oversight dele-
gations within the United States and around
the world.
Recently, Colonel Holman led a CODEL to
the 75th Anniversary of the D–Day landing at
Normandy, the largest CODEL of this type on
record. His expert planning, attention to detail,
and love of travel enabled exceptional visits
for fifty-eight Members of Congress and their
staff. I found him to be a thoughtful, intelligent,
and a professional soldier in the best traditions
of America’s Armed Forces. Madam Speaker,
it has been a pleasure to work with Colonel
Holman during his tenure as the Chief of the
United States Army House Liaison Division in
the House of Representatives.
On behalf of a grateful Nation, it is my
honor to recognize the selfless service and
sacrifice of a fellow Mississippian, Colonel
Timothy Holman, and his wife, B.J. Holman. I
wish them the very best.

World War I, who upon returning home no-
ticed a lack of government assistance in as-
similating back to their pre-service lives.
Though they had experienced extreme suf-
fering during the war, veterans received no
disability compensation, comprehensive med-
ical care, pensions for widows and orphans, or
vocational training. As a result, The American
Legion sought to create a self-help organiza-
tion that would provide veterans with devoted
care nationwide with Posts in local commu-
nities. The 28th Congressional District is proud
to house Burbank Post 150, Glendale Post
127, Los Feliz Post 527, Hollywood Post 43,
Sun Valley Post 520, Sunland-Tujunga Post
377, and Verdugo Hills Post 288.
The American Legion’s mission was found-
ed on four principles: Veterans Affairs and Re-
habilitation, Americanism, National Security,
and Children and Youth, and these principles
reflect the founders’ vision for America, one in
which military veterans are honored, re-
spected, and prosperous. For 100 years, they
have done just that as The American Legion
has made great strides in strengthening vet-
eran care in America. In 1923, results from a
nationwide survey conducted by The American
Legion shocked the nation, as they showed
that many veterans from the Great War had
given up hope and were homeless, suffering
from PTSD, and were merely attempting to
survive. As a result, the Veterans Bureau was
created, and federal and state laws were en-
acted that provided greater care for veterans.
One of the laws that The American Legion is
credited for creating is the Servicemen’s Re-
adjustment Act of 1944, or the GI Bill, which
provided benefits for servicemen returning
from World War II.
A lifeline to the veteran community, today
The American Legion boasts over 2 million
members and 13,000 posts nationwide. Some
of the nationwide programs include The Amer-
ican Legion Baseball program, which is dedi-
cated to mentoring the youth of America and
Operation Comfort Warriors, which provides
recovering wounded warriors with comfort
items during their time in hospitals.
I am proud to recognize The American Le-
gion for a century of outstanding service to
veterans and the United States. I ask all Mem-
bers to join me in congratulating The Amer-
ican Legion for its remarkable achievements.

CITRUS COLLEGE, GLENDORA,
CALIFORNIA
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I con-
gratulate Citrus College, the first California
community college to receive top honors for
student success by a national organization. At
an awards gala on April 15, 2019, American
Association of Community Colleges (AACC)
President, Dr. Walter Bumpus, and AACC
Board Chair, Dr. Sandra Kurtinitis, presented
Dr. Geraldine M. Perri, Superintendent/Presi-
dent of Citrus College, with the 2019 AACC
Award of Excellence in the Student Success
category. This well-deserved national recogni-
tion affirms the outstanding campus-wide effort
to boost completion and transfer rates. Citrus
College is the only community college in Cali-
fornia to have been honored by the AACC in
2019.
Every year, the AACC recognizes the ex-
ceptional work accomplished by the nation’s
community colleges by presenting Awards of
Excellence in six categories: Student Success,
Advancing Diversity, CEO/Board Relationship,
Community College Safety and Planning, Fac-
ulty Innovation, and Outstanding College/Cor-
porate Partnership. The AACC Award of Ex-
cellence in the Student Success category rec-
ognizes a community college that has dem-
onstrated a sustained commitment to student
achievement. The criteria used to determine
this year’s finalists included the development
of a comprehensive strategic completion plan,
the achievement of measurable and significant
increases in degree completion, certificate
completion, and transfer from two-year to four-
year institutions.
Citrus College was highlighted for estab-
lishing and promoting an associate degree for
transfer (ADT) pathway to four-year colleges
and universities, and for introducing the Citrus
College Promise, a program designed to cover
enrollment fees and other college costs for
first-time students for up to two years. As a re-
sult of the college’s efforts, transfers have
risen by 38 percent from 2014 to 2017.
We send our sincere congratulations to Dr.
Perri and all students, faculty, staff, and Mem-
bers of the Board of Trustees at Citrus Col-
lege, and we wish them continued success.

WORLD WAR II VETERAN JOHN
O’CONNER OF PAYSON, ARIZONA
CLEBRATES HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor World War II Veteran John O’Conner
as he celebrates his 100th Birthday. John
O’Conner of Payson, Arizona epitomizes a life
dedicated to serving others and defending our
country.
John was born on June 11, 1919 in Bran-
ford, Pennsylvania. He attended the University
of Buffalo in Buffalo, New York. During this
time, he met and married his wife of 54 years,
Velma. After such a joyous and momentous
occasion, his country called for him to serve
as socialism spread throughout Europe.
Without hesitation, John answered his coun-
try’s call, took his new bride to live with his
mother and joined millions of the Greatest
Generation to fight for the survival of mankind.
The year of 1940 marked the beginning of
John’s five-year service in the European The-
atre. He served in the artillery division of the
United States Army Air Corps. By the grace of
God, John survived the war and helped save
the world from the rise of socialism.
After the war, he went on to author the first
instruction manual for the nuclear submarine,
the very same nuclear submarine invented by
the ‘‘Father of the Nuclear Navy,’’ Admiral
Hyman Rickover. John and Velma went on to
raise three wonderful children, John, Patricia
and Kathleen. John moved to Payson in 1969.
When we look at John’s life and what he
has accomplished, it’s clear to see why he is
loved by so many. He and so many like him
put their lives on hold and placed themselves
in a situation that none of us could possibly
fathom. All of this, in defense of our country.
We can never repay John’s service to our
country. May he have a blessed birthday and
may many learn from his example of service
and patriotism. Happy Birthday, John.

STRENGTHENING LOCAL TRANS-
PORTATION SECURITY CAPABILI-
TIES ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 2539, ‘‘Strengthening
Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act
of 2019.’’
H.R. 2539 requires DHS to prioritize the as-
signment of officers and intelligence analysts
from TSA and DHS I&A to locations with par-
ticipating State, local, and regional fusion cen-
ters in jurisdictions with a high-risk surface
transportation asset.
The tragic events of 9/11 thrust the issue of
physical security into public domain as never
before and set in motion responses that have
re-shaped transportation in unforeseen ways.
H.R. 2539 authorizes DHS to develop,
through the Federal Law Enforcement Training
Centers, a training program to enhance the
protection, preparedness, and response capa-
bilities of law enforcement agencies with re-
spect to terrorism and other serious incidents
at surface transportation assets.
In addition, threats to health, such as the
spread of pandemics, present significant chal-
lenges to transport planning and operations.
Railway stations and airports are some of
the most densely populated sites anywhere.
From 2009, all the flights originating, bound
to or flying over the United States had their list
of passengers cross-referenced by a central
no-fly list managed by the TSA.
Security involves many steps, from restrict-
ing access to airport facilities, fortifying cock-
pits, the setting of no-fly lists, to the more ex-
tensive security screening of passengers.
Screening now involves more rigorous in-
spections of passengers and their baggage at
airports, including restrictions on what can be
personally carried in airplanes such as gels
and liquids.
Considering the emergence of global supply
chains, the emphasis in freight transport secu-
rity is gradually shifting into a more com-
prehensive but complex approach.
The large number of ports, the vast fleet of
global shipping and the range of products car-
ried in vessels, and the difficulty of detection
has made the issue of security in shipping an
extremely difficult one to address.
The less regulated and greater international
dimensions of the shipping industry have
made it vulnerable to security breaches.
We need appropriate security measures to
protect the susceptibility of American lives
against possible acts of violence and ter-
rorism.
The growth in the use of information tech-
nologies and their associated networks have
opened new forms of vulnerability as control
and management systems can be remotely
accessed.

This has resulted in complex interconnected
corporate information networks that can be
hacked and disrupted.
Trained officials and security experts work
arduously to assess and mitigate the safety of
passenger flow at transportation hubs.
Taken together, the bill’s provisions en-
hance the capabilities of local transportation
security stakeholders to prevent and respond
to terrorist attacks and other serious incidents.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting H.R. 2539 to strengthen our
nations’ ports of transportation to prevent and
respond to terrorist attacks.

Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I con-
gratulate the University of La Verne on being
ranked 5th in the nation for social mobility of
graduates, according to U.S. News & World
Report in its 2019 Best Colleges rankings.
These high marks affirm the university’s
record of success in helping students from
low-income families achieve equity with grad-
uates from families with stronger financial
backgrounds.
I recently had the honor of addressing the
University of La Verne’s 2019 graduating class
during the commencement ceremony on May
31, 2019, where I noted this distinguished
ranking, and I was grateful to meet several
students from all backgrounds and their fami-
lies. These future leaders are poised to enter
the workforce, continue their studies, and
make a difference in our communities and the
world around them.
For its social mobility rankings, U.S. News &
World Report focused on how effective univer-
sities are at serving and graduating students
who receive federal Pell Grants. Pell Grants
are awarded to students from families with a
household income that is typically less than
$50,000 annually.
We congratulate University of La Verne
President Devorah Lieberman and all stu-
dents, alumni, faculty, and staff on this well-
deserved national recognition, and we wish
them continued success.

E742 June 11, 2019
Cortez, Colorado, an American soldier who
was recently killed defending our country in
the Kunduz Province of Afghanistan. He and
Spc. Joseph Collette, both Fort Carson based
soldiers, were killed in an attack fighting
against the Taliban.
Sgt. Lindsay was born in Cortez in 1985.
The grandson of World War II veteran Richard
Lindsay and World War II veteran Warren
Waldorf, he was no stranger to service. He fol-
lowed his grandfather’s footsteps when he en-
listed into the Army in 2004, ultimately getting
selected into the elite 10th Special Forces
Group. This prestigious fighting group deploys
to some of the world’s most heated combat
zones and Sgt. Lindsay bravely deployed with
them seven times including five tours in Iraq,
one in Tajikistan and this final deployment to
Afghanistan.
As a highly decorated combat veteran, Sgt.
Lindsay had an expansive list of military
awards and decorations to include a Silver
Star, Purple Heart, four Bronze Stars, two
Meritorious Service Medals, two Meritorious
Unit Awards, the Valorous Unit Award, the
Army Superior Unit Award, four Army Good
Conduct Medals, the National Defense Service
Medal, the Global War on Terror Service
Medal, the NCO Professional Development
Ribbon with numeral four, the Army Service
Ribbon, two Overseas Service Ribbons, the
NATO Medal, the Special Forces Tab, the
Combat Infantry Badge, the Military Free Fall
Jumpmaster Badge, the Master Parachutist
Badge, the Chilean Airborne Wings, and the
Senior Instructor Badge. Sgt. Lindsay’s record
is a testament to his commitment of putting
country before self, as he did in the Army for
nearly 15 years.
I stand before the House of Representatives
with a heavy heart thinking about his family
and their great loss, especially his wife Sarah,
his four daughters and his parents Grant and
Tammy. I join the town of Cortez, his brothers
and sisters in arms, and the entire nation in
mourning his untimely death. I have gotten to
know Sgt. Lindsay’s family over the years and
his loss will be felt by many in our small com-
munity.
Madam Speaker, Sgt. Lindsay’s death is a
painful reminder of the sacrifices our men and
women in the military endure. Sgt. Lindsay
was a true American hero from one of the
most rural areas in Colorado who died pro-
tecting his men and the country he loved. He
dedicated his life to selflessly protect our great
nation and we are all proud of him. His loss
is tragic, but his legacy will be remembered for
generations to come, and the world is a better
place because of him.

RECOGNIZING THE VIENNA ARTS
SOCIETY 50TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Vienna Arts Society on the oc-
casion of its 50th anniversary. Since 1969, the
Vienna Arts Society has worked to cultivate
and maintain an interest in the fine arts in the
Town of Vienna. The impact that the arts can
have on a community and its residents cannot
be overstated. As an amateur thespian myself,
I can attest to the transformative power the
arts can have on an individual’s life and I com-
mend the Vienna Arts Society for its work to
ensure that this transformative power is found
in Vienna. The Vienna Arts Society does this
in many different ways, whether it be its an-
nual print making workshop for children, pro-
viding illustrations for the Town calendar, cre-
ating Christmas decorations for display during
the holidays, providing high school scholar-
ships or their work with numerous Scout
troops.
This year is also significant because the Vi-
enna Arts Society is hosting the first ever na-
tional art competition in the town, through its
Treasure of Art reception at the newly ren-
ovated Vienna Community Center. I look for-
ward to seeing the contributions of our local
residents. A number of those artists are also
receiving awards as a result of the excellence
of their work. I am pleased to include in the
RECORD the names of the following individ-
uals:
1ST PLACE
Lola Santos, ‘‘Pio’’, acrylic & collage
2ND PLACE
Carolyn Marshall Wright, ‘‘Cherries Jubilee’’
acrylic on canvas
3RD PLACE
Ray Goodrow, ‘‘Rodeo’’ watercolor

yup
Alice Nodine, ‘‘Safezone’’ acrylic & ink on
paper
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in congratulating the winners of the
Treasure of Art show and in congratulating the
Vienna Arts Society on this momentous anni-
versary. I wish them great success in all their
future endeavors.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO TOURISM
IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong support of H.R. 951, the ‘‘United
States-Mexico Tourism Improvement Act of
2019.’’
H.R. 951 addresses the decline in tourist
activity between the United States and Mex-
ico.
The bill aims to strengthen the bilateral rela-
tionship between the United States and Mexi-
can tourism industries by advocating for in-
creased cooperation through both government
and non-governmental channels.
Specifically, the legislation seeks to—
improve third-party tourism to both countries
through joint international promotional efforts;
prioritize exchange programs in various eco-
nomic sectors; and
promote cross-border medical partnerships.
Mexico is the biggest source of international
visitors to the United States after Canada.
In 2016, Mexican tourism to the United
States peaked at 18,990,585 visitors, consti-
tuting 1 in 4 (24.9 percent) of all tourists that
year.
Additionally, in 2016, spending by Mexican
tourists in the United States totaled $20.3 bil-
lion, which represented a 3 percent growth
from 2015.
In 2017, international tourist arrivals totaled
76,900,000, up 0.7 percent from 76,400,000 in
2016.
The same year, 77,000,000 international
visitors spent a record $251.4 billion on hotels,
travel, food, and souvenirs, a 2-percent in-
crease over 2016.
However, also in 2017, there was a 6.1-per-
cent decline in visitors to the United States
from Mexico, comprising a loss of 1,166,585
Mexican tourists from 2016.
The Department of Commerce has not yet
released 2017 spending totals by Mexican
tourists in the United States, but a cor-
responding monetary decline would be ap-
proximately $1.24 billion in lost revenue.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting H.R. 951 to promote bi-
lateral tourism through the United States and
Mexico.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E743
June 11, 2019
NARFE is a national organization that was
founded in 1921 to support both active and re-
tired federal employees. It functions as an in-
formation resource, keeping its members up-
to-date on federal retirement, health care,
compensation and other benefits that affect
federal employees and retirees. It also advo-
cates on behalf of its members to protect and
enhance the benefits they have earned.
With well over 1,000 chapters nationwide,
NARFE also serves as a source of community
engagement. It unites public servants and pro-
vides them with opportunities to do what they
do best: serve their community.
Today, I would like to recognize the past
and current members and leaders of NARFE
Chapter 1116. They have contributed to a
thriving civil society in Northern Virginia and
are part of the backbone that makes both our
community and this country great. I would like
to specifically recognize President Kathy Arpa
and the other officers and board members for
their dedication and efforts on behalf of our
current and retired federal employees.
The federal government cannot function ef-
fectively and efficiently without the hard work
and commitment of our exceptional civil serv-
ants. NARFE Chapter 1116 has advocated
and supported our public servants for the past
50 years and I am honored to recognize the
Chapter on this occasion.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in congratulating NARFE Chapter
1116 for 50 years of service to our federal
workers and to wish them continued success
protecting the rights of current and future fed-
eral workers and retirees.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH
ANNIVERSARY OF PRS CRISISLINK
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize PRS CrisisLink on its 50th anniver-
sary. This occasion carries great significance
for my family and I, as my wife is co-chair of
the Congressional Spouses for Suicide Pre-
vention and Education.
PRS CrisisLink is a free 24/7 crisis interven-
tion and suicide prevention program that offers
a free and confidential crisis and suicide pre-
vention hotline for Northern Virginia and the
Washington, D.C. region.
Under the leadership of Wendy Gradison,
PRS CrisisLink continues to evolve into a
highly important resource within our commu-
nity. Based on a 2009 report by the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra-
tion, PRS CrisisLink has determined that an
estimated 72,000 residents of Northern Vir-
ginia have a serious mental illness with the
majority of whom not receiving treatment.
Given the high numbers of persons with men-
tal illness, PRS seeks ways to serve those in
need through a variety of programs.
PRS CrisisLink hotlines are staffed by highly
trained volunteers and crisis line workers who
provide helpful information about community
services, referrals to mental health services
and tips on how to help those struggling with
mental health issues.
With many community members in Northern
Virginia and the Washington, D.C. region still
in dire need of mental health services and
support, PRS CrisisLink aims to further ex-
pand service delivery to reach as many indi-
viduals as possible.
Each year, PRS serves more than 1,100 cli-
ents. Last year alone the volunteers and staff
at CrisisLink responded to 45,000 phone calls.
I commend the staff and volunteers for their
selfless service to our community. The tools
they provide to help individuals with mental ill-
ness live with dignity and become fully inte-
grated members of our community.
Madam Speaker, programs like PRS
CrisisLink are a testament to good community
leadership and further evidence that we live in
a community that cares. I commend the staff
and volunteers of PRS CrisisLink for the life-
saving work they do every day on behalf of
others. I ask my colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating PRS CrisisLink on its 50th anniver-
sary and in thanking them for their continued
service to our community.

TRANSPORTATION EMERGENCY
RELIEF FUNDS AVAILABILITY ACT
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I
am proud to introduce the ‘‘Transportation
Emergency Relief Funds Availability Act’’ to
safeguard federal funding for disaster-recovery
projects.
I want to thank my colleagues from Califor-
nia’s Congressional delegation for their sup-
port: Representatives JARED HUFFMAN (D–
CA2), MIKE THOMPSON (D-CA5), MARK
DESAULNIER (D–CA11), BARBARA LEE (D–
CA13), JACKIE SPEIER (D–CA14), ERIC
SWALWELL (D–CA15), RO KHANNA (D–CA17),
ANNA G. ESHOO (D–CA 18), ZOE LOFGREN (D–
CA 19), JIMMY PANETTA (D–CA20), SALUD O.
CARBAJAL (D–CA24), KATIE HILL (D–CA25),
JULIA BROWNLEY (D–CA26), GRACE F. NAPOLI-
TANO (D–CA32), NORMA J. TORRES (D–CA35),
RAUL RUIZ (D–CA36), GILBERT RAY CISNEROS,
JR. (D–CA39), ALAN S. LOWENTHAL (D–CA47),
HARLEY ROUDA (D–CA48), and SCOTT H.
PETERS (D–CA52).
Our legislation would prevent the Trump ad-
ministration from targeting disaster-recovery
funding for highway and transportation
projects across our state. In January 31, 2019,
the Federal Highway Administration denied the
California Department of Transportation’s
(Caltrans) request for 1-year extensions for 66
out of 73 projects awarded ‘‘emergency relief’’
funding from the U.S. Department of Transpor-
tation. During previous administrations, such
1-year extensions were routinely granted
under the Federal Highway Administration’s
and Federal Transit Administration’s emer-
gency relief programs.
Californians are facing increasingly frequent
and severe floods and wildfires due to climate
change. They deserve nothing less than the
full-throated support of their Federal Govern-
ment, and that is exactly what our bill ensures.
Current U.S. Department of Transportation
regulations allow the Federal Government to
claw back ‘‘emergency relief’’ funding for high-
way and public transit projects if those
projects do not reach construction within 2 fis-
cal years. The ‘‘Transportation Emergency Re-
lief Funds Availability Act’’ would repeal this
regulatory deadline and provide up to 6 years
for projects awarded these funds to advance
to construction. The new 6-year deadline
would start following the date on which a dis-
aster was declared by the respective state’s
governor or the president.
I also want to thank Caltrans, the California
State Association of Counties and the Cali-
fornia Governor’s Office of Emergency Serv-
ices (CalOES) for their support of this critical
legislation for our state.
Madam Speaker, I hope that any surface
transportation reauthorization bill this Con-
gress will include the ‘‘Transportation Emer-
gency Relief Funds Availability Act. ‘‘This is a
major priority for California: the nation’s most
populous state and the fifth largest economy
in the world. As a member of the Committee
on Transportation and Infrastructure, I am
working with my fellow California colleagues to
see this done.

RECOGNIZING THE 2019 FAIRFAX
COUNTY VOLUNTEER SERVICE
AWARD RECIPIENTS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize Volunteer Fairfax and ex-
press my sincere appreciation to recipients of
the 27th Annual Fairfax County Volunteer
Service Awards.
Established more than 40 years ago, Volun-
teer Fairfax matches the skills and interests of
thousands of volunteers with the needs of
local non-profit organizations. The success of
this model and its impact on delivery of need-
ed services is beyond question; Volunteer
Fairfax has been rated as one of the most ef-
fective community service organizations in the
nation.
Last year alone, over 6,000 individuals con-
tributed more than 328,000 volunteer hours to-
taling almost $8,000,000. These staggering
numbers are a testament to the strong ethos
of public service and of volunteerism that ex-
ists in Fairfax County and is one of the many
reasons why this community is such a won-
derful place to live.
Each year, Volunteer Fairfax selects a few
exceptional individuals, groups, or organiza-
tions to receive special recognition. It is my
great pleasure to include in the RECORD the
following names of the 2019 Fairfax County

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO ADD
SUICIDE PREVENTION RE-
SOURCES TO SCHOOL IDENTI-
FICATION CARDS
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, unfortu-
nately, in 2017, there were more than 47,000
suicides nationwide, making it the tenth-lead-
ing cause of death.
Tragically, among teenagers and young
adults, the suicide rate is particularly alarming,
with suicide the second-leading cause of
death for people between the ages of 15 and
24.
For people experiencing suicidal thoughts or
emotional distress, the National Suicide Pre-
vention Lifeline and Crisis Text Line provide
free and confidential round-the-clock support.
Many colleges and universities also offer men-
tal health resources on campus.
To raise awareness of these available re-
sources, the bill simply requires colleges and
universities to provide the contact information
for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline;
Crisis Text Line; and a campus mental health
center, if applicable, on student identification
cards. For colleges and universities that do
not provide identification cards to their stu-
dents, schools must ensure that the informa-
tion is available on their website.
Suicide is a major public health problem.
Providing information on existing suicide pre-
vention resources can help students experi-
encing suicidal thoughts or emotional distress
and potentially save lives.

HONORING SUNNY SUNG-IN KIM
HON. JOE WILSON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, Sunny Sung-In Kim, 68, died on
Sunday, June 9, 2019 at Sunrise at Fair Oaks
in Fairfax, Virginia following a three-year battle
with an aggressive meningioma. His final days
were spent surrounded by his loving family,
especially his five beloved grandchildren who
serenaded him with music, song and laughter.
Sunny was born on November 16, 1950 in
Pusan, Korea during the Korean War. He en-
listed in the Republic of Korea Marine Corps,
graduated basic training with the 218th Class
and served from 1969 to 1972, having
achieved the rank of Lance Corporal.
He emigrated to the United States in 1973,
became a naturalized citizen and on May 11,
1975, he married the love of his life, Susan
Bok-Ja Kim in Long Island, New York. Their
wedding was officiated by the Reverend Dr.
Young-Kyo Hahn (1902–1982), an historically
renowned Korean Christian Scholar and civic
leader who was a former Dean of the College
and Graduate School at Yonsei University. Dr.
Hahn led Sunny and his wife into the Christian
faith, the Presbyterian Church and baptized
them. Together the couple had two sons. In
1986, Sunny founded and was President of
Grass Roots, Inc., a food service and catering
business with multiple locations in the Finan-
cial District of Boston, Massachusetts. He re-
tired to Haymarket, Virginia to be near his
sons and grandchildren after nearly three dec-
ades of running the company together with his
wife.
Sunny had a lifelong passion of service to
his community and served as President of the
Korean American Association of New England
and the Secretary-General of the Federation
of Korean Associations, U.S.A. He was also
instrumental in galvanizing support for the cre-
ation of the Massachusetts Korean War Vet-
erans Memorial at the Charlestown Naval
Shipyard. Having never forgotten the 36,574
U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that
paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect and de-
fend freedom during the Korean War when he
was born, he dedicated his life to honoring all
Korean War veterans and their families. For
his contributions to the U.S.-Korea alliance
and the Korean American community, Sunny
was the recipient of a Presidential Com-
mendation by the President of the Republic of
Korea.
An active member of the Korean Pres-
byterian Church in Greater Boston where he
was an ordained Elder, Sunny’s deep and
abiding Christian faith was the foundation of
his family. He instilled in his sons the virtues
of generosity, graciousness and a heart of
gratitude. An avid sports enthusiast, he was a
devoted fan of the Washington Redskins and
the Boston Red Sox. In the final years of his
life, nothing brought him greater joy than
cheering on his grandchildren while watching
them play football, lacrosse and baseball.
Sunny is survived by his wife of 44 years,
Susan Bok-Ja Kim, his sons Thomas (Nancy)
and James (Susan) and his grandchildren
Thomas ‘‘TJ’’ Kim, Rachel Kim, Samuel Kim,
William Kim and Henry Kim. A Memorial Serv-
ice will be held on Wednesday, June 12 at
Fairfax Memorial Funeral Home, 9902 Brad-
dock Road Fairfax, VA 22032 at 7:00PM. The
Burial Service will be held on Thursday, June
13 at Fairfax Memorial Park, 9900 Braddock
Road Fairfax, VA 22032 at 10:00AM. Memo-
rials may be directed to the Korean War Vet-
erans Memorial Wall of Remembrance in
Washington, D.C. or to Open Door Pres-
byterian Church in Herndon, Virginia.

RECOGNIZING FIRST BAPTIST
CHURCH OF VIENNA PASTOR
VERNON C. WALTON
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize First Baptist Church of Vi-
enna and my friend, Pastor Vernon C. Walton,
on the occasion of his 5th anniversary as pas-
tor. Installed in 2014 after the retirement of the
Rev. Dr. Kenny Smith, Pastor Walton has con-
tinued the legacy of spiritual wealth left behind
by his predecessor. As someone who spent
time with Rev. Dr. Smith, I can attest that hav-
ing to fill his shoes as pastor is an unenviable
task. However, Pastor Walton has not only
succeeded in this task, but thrived.
As someone who studied for the Catholic
priesthood, I can also speak to the unique
benefits and challenges of being called to min-
istry. Being entrusted with the pastoral health
of a congregation as large as First Baptist
Church of Vienna is a significant undertaking
and I commend Pastor Walton for handling it
with dedication, devotion and with grace.
Pastor Walton’s tenure has also enhanced
First Baptist Church of Vienna’s civic engage-
ment. I have attended multiple events in the
sanctuary designed to boost the civic engage-
ment and awareness of the congregation.
Most recently, I attended a community forum
on affordable housing put together by the Fair-
fax chapter of the NAACP. First Baptist had
graciously allowed its sanctuary to be used as
the staging location for the event and Pastor
Walton was a featured speaker. The sight of
hundreds of people, many of them congrega-
tion members, coming together to educate
themselves on one of the most pressing
issues facing our community was inspiring. I

CELEBRATING FRED G. ACOSTA
JOB CORPS CENTER DAY IN THE
CITY OF TUCSON
HON. RAÚL M. GRIJALVA
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and celebrate the fortieth
anniversary of the Fred G. Acosta Job Corps
Center in Tucson, Arizona. Over these past
forty years, thousands of young people have
benefited from the Fred G. Acosta Job Corps
Center’s comprehensive residential, academic
and career technical training program.
Each year, the Fred G. Acosta Job Corps
Center serves hundreds of young adults by
providing a career in technical education and
a path to a high school diploma. Furthermore,
the center provides social skills training and
other services to empower young men and
women to start a career, enroll in advanced
training, enroll in college, or enter the Armed
Forces. I am specifically grateful for the Cen-
ter’s accomplishments in breaking the cycle of
poverty, strengthening local communities, im-
proving the quality of life of thousands, and for
its continued contributions in educating and
training the youth of Arizona’s 3rd District. For
these reasons, I move that the United States
House of Representatives celebrate the Fred
G. Acosta Job Corps Center today, on Fred G.
Acosta Job Corps Center Day which is cele-
brated in July 10th.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF
JAMES ROBINSON
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, it is with great
pride that we honor the memory of James
Robinson, who fought heroically in the Amer-
ican Revolution. Like many African Americans
who fought for American independence, Mr.
Robinson’s contributions went unrecognized
for too long. We will right that injustice by rec-
ognizing his accomplishments and honoring
his memory.
Mr. Robinson was born into slavery in Mary-
land in 1753. After the Revolutionary War
broke out in 1775, he served in a light infantry
regiment. James Robinson fought at the bat-
tles of Brandywine and Yorktown, during
which he played a pivotal role in the over-
taking of the British rampart. The battle of
Yorktown ended with the British surrendering.
Mr. Robinson was rewarded by French Gen-
eral Marquis de Lafayette with a Gold Medal
of Valor.
Despite having been promised his freedom
in exchange for his service, Mr. Robinson re-
mained in slavery. He fought in the war of
1812. He eventually became free and went on
to work as a preacher. In short, James Robin-
son lived an extraordinary life. He passed
away at the age of one hundred fifteen, buried
without recognition for his bravery and remark-
able work.
It is an honor to see James Robinson’s con-
tributions receive the recognition they deserve.
We are thankful for his service and give honor
to his memory and legacy.

HONORING DR. WALTER TRIBLEY
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Dr. Walter Tribley for his distin-
guished service as the President of Monterey
Peninsula College (MPC). Dr. Tribley served
as President of MPC from 2012 to 2019 and
will assume the position of President of North-
ern Wyoming Community College District this
Fall. Dr. Tribley has had a profound impact on
MPC, its students and our community on the
central coast of California, and I am grateful
for his contributions.
Under Dr. Tribley’s leadership as President,
MPC became a model for other colleges and
universities to emulate. His efforts have con-
tributed to a diverse learning environment
where all students have the opportunity to
reach their educational goals. In the 2008–
2009 academic year, Hispanic and Latino stu-
dents made up less than 20 percent of MPC’s
total student body. Less than decade later,
that number doubled to more accurately rep-
resent the population of the Central Coast.
Furthermore, the number of total young people
between the ages of 18 and 24 enrolling in
higher education at MPC has risen signifi-
cantly during Dr. Tribley’s tenure.
Many positive changes to MPC are a result
of Dr. Tribley’s ability to articulate a strong vi-
sion and implement tangible and innovative
policies. Examples of these forward-thinking
approaches include the establishment of dual
enrollment programs for local high school stu-
dents and offering free tuition to first year stu-
dents. Dr. Tribley was also instrumental in
MPC’s College Incentive Program and acquir-
ing the Title V Developing Hispanic-Surviving
Institutions Grant for a transfer and degree
completion initiative titled ‘‘Ready, Set, Trans-
fer.’’ Both programs aim to expand access to
higher education and increase success rates
among underserved students. Dr. Tribley also
demonstrated his financial management skills
by reducing unnecessary spending and being
a responsible steward of public funds.
Dr. Tribley’s service is not limited to MPC.
He serves in a number of advisory rules, in-
cluding his membership on the South Bay Re-
gional Public Safety Training Consortium, the
Monterey County Workforce Investment
Board, the Monterey County Children’s Coun-
cil, and the Monterey Peninsula College Foun-
dation. While our community will certainly miss
Dr. Tribley’s presence, I am confident that he
will continue to find success and purpose in
his future undertakings.
Dr. Walter Tribley embodies the meaning of
a community leader and has undoubtedly
made a lasting impact on community pros-
perity and education on the Central Coast.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my distinguished
colleagues please join me in thanking Dr.
Tribley for his significant contributions and
wishing him success in his new position as
President of Northern Wyoming Community
College District.

RECOGNIZING JUNE 7TH AS NA-
TIONAL GUN VIOLENCE AWARE-
NESS DAY
HON. KATIE HILL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Ms. HILL of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to declare June 7th, National Gun
Violence Awareness Day. Today we are re-
minded of the epidemic of senseless gun vio-
lence that plagues our nation. Our inaction
has cost too many innocent lives. Every day,
100 Americans are killed by gun violence and
countless others are wounded. We are fortu-
nate to have passionate, forward-thinking,
dedicated organizations like Moms Demand
Action who work tirelessly to enact change
and protect our community. It’s time we do our
part.
As a lifelong gun owner, I know that re-
specting the Second Amendment and advo-
cating for gun safety measures are not mutu-
ally exclusive. We can adequately retain the
right to bear arms while keeping our kids and
communities safe.
Like most law-abiding gun owners, I believe
that high-risk individuals like terrorists, domes-
tic violence abusers, convicted criminals, and
those suffering from mental illness, who are
inclined to hurt themselves or others, should
not be allowed to purchase weapons.
That is why I cosponsored and voted for
H.R. 8, The Bipartisan Background Checks
Act of 2019, which establishes new back-
ground check requirements for firearm trans-
fers between private parties. On February 27,
the House passed H.R. 8.—the first time in 25
years that a piece of gun violence prevention
legislation came to the House floor for a vote.
This is a public safety issue, not a partisan
issue. Not only do we need stricter back-
ground checks, but we also need to provide
funding to the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention to research gun violence as the
public health concern that it is. We have a re-
sponsibility to do everything we can to ad-
dress this problem.
Gun safety is a priority for me because I
have heard from far too many constituents
who are afraid for their lives. One constituent
survived the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting,
only to be killed the following year at the Bor-
derline Bar mass shooting just outside our dis-
trict. I will always fight for the people of the
Antelope, Simi, and Santa Clarita Valleys,
above all, and I am committed to pursuing pol-
icy solutions that address both the outcomes
and root causes of these tragedies.
By wearing orange and commemorating Na-
tional Gun Violence Awareness Day, Ameri-
cans will raise awareness about gun violence
and honor the lives and lost human potential
of Americans stolen by gun violence. I want to
thank the advocates and leaders all across
America, but especially at home in my district,

HONORING HEZEKIAH WATKINS
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor a valiant and
selfless community servant, Hezekiah Wat-
kins.
In the summer of 1961, Hezekiah Watkins
sought out to see the Freedom Riders make
history at the Greyhound bus station in Jack-
son, Mississippi. Though his mother warned
him of his potential demise, their home being
burned, and other risks of activism; Watkins
couldn’t be dissuaded from watching the pro-
testers combat segregated public transpor-
tation up close and personal.
At age 13, Watkins’s life changed forever
when he was pushed into the bus station, mis-
taken for an ‘‘outside agitator,’’ and sent to
Parchman Farm, the Mississippi State Peni-
tentiary. While incarcerated, Watkins was
celled with two inmates convicted of murder,
who tormented, molested, and physically
abused him. They also stole his food leaving
him with only scraps of fat, syrup and a bis-
cuit. He was returned to his mother in Jackson
five days later, who anticipated identifying his
remains.
Hearing of Watkins’ incarceration, James
Bevel, a prominent civil rights leader, visited
Watkins’ home in Jackson. While Watkins still
had no intentions of joining the movement,
Bevel insisted he was needed. After hearing
Bevel deliver a powerful sermon at church,
Bevel gained the trust of both Watkins and his
mother, who believed Bevel was a God-sent
man. She allowed Watkins to join the Free-
dom Riders under the sole condition that
Bevel would keep him safe, which he did.
Watkins participated in the 1964 Mississippi
Summer Project, also known as Freedom
Summer, where he and other activists worked
to increase the black voter turnout in Mis-
sissippi. They also instituted Freedom Schools
which worked to academically empower black
students by offering free summer classes.
Today, Watkins can be found at the Mis-
sissippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson, not
as a part of a display, but as an employee,
sharing his story to daily visitors.

PREVENTING CHILD MARRIAGE IN
DISPLACED POPULATIONS ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong support of H.R. 2140, the ‘‘Pre-
venting Child Marriage Act of 2019.’’
H.R. 2140 calls for an adoption by the
United Nations of a definition of ‘‘child mar-
riage’’ and develop a comprehensive strategy
through the United States Permanent Rep-
resentative to the United Nations to address
child marriage in refugee settlements adminis-
tered by the United Nations.
Child marriage occurs when a formal mar-
riage or informal union takes place in which at
least one person is younger than age 18.
Illegal child marriage arises when a formal
marriage or informal union involving at least
one person younger than age 18 that is illegal
under the laws of the country in which the
child marriage occurs.
It is critical that we better understand the
presence of child marriages within refugee
settlements in order to assess how they inter-
sect with the rates of violence against girls in-
cluding young children and infants.
This bill calls upon the United Nations to
adopt a comprehensive strategy including:
Collecting and reporting data related to the
number of known or suspected child mar-
riages taking place inside each such settle-
ment;
Protocols for United Nations personnel re-
garding prevention and monitoring of child
marriages inside each such settlement;
A description of programs administered at
such settlements that provide—
(A) physical, mental, and emotional rehabili-
tation and support to children who have extri-
cated themselves from child marriage; and
(B) alternatives to child marriage, such as
education initiatives; and
Protocols regarding how United Nations per-
sonnel should—
(A) report adults participating in illegal child
marriages in each such settlement;
(B) monitor the prosecution of such adults
by the authorities of the country in which the
2 settlement at issue is located.
When enacted, H.R. 2140 will develop a
framework in gaining data on child marriages
globally as well as create effective strategies
to combat them in refugee settlements.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting H.R. 2140 to confront
child marriages which pose a strong threat to
young children especially girls living within
these settlements.

TRIBUTE TO CATHERINE REY-
NOLDS, RETIRING SENIOR VICE
PRESIDENT AND GENERAL
COUNCIL AT CONSUMERS EN-
ERGY
HON. JOHN R. MOOLENAAR
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to acknowledge Catherine Reynolds for
her superior leadership and service to the
people of Michigan during a trailblazing 40-
year career at CMS Energy Corporation and
Consumers Energy Company.
Cathy, who will retire this month, joined the
company in 1979 during an era of unique
challenges for women in the corporate world.
She started as a proofreader in the ‘‘steno
pool’’ where all the typing in the company was
conducted.
In 1983, she earned her law degree at
Thomas M. Cooley Law School and trans-
ferred to the company’s legal department.
There, she worked in a variety of areas, in-
cluding 10 years in litigation before focusing
on marketing, electronic commerce and cor-
porate issues.
Cathy was appointed assistant general
counsel over the general practice group of the
legal department in 2004 and handled issues
including contracts, property, environmental,
marketing, human resources, labor, benefits,
property tax and insurance matters.
In 2006, she became the company’s first fe-
male corporate secretary. And in 2013, Cathy
was named the company’s first female senior
vice president—serving as Senior Vice Presi-
dent and General Counsel.
She served as a director on the Jackson
County Chamber of Commerce and is a mem-
ber of the Jackson County, Michigan and
American Bar associations.
Cathy has handled each of her roles with
professionalism, integrity and grace. She set
an extraordinary example at the company,
serving as a calm, insightful influence on the
many co-workers she mentored throughout
her career.
On behalf of the Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict of Michigan, I send my congratulations on
Cathy’s well-deserved retirement and many
thanks for 40 years of inspiring and empow-
ering generations of women to excel.

AMERICAN LEGION CONTENNIAL
CELEBRATION
HON. ANN M. KUSTER
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the American
Legion on their 100th birthday. The American
Legion has been a leading voice in advocating
for veterans, servicemembers, their families
and communities.
The American Legion was chartered and in-
corporated by Congress in 1919 as a patriotic
veterans’ organization devoted to mutual help-
fulness. It is the nation’s largest wartime vet-
erans service organization, committed to men-
toring youth and sponsorship of community-
based programs, advocating patriotism and
honor, promoting strong national security, and
continued devotion to fellow servicemembers
and veterans.
The American Legion Department of New
Hampshire was chartered on August 1, 1920.
There are currently 107 American Legion
Posts located throughout the Granite State,
boasting nearly 18,000 members. American
Legion members contribute significantly to
their local communities. Members participate
in blood drives, and contribute generously to
scholarships, community projects, emergency
aid and youth activities. Many of the Posts
have halls, where community enjoy social
functions for events throughout the year.
The American Legion works closely with the
Veterans Administration to ensure that the vet-
erans in New Hampshire and across our coun-
try are cared for following their service to the
United States. New Hampshire leaders work
closely with military organizations and are
proud to have two military installations within
the state serving thousands of military mem-
bers and their families.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s Second Congressional District, con-
gratulations to the American Legion commu-
nity for 100 years and all the best in the years
to come.

SPEECH OF
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 542, the ‘‘Supporting
Research and Development for First Respond-
ers Act of 2019.’’
H.R. 542 amends the Homeland Security
Act of 2002 to authorize the National Urban
Security Technology Laboratory (NUSTL) with-
in the Department of Homeland Security’s
Science and Technology Directorate.
The National Urban Security Technology
Laboratory (NUSTL) is charged with testing
and evaluating emerging technologies and
conducting research and development (R&D)
to assist emergency response providers in
preparing for, and protecting against, threats
of terrorism.
The National Urban Security Technology
Laboratory (NUSTL) conducts nuclear and ra-
diological R&D in support of response and re-
covery as well as providing technical advisory
services to emergency response profes-
sionals.
It is critical that we better understand the
technologies and research used to further de-
velop and assist emergency response pro-
viders when dealing with threats of terrorism.
This bill will allow the National Urban Secu-
rity Technology Laboratory to—
1. Conduct tests, evaluations, and assess-
ments of current and emerging technologies.
2. Also, conduct tests regarding cybersecu-
rity of such technologies that can connect to
the internet, for emergency response pro-
viders;
3. conduct research and development on ra-
diological and nuclear response and recovery;
4. carry out other such activities as the Sec-
retary determines appropriate;
5. act as a technical advisor to emergency
response providers.
When enacted, H.R. 542 will create a better
understanding of the technical advisory serv-
ices that are being used to help emergency
response professionals.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting H.R. 542 to further evaluate
emerging technologies as well as research ra-
diological and nuclear response and recovery
for the emergency response providers.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COAST
GUARD YOUTH STEM PROGRAMS
EXPANSION ACT
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to introduce an important bill, the Coast Guard
Youth STEM Programs Expansion Act. This
bill will allow the Coast Guard expanded au-
thority to partner with the Department of Edu-
cation and the Department of Defense to im-
prove Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics (STEM) education for America’s
elementary and secondary school students
and their teachers.
Now more than ever the innovation capacity
of the United States—our prosperity and secu-
rity—depends on an effective and inclusive
STEM education ecosystem and workforce.
Given the Coast Guard’s mission of coastal
defense and maritime law enforcement, daily
activity relies significantly on STEM skills. The
ability to work with the Department of Edu-
cation and Department of Defense on youth
STEM programs will increase exposure and
engagement to the adventures and intriguing
opportunities of the Coast Guard’s mission.
Specifically, the Coast Guard Youth STEM
Programs Expansion Act will allow the Coast
Guard to coordinate with the Department of
Education to establish programs to improve
STEM knowledge and skills for elementary
and secondary school students and faculty. It
will allow the Coast Guard to cooperate and
coordinate with the Department of Defense,
particularly through the very successful DOD
STARBASE Program. It will also allow the
Coast Guard to expand beyond traditional
STEM skills to focus on expertise particularly
important to their own mission, including lim-
nology, marine science, and oceanography.
Basic STEM concepts are best learned at
an early age—in elementary and secondary
school—and are the essential prerequisites for
career technical training, advanced college-
level and graduate study, and success in
workplaces. With the range of federal agen-
cies partnered to coordinate federal STEM ini-
tiatives, the Coast Guard too has a vested in-
terest in advancing this important mission.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill and
its goal of expanding the Coast Guard’s efforts
to engage and expose American youth to vital
STEM education and workforce skills.
DHS OVERSEAS PERSONNEL
ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 2590, the ‘‘DHS Over-
seas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2019.’’
H.R. 2590 is a continuation of an existing
program that requires an overseas personal
enhancement plan to be provided by the De-
partment of Homeland Security.
Current law mandates that the Department
of Homeland Security have a three-year stra-
tegic plan for overseas deployment of DHS
personnel (P.L. 114–328 (authored by Chair-
man THOMPSON)).
The requirements currently state that DHS
must provide Congress with a briefing regard-
ing all DHS personnel with primary duties tak-
ing place overseas.
H.R. 2590 will build on the existing Federal
DHS mandate by strengthening congressional
oversight.
The resolution requires DHS to submit a
plan to enhance the effectiveness of the over-
seas deployment of DHS personnel 90 days
after their initial briefing.
The DHS plan will be required to include
proposals on how to improve efforts to de-

INTRODUCTION OF THE VERA
RUBIN SURVEY TELESCOPE DES-
IGNATION ACT
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today I am joined by my Science Committee
colleague, Representative GONZÁLEZ COLÓN,
in introducing the Vera Rubin Survey Tele-
scope Designation Act.
Dr. Vera Cooper Rubin was a renowned as-
tronomer and a staunch advocate for women
in science. She was also a trailblazer. Born in
1928, Dr. Rubin’s interest in astronomy was
ignited early. As a young girl, she would rather
stay up and watch the stars through her bed-
room window than go to sleep.
After graduating from Vassar College in
1948 as the only woman astronomer in her
class, Dr. Rubin hoped to pursue her doctoral
studies at Princeton. However, the Princeton
astrophysics graduate program did not admit
women at the time and declined to send her
a course catalog.
Dr. Rubin persisted and earned her master’s
degree at Cornell and her Ph.D. at George-
town University before joining the Carnegie In-
stitution’s Department of Terrestrial Mag-
netism.
As her career progressed, Dr. Rubin contin-
ued to face barriers because of her gender.
For instance, after becoming the first woman
to be officially permitted to observe at the
prestigious Palomar Observatory in 1965, she
discovered that the building had no women’s
restroom. Undeterred, Dr. Rubin created her
own women’s restroom by pasting a skirt cut-
out over the stick figure of a man on the ob-
servatory bathroom.
While Dr. Rubin was breaking down bar-
riers, she was also revolutionizing our under-
standing of the universe. In 1970, Dr. Rubin
and her collaborator Dr. Kent Ford published
some of the best evidence of the existence of
dark matter. This groundbreaking work
changed the conventional view of the universe
from one dominated by light-emitting matter to
one dominated by dark matter.
Dr. Rubin went on to become the second
woman astronomer elected to the National
Academy of Sciences in 1981. She received
the National Medal of Science from President
Clinton in 1993, and she received many other
honors and awards throughout her career.
Motivated by her own battle to garner re-
spect as a woman in a male-dominated field,
Dr. Rubin worked tirelessly to encourage girls
interested in astronomy to pursue their
dreams. She advocated for more women
members of the National Academy of
Sciences and for more women on review pan-
els and academic search committees. She
also advocated for more opportunities for girls
in science. In her address to the University of
California, Berkeley class of 1996, Dr. Rubin
said ‘‘science is competitive, aggressive, de-
manding. It is also imaginative, inspiring, uplift-
ing. You can do it, too,’’ urging the students to
‘‘devise your own paths’’.
Dr. Rubin has a well-deserved place in his-
tory. This bill will honor her legacy by desig-
nating the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST), jointly funded by the National Science
Foundation and the Department of Energy and
set to begin operations in 2023, as the Vera
Rubin Survey Telescope. The LSST was de-
signed, in part, to probe the nature of dark
matter. As a tribute to the woman whose pio-
neering work made this pursuit possible, this
bill would ensure that it bears her name.
I urge my colleagues to join us and help us
move this legislation forward into law.

HONORING ALAN D. MONROE
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor Alan D. Monroe, a leader,
a trailblazer, and an intellectual.
Alan D. Monroe grew up in Sherman,
Texas. After graduating from Sherman High
School in 1965, he attended Austin College
where he graduated with Honors earning a
Bachelor of Arts in English in 1969. In 1970,
he obtained a Master of Arts at New York Uni-
versity. He continued his education at the Uni-
versity of Texas School of Law, graduating in
1975 with his juris doctor. Alan went on to
practice law in many courts across Texas, in-
cluding the United States Court of Appeals for

the Fifth Circuit in 1979 and the Supreme
Court of the United States in 1981.
Alan D. Monroe is highly respected in the
field of real estate law. Among his many pres-
tigious accomplishments, he obtained his
Board Certification by the Texas Board of
Legal Specialization in Commercial Real Es-
tate Law and Residential Real Estate Law in
1988. Additionally, he has held memberships
in the State Bar of Texas, the Hidalgo County
Bar Association, and the American Bar Asso-
ciation.
Alan D. Monroe is a multi-faceted lawyer
with years of experience and a wealth of
knowledge. Upon graduating from the Univer-
sity of Texas School of Law, Alan D. Monroe
served as an Associate with Kelly, Looney &
Alexander in 1976. He became a partner of
the firm in 1980. Seven years later in 1987, he
established his own practice named the Law
Office of Alan D. Monroe. On July 1, 2002,
Alan D. Monroe became partners with Byron
Jay Lewis and Mark S. Peña. They renamed
the firm Lewis, Monroe & Peña.
Alan D. Monroe is known for both his suc-
cesses and his generosity, constantly sharing
his knowledge with peers. He taught courses
in banking law for the American Bankers As-
sociation from 1989 to 1991. He also served
as a chairman of the Real Estate Section for
the Hidalgo County Bar Association from 2009
to 2011, and he coauthored Creative Solutions
to Complex Title Problems, which was pre-
sented during the 28 Annual Advanced Real
Estate Law Conference in 2006.
Alan D. Monroe is looking forward to devot-
ing his time to his wife, Baceliza, and his chil-
dren: Rebecca Monroe, Jessica Martinez and
her husband Daniel, James Alan Monroe and
his wife Mary Beth. He especially cherishes
time with his grandsons, Luke Martinez and
Tom Monroe.
Mr. Alan D. Monroe will retire officially on
June 30, 2019. To say we are grateful for his
contributions would be a grave understate-
ment—he has earned the respect of many
throughout his decades of service. His work
ethic, dedication and professionalism have
made a lasting impact on many, especially
those who have had the privilege of working
with him.
Madam Speaker, I commend Alan D. Mon-
roe for his work in the real estate industry that
has produced great lasting results for the Rio
Grande Valley, South Texas, and beyond.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF GEORGE ALBERT
GAINES, JR.
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor a life so rich in purpose
and experience that it would be a shame not
to commit a place in the record of this body
to commemorate it.
In August, a selfless servant of considerable
character, Mr. George Albert Gaines, Jr. of
Elberton, Georgia, will celebrate his 100th
birthday in the company of friends, family and
loved ones.
Born August 17, 1919, in Elberton, Georgia,
George Albert Gaines, Jr. has spent 100 years
demonstrating why his life—a life of service,
leadership, and fortitude—is worth celebration
and reflection.
In 1940, George began what would ulti-
mately become a 31-year career in the military
by joining the National Guard Unit in his
hometown of Elberton, Georgia. As a member
of the Greatest Generation, and a veteran of
World War II, George served under General
George S. Patton in North Africa, Corsica, and
Italy, where he earned a Bronze Star in April
of 1945 for his leadership on the battlefield,
and for courage in the face of enemy fire.
After the war, George worked in the granite
industry, capably managing Atlas Granite
Company from 1947 to 1964. He later re-
signed from Atlas and took a position as the
full-time executive officer with the Georgia Na-
tional Guard, where he assumed command of
the 1st Battalion, 214th Artillery, with units in
Elberton, Washington, Thompson, Sparta and
Waynesboro, Georgia. While in that position,
George received the Distinctive Service Medal
for exceptionally meritorious and distinctive
service.
In addition to serving his country, George
has been devoted to serving his community
throughout his lifetime. He served on various
boards, including the Elbert County Board of
Education, and has been active in many civic
and community organizations, including the
Sons of the American Revolution, the Salva-
tion Army, the Rotary Club of Elberton, and
the Elberton Granite Association, of which he
was once the President. He has been a de-
voted member of the First Baptist Church of
Elberton and has served the congregation in
many leadership positions over the years.
On behalf of the people of Northeast Geor-
gia, please join me in thanking Mr. Gaines for
his service and celebrating 100 years of a life
well lived.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-

‘‘DHS Acquisition Review Board Act of 2019.’’’
This bill would establish the Acquisition Re-

mines whether best practices are incorporated
in proposed acquisition strategies and if the
strategies are aligned with Department stra-
tegic initiatives.
Last, the Acquisition Review Board over-
sees the progression of major acquisition pro-
grams, confirming that the proposed acquisi-
tion has met key phases of the lifecycle frame-
work, and conducting systematic reviews of
the acquisition to ensure the program is pro-
gressing in compliance with approved docu-
mentation.
I stand in support of fairness and trans-
parency through the Acquisition Review
Board.

HONORING DR. KAREN HAYNES ON
HER RETIREMENT AS PRESI-
DENT OF CALIFORNIA STATE
UNIVERSITY SAN MARCOS
HON. MIKE LEVIN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Mr LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise to honor Dr. Karen Haynes on the event
of her retirement as president of California
State University San Marcos.
Dr. Haynes has worked for over 30 years as
an academic administrator. During her tenure
as president of California State University San
Marcos (CSUSM), she was instrumental in the
growth and development of the school. She
joined CSUSM fourteen years after the school
opened its doors, with a student population of
merely 7,000. CSUSM is now home to over
17,000 students, Division II athletics, and a
satellite campus in Temecula.
Since the beginning of her tenure, Dr.
Haynes has worked to ensure that CSUSM
serves a diverse student population. Around
one third of CSU San Marcos students are
outside of the traditional college age range,
and the school has the largest number of Na-
tive American students per-capita in the CSU
system. Like Dr. Haynes herself, almost half of
the students are first-generation college stu-
dents.
CSUSM would not be the school it is today
without the hard work and dedication of Dr.
Haynes. I thank Dr. Haynes for her fifteen
years of service to California State University
San Marcos and congratulate her on her re-
tirement.
DR. SCHOONOVER’S REMARKS ON
NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICA-
TIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE
OF MAINE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 11, 2019
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, on June 5,
2019, Dr. Rod Schoonover, a Senior Analyst
in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research of
the U.S. Department of State, testified before
the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence. The hearing sought answers on
the very real dangers and national security
risks caused by climate change. The Adminis-
tration, however, continued its pattern of anti-
science and climate denial behavior. Though
Dr. Schoonover was allowed to give his in-
valuable testimony, the Administration blocked
his testimony from being entered into the
record. We must recognize that climate
change is a threat to our country’s economic
well-being, public health, and national security.
I include in the RECORD part of Schoonover’s
summary, but urge my colleagues to read the

Chairman Schiff, Ranking Member Nunes,
and distinguished members of the Com-
mittee, thank you for inviting me to speak
with you today on the national security im-
plications of climate change.
As a U.S. intelligence officer in the Depart-
ment of State Bureau of Intelligence and Re-
search it is my job to provide clear, objec-
tive, and independent analysis to policy-
makers to advance U.S. national security ob-
jectives. As a scientist in the intelligence
community (IC), I blend insights derived
from peer-reviewed journal articles and
other scientific reports with information
gathered from daily intelligence reporting to
provide science-informed national security
analysis. My understanding of this and other
issues is deepened by the cadre of talented
and dedicated officers in the IC, many with
technical expertise, who quietly serve U.S.
interests. This Committee is already aware
that the IC does not advocate for any par-
ticular set of policies, including those that
address climate change.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Fundamental characteristics of the global
climate are moving outside the bounds expe-
rienced in modern history and there is uncer-
tainty on how some aspects of the climate
will evolve. Given the complex social and po-
litical contexts in which a multitude of
changes are occurring, however, we can ex-
pect new and compounded stresses on people
and societies around the world, many with
outcomes important for national security.
Climate change will have wide-ranging im-
plications for U.S. national security over the
next 20 years through global perturbations,
increased risk of political instability,
heightened tensions between countries for
resources, a growing number of climate-
linked humanitarian crises, emergent
geostrategic competitive domains, and ad-
verse effects on militaries. Increasingly
probable amalgamations of these security
concerns are especially worrisome. Climate
change alone is unlikely to trigger state fail-
ure in the next few decades but it will affect
factors that that contribute to conflict, such
as access to natural resources. People will

increasingly decide to move because of dete-
riorating conditions, both within nations
and into countries that are more prosperous.
Perhaps most importantly, the rapidity of
concurrent and compounded changes to
Earth’s systems, from human and natural
causes, heightens the risk for unwelcome and
possibly severe climate-linked surprises.
FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSIS
The IC’s task with respect to climate
change is to inform policymakers of the
myriad risks and uncertainties that may lie
ahead, rather than trying to predict the fu-
ture. We have therefore examined a wide
range of climate change effects, including
those currently believed to have low prob-
ability, particularly if the ramifications
could be highly impactful. The IC focuses on
security considerations outside the United
States, so we do not address the direct ef-
fects of climate change on the U.S.homeland.
We expect, however, that many judgements
could nonetheless apply to the United
States.
