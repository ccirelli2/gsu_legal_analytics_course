RECOGNIZING PARK AND
RECREATION MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
July as Park and Recreation Month. It
is a fitting time to celebrate our Fed-
eral, State, and local parks and recre-
ation systems because so many Ameri-
cans will visit them this summer.
As a lifelong resident of rural Penn-
sylvania, an avid outdoorsman, and
spending time in my career as a rec-
reational therapist, I strongly support
our Nation’s parks and recreation fa-
cilities.
Our parks provide countless rec-
reational and educational opportuni-
ties for individuals and families to
enjoy the outdoors. This month recog-
nizes the important role these parks
and public facilities play in the lives of
Americans and the contributions of
employees who work every day to
maintain public parks across the Na-
tion.
Our parks create opportunities for
people to come together and experience
a sense of community. They contribute
to local economies by attracting busi-
nesses and jobs and increasing housing
values.
In the United States, public park op-
erations and capital spending generate
nearly $140 million in economic activ-
ity annually, and our National Park
System receives an estimated 331 mil-
lion recreation visits every year.
Ninety percent of people in the
United States agree that public park
recreation facilities and activities are
important government services. This
support spans across all people in the
country regardless of race, income, or
political affiliation. Nearly 75 percent
of Americans agree it is important to
ensure all members of their commu-
nity have equitable access to public
parks and recreation facilities.
The most economically sound areas
are those with ample public park and
recreation facilities and activities. A
key factor in business expansion and
location decisions is quality of life for
employees, with a premium placed on
adequate and accessible public parks
and open space.
Mr. Speaker, public parks and rec-
reational facilities foster a variety of
activities that contribute to a
healthier society. Americans living
within a 10-minute walk of a park have
higher levels of physical activity and
lower rates of obesity. People who use
public parks and open spaces are three
times more likely to achieve the rec-
ommended levels of physical activity
than nonusers.
Recreational programs at public
parks provide children with a safe
place to play, access to healthy foods,
opportunities to be physically active,
and enrichment facilities that help pre-
vent at-risk behavior such as drug use
and gang involvement.
As we head further into summer,
many Americans will visit public parks
and recreation facilities to spend time
outdoors with family, friends, and
neighbors. We are blessed with beau-
tiful outdoor facilities, and it is my
hope that all Americans get out and
enjoy the parks in their areas.
MINIMUM WAGE KILLS JOBS
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, this morning, I rise to ad-
dress a bill that my friends across the
aisle, the Democrats, are going to
bring to the floor next week raising the
minimum wage to $15 an hour.
There was a score this week by the
Congressional Budget Office that sheds
truth and light on that proposal and
what it does, and this government
source has indicated it kills jobs. It
harms Americans who are today strug-
gling to make ends meet. The average
family income will be reduced as a re-
sult of this bill.
Mr. Speaker, it is estimated by the
CBO, the Congressional Budget Office,
that 3.7 million jobs will be lost and
that 42 percent of families who are cur-
rently at the minimum wage will see a
net reduction in their family income,
taking many of them, maybe for the
first time, down into a poverty level of
income.
There is a better way, Mr. Speaker.
In the past, this body passed the Career
and Technical Education Reauthoriza-
tion bill, the Perkins Act. I was proud
to work with Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI
from Illinois on that bill as we led it.
President Trump signed that into law
last July.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5308 July 10, 2019
We are seeing this bill restore rungs
on the ladder of opportunity. A signifi-
cant number of jobs—6 million jobs—
are open and available today at family-
sustaining wages.
There is a pathway out of minimum
wage. Minimum wage should be a start-
ing point. To me, it is not where you
start in life, but it is where you end up.
We have provided the tools to provide
individuals better access to the type of
skills-based education to improve their
lot in life and to achieve higher wages
and greater opportunity, which is what
this country promises.
We work hard; we take risk; and we
better ourselves.
f
CALLING ON THE HOUSE TO
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
still I rise. It has been some 84 days
since the Mueller report was made pub-
lic, some 84 days now that the Chief
Executive Officer of this country has
been above the law, some 84 days that
we are aware of since the Mueller re-
port. But in truth and in fact, before
the Mueller report was presented, we
knew that the Chief Executive Officer
was behaving in a fashion that would
indicate that he thought he was above
the law, 84 days above the law, 84 days
disrespecting the law.
He disrespects the Supreme Court of
the United States of America. After it
makes a ruling on the Census, he de-
cides to just simply disregard that.
‘‘Maybe I will use an executive order.’’
The Supreme Court has already spo-
ken. There was a time when the Presi-
dent of the United States of America
would respect a decision of the Su-
preme Court.
He disrespects Congress, encourages
witnesses not to testify, and refuses to
surrender proper documents after they
have been properly subpoenaed.
He has no respect for the Court and
no respect for Congress.
Eighty-four days above the law since
the Mueller report was presented—as
heartbreaking as that is, I would also
add many days since these babies at
the border were separated from their
parents.
What kind of country are we allowing
ourselves to metamorphose into when
we will allow this to go unchecked,
when we will allow babies to be taken
from their parents? What kind of a
country are we metamorphosing into?
We have a responsibility, a duty, and
an obligation to ensure that no one is
above the law. Article II, Section 4 of
the Constitution is the law. We in this
House have the responsibility to en-
force that law. If we do not enforce
that law, there will be no guardrails. A
ruthless, reckless, and lawless Chief
Executive will continue to disobey the
law, knowing that he can do what he
will and what he may and that we will
not challenge him.
But I do believe this: I believe that
time is running out. I believe that
there be will be a vote to remove this
Chief Executive. Let me correct that: a
vote to impeach.
I don’t know what the Senate will do,
but I believe he will be impeached. I be-
lieve he will be impeached not because
of but in spite of a good many people
who hold public trust, I might add. In
spite of them, he is going to be im-
peached. Because of some who hold
public trust and in spite of some others
who hold public trust, he will be im-
peached.
The tintinnabulations of history, the
bells of history, are sounding. History
is starting to drive this, and history
will drive some people. There are peo-
ple who make history, and there are
people whom history will make. His-
tory is going to make some people as-
sume their responsibilities and take up
the challenge that the Framers of the
Constitution have afforded us.
I believe that this is going to take
place in the near future. I believe that
this House is going to do what it is sup-
posed to do, that we are not going to
place the blame on others and that we
will take up our responsibilities.
I believe that when it happens, Amer-
ica is going to be on a proper course.
We will set a proper course so that we
will show that no one is above the law.
Let the Senate do what it may, but
the House will have taken up its re-
sponsibilities and placed an indelible
stain on the Chief Executive Officer for
his attempts to remain above the law
and to abuse these children with poli-
cies that would separate them from
their parents.
No one is above the law, not even the
Chief Executive Officer in the most
powerful country in the world.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
RECOGNIZING THE COLUMBUS
POLICE DEPARTMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Columbus Police Depart-
ment for its support of National Guard
and military Reserve employees.
The Columbus Police Department re-
cently received the Above and Beyond
Award for its dedication to its officers
who are also members of the National
Guard and military Reserves. This
award goes to organizations that go
above and beyond when it comes to em-
ployees who also serve in our Nation’s
Armed Forces.
The Columbus Police Department
currently has 11 officers who also serve
in the National Guard or military Re-
serve roles. In fact, 33 percent of its
employees are either currently serving
or are veterans of our Armed Forces.
I thank the Columbus Police Depart-
ment for caring for our veterans and
for those currently serving our coun-
try.
RECOGNIZING IU HEALTH BALL MEMORIAL
HOSPITAL
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize IU Health Ball Memorial
Hospital in celebrating 90 years of serv-
ice to the Muncie community.
The hospital has grown with the city
to offer the highest quality of care.
Throughout the years, Ball Memorial
Hospital has been with the city of Mun-
cie through many ups and downs, in-
cluding the Great Depression and the
polio epidemic of the 1940s.
Ball Memorial Hospital merged with
IU Health in 2010, a move that only ex-
panded the hospital’s reach throughout
east central Indiana.
Congratulations to IU Health Ball
Memorial Hospital on 90 years of suc-
cess. I thank them for serving the city
of Muncie and the State of Indiana.
RECOGNIZING ASAP OF BARTHOLOMEW COUNTY
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Alliance for Substance
Abuse Progress in Bartholomew Coun-
ty, a group that has been on the front
lines of combating the opioid crisis.
The alliance, known as ASAP, part-
ners with law enforcement, courts,
counselors, health systems, and com-
munity leaders to address the opioid
crisis through prevention, interven-
tion, treatment, and recovery.
I want to recognize its new executive
director, Doug Leonard, who officially
started this Monday. Doug is a former
local and State healthcare leader, serv-
ing as the president of the Indiana Hos-
pital Association from 2007 until 2017.
While we have much work to do,
ASAP of Bartholomew County can be a
model for other counties looking to
combat this terrible scourge.
b 1015
I rise today to reiterate my commit-
ment to passing the USMCA, which
will lead to stronger economic growth
and rising wages for all Hoosiers and
all Americans. The USMCA will gen-
erate tens of billions of dollars, and it
will create over 175,000 new American
jobs.
The USMCA will also rebalance trade
to support American manufacturing,
strengthen U.S. trade in agriculture,
and support American small business.
It increases market access for Hoosier
and American dairy providers.
It is imperative that Congress act on
behalf of American farmers, ranchers,
businesses, and all workers.

WOMEN’S WORLD CUP AND EQUAL
PAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
GREEN of Texas). The Chair recognizes
the gentleman from California (Mr.
COSTA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate the United States
Women’s National Soccer Team on
their World Cup victory in France.
For weeks, America’s women’s soccer
team has captivated the imagination

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5309
July 10, 2019
and the enthusiasm of not only Amer-
ica’s soccer world, but much of that
throughout the entire globe.
Their performance over the past few
weeks leaves no doubt that they are
the best team in the world, but their
victory Sunday is a stinging reminder
that members of the team are being
paid much less than their male coun-
terparts.
With four World Cup titles, four
Olympic Gold Medals, and a long his-
tory of dominance, they are the most
successful team in the history of wom-
en’s soccer—more successful on the
world stage than the United States
men’s, their counterparts.
And what we are really talking about
here is an issue that has been out there
for many years, and that is equal pay
for equal work. The highest paid male
soccer player makes $200,000 more than
the highest paid female player.
Over the past 3 years, the women’s
team generated more revenue and high-
er TV ratings than their men’s coun-
terpart.
The gap is a stark reminder of the
persistent and frustrating reality that
women’s sports are undervalued and
their stars, simply, are underpaid. That
is a fact.
But it is not just the playing field
where the women’s work is under-
valued; it is also in the workforce. In
the United States, women who work
full-time still earn only 80 cents, on
the average, for every dollar earned by
a man. Today’s wage gap robs women
of over $400,000 over the course of their
working lives.
So equal pay for equal work is really,
I think, an incredible value that we
must pursue in this Congress. It is the
fair thing. It is the right thing to do.
In March, I joined my colleagues to
pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which
will give women tools they need to
fight pay discrimination, and I urge my
colleagues in the Senate to pay atten-
tion to the strong support for the bill
and to ensure that, in fact, we follow
up and get it to the President’s desk.
Also, in March, the U.S. soccer team
sued for equal pay, alleging gender dis-
crimination, with the men’s team sup-
porting their efforts. This really goes
back to title IX that was started dec-
ades ago to ensure that, in our colle-
giate sports, women could have the
same access to the same sporting pro-
grams throughout our universities.
Now, this week, we are going to see
parades in New York and in Los Ange-
les celebrating this great world cham-
pionship, this victory. But shortly
after the final whistle on Sunday so-
lidified these women’s efforts in his-
tory books, celebratory cheers in the
crowd quickly erupted into chants of
‘‘equal pay, equal pay,’’ showing their
support, as well, for which a
groundswell, I believe, is developing.
It is time, therefore, that we end pay
disparity on the playing field and in
the workplace once and for all.
Congratulations to the United States
Women’s National Soccer Team. Go
USA and equal pay.
IN HONOR OF GENE HAAGENSON
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise
today to recognize and honor the ca-
reer of Gene Haagenson on his retire-
ment.
A successful television news reporter
for four decades, Gene spent the past 27
years covering stories throughout my
home in the San Joaquin Valley for
KFSN TV, Channel 30. He had the
pleasure of working with so many of us
over the years.
An adept, smart reporter, he is
known and respected for not only his
fair reporting, hard-hitting questions,
and the embodiment of a true profes-
sional, he did his homework. He knew
what he was talking about.
Gene’s professionalism, his commit-
ment to fair and balanced reporting
will be missed, but he leaves a robust
foundation for future journalists to
build upon. He is a mentor, and he is a
teacher.
I wish him the very best with his
family and his grandchildren in his new
exciting phase of life.
But I will encourage him, as I have
before, that he use all these skills that
he has honed over the years and teach,
teach in our colleges and universities,
the future journalists of America, to
ensure that we have a vibrant, fair, and
free press that is the cornerstone of our
democracy. Gene has a lot more to
give, and I hope he does so.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
join me in honoring Gene Haagenson
for his achievements, his outstanding
commitment to Fresno, the San Joa-
quin Valley, and to our country, for al-
ways—always—standing for a free and
fair press.

IN MEMORY OF EDWIN RUSSELL
MEGONEGAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. YOHO) for 5 minutes.
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor a great man and a friend who
recently passed away, Mr. Edwin Rus-
sell Megonegal, or, as his friends called
him, Russ.
Russ passed away peacefully last
week on June 21, 2019, at the age of 97.
He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsyl-
vania, on October 21, 1921.
Mr. Megonegal was part of America’s
Greatest Generation, serving his coun-
try during World War II and the Ko-
rean war in the Army Air Corps, the
Air Force, and retiring in 1973 from the
Pennsylvania National Guard, with the
rank of colonel.
He was a graduate of Franklin &
Marshall College and Temple Univer-
sity.
Mr. Megonegal had a long career in
education in Pennsylvania as teacher,
assistant principal, principal, and re-
tiring as assistant superintendent of
the William Penn School District.
He and his beloved wife, Tigger, re-
tired to Lake Mary, Florida, in 1981,
where he served as the commissioner of
the City of Lake Mary. He and Tigger
made Clay County their home in 1991
and immediately became ensconced in
their community.
I first met Russ in 2012, while run-
ning for office. He was at every meet-
ing, every gathering, and knew every-
one. He always had a smile on his face
and many pearls of wisdom that he
would impart upon me, whether it was
solicited or not. No matter what, he
also told you what he believed and
what he felt and what he thought was
right; and that is perhaps what I will
miss most about Russ.
Russ’s service to Clay County was
boundless. He served on the City Coun-
ty Planning and Zoning Committee and
the board of Penney Farms Retirement
Community. He was actively involved
in many of the charities, including the
Rotary Club of Green Cove Springs,
J.P. Hall Charities, the Clay County
Salvation Army Advisory Council, the
Food Pantry of Green Cove Springs,
the Republican Club of Clay County,
the Republican Executive Committee
of Clay County, the DePaul Society of
St. Vincent’s Medical Center, the
United States Coast Guard Auxiliary,
and the Clay County Fair Association.
He was an active member of the First
Presbyterian Church of Green Cove
Springs.
He had received many awards for his
public service, including the Clay
County Lifetime Achievement Award
in 2016 and the Boy Scouts of America
12 Points Award in 2019. Of all of these
awards, Russ may perhaps be remem-
bered best as the unofficial mayor of
Penney Farms, where he made his
home.
Russ’s life was full, and he touched
all those who knew him. I am proud to
have known him and to have called
him a friend.
Russ, you will be missed.
CONGRATULATIONS TO JIM LLOYD
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate and celebrate one of
my constituents, Jim Lloyd.
Dr. Lloyd received his degree in vet-
erinary medicine from Michigan State
University in 1981, but he didn’t stop
there. He furthered his education with
a doctorate in agricultural economics
in 1983 and began his long career as
both a published researcher and educa-
tor.
Before leaving Michigan, Jim served
as the dean of the Michigan State Uni-
versity Veterinary College. After years
of teaching, presenting, and serving the
agricultural community of Michigan,
Jim was selected as the dean of the
University of Florida College of Veteri-
nary Medicine in 2013, my first year in
Congress. In that role, I had the great
privilege of working with him directly
on a number of initiatives.
His passion for science, his commit-
ment to agriculture, his passion for the
veterinary profession in general, and
his friendship inspire not just me, but
everyone who comes in contact with
him.
Mr. Speaker, I wish Jim well in his
retirement, and I look forward to
working with him in the future.

IN HONOR OF KEN BROCK
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor Ken Brock.
Mr. Brock calls Keystone Heights
home and is an Army veteran.
In addition to serving his country
with distinction and honor, he has done
something else that is incredible. Mr.
Brock has walked more than 2,650
miles across the United States to pro-
mote PTSD programs for the Wounded
Warrior Project, with the aim of mak-
ing it to Idaho by Independence Day.
His walk began on February 1 of this
year and wasn’t without challenges. He
faced two weekends of deadly torna-
does, deadly floods, thunderstorms, a
collision with a tractor trailer, and
plenty of snow.
In the midst of the Ken’s trek, he was
called back to Florida for a mandatory
VA benefit evaluation. Not to be de-
terred, Ken made his appointment and
got right back on the road.
Nonetheless, he arrived at Coeur
d’Alene, Idaho, 6 days ahead of the
town’s Fourth of July parade, with
residents standing five deep along
Sherman Avenue. Brock was featured
in the parade doing what he does best:
walking with his 100-pound supply cart
and his service dog, Pam.
This Sunday he will receive a hero’s
welcome from the Keystone Heights
community. I am proud to honor and
celebrate Ken Brock’s journey to honor
our veterans.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF JACK
GREER
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
COSTA). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE) for 5
minutes.
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to remember Mr. Jack Greer.
Jack passed away last week after a
long life of personal and business
achievement and service to his family
and to his community.
So many people in south Alabama
knew Jack from shopping for groceries
at Greer’s grocery store, a business
which has been operating in our area
for over 100 years. But it was through
his civic involvement that Jack truly
left his mark. His civic contributions
are too many to list.
It was his role as an environmental
advocate that he perhaps was most
proud of. He was a founding member of
Mobile Baykeeper and remained en-
gaged throughout his life in protecting
the waters in and around Mobile Bay.
Jack was an active member of Dau-
phin Way United Methodist Church,
and he proudly served his country as
second lieutenant in the United States
Army.
I knew Mr. Jack. I have known the
Greer family my entire life. My deepest
condolences to his wife of 70 years,
Janice, and his many surviving chil-
dren, grandchildren, and great-grand-
children. Please know that Mr. Jack
lived a life you can all be proud of. He
will be, and is, sorely missed.
RECOGNIZING THE ST. CLOUD
POLICE DEPARTMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the St. Cloud Police
Department for receiving the United
States Department of Justice’s L. An-
thony Sutin Civic Imagination Award.
This award recognizes collaborative
partnerships between law enforcement
and their communities.
The St. Cloud Police Department re-
ceived the award for its Community
Outpost Project. The ‘‘Cop House,’’ as
is it is more commonly known, is a re-
furbished residential home in a neigh-
borhood that previously experienced a
high level of calls for local law enforce-
ment.
The St. Cloud Police Department, to-
gether with numerous community
partners, now provides not only a local
gathering place, but safety and health
programming for the neighborhood
residents out of this home.
Congratulations to Chief Blair An-
derson, Lieutenant Lori Ellering, the
Greater St. Cloud Public Safety Foun-
dation, and all of the officers of the St.
Cloud Police Department for this well-
deserved award.
Our community appreciates all of
you and all that you do to protect and
serve us.
PRIORITIZING TRANSPORTATION SAFETY
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, on Min-
nesota’s U.S. Highway 12 between the
cities of Independence and my home-
town of Delano, in just the last 5 years,
there have been 811 crashes in which
239 people have been injured and 24 peo-
ple have lost their lives.
Several of those lost have been high
school classmates of my own children.
In fact, this past March, Marleena
Dieterich, a senior honor student at
Delano High School and the child of
Thom and Deb, lost her life as she was
trying to get home.
Recently, Deputy Administrator for
the Federal Highway Administration
Brandye Hendrickson visited Min-
nesota on behalf of Secretary Chao.
Following a bus tour of the most dan-
gerous stretches of U.S. Highway 12, we
held a roundtable with community
leaders and residents to discuss pos-
sible solutions and the need for action.
b 1030
The accidents and fatalities on this
road are avoidable. We continue to
urge Secretary Chao to visit and see
firsthand the danger this highway pre-
sents.
Congress must do its part to provide
long-term Federal transportation fund-
ing for needed infrastructure repairs
and improvements. We must find inno-
vative and long-term solutions to ad-
dress these sorely needed improve-
ments, like the need on U.S. Highway
12.
I thank Deputy Administrator
Hendrickson and everyone who partici-
pated in our roundtable. Together, we
will continue fighting for improve-
ments on U.S. Highway 12 until we see
the changes that will prioritize the
safety of our neighbors, our friends,
and our fellow Minnesotans.
INSPIRING FUTURE FEMALE LEADERS
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize my staff and to
highlight a program our office
launched during my first term in Con-
gress for high school women in Min-
nesota’s Sixth Congressional District.
The program is called the Young
Women’s Leadership Program.
In addition to my staff, I want to per-
sonally thank the amazing women
leaders who have participated in the
program and who have agreed to be a
resource and mentors for the young
women who attend these programs as
they get ready for life beyond high
school.
Every summer, our Young Women’s
Leadership Program hosts three round-
table discussions featuring high-
achieving professional women in our
district.
To date, we have been honored by the
first female brigadier general for both
the Army and Air Force, the first
Asian American female U.S. district
attorney, a surgeon, a college pro-
fessor, and numerous female entre-
preneurs and business owners.
This program gives our participants
insight into valuable leadership experi-
ences and career advice during a piv-
otal time in their lives.
Our panelists have discussed how to
negotiate your first salary, tips for
networking successfully, managing a
work-life balance, and countless other
lessons.
We live in a time in our Nation’s his-
tory where everyone is important and
needed, especially strong women.
Again, I want to thank the incredible
women leaders who have participated
in our program to pay it forward for
the next generation of women leaders,
and I encourage my Republican and
Democrat colleagues here in Congress
to do the same in all of your districts.
A BETTER WAY TO AGE
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, we re-
cently held a senior forum for residents
of Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional
District. This forum was an oppor-
tunity to connect our seniors and their
caregivers with resources to assist with
health, lifestyle, and future planning
needs.
I want to thank the Metropolitan
Area Agency on Aging and the Central
Minnesota Council on Aging for
partnering with our office to make this
event a success.
Recently, the House passed the Set-
ting Every Community Up for Retire-
ment Enhancement Act. This non-
partisan law, more commonly known
as the SECURE Act, will make it easi-
er to establish retirement plans and re-
moves age limits for IRA contribu-
tions.
The SECURE Act will allow our sen-
iors more flexibility and improve their
quality of life in retirement.

HONORING YARDLEY BOROUGH
CHIEF OF POLICE JOSEPH KELLY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor a dedicated public
servant from Bucks County, Pennsyl-
vania, Yardley Borough Chief of Police
Joseph Kelly.
Chief Kelly was presented with the
Excellent Police Service Award, a well-
deserved distinction for a man who has
dedicated his life to public service.
Before he served in Yardley, Chief
Kelly was a 23-year veteran of the New
Jersey Transit Police Department,
serving as deputy chief and chief of op-
erations. Before his service there, he
was an EMT dispatcher for the Maple-
wood, New Jersey, Police Department.
Upon becoming Yardley Borough po-
lice chief, the area saw a 20 percent
drop in traffic accidents compared to
the year before, as well as a more suc-
cessful enforcement of transit laws.
In addition, Chief Kelly has moved to
make the department more approach-
able, especially for victims of domestic
violence, pushing for a closer relation-
ship with A Woman’s Place and other
organizations.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chief Joseph
Kelly for his continued service, and I
would also like to thank all the mem-
bers of the Yardley Borough Police De-
partment for their tireless work in pro-
tecting our community.
HONORING THEODORE HAUPTMAN,
FEASTERVILLE BUSINESS ASSOCIATION 2019
PERSON OF THE YEAR
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize and honor the
distinguished achievements of the
Feasterville Business Association 2019
Person of the Year, Theodore
Hauptman.
Mr. Hauptman serves both in his im-
mediate community in Holland, Penn-
sylvania, as well as the greater com-
munity of Bucks County.
He has logged 25 active years with
the Feasterville Business Association,
serving as its president, corresponding
secretary, and as a member of its exec-
utive board. He currently serves as
legal counsel for the organization.
Mr. Speaker, the mission statement
of the Feasterville Business Associa-
tion is to foster and encourage growth,
progress, and the betterment of the
community.
Mr. Hauptman has shown his belief in
and dedication to this mission as he
serves his community with distinction
in his practice of law; his position on
the Northampton Township Zoning
Hearing Board; and his positions as di-
rector, counsel, and president of the
Northampton Community and Eco-
nomic Development group.
Mr. Hauptman is a black belt in
taekwondo and serves as a certified
coach and referee for the World
Taekwondo Federation.
He and his wife are also the proud
parents of three children: Jonathan,
Adam, and Allyson, the latter of whom
is currently serving our country on Ac-
tive Duty as a captain in the United
States Army.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to once
again thank Mr. Hauptman for his
service to Bucks County and our con-
stituents, and we congratulate him on
his achievement.
REMEMBERING KRISTEN MARIE RIDGE
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it
is with a heavy heart that I rise today
to recognize the remarkable life of 26-
year-old Kristen Marie Ridge, who, on
July 5, was taken from us too soon.
Kristen was a veterinary technician
at the Animals’ Hospital of Levittown.
She deeply cared about the safety and
well-being of all animals.
Her thoughtfulness continues after
her death with her urging friends and
family to donate towards animal wel-
fare in lieu of flowers.
Mr. Speaker, Kristen’s selflessness is
precisely why we recognize her today
on the floor of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives.
She is an example of someone with a
compassionate heart having a desire to
help people and animals in our commu-
nity.
We send our love to her parents,
Susan and Robert Ridge; her sister,
Katherine Ridge Mayer; and her grand-
parents, Rob and Lil Boyson.
May they find peace knowing that
Kristen left an indelible mark on our
community and she is now enjoying
her eternal reward for a life she spent
caring for all of God’s creatures.

CONGRATULATING ANTHONY
CICERO IV AND DAKOTA SNYDER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Anthony Cicero
IV and Dakota Snyder of Elizabeth-
town High School in Lancaster County
for their remarkable achievement on
winning the Student Angler Federation
High School Fishing World Champion-
ship last month.
Their partnership led them to victory
over 389 high school teams from around
the Nation.
Mr. Speaker, these two young gentle-
men are no strangers to the water. At
their young age, they have been tour-
nament fishing for years and practicing
all year round.
Dakota said: ‘‘As long as there is no
ice, I am out there fishing.’’
It is a trait that runs in the family,
as Anthony and Dakota’s fathers fished
together as a team as well.
Mr. Speaker, we are blessed with
beautiful and great natural resources
in York and Lancaster Counties, which
will be celebrated and protected
through the passage of my legislation
to create the Susquehanna National
Heritage Area.
I am very thankful that these two
young men enjoy spending time in na-
ture while using their talents. I wish
them both continued success and con-
gratulate them on their championship
victory.
HONORING COMMUNITY LEADERS MAKING AN
IMPACT COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor and give thanks to com-
munity leaders who are making an im-
pact on the communities I represent in
combating the opioid epidemic.
York and Lancaster County are lead-
ing the Nation in their community-
wide, collaborative approach to help
neighbors who are struggling with ad-
diction.
York County District Attorney David
Sunday and coroner Pam Gay are lead-
ers in our community. They have
brought together community organiza-
tions in York County, creating an or-
ganization that is now known as the
York Opioid Collaborative, assisting in
coordination of services and raising
awareness about the opioid crisis in
our communities and across the Na-
tion.
Similarly, in Lancaster County,
Alice Yoder, the director of community
health with Penn Medicine, and Lan-
caster County Commissioner Josh Par-
sons have led an organization called
Joining Forces, another community-
wide effort, this one in Lancaster
County.
Mr. Speaker, while Congress con-
tinues to address this critical issue, we
are fortunate in Pennsylvania’s 11th
District to have public servants leading
on the effort to address this horrific
epidemic. I thank them and many oth-
ers across our community who are
working together to make a difference.

WELCOMING REVEREND ASRIEL
MCLAIN
The SPEAKER. Without objection,
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
JOHNSON) is recognized for 1 minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, it is my great privilege to in-
troduce my friend and Louisiana na-
tive, Reverend Asriel G. McLain, as our
guest chaplain to lead the opening
prayer today.
Reverend McLain has held leadership
positions in numerous churches
throughout the United States, includ-
ing Louisiana, Michigan, and Texas. He
has written over a dozen books and fre-
quently gives lectures on equipping
Christian education leaders for effec-
tive ministry and discipleship.
Reverend McLain received his bach-
elor of arts from Bishop College in Dal-
las, Texas, and his master of divinity
from Princeton Theological Seminary
in Princeton, New Jersey. He is the
proud father of four children: David,
Joseph, Desiree, and Danielle. Some of
the family is here today. He is also a
lifelong member of Omega Psi Phi Fra-
ternity.
In addition to his work behind the
pulpit and inside the classroom, Rev-
erend McLain followed in his father’s
footsteps, becoming a leading voice on
advancing the cause of justice and
equality for all Americans. Having wit-
nessed and endured the hardships of
racism personally, Reverend McLain
has devoted much of his life to ensur-
ing that future generations can enjoy
equality in all aspects of life.
It is a great honor to ask God’s bless-
ings over us, and I ask my colleagues
to help me in welcoming my dear
friend, Reverend Asriel McLain.

RECOGNIZING SECOND ANNUAL
ABSECON KIDS’ ALL-DOGS DOG
SHOW
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, a
group of impressive young south Jersey
people, aged 8 to 11, hosted their second
annual dog show at a local park in Ab-
secon, New Jersey. The event began in
2018 when Grace Marczyk watched a
dog show and felt bad for the mixed
breeds. They weren’t allowed to com-
pete.
Grace talked to her friend Zoey. To-
gether, they formed a committee of
animal lovers, and they hosted a dog
show that was inclusive to all members
of the species.
The competition is comprised of mul-
tiple categories, judged exclusively by
the kids, and concludes with different
prizes being awarded for the Best in
Show.
At their first show, the kids raised
$650, all of which was donated to the
Humane Society of Atlantic County.
Their second show raised over $2,000 for
the Humane Society and nearly dou-
bled its participants and its sponsors.
These innovative, enthusiastic young
people and their inclusivity and love
for animals is a truly great thing to
see. We are lucky to have them as part
of our community in south Jersey.
It is said that a nation is judged by
the way it treats its pets. If it is,
Madam Speaker, these are going to be
fine young Americans.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
DELIVERING
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, in a climate of end-
less negative attacks, it is refreshing
to read ‘‘President Trump Is Deliv-
ering’’ by the respected national col-
umnist Star Parker in the Aiken
Standard on June 24.
She has correctly identified success
as being three criteria, the Constitu-
tion, Christianity, and capitalism.
‘‘On all three fronts, Donald Trump
is making America great again. The
Supreme Court now has a solid con-
servative majority,’’ with the environ-
ment friendly to Christian values to re-
store respect for life and family.
Regarding the third C, Harvard econ-
omist Robert Barro estimates that the
2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act added al-
most a third over the average GDP
growth rate in the Obama years.
‘‘Optimism among the Nation’s small
businesses is surging, according to the
recent National Federation of Inde-
pendent Business Small Business Opti-
mism Index,’’ with record-low unem-
ployment among Hispanics and African
Americans.
‘‘President Trump’s courage to recog-
nize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel
has changed the face of the Middle East
. . . for the better.’’
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

HONORING JILL ELLIS
(Ms. SHALALA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the brilliant coach
of the United States Women’s National
Team, Jill Ellis.
On Sunday, on a soccer pitch in
Lyon, France, our U.S. team clinched
their fourth FIFA World Cup victory,
two of which have been won under the
leadership of Coach Jill Ellis.
I know that our former colleagues
who passed title IX in 1972 are smiling.
That year, only 700 girls in the United
States played soccer at a high school
level. This year, over 400,000 played at
a high school level, a 55,000 percent in-
crease.
Coach Ellis lives in my district with
her family. She is my friend.
We join our entire country in hon-
oring her extraordinary recruiting, her
analytical skills, and the sophisticated
winning system she developed. As one
writer put it, her team ‘‘could do dif-
ferent things and win in different
ways.’’
Jill Ellis is one of the greatest coach-
es in soccer history. She is the very
definition of world class.
I am proud to join my colleagues in
honoring her and the entire United
States Women’s National Team today.

RECOGNIZING RADIO LEGEND
PAUL TINKLE
(Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Paul
Tinkle, a Tennessee radio legend.
Paul is currently the president and
general manager of Thunderbolt Radio,
a strong media presence in west Ten-
nessee. Paul has almost 50 years in
radio and is a past Distinguished Serv-
ice Award recipient, served as the Na-
tional Association of Broadcasters di-
rector representing both Tennessee and
Arkansas, and was the 1982 Tennessee
Associated Press Broadcaster of the
Year.
On August 6, Paul will be inducted
into the Tennessee Journalism Hall of
Fame, an honor that is so well-de-
served.
Keith Carver, chancellor of the Uni-
versity of Tennessee at Martin, said:
Paul Tinkle is a tremendous asset to
northwest Tennessee. In an era of large net-
works and 24-hour continuous world news
coverage, Paul’s primary focus is bringing
the world to his region. Paul is a master at
his craft and a true public servant.
Chancellor Carver summed up Paul’s
legacy perfectly.
I congratulate Paul on his induction
into the Tennessee Journalism Hall of
Fame. I know I speak for everyone
when I say west Tennessee is lucky to
have someone as dedicated and com-
mitted to good journalism as Paul.

ENACT LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR
DEFRAUDED STUDENTS
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker,
today, I am proud to introduce the Re-
lief for Defrauded Students Act. This
bill would give students the oppor-
tunity for a quick and fair process for
loan forgiveness against schools that
defrauded them.
Borrowers defense is especially im-
portant to me after the closing of Ar-
gosy University’s campus in my dis-
trict this past March. The 1,500 stu-
dents who were affected were left with
incredible debts but no degree to show
for it.
Students should focus on getting the
quality education they were promised,
not worrying about being saddled with
large debts from schools that could not
and did not deliver on their education
promise.
I am proud to lead the Relief for De-
frauded Students Act with my col-
leagues, Representatives ABBY
FINKENAUER, KATIE PORTER, CINDY
AXNE, MARY GAY SCANLON, and
SHARICE DAVIDS. Together, we will pro-
tect our students and hold these insti-
tutions accountable.
RECOGNIZING U.S. WOMEN’S NA-
TIONAL SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP
VICTORY
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ap-
plaud the incredible talent of the
United States Women’s National Soc-
cer Team, which secured their fourth
World Cup title this Sunday, July 7.
The commitment, athleticism, and
drive of these women brought our Na-
tion together to cheer them on as they
truly dominated match after match.
The team scored 26 goals in their
seven matches and allowed only three
goals during the entire tournament,
making them the highest scoring team
in tournament history.
I would like to personally recognize
the efforts of goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher
and defender Ali Krieger, both alumnae
of Pennsylvania State University.
Naeher denied England a critical pen-
alty shot in the semifinals, sending the
United States to the championship
round where the team outran, outshot,
and outplayed the Netherlands Wom-
en’s National Team to win 2–0.
Krieger said, ‘‘We were ready for the
moment.’’
She, along with their 21 other team-
mates, delivered and brought home a
hard-fought and well-deserved victory
for the United States, rightfully earn-
ing the title of champions.

MAINTAIN CRITICAL AFFORDABLE
CARE ACT PROTECTIONS
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, our
work to lower healthcare costs for
working families could not be more ur-
gent. Yesterday, we heard the first ar-
guments in the Texas v. United States
case that will determine whether we
maintain critical protections for pa-
tients with preexisting conditions.
We must work to improve the
healthcare system that has now been
in place for almost a decade, not dis-
mantle the progress that we have
achieved. If this lawsuit is successful,
an additional 35,000 folks in my district
could become uninsured.
We cannot allow this to happen. To
be sure, we need to fix and improve the
healthcare system today. What we
should be here talking about is how we
can do that together.
We should be talking about ideas,
such as the Medicare-X Choice Act of
2019, which would add competition in
the health insurance market. We
should be talking about how we reduce
the high price of prescription drugs.
Medicare-X would create an affordable
public option. The PRICED Act would
shorten market exclusivity.
It is time for solutions. Americans
don’t have time for anything less.
f
REFORM OUR ASYLUM LAWS
(Mr. GAETZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I have
been to the detention facilities in
Yuma, Arizona, where I have seen the
individuals who committed the crime
of unlawful entry into our country,
who have been detained, and who are
kept in undeniably wretched condi-
tions. The stench, the level of care, the
inadequate training and facilities pro-
vided to our Homeland Security offi-
cials create conditions that are ripe for
the vulnerable to be taken advantage
of and to truly be harmed.
The question is not whether or not
circumstances have fallen below our
standards; the question is what has led
to these circumstances.
The inability of my colleagues in the
majority to reform our asylum laws so
people aren’t incentivized to come to
our country illegally, bringing small
children with them, is a stain on this
institution.
The inability to secure our border so
we don’t have 1 percent of Guatemala,
Honduras, and El Salvador moving into
our country every few months is inde-
fensible.
And the inability to build a physical
barrier or a wall to keep people from
coming into our country illegally will
ultimately erode the fabric of our Na-
tion if we do not act quickly.
We can resolve these problems. It
wasn’t too long ago the Democrats
used to agree with us on this stuff.

HUMANITARIAN AID IS NOT A
CRIME
(Mrs. KIRKPATRICK asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend

Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speak-
er, imagine fleeing your home, jour-
neying through the desert in search of
refuge. Imagine having your child
ripped away from you. Imagine learn-
ing that your kids are hungry,
unbathed, cold, screaming from cages,
wrapped in foil blankets.
Yesterday, news broke of children
being sexually assaulted at a Yuma de-
tention facility. What I have described
is a reality here, and it is un-American.
I represent a border district in south-
ern Arizona. I have met with Border
Patrol, migrant advocacy groups,
faith-based organizations, and city
leaders. I have been proud to see our
community work together in powerful
ways. Our Tucson community has
shown more humane leadership than
Federal departments led by the Trump
administration.
We must be vigilant and protect hu-
manitarian rights, and we must remind
our neighbors that humanitarian aid is
not a crime.

IN RECOGNITION OF TRANSPOR-

Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Transportation
Security Officers at the Phoenix Sky
Harbor Airport for their bravery and
dedication to their mission to keep our
airports safe.
Last month on June 18, a man rushed
a TSA security checkpoint at the
Phoenix Airport, injuring and knock-
ing over several TSOs in the process. I
would like to thank the following TSOs
who showed courage in subduing the
attacker, even as he attempted to hurt
and push past the officers:
Donna Potts O’Brien, Cynthia Baker,
Christopher Cotton, Sandra Thompson,
Patricia Miller-Davis, Gladys Recinos,
Michael Malloy, Melvin Gorham, Adam
Ervin, Kenneth Fetter, Robert Morelos,
Michael Wilmoth, and Roberto Lopez.
I am grateful to these heroic officers

f
HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF THE
UNINSURED
(Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker,
last week, I had the opportunity to
visit the Community Volunteers in
Medicine center in West Chester, Penn-
sylvania, which works to meet the
healthcare needs of the working poor
and uninsured in my community.
Giuseppe is a member of my Pennsyl-
vania community and owns a pizza
shop with his wife. He has diabetes, hy-
pertension, and major cardiac issues.
Combined, they bring in $2,200 a
month, and their prescription drug
prices are $1,790. Without CVIM, the
family would be paying 81 percent of
their monthly income just for prescrip-
tion drugs.
The astronomical costs of prescrip-
tion drugs affect everyone. Neither
being a Democrat nor a Republican will
get you a discount. We are failing the
people of this country by not working
together as a Congress to relieve these
burdens. For too long, Congress has
used people’s access to healthcare as a
political pawn.
As my mother would say: ‘‘We need
to knock it off.’’ Please join us in
working together and side by side to
help people across our country with
these issues.
I applaud CVIM for their efforts, and
I want Giuseppe and my fellow Penn-
sylvanians to know: I see you, and I
will keep fighting for you.
Please join me.
f
GUN VIOLENCE IS A PUBLIC
HEALTH EMERGENCY
(Mr. CLAY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to urge my colleagues to support
H.R. 3435, the Local Public Health and
Safety Protection Act.
Across this Nation, we are faced with
an ugly, obscene, inescapable truth:
gun violence is a public health emer-
gency.
My bill would, for the first time via
Federal legislation, prohibit any State
that wants to compete for grant fund-
ing from the Department of Justice
from restricting the ability of a local
government to enact tougher gun laws.
My hope is that we can finally give
local governments the freedom to pro-
tect innocent citizens and first re-
sponders while making our neighbor-
hoods safer, regardless of what their
State legislature thinks.
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor
and support this vital public safety leg-
islation.

MILLIONS STAND TO LOSE
HEALTHCARE
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, on behalf of the people of Nevada’s
Third District, I rise today for the
288,000 Nevadans with Medicaid, thanks
to the Affordable Care Act;
For the thousands of young Nevadans
under the age of 26 who can stay on
their parent’s health plan, thanks to
the Affordable Care Act;
For the nearly 350,000 Nevada seniors
on Medicare part D who are now paying
less for their prescription drugs,
thanks to the Affordable Care Act;
For the 20 million Americans who are
scared right now of losing the
healthcare they have finally received,
thanks to the Affordable Care Act; and
For the 1.2 million Nevadans and 130
million Americans with asthma, high
blood pressure, ALS, cancer, cystic fi-
brosis, depression, HIV, and other dis-
eases, for their preexisting conditions
that will not be protected if the Afford-
able Care Act is dismantled.
Look, it is pretty simple. If the lower
court decision in Texas v. United
States lawsuit stands, millions could
lose their health insurance. I stand for
every one of those Americans, and we
should all stand for them.

HEALTHCARE FOR AMERICANS
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker,
yesterday the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals heard oral arguments in the
lawsuit where Republicans sued to not
only strike down protections for people
with preexisting conditions, but elimi-
nate every last protection and benefit
provided by the Affordable Care Act.
House Democrats have used our vote
to send a strong message against this
lawsuit, and yesterday, the House gen-
eral counsel argued in support of peo-
ple with preexisting conditions and the
healthcare of all Americans.
While our Republican colleagues at-
tempt to undermine people with pre-
existing conditions, House Democrats
will do everything in our power to pro-
tect the healthcare of the American
people.
If the administration’s position is
supported by the Fifth Circuit, it will
destroy the protection for more than
130 million people with preexisting con-
ditions, Medicaid expansion coverage
for 15 million Americans, significant
savings that our elders receive and sen-
iors receive due to ACA’s closing of the
doughnut hole in Medicare drug cov-
erage, bans on discriminatory insur-
ance practices that force women to pay
more for coverage, and young adults’
ability to remain on their parents’ in-
surance until age 26.
Madam Speaker, Democrats will con-
tinue to deliver on our For the People
agenda and American healthcare.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for

pending which I yield myself such time

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, on
Tuesday, last night, the Rules Com-
mittee met and reported a rule, House
Resolution 476, providing for consider-
ation of H.R. 2500 under a structured
rule. One hour of general debate has
been provided, controlled by the chair
and ranking minority member of the
Committee on Armed Services.
Madam Speaker, this rule makes
more than 430 amendments in order. I
think we broke a record. This bill has
the most amendments, I think, ever
made in order, and I think it is some-
thing that we should be proud of.
These amendments include ideas
from both sides. I think that is impor-
tant. But I have got to tell you that I
am especially proud that this rule al-
lows a debate on many truly progres-
sive ideas.
One of these amendments would
allow transgender troops their rightful
chance to serve in our military without
roadblocks from this administration.
That shouldn’t be a radical idea. Gen-
der shouldn’t matter on the battlefield.
Transgender troops have been serving
in our military for a very long time.
They have willingly put their lives on
the line to deploy in combat zones just
like all other troops. They have worn
the same uniform and have been held
to the same standard as everybody
else.
But, instead of thanking them, in-
stead of thanking them for their serv-
ice to our country, this administration
wants to prevent them from serving at
all.
Out of nowhere, President Trump
logged onto Twitter one day and de-
cided to ban transgender people from
military service.
This rule will give us a chance to de-
bate an amendment to change that, to
reject the President’s bigotry.
There is another amendment here
that would prevent the President from
using the 2001 AUMF to launch an at-
tack on Iran or engage in military hos-
tilities without explicit congressional
authorization.
Now, think about this. We were, ap-
parently, moments away from the
President launching an attack against
Iran—no consultation with Congress at
all, no debate on this floor, no thought-
ful discussion, not even a vote.
Democrats don’t want war with Iran.
Most Republicans don’t want war with
Iran. The American people certainly
don’t want a war with Iran.
But this President was, apparently,
about to use an AUMF passed more
than a decade ago to fumble us into an-
other conflict in the Middle East. I am
glad the President backed off from
bombing Iran, but I am terrified about
the lack of thoughtful leadership com-
ing from this Oval Office.
I don’t know what kind of mood he
will be in when he wakes up tomorrow,
whether he will want to go to war with
a country or not, but I think we have
a constitutional obligation here in
Congress to make sure that we play a
role as to whether or not we enter into
another war as well as preventing an-
other war.
We need to make it clear to this ad-
ministration that the President cannot
use an old AUMF to initiate hostilities
against Iran, period. This rule is our
chance. There are dozens and dozens of
ideas here that many of my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle have tried
to get debated for a long time and
many on our side of the aisle have tried
to get debated for a long time. This
rule will finally allow us to do that.
As important as they are, the impor-
tance of this rule goes beyond just the
amendments. There is suspension au-
thority included in here that would
allow us to move quickly this week and
pass the reauthorization of the 9/11
Health and Compensation Act.
How could anybody oppose that,
Madam Speaker? Recently, we saw 9/11
first responders coming to the Senate
and literally begging for Majority
Leader MCCONNELL to move the bill.
These people are heroes. They should
never have to plead with hat in hand
for the resources to help them survive.
The Senate is finally showing a will-
ingness to move on this. So, if we pass
this rule, this program could be reau-
thorized within a matter of days.
Passing this rule would also allow us
to quickly take action on the first
measure placed on the Consensus Cal-
endar, H.R. 553, as part of the under-
lying bill.
This calendar was created as part of
our bipartisan rules package, passed at
the start of the Congress. It is a new
procedure designed to expedite consid-
eration of measures with broad bipar-
tisan support.
Congressman JOE WILSON and Con-
gressman JOHN YARMUTH’s bill to up-
date the Department of Defense’s Sur-
vivor Benefit Plan has well over 350 co-
sponsors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5316 July 10, 2019
Clearly, there is a lot of bipartisan
support here for this legislation. Let’s
pass this rule and make sure it gets
taken up as quickly as possible this
week as part of a must-pass vehicle.
That is what this rule is all about,
Madam Speaker: debating ideas and
countless progressive amendments—
and some amendments, quite frankly,
that are very conservative that I am
going to fight as hard as I can to de-
feat.
Moving quickly to reauthorize a pro-
gram that our 9/11 first responders de-
pend on, I think, is an absolute priority
of this majority, and I hope my Repub-
lican friends will join with us in sup-
porting this effort.
Allowing an overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan bill to be considered on the floor
without delay that benefits widows, I
think, is something that hopefully will
get broad bipartisan support.
So, if we pass this, we can make sure
all of this happens this week.
Madam Speaker, I also want to take
a moment and recognize that this un-
derlying NDAA bill would finally con-
fer a service medal honoring the sac-
rifice of atomic veterans.
It has been a long road getting to
this point. The prior three House
NDAA bills included similar amend-
ment language, sometimes by near
unanimous votes, but it was stripped
out of conference every single time.
For the life of me, I cannot figure out
why.
Radiation-exposed servicemembers
risked their lives for our Nation, in se-
cret and at great personal cost. More
than three-quarters of atomic veterans
have already passed away, many pre-
maturely from health problems di-
rectly related to their service.
It is past time to finally recognize
their courage and sacrifice, not just
with a certificate of recognition but
with what they truly deserve: a service
medal.
So I hope, by including this language
in the base bill, it won’t be stripped out
as the process continues, and let’s give
these veterans the recognition that
they have earned.
Finally, Madam Speaker, let me just
say this: The underlying bill is a good
bill, and Chairman SMITH, Ranking
Member THORNBERRY, and their staff
deserve a lot of credit for this product.
It was a bipartisan process in com-
mittee, as we heard last night in the
Rules Committee. Many Republican
amendments were adopted in the com-
mittee process, and I think Chairman
SMITH, again, and his staff deserve
enormous credit for getting us to the
point we are at here today.
I will say that I regret very much
that the marching orders coming from
the leaders of the Republican Con-
ference are that all Republicans should
vote against the NDAA bill, a bill that
contains a pay increase for our troops,
a bill that includes items that will pro-
tect and enhance our national security,
a bill that will provide all the other
things I have just mentioned.
I am sorry that the Republican lead-
ers have decided to turn this into a
partisan exercise, but they can do
whatever they want.
Our job is to make sure this gets
done and it gets moved forward in a
timely fashion, and that is what we in-
tend to do.
Madam Speaker, with that, I reserve
the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I appreciate that
admonition. I promise you, you won’t
have to repeat that again on my time.
I appreciate my friend from Massa-
chusetts yielding the time.
I had a whole wonderful opening
statement planned, Madam Speaker. It
was going to be our first time down
here on the floor together during a
rule.
Janet Rossi, on my team, put to-
gether all the great stats and statis-
tics, many of which you heard my
friend from Massachusetts reference.
And then, as happens to me so often
on the Rules Committee, I show up in
a good mood, I show up in a great
place, and then folks just poke me in
that way that gets me going.
For my friend from Massachusetts to
close with the Republicans have turned
this into a partisan exercise frustrates
me to no end.
If there is one thing I have learned in
my 9 years in Congress, Madam Speak-
er, it is that when it comes to Amer-
ican national security, it never gets
turned into a partisan exercise.
I don’t know how your election went,
Madam Speaker, or what it was that
your constituents said to you. Mine
talked to me a lot about congressional
dysfunction.
‘‘Why can’t they get anything done,
Rob?’’
‘‘Why in the world can’t you all get
together and cooperate?’’
And I always respond with the bill
that we are looking at today, the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. I
say: In six decades of working, depend-
ing on who was in the White House,
who was leading the House, who was
leading the Senate, six decades of
working on National Defense Author-
ization Acts that need to be passed
every single year, how many times do
you think we have actually success-
fully gotten that done together?
You know how that conversation
goes, Madam Speaker.
‘‘Rob, I think you guys have gotten it
done once in 60 years.’’
‘‘Rob, I think it has happened 4
times, maybe 12 times.’’
Madam Speaker, you know what I
know, which is that, over these dec-
ades, every single year, without fail—it
does not matter who is in the White
House; it does not matter who leads
the U.S. House; it does not matter who
leads the United States Senate—we
come together as a Nation to support
our men and women who are standing
on the frontlines for us.
So, no, this is not a partisan exercise
today, nor should it be from the Repub-
lican side of the aisle.
But I am mystified, Madam Speaker,
as to why we have taken what should
have been this continuation of decade
upon decade upon decade of bipartisan-
ship and seemingly gone out of our
way, as a new Democratic majority, to
make it partisan.
I know the policy isn’t. I know the
policy isn’t. I can go right down the
line, man after woman, woman after
man, on the Democratic side of the
aisle and find patriots who love this
country and who will do whatever it
takes to defend it. That is the con-
versation we had in the Rules Com-
mittee last night.
But I will take you back to my fresh-
man year in Congress, Madam Speaker.
I came in with that rabid class of fresh-
man Republicans, that largest fresh-
man class in American history. You
would think, if we were going to find
partisanship, we would find it in that
class.
We all came in on that big Tea Party
wave, folks wanting to shake things
up, change things. Do you know what
the National Defense Authorization
Act looked like coming out of com-
mittee that year?
It passed 60–1, Republicans and
Democrats standing together. The year
after that, 56–5. That is what my fresh-
man year looked like: 60–1, 56–5, Repub-
licans and Democrats standing to-
gether on behalf of national security.
I don’t know if you have looked at
the vote from the Armed Services Com-
mittee, Madam Speaker. I know you
are familiar. It was 33–24, straight
party-line vote, coming out of com-
mittee this year.
In the Rules Committee last night up
on the third floor, Madam Speaker, we
finished up about midnight. I had the
chairman and the ranking member of
the Armed Services Committee there
talking about all the things that they
agree on as it comes to national secu-
rity, yet, to my friend from Massachu-
setts’ point, the marching orders came
down from somewhere that prevented
them from doing what we have always
done, and that is report a bill in a bi-
partisan fashion.
It has nothing to do with who leads
this Congress, Madam Speaker.
About 12 years ago now, when the
very first woman to ever hold the
Speaker’s chair took over—that would
be 2007, Madam Speaker—we didn’t
bring the bill to the floor under a rule
in a partisan fashion. We brought the
bill to the floor under suspension.
b 1245
Madam Speaker, that very first bill
that was passed in the Pelosi Speaker-
ship passed 369–46 on the floor of the
House; 369–46. Most of the no votes
were Democrats voting against the new

Democratic Speaker of the House and
the national security bill; 369–46.
The year after that, the last year of
the new Speakership, the year right be-
fore I came, it passed 341–48.
Madam Speaker, I go through these
big numbers to make the point that it
didn’t have to be this way. We went out
of our way, it seems, as an institution,
to divide on national security. I will
just give you a few of those examples.
There are 439 amendments made in
order, as my friend from Massachusetts
pointed out, and I think we should cel-
ebrate that. But again, there were 683
amendments offered, so 250 Members
were shut out.
Madam Speaker, we had an oppor-
tunity, under the new Consensus Cal-
endar that my friend from Massachu-
setts referenced, to bring bipartisan
legislation to the floor.
For folks who haven’t been following
that, the only way to get to the House
floor is to have a committee report
your bill. If committees don’t report
your bill, you can’t get to the House
floor unless you end up on the suspen-
sion calendar.
This new majority, this new Demo-
cratic majority, changed the rules in
what I think is an amazingly positive
and productive way. What they said is,
if you bring together enough Demo-
crats and Republicans to support your
bill, we are going to have to give you a
special pathway to the House floor for
those consensus ideas that we want to
celebrate together as an institution.
Madam Speaker, my friend, JOE WIL-
SON from South Carolina has such a
bill. It is a bill to support the widows
and widowers of our fallen servicemen
and women. He has worked this bill
with my friend from Kentucky, Mr.
YARMUTH, and this is the very first bill
to have achieved, again, this new level
of excellence that the new majority
laid out. If you can bring people to-
gether we will give you a special path-
way to the House floor. You get a vote
on your bill.
I might point out that my friend
from California, Ms. LOFGREN, did this
very same thing. She did it on a piece
of immigration legislation that I am a
cosponsor of. She put together the req-
uisite number of Republicans and
Democrats, and her bill is coming to
the floor, too.
Now, her bill is coming to the floor
today on suspension, stand-alone, up-
or-down vote to allow Republicans and
Democrats to come together and sup-
port that idea.
My friend, Mr. WILSON’s bill, without
his knowledge, without his consulta-
tion, without his input, has been
tucked into this rule, this partisan
rule, this passed-by-party-line-vote
rule, to be self-enacted into the under-
lying legislation.
I expressed my frustration to the
chairman last night; that so often we
fail in ways that meet the very low ex-
pectations of our constituents. This
was a wonderful, positive change that
Speaker PELOSI and the new Demo-
cratic majority brought to this institu-
tion. Madam Speaker, it is a change
that I hope will be a lasting change. It
is a change that I hope will persist no
matter who sits in the Speaker’s chair
over the next decade upon decade.
But our very first opportunity to use
it, we moved it from its design, which
was to be an opportunity to celebrate
those things that bring us together,
those hard nuts that we figured out a
way to crack together, and we have
turned it into yet another exercise in
‘‘gotcha’’ partisan politics.
The men and women who will be
served by this legislation deserve bet-
ter than that. The men and women who
serve in this institution deserve better
than that. And when the new Demo-
cratic majority was sworn in on the
first day of this Congress, they prom-
ised the American people better than
that.
Madam Speaker, today won’t be the
last word on this issue; but it is the
first word, and it is an unfortunate one.
I hope that my colleagues will be
cognizant of this mistake that they
have made, and I hope that they will
correct it before it is too late.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Let me just take issue with the gen-
tleman from Georgia when he talks
about this as being a partisan process.
From what I understand, in the Armed
Services Committee, 142 Republican
amendments were accepted, 142.
And the gentleman’s facts are a little
bit wrong when he says it was a
straight party-line vote reporting the
bill to the floor, unless Ms. STEFANIK
and Mr. BACON have changed parties—I
hope they did—because they voted to
advance it. Everybody in that com-
mittee should have voted to advance it,
but they did, and they deserve credit
for that.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
Republican leadership is telling all
their Members, vote ‘‘no’’ on the final
passage of the bill, and vote ‘‘no’’ on
the rule, unlike my colleagues on the
Republican side when they were in
charge, who would routinely ask Demo-
crats who came before the Rules Com-
mittee and offered amendments and
they would say, if we make your
amendment in order, will you vote for
the bill?
Well, we didn’t ask a single Repub-
lican that question last night. And we
made 62 Republican amendments in
order. There are 94 bipartisan amend-
ments in order, and so we didn’t do
that.
If this ends up being a partisan vote
on the rule, that is the choice of my
colleagues on the Republican side. I
think there is lots and lots of stuff in
here that everybody should support.
Let me just say one other thing
about the Consensus Calendar. My
friend from Georgia is just beside him-
self that we are moving forward a bi-
partisan idea that has over 300 cospon-
sors, overwhelmingly bipartisan. Oh, it
is terrible that you are putting it in
the rule. It is terrible, terrible, ter-
rible.
Well, let me say, what happened
when they were in charge in the last
Congress. Mr. WILSON and Mr. YAR-
MUTH introduced a bill. I think there
were 290-plus cosponsors on the bill.
My Republican friends couldn’t even be
bothered last session with giving the
bill a hearing. They didn’t bring it to
the floor for a vote. They could have
brought it under suspension. They
could have had it as an amendment to
something. They could have put it in a
rule if they wanted to. They didn’t do
anything.
And now that we are moving forward
an idea that has broad bipartisan sup-
port, they can’t handle it. They are
having a meltdown on the other side of
the aisle.
Well, you are obsessed with the proc-
ess when you should be obsessed with
the widows who would benefit from the
enactment of this bill. But that is fine.
That is fine.
The whole point of the Consensus
Calendar was to be able to bring bipar-
tisan ideas that had overwhelming sup-
port to move those ideas forward, and
we praise Mr. WILSON and praise Mr.
YARMUTH for their leadership on this.
But to carry on about that it is on a
rule, and not at all be concerned about
it becoming law really kind of shows
the difference in our priorities.
Let me tell you that one of the rea-
sons why we think it is important to
put it on the NDAA bill is because we
think is a must-pass piece of legisla-
tion. This will go to the Senate. I
mean, obviously, there will be a con-
ference report, and there will be back
and forth and there will be changes and
additions and it will come back. But we
know that this bill, if it passes the
House is going over to the Senate,
whether you like it or not. It is going
to the Senate.
If we brought it up here under a sus-
pension, it would die in MITCH MCCON-
NELL’s graveyard, like everything else
dies over in the Senate. He doesn’t give
a damn about this; if he did, he would
have done something about it.
So I appreciate the gentleman’s con-
cerns, but, quite frankly, I think that
they are unfounded; and I think that,
quite frankly, this is a rule that de-
serves the support of not just Demo-
crats but Republicans as well.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs.
TRAHAN). Members are reminded to re-

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I

Kentucky (Mr. YARMUTH), the distin-

for all, repeal the SBP-DIC offset, com-
monly known as the widow’s tax.
I would like to thank Chairman
SMITH and Chairman MCGOVERN for
their work to include my amendment
in this bill. I also want to thank the
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.
WILSON) for his continued stalwart
leadership on the issue.
I got involved in this issue several
years ago when I was contacted by a
constituent of mine named Ellen. She
emailed me to tell me about the unfair
burden being placed on an estimated
64,000 surviving spouses and families of
the men and women of our military,
forcing them to forfeit all or part of an
annuity purchased by their beloved
fallen heroes.
In the final paragraph of Ellen’s
email, she mentioned a First Sergeant
in the U.S. Army who suffered a heart
attack during his required physical
training in 2002. That First Sergeant
was her husband.
It became clear to me that Congress’
mistake more than 4 decades ago was
now negatively impacting one of my
constituents, a constituent who was al-
ready grieving the loss of her husband.
And while I am heartbroken by the rea-
son Ellen was forced to become an ad-
vocate on this issue, to this day I am
very thankful she contacted me.
Including this provision to ax the
widow’s tax in must-pass NDAA legis-
lation is likely our only shot in this
Congress to end the unfair offset once
and for all. I want to urge my col-
leagues to support this rule and final
passage of this bill. We have tried for
years to get this right and now we fi-
nally can.
Stand up for Gold Star families and
support this rule and the underlying
legislation. The spouses and children of
our fallen heroes have sacrificed
enough.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
thank you for that second admonition.
I did say you wouldn’t have to use it
again on my side of the aisle. I can
commit to you that you still will not
have to issue one on our side of the
aisle.
I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman
from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the rank-
ing member of the Rules Committee.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to op-
pose the rule and the underlying legis-
lation. This is actually a very sad occa-
sion, I think, for the House; it cer-
tainly is for me personally. I have
never voted against a national defense
authorization in my 17 years in Con-
gress. As a matter of fact, most of our
Members have never done that for the
last 58 years, so it is pretty unusual for
us to be here and we, personally, regret
that a great deal.
My concerns with the substance of
the bill are many, although there are,
as my good friend from Massachusetts
said, lots of good things in there, and
there was lots of bipartisanship in
writing it.
But the top line number is $15 billion
less than the President requests and
the Senate has already enacted in their
NDAA bill. We think that hurts readi-
ness. We have concerns with the rever-
sal of some decisions, both slowing
down the modernization of our nuclear
forces, and moving us away from low-
yield nuclear weapons, which we think
we need to counter Russia and its cur-
rent aggressive posture.
We are disappointed the bill doesn’t
include longstanding prohibition
against transferring detainees from
Guantanamo Bay to the United States.
Those provisions were put in by a
Democratic Congress in 2010. We are
sorry our friends seem to reverse a de-
cision that they believed in a decade
ago.
And it includes a lot of restrictive
policies and prohibitions on securing
the southern border, including prohibi-
tions on funding a border wall, fence,
physical barriers. I understand there
are differences there, but I would hope
we could give the executive flexibility
in that area.
Mr. Speaker, as concerned as I am
about the substance of the bill, I am
very concerned about the process. I
grant my friend’s point that a lot of
amendments have been made in order.
We could have made more. We actually
offered an open rule last night that
would have made everybody’s amend-
ments in order. It wouldn’t have taken
away any of the amendments my
friends wanted to put out there, but it
would have allowed everybody’s
amendments to come to the floor for
full and robust debate.
Now, the amendments that were
made in order, 67 percent of them, are
Democratic amendments; 14 percent
are Republican. We don’t think that is
a fair, remotely fair ratio.
And frankly, the en bloc arrange-
ments in which we are going to bring
many of these to the floor are even
more imbalanced; basically 63 percent
of those will be on Democratic initia-
tives; I think two are on Republican
initiatives. So we are very concerned
about that. I think if we don’t stop this
process, we are about to make the mis-
take that we made 2 weeks ago.
Now, the Senate has given us, as it
did 2 weeks ago, a different example.
They have passed a national defense
authorization by a vote of 86–8, so over-
whelmingly bipartisan. The President
has said he would sign their bill. The
President sent us a message that the
partisan bill that we are embarking on
and about to pass he will not sign; so
we are headed for a confrontation. It is
a confrontation where we will produce
a partisan bill that the President won’t
sign. The Senate will produce a bipar-
tisan bill that the President will sign,
and I think we know how that story
ends.
b 1300
So we are dangerously close to re-
peating the mistake we made only 2
weeks ago, and I would hope that we
stop, because if we proceed down this
path, we will find ourselves in precisely
the same situation we found ourselves
in with the border wall.
Now, I also want to take issue with
my friend a little bit about the 9/11
issue and our friend Mr. WILSON’s bill
and my good friend in the chair’s bill,
as well. I just want to say, putting a
bill, those things that are bipartisan,
in a rule, it just literally means that
our side is not going to vote for it. It
would be the same if it were your side.
You can say all you want. It was going
to pass no matter what. So we don’t
think this was necessary.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
YARMUTH). The time of the gentleman
has expired.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE).
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my
friend for the additional time, and I
will be brief.
So it is with a great deal of sorrow—
not sorrow that I oppose the rule, be-
cause I think the rule needs to be much
more open, much more inclusive, but I
hope that we can get back, Mr. Speak-
er—and by rejecting this rule and re-
jecting the underlying legislation, we
can—to a bipartisan process where we
produce a bipartisan National Defense
Authorization Act.
Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of the
rule and rejection of the underlying
legislation.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I understand the frustration on the
Republican side. They lost an election,
and so they are not getting everything
they want in terms of policy. Well,
elections have consequences, and I will
give you an example.
I oppose low-yield nuclear weapons,
and I hope that that remains the pol-
icy, but we made an amendment in
order that would allow them to reverse
what was in the bill. I am going to
fight to defeat it, but there will be a
vote on that, and we will have to live
with whatever the outcome is.
The bottom line is that, if it doesn’t
turn out your way, it doesn’t mean the
process is somehow partisan. That is
what happens when you win elections.
You don’t win on every policy debate
that you decide to engage in.
And let me just say one thing about
the process and the procedure, because
I think it is important for my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
have a little bit of a fact check here.
Our friends like to point out the
ratio of amendments, but that is a
cherry-picked statistic that doesn’t
tell the whole story. To date, we have
made in order more amendments, over-
all, than my Republican friends did
when they were in charge. We have
even made in order more minority
amendments, to date, than the Repub-
licans did last Congress.
By this time in the 115th Congress, a
total of only 140 amendments were
made in order. Of those, 89 were minor-
ity amendments. This year, we have
made a total of 1,280 amendments in

order. That is nine times as many
amendments as my Republican friends
made in order at the same point in the
last Congress. And we have made in
order 256 minority amendments this
year, which is more than double the
number of minority amendments the
Republicans made in order at this
point in the 115th Congress.
You want to look at the statistics,
there they are. And the bill that we are
about to debate, we are making in
order the most amendments, ever, of
any bill brought to the floor.
Now, I guess we could do better than
that, but the bottom line is the most
amendments, ever, are being made in
order on this NDAA bill—and, by the
way, on any bill; not just NDAA, on
any bill.
So I know it is frustrating to be in
the minority. I was there not too long
ago. I know it is frustrating not to win
on every vote and to be able to rig
every vote as my friends did when they
were in charge, but the bottom line is,
in this place, the majority, whoever
has the most votes, wins. So in terms
of the process, I think my friends pro-
test too much.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs.
TRAHAN), a member of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee.
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of this year’s National
Defense Authorization Act. This bill
addresses many critical components of
our national defense, including the ur-
gent need to tackle sexual assault
across the United States military.
Recent years have seen significant
progress towards reforming how sexual
assault claims are handled. Now it is
time for Congress to confront the con-
ditions that allow sexual assault to
happen in the first place.
We have an obligation to protect and
safeguard those who answer the call to
service and wear the uniform of the
United States. It is not good enough
merely to have the best training and
equipment on the battlefield; we must
also protect our soldiers on base or
wherever they are.
This NDAA includes an amendment I
coauthored that does just that by di-
recting the Secretary of Defense to cre-
ate a civilian advisory committee on
sexual assault prevention in the mili-
tary. This committee would be com-
prised of civilians with expertise in
campus sexual assault prevention, sui-
cide prevention, public health, and per-
haps, most importantly, culture
change of large organizations.
We absolutely can make more mean-
ingful progress to make military sex-
ual assault a thing of the past. I am
glad that opportunity is reflected in
the NDAA before us now. I urge sup-
port of this bill.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I have
become accustomed to your gentle
gavel in the Budget Committee, and I
appreciate its gentleness here on the
floor, as well.
I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON),
whose bill you have been so instru-
mental in, as well.
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
Georgia for yielding this time. I appre-
ciate his leadership.
H.R. 553, the Military Surviving
Spouses Equity Act, is a bipartisan bill
with over 365 cosponsors. In fact, it is
rare that a bill garners this many co-
sponsors and was amongst the first to
reach the new threshold for mandatory
consideration under the Consensus Cal-
endar. I am grateful that colleagues on
both sides of the aisle support this leg-
islation to repeal the ‘‘widow’s tax.’’
Thank you to all of the surviving
spouses and advocates who have
worked diligently and tirelessly on this
legislation. The bill would have been
eligible for a vote this Friday.
Instead, Democratic leadership has
decided to specifically bar this bill
from independent consideration and in-
clude it in the flawed, partisan NDAA.
In fact, the rule for the NDAA specifi-
cally states:
Rule XV of the Consensus Calendar shall
not apply with respect to H.R. 553.
Democratic leadership has essen-
tially said, if the NDAA does not pass,
the widow’s tax doesn’t pass.
Further, leadership has put this bill
at risk of the conference with the Sen-
ate. Democratic leadership knows that
it is not included in the Senate’s
version of the NDAA, and I am dis-
appointed with the other side.
I even offered a bipartisan amend-
ment with Chairman JOHN YARMUTH to
have this legislation be included in the
NDAA, but they did not make that
amendment in order. Instead, Demo-
crats placed their own amendment in a
partisan rule and are forcing the stand-
alone bill to be barred from the Con-
sensus Calendar.
This is partisan politics at its worst.
This is heartbreaking for the 65,000
military widows who have worked tire-
lessly and very effectively to mobilize
support behind the bill.
At the peak of their hopes that this
bill would pass the United States
House of Representatives this week,
leadership now has put the bill in jeop-
ardy. Instead of supporting our mili-
tary and the military families, includ-
ing those who have died and sacrificed
for this country, the majority has cho-
sen to violate their own rules and put
the bill in jeopardy. This tactic cheap-
ens the efforts of these military widows
by turning their real-world plight into
a partisan tactic.
A stand-alone bill in the Senate with
over 365 House cosponsors would have
had a better chance of passing and sent
a clear and overwhelming message of
support to these widows. Instead, we
will be sending this over in a partisan
bill, almost ensuring its demise in the
Senate. This is a disservice to the wid-
ows who deserve better.
I am grateful for Ranking Member
TOM COLE, who argued against making
H.R. 553 as part of this self-executing
rule. He is right that this shortcuts the
process and is politics at its worse.
Our team followed the rules the
Democrats set forth to have this over-
whelmingly bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion set for a vote, and they decided to
play partisan politics and remove it.
Further, the Rules Committee failed to
notify my staff and even failed to no-
tify the community that would be most
directly impacted by their actions: the
widows who have worked tirelessly to
generate support for H.R. 553.
The community, inspired by veterans
service organizations, gave all, and this
Congress can’t even follow its own
rules. It is sad how the majority has
undermined this important bill in the
manner they have done.
Barring this bill from independent
consideration is outright wrong, and I
ask that each of my Democratic and
Republican colleagues think long and
hard about the implications of this par-
liamentary gimmick.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I regret very much that the gen-
tleman is going to vote against a meas-
ure to repeal the widow’s tax, and I
will just remind him again that, when
his party was in control of the Con-
gress, they did nothing on this—noth-
ing—no hearing last session, not a
thing.
We had, in our rules package, this
item called the Consensus Calendar
that said that, when there are meas-
ures that have 290 cosponsors or more,
where there is broad bipartisan sup-
port, that the Speaker will move the
bill forward, and in this case, any way
she wants to with moving it forward.
The gentleman should be really
happy, quite frankly, that it is at-
tached to the NDAA bill because this is
a must-pass piece of legislation. It will
go to the Senate, and there will be a
conference.
I hope my Republican friends have
some sway with the Republican leader
over there, MITCH MCCONNELL, and
would urge him not to try to gut this
provision from the final version of the
bill. But it will go to conference, and
the Senate will have to deal with it.
The reason why I know this is a
must-pass bill is because one of the
amendments that is in order here is an
amendment that was a request to the
Rules Committee from Minority Lead-
er MCCARTHY, an amendment to au-
thorize funding to assist military in-
stallations recovering from earth-
quakes and other natural disasters. I
don’t think he would be wasting his
time trying to put that in a bill that he
thinks is going nowhere.
This bill is going to the Senate, and
then it is going to be up to my friends
on the other side of the aisle to try to
help join with us in convincing the Re-
publican leadership in the Senate to
stand with the House position on this.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to

strong support of the rule and under-
lying bill. I also want to thank Chair-
man SMITH for his leadership on the
bill and all the members of the Armed
Services Committee for the work they
put in to ensure that we have an NDAA
that fully addresses the modern chal-
lenges facing our country.
This bill takes steps to address the
threat of climate change, long identi-
fied by the DOD as a threat to national
security, by requiring the Department
to plan around climate vulnerabilities
in future projects.
This bill also protects military fami-
lies. In addition to the widow’s tax
issue, it protects low-income service-
members by bridging the gap for those
who need SNAP assistance. It upgrades
military housing and provides support
for childcare and education for mili-
tary families.
It also promotes diversity in our
Armed Forces by requiring DOD to
issue a new diversity and inclusion
strategy and address existing inequi-
ties.
This NDAA goes further to ensure
that our Armed Forces are fully ready
for the threats we face today and pre-
pared for the threats we will face in the
future.
Of particular concern to my district
is the CH–47 aircraft, better known as
the Chinook. Like the residents of my
district who proudly build these ma-
chines, the Chinook is a workhorse
that can always be relied upon to get
the job done, even in the toughest and
most unforgiving of conditions. This
bill makes it clear that Congress has
no intention of abandoning this vital
program.
On top of being one of the most
versatile and crucial aircraft in our
Armed Forces, the Chinook program
supports more than 20,000 jobs and 200
suppliers in 38 States. I am pleased
that this program is in the bill, and I
look forward to supporting its passage.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
You see the challenges that we are
confronted with here. My friend from
Massachusetts is telling my friend
from South Carolina how my friend
from South Carolina should get his bill
to the United States Senate. There is
no one who has worked harder on this
issue than Mr. WILSON has. There is no
one whose heart is in this issue more
than Mr. WILSON’s is.
b 1315
I hope you listened carefully to his
heartfelt words, because the key point
that he made is that this really won-
derful, bipartisan creation of the new
Democratic majority, this Consensus
Calendar, if we pass the rule today will
be specifically turned off specifically
for Mr. WILSON’s bill.
The new majority can play whatever
partisan games they want to, I wish
they wouldn’t, but they can, with the
underlying bill by stuffing in self-en-
acting amendments, by adding amend-
ments after the fact, all the games that
majorities sometimes play, but the new
rules that you voted for, Madam
Speaker, that my friend from Massa-
chusetts brags about on his website,
rightfully so, because there were im-
portant changes in those rules, the
very first time we have an opportunity
to utilize those rules, Mr. WILSON’s bill
was ripened for consideration before
the House this week, it is not simply
that folks have stolen his language and
tucked it into this partisan underlying
piece of legislation, they have specifi-
cally in the rule today prohibited him
from availing himself, and by himself,
I mean hundreds of our colleagues and
thousands of widows that they rep-
resent, from availing themselves of the
new tool created by the new House ma-
jority this year.
I do not value the new majority’s use
of partisan tools in the NDAA, but I
understand that is the right of a new
majority.
My friend from Massachusetts is ex-
actly right. When you lose elections,
losing elections has consequences, but
when you pass rules, passing rules has
consequences, too.
I am going to be fascinated by what
happens here in about an hour and a
half when the members of the new ma-
jority are confronted with an oppor-
tunity to turn off the new bipartisan
reforms they just codified in the House
rules 6 months ago.
This should have been a day of cele-
brating a positive new change from a
new administration, and instead, it is a
day of playing politics with families
that have already given much too
much to the United States of America.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let
me say for the RECORD, the widows
were deprived in the last Congress
when my Republican friends were in
control. They did nothing.
Madam Speaker, I commend Mr. WIL-
SON and Mr. YARMUTH for their efforts
on this and getting broad bipartisan
support, but quite frankly, the Repub-
lican leadership failed in the last Con-
gress. They didn’t do anything, period.
We are going to do something, and we
are going to make the widows proud
and we are going to move this legisla-
tion forward. I hope when we do, that
we can all come together and join in a
bipartisan moment where we can actu-
ally point to something concrete that
will help these widows.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.
WELCH).
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, this rule makes in
order an amendment that is of great
consequence and urgency, and that
amendment would require that before
the President initiated any military
action against Iran, he has to come to
Congress and get approval through an
Authorization for Use of Military
Force.
And make no mistake about it. That
amendment is essential for our secu-
rity.
What the President did on May 8 was
that he tore up the Iran nuclear agree-
ment, with no alternative in place. He
says now his objective is a nonnuclear
Iran.
That is what we had. Our intelligence
agencies confirmed that Iran was in
compliance with that agreement.
Instead, he has embarked on a policy
that is bellicose in rhetoric and ineffec-
tive in outcome.
He has torn up the agreement that
was supported, not just by this Con-
gress, but it was supported by our al-
lies, including our frenemies Russia
and China, and our good friends Brit-
ain, Germany, and France. Instead, he
substituted it with the maximum pres-
sure that has met maximum resist-
ance, and what we see now is an enor-
mous escalation in danger and in rhet-
oric.
Madam Speaker, the most important
decision that a President can make is
to recommend whether we use the awe-
some force of our military, and the
most important decision that Congress
can make is whether to authorize the
use of military force.
Regrettably, we are operating on a
stale authorization from 2001 that has
nothing to do with present cir-
cumstances.
It is on Congress if we, as Repub-
licans and Democrats, given that awe-
some power, fail to be accountable by
having that vote ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ on the
authorization.
The President’s policy right now is
escalating the likelihood of military
confrontation with Iran. We must
make certain that that cannot be done
without a vote of this Congress and
every Member in it.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, my friend from
Massachusetts is right. We have made
a lot of amendments in order in this
bill today, but in the absence of an
open rule, we are never able to consider
all of the ideas.
One of the ideas we have not had a
chance to consider is whether or not we
should be doing business through the
Department of Defense with companies
that have a direct or indirect sub-
sidiary company that is under the con-
trol of the Chinese Government or the
Communist Party.
The ranking member of the Armed
Services Committee, Mr. THORNBERRY,
has such an amendment. If we defeat
the previous question, Madam Speaker,
I will offer that amendment, which
does exactly that. It prohibits the De-
partment of Defense from contracting
with any company that is a direct or
indirect subsidiary of a company in
which the Chinese Government or the
Chinese Communist Party has a con-
trolling interest.
Now, on the list of things I would put
on the common bipartisan list of ideas,

not doing business with communist
China would be one. We have seen that
over and over again. We are in the
midst right now of ripping out security
cameras all across this country manu-
factured by the Chinese as a result of a
prohibition in last year’s National De-
fense Authorization Act.

TRAHAN). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B.
MALONEY).
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the
gentleman for yielding and for his ex-
traordinary leadership.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this rule, which when passed
will include my bill, the Federal Em-
ployee Paid Leave Act, into the NDAA.
We are long overdue to guarantee
Federal workers, 2 million working
people, 12 weeks of annual paid leave to
care for themselves and their families
in time of need. This builds on the
Family Medical Leave Act that had 12
weeks of unpaid leave. This provides 12
weeks of paid leave; which families des-
perately need.
I painfully remember the birth of my
first child and inquiring about family
leave, I was told, ‘‘There is no leave.
Women just leave.’’
I said, ‘‘I don’t intend to leave. I have
to work.’’
They said, ‘‘We have no leave policy.
You will be the first one to ever come
back. Women are supposed to leave.’’
Well, this realizes that it takes two
workers usually in a family just to
make ends meet.
It is well past time that our Nation
truly honors families by offering this
basic benefit for Federal workers.
Additionally, this rule brings us one
step closer to honoring our heroic first
responders who risked their lives on
9/11 by allowing this Chamber to move
forward with the passage of the Never
Forget the Heroes Act, which fully
funds and permanently reauthorizes
the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD a listing of well over 54 organi-
zations, women’s groups, and unions
that are strongly in support of the
Family Medical Leave Act.
JULY 9, 2019.
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: We, the under-
signed organizations, urge you to co-sponsor
the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act (H.R.
1534), and cosponsor and vote for the Federal
Employee Paid Leave Act amendment to the
National Defense Authorization Act (Amend-
ment 363 to H.R. 2500). The Federal Employee
Paid Leave Act would: provide 12 weeks of
paid leave for the birth, adoption or foster
placement of a new child; to care for a
spouse, child or parent; for particular mili-
tary caregiving and leave purposes; and for
personal health reasons to federal workers
who are eligible for job protected, unpaid
leave under the Family and Medical Leave
Act (FMLA).
With more than 2 million employees, the
federal government is the nation’s largest
employer, yet provides no paid family and
medical leave. This leaves federal workers
forced to choose between a paycheck and
caring for a loved one, a newborn or them-
selves. The Federal Employee Paid Leave
Act would not provide employees with addi-
tional leave time; it would simply ensure
that federal employees can receive full pay
during their 12 weeks of FMLA leave.
Paid leave would help not just federal em-
ployees, but the entire federal government.
With access to paid leave, many individuals
can remain in the workforce when they face
caregiving responsibilities. Women who take
paid leave are more likely to be working
within a year after giving birth than those
who take no leave. Paid leave helps reduce
turnover, which is estimated to cost between
16 and 200 percent of a worker’s annual sal-
ary.
Providing paid leave to federal workers
will help the federal government retain key
employees and attract the best workers. The
federal workforce is aging, creating a reten-
tion and recruiting crisis. In 2017, the num-
ber of full-time federal employees older than
50 years old was nearly eight times the num-
ber under 30. An increase in satisfaction with
family-friendly policies has been shown to
reduce turnover intention by 37.5 percent in
federal agencies. Further, paid family and
medical leave is key to the federal govern-
ment’s competitiveness as more top compa-
nies introduce new or expanded paid leave
policies.
Paid leave supports the health and well-
being of employees and their families. New
mothers who take paid leave are more likely
to take the amount of time away from work
recommended by doctors, and their children
are more likely to be breastfed, receive med-
ical check-ups and get critical immuniza-
tions. When children are seriously ill, the
presence of a parent shortens a child’s hos-
pital stay by 31 percent; active parental in-
volvement in a child’s hospital care may
head off future health problems, especially
for children with chronic health conditions,
and thus reduce costs. Paid leave also lets
people help older family members recover
from serious illnesses, fulfill treatment
plans, and avoid complications and hospital
readmissions. Paid leave is not just good
human resource management; it sends a
message about the value we place on family.
There is a growing consensus across the
country that paid leave is a necessity. Seven
states and the District of Columbia have
passed comprehensive paid family and med-
ical leave programs and dozens of munici-
palities across the country guarantee paid
leave to their employees. Millions of workers
have filed claims in the four states that have
implemented paid leave programs, and evi-
dence shows that paid leave benefits both
employees and employers and has high levels
of public support—84 percent of voters sup-
port a comprehensive paid family and med-
ical leave policy that covers all people who
work.
The Federal Employee Paid Leave Act
would provide critical support to federal em-
ployees when they need time to care—wheth-
er for themselves, their families, or a new
child. We urge you to stand with the more
than two million federal workers and their
families by cosponsoring the Federal Em-
ployee Paid Leave Act, and cosponsoring and
voting for the Federal Employee Paid Leave
Act amendment in the National Defense Au-
thorization Act.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Madam Speaker, we have a
chance today not just to ensure a vital
and talented Federal workforce going
into the future, to make public service
economically viable to a new genera-
tion, but also to ensure that we can set
the standards for all workers across
America.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to please vote today for this rule and
the underlying bill.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN).
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise to support the NDAA and the rule
and the bipartisan work that went into
it.
Part of the reason I separated from
the Air Force was from a lack of suffi-
cient childcare options.
People across our country are often
forced to decide between building their
careers and building their families,
and, frankly, this is bad for our econ-
omy and for our country.
We need to be working to ensure that
we attract and retain the best possible
talent for any and every job. Eighty-
two percent of Americans believe our
country should be providing this, and
only 16 percent of us have it. And this
should start at the top, at the Federal
level.
I cannot fathom a world where any
person, regardless of party, would hesi-
tate to understand the importance of

having the best and brightest people
working in our government.
Our legislation addresses this core
issue. No one should have to choose be-
tween their family and career. The gov-
ernment should be leading by example,
and today, this legislation allows us to
effectively send a successful message
to all workers: paid family leave is an
investment in all of our families.
For me, it is inspiring, and it is an
inspiring moment when we see legisla-
tion being born from unlikely bed-
fellows: a concern for securing our sup-
ply chain of rare earths help fund the
need for us to provide paid family leave
to all Federal workers. This is the type
of legislation my community in Penn-
sylvania expects from Congress, and I
am very proud to introduce it today.
Madam Speaker, I urge the support
of the NDAA. I am very, very grateful
for the support and work of Congress-
woman MALONEY in leading me to this
and leading us to this.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, par-
liamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia will state his par-
liamentary inquiry.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
am holding the Rules of the House here
that say in rule XV, clause 7, para-
graph (c), ‘‘After a measure has main-
tained at least 290 cosponsors for a cu-
mulative period of 25 legislative days
after the presentation of a motion
under paragraph (b)(1), the measure
shall be placed on the Consensus Cal-
endar. Such measure shall remain on
the Consensus Calendar until it is’’ ei-
ther ‘‘considered in the House; or’’ . . .
‘‘reported by the committee of primary
jurisdiction.’’
Does tucking a measure into the un-
derlying bill, as the self-enacting
amendment does today, satisfy the
(c)(1) requirement that it be considered
in the House?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will not respond to a hypo-
thetical question or interpret the pend-
ing resolution.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, if
the gentleman would yield to me, I am
happy to respond to him.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, the
gentleman has only yielded me 30 min-
utes, but I would be happy to reserve so
that the gentleman can respond.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself 20 seconds.
Madam Speaker, I wrote the rule on
this, and we intentionally left open
how the process would proceed.
We are considering this bill and,
therefore, we don’t need to consider it
twice or three times or four times, and
that is why we are shutting the process
off.
So we are complying with our rule.
That was the intention when we wrote
it, and we are keeping our word. We are
breaking nothing. We are doing what
we promised.
So we are bringing this bipartisan
bill to the floor, and, hopefully, it will
go to the Senate and become law.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
would say to my friend from Massachu-
setts, I don’t believe I have any further
speakers remaining.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
have no additional speakers.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I have enjoyed serv-
ing on the gentleman from Massachu-
setts’ Rules Committee; I confess, not
as much as I enjoyed serving on the
gentleman from Texas’ Rules Com-
mittee, but it is because when you are
on the Rules Committee, there are nine
members in the majority and four
members in the minority.
Now, we have talked a lot of math, a
lot of votes, a lot of numbers today,
but you don’t have to be a rocket sci-
entist to figure out what happens when
you serve on a committee where there
are nine majority members and four
minority members, and the answer is,
what happens is you lose, and you lose
a lot.
That is the privilege of being in the
majority. When the American people
send a new Speaker and a new majority
here, that new majority gets to craft
the process however they want to.
When we crafted the process when I
was in the majority, we gave the mi-
nority more amendments than we gave
the majority, and we did that because
majorities have powers as committee
chairmen. They don’t have to put ev-
erything on the amendment calendar.
They can tuck it into a bill.
b 1330
As the roles have been reversed,
again my friend from Massachusetts is
making in order a record number of
amendments today. He is making in
order five times more Democratic
amendments, folks who already have
all the tools of power, than he is mi-
nority Republican amendments.
Again, it is the power of the major-
ity. They get to do that if they want to
do that. Is it fair? Well, we didn’t think
so. That is why we did it differently.
But if that is what the gentleman
wants to do, he can do it.
But to tuck a bipartisan measure—
and I don’t mean ‘‘bipartisan’’ because
one Member signed onto it or two
Members signed onto it; I mean ‘‘bipar-
tisan’’ because hundreds of Members
signed onto it—into a measure that in-
tentionally lifts one party up while
putting its foot on the throat of
amendments of the other party does
not constitute bipartisanship by any
stretch of the imagination.
When my friend from Massachusetts
was talking about the rules package—
and he is the author of the rules pack-
age. I stipulate, no one knows more
about the rules package than he does.
His heart was in the right place when
he added this new Consensus Calendar.
He said this: ‘‘It unrigs the rules so the
people’s House actually works for the
people again. Americans demanded a
new direction, and this rules package
will immediately usher in a new era for
this Congress.’’
We are 6 months later, Madam
Speaker, and we heard from the author
of the bill that is the subject of conten-
tion today. We heard from the author,
the one who has gone out to do all the
heavy lifting, do all the work to build
all the bipartisanship—again, not one
Member or two Members, but hundreds
of Members. He said he wanted to avail
himself of the Consensus Calendar to
get a vote on the floor of the House, an
unbiased, unrigged vote because, as my
friend from Massachusetts said, the
new rules package ‘‘unrigs the rules.’’
Yet, before we have considered any-
thing else on the Consensus Calendar
this entire year—Mr. WILSON’s bill is
number one on that Consensus Cal-
endar—we are confronted with a rule
today that turns off the very provision
that my friend from Massachusetts in-
serted in the House rules package to
unrig the process.
I don’t question the motives of any
Member of this institution, Madam
Speaker, and partisan motives are fair
game around here. We all wish that
they weren’t, but occasionally, they
are.
When my friend from Massachusetts
says that he has done this, this unprec-
edented use of the Consensus Calendar
and turning it off, he says he is doing
it so that the bill has the best chance
of passage in the Senate and becoming
law by being signed on the President’s
desk. I take him at his word that he
means exactly that.
But I ask you, Madam Speaker, when
the author of the bill, the one who has
done all the work, not just for a week,
not for a month, but for years to get
this bill to a place where it can be con-
sidered by the Senate, why in the world
would we not honor his request, his
wish, his desire? Even if they are going
to tuck it into this provision, why not
allow the Consensus Calendar to take
its course and get him the vote that he
has worked so hard in a bipartisan way
to achieve? If this isn’t about partisan
politics, why not give us two bites at
making this the law of the land instead
of just one?
If my friend from Massachusetts is
right, and when we take a separate
vote on this bill on Friday, it just dis-
appears into the ethos, then no harm,
no foul. But if my friend is wrong and
the partisan game that is being played
today exacts a toll—and it is not a toll
on us as Members of Congress, but it is
a toll on the widows of the members of
our Armed Forces—then we all know
that is a game that has gone too far.
I urge rejection of this rule. Defeat
the previous question, allow our
amendment, reject this rule, and allow
the bipartisanship that this new major-
ity offered and then enacted to come to
fruition for the very first time.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

July 10, 2019
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker,
how much time do I have remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has 31⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, we are bringing for-
ward legislation to repeal the widow’s
tax precisely because we have this
rules change, this Consensus Calendar.
We are bringing it forward, and it is
going to be voted on.
The Republicans, who have been in
charge for 8 years previously, had done
nothing in the last Congress to even
hold a hearing, and we are being scold-
ed that we are bringing forward this
bill? Give me a break.
In terms of amendments, we have
made nine times as many amendments
as my Republican friends made in order
at the same point last Congress. We
have made more minority amendments
in order than they did in the same pe-
riod in the last Congress. In fact, we
have more than doubled the number of
minority amendments.
So, please, spare me the crocodile
tears on the process.
They ran this place in the most
closed way possible. We are doing
things differently, and we are proud of
that.
Madam Speaker, we have already
made 439 amendments in order. That is
the most for any bill ever. But Christ-
mas is coming early this year, and we
have two more. In a moment, I will be
offering an amendment to the rule to
make in order two additional amend-
ments, one by Representative DINGELL
and one by Representative JAYAPAL.
They will bring our total amend-
ments to the bill to 441. That is a new
record. We believe this is the most
amendments ever made in order to a
single bill.
While this isn’t technically an open
rule, it is a pretty open rule.
AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. MCGOVERN
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 7. The amendments specified in Rules
Committee Print 116–23 shall be considered
as though printed in part B of House Report
116–143.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker,
despite the fact that the gentleman re-
fused to yield to me earlier, I am happy
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL) to respond
to this.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
have a parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
appreciate the gentleman yielding. I
am a little confused about what has
happened, Madam Speaker. Are we
about to begin a new hour of debate on
a new amendment after we just fin-
ished the hour of debate on the under-
lying rule?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has been
recognized under the hour rule.
Mr. WOODALL. Under the new hour,
Madam Speaker?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has been recognized under the
hour rule on his amendment.
Mr. WOODALL. Well, then I would
ask my friend from Massachusetts—I
only had 6 minutes to yield before, and
I confess I did not yield any of them to
my friend. The gentleman now has 60
minutes—could I ask for more than a
minute of his time, the customary 30
minutes?
Mr. MCGOVERN. I reclaim my time,
Madam Speaker. Enough.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. We
are making the most amendments ever
in order for any bill that has been
brought to this House floor. This is a
good process. The underlying bill—the
National Defense Authorization Bill—
increases pay for our troops, and, as I
mentioned earlier, will help repeal the
widow’s tax. The 9/11 bill is also a part
of this package. There is no reason,
other than just pure partisanship, to
want to oppose this, and if my friends
want to oppose it, they can.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows:
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 7. Notwithstanding any other provi-
sion of this resolution, the amendment print-
ed in section 8 shall be in order as though
printed as the last amendment in part B of
the report of the Committee on Rules accom-
panying this resolution if offered by Rep-
resentative Thornberry of Texas or a des-
ignee. That amendment shall be debatable
for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled
by the proponent and an opponent.
SEC. 8. The amendment referred to in sec-
tion 7 is as follows:
At the end of subtitle G of title VIII, add
the following new section:
SEC. 8. PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH COM-
PANIES INFLUENCED BY THE GOV-
ERNMENT OF CHINA.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Defense
may not enter into a contract with a com-
pany that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of
a company in which the Government of
China or the Chinese Communist Party has a
controlling interest to acquire critical
United States technologies.
(b) EXISTING CONTRACTS.—If the Secretary
of Defense has been notified that a con-
tractor for an existing contract of the De-
partment of Defense is a direct or indirect
subsidiary of a company in which the Gov-
ernment of China or the Chinese Communist
Party has a controlling interest to acquire
critical United States technologies, the Sec-
retary shall seek to take action, as prac-
ticable, to terminate the contract.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time, and
I move the previous question on the
amendment and on the resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS.
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the
purpose of complying with the Statutory
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of
the House Budget Committee, provided that
such statement has been submitted prior to
the vote on passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LOFGREN) and the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) each

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1044, the Fairness for High-
Skilled Immigrants Act, a bipartisan
bill that would make a modest, but im-
portant change to our immigration
laws to alleviate hardships associated
with lengthy visa backlogs.
Let me begin by explaining what this
bill does do and does not do. H.R. 1044
does not increase the overall number of
immigrant visas that are available
each year. Although raising the ceiling
on visas is the only viable way to
eliminate backlogs, there is, in my
view, unfortunately, no consensus on
that issue at this time.
But there is broad consensus that we
should do what we can to make the
system more equitable. This is the
focus of H.R. 1044. By eliminating the
per-country limit on employment-
based visas, all immigrant visa appli-
cants will eventually be restored to a
level playing field, where one’s country
of nationality has no bearing on their
place in line.
Under our immigration laws, employ-
ment-based visas are granted to indi-
viduals under a five-tiered ‘‘preference
system.’’ The first three preference
categories are reserved for priority
workers, individuals with advanced de-
grees, and other professionals and
skilled workers.
To be eligible for a visa under one of
these categories, the applicant must
generally have an offer of employment
from a U.S. employer, and must submit
extensive documentation of their
qualifications for the job and the rel-
evant preference category. The appli-
cant’s country of birth is simply not a
factor, and rightfully so. What does a
person’s nationality have to do with
their merit as an employee?
However, country of birth does be-
come relevant after the applicant has
qualified for a visa and is waiting in
line for a visa number. The so-called
‘‘per-country’’ limit prohibits any one
country from receiving more than 7
percent of the immigrant visas that are
available each year.
Because of this, the visa backlogs
have a particularly harsh impact on
nationals of countries with high popu-
lations, and thus, high demand for
visas, such as India. As a result, it can
now take a decade or more for an In-
dian physician working in a medically-
underserved area, or a particle physi-
cist with a Ph.D. from MIT to receive
a green card. How is this good for our
country?
Our immigration system is in des-
perate need of reform. We all know too
well the plight of Dreamers and the un-
documented population. We know now
more than ever that our agriculture
sector, which relies heavily on immi-
grant workers, is struggling to satisfy
its labor needs and provide a safe do-
mestic food supply.
We are reminded daily of the concern
we have of the situation unfolding at
the border.
On top of these very real and very se-
rious issues, we also remain inex-
tricably bound by the imperfections of
an immigration framework that was
formulated nearly 30 years ago and is
out of touch with the needs of the 21st
century.
Major reforms are required to truly
fix our outdated legal system. But as
we all know, such reforms have been
hard to come by for a long time.
If we want to get anything done, if
we want to do what is right for our
country, we have to find common

ground, and we have to compromise.
On an issue as contentious as immigra-
tion, our failure to work together in a
fully bipartisan fashion can only result
in legislation that will go nowhere in
the Senate.
H.R. 1044 is one of those rare pro-
posals where we can agree. H.R. 1044
has strong bipartisan support, with
more than 200 Democratic and more
than 100 Republican cosponsors. In 2011,
the House passed a version of this bill
by a margin of 389–15. I urge all of my
colleagues to once again vote in favor
of this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
I thank the Speaker for the oppor-
tunity to speak about this important
legislation that I am proud to sponsor,
the Fairness for High-Skilled Immi-
grants Act.
I also want to thank my colleague,
the distinguished gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LOFGREN), chairwoman
of the Subcommittee on Immigration
and Citizenship. I have appreciated
working with the gentlewoman to
make a meaningful change that will
make our employment-based immigra-
tion into an equitable system, one that
is based on merit, not on where you
were born.
Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you why
this bill has a special place in my
heart. Two years ago, as I was trav-
eling through my district, I met with a
group of individuals who were here le-
gally but felt that they were being put
at a disadvantage by our government’s
immigration policies. They were reso-
lute that I, and Congress, more broad-
ly, could change their futures for the
better.
As we sat together, my new friends
shared their stories of coming to the
United States with a great sense of
hope. They came here for any number
of reasons, but every single person ar-
rived seeking a new opportunity to suc-
ceed and realize their own American
Dream.
During our conversation, we talked
about a bill, but what we really were
discussing was these individuals’ hopes
and dreams for a future that will be
brighter because of this legislation.
You see, Mr. Speaker, our immigra-
tion policies are leaving these hard-
working people stuck between a rock
and a hard place. They had made the
difficult decision to pack up their lives
and come to the United States, seeking
the opportunity to live and work in the
greatest country in the world. But now
these same people found themselves
caught in a decades-long backlog to re-
ceive a green card, waiting to open
their own businesses, create American
jobs.
At this moment, there are approxi-
mately 1.5 million high-skilled immi-
grants living in the United States on
an employment-based visa. They are
working hard and paying their taxes,
yet face decades-long waits, sometimes
up to 70 years to receive a green card.
Worst of all, Congress created this
state of limbo by instituting an arbi-
trary annual cap on the number of in-
dividuals who may receive a green card
from any single country.
This system doesn’t make sense. Our
employment-based immigration sys-
tem has a single purpose, bringing in
the best and brightest. We shouldn’t
hamstring our economy by placing ar-
tificial caps on who can get a green
card quicker based solely on where you
are born.
As the Cato Institute and National
Review deftly pointed out, we aren’t
considering that countries have dif-
ferent population sizes. India has a
population 21⁄2 times greater than the
European Union, but has an employ-
ment-based green card cap that is 4
percent of the European Union’s cap.
This policy is not helping to develop
our high-skilled economy.
Additionally, studies based on the
Department of Labor’s own statistics
show that the per-country caps are de-
pressing the average wage for em-
ployer-sponsored immigrants by
$11,592. These arbitrary caps are de-
pressing wages, hurting American
workers, and hindering further eco-
nomic growth.
We shouldn’t be punishing highly-
skilled individuals who come to this
country legally. People who do every-
thing the right way, and are only seek-
ing an opportunity to work hard, con-
tribute to the U.S. economy and sup-
port their families.
b 1500
We should be celebrating this and
helping to create an equitable system
that benefits both U.S. companies and
employment-based visa holders. I am
happy to say that is exactly what this
bill does.
The Fairness for High Skilled Immi-
grants Act creates an equitable system
that eliminates the arbitrary per-coun-
try caps on employment-based green
cards and replaces it with a first-come-
first-served system.
This important change will free U.S.
companies to focus on what they do
best: hiring smart people to create
products, services, and jobs in our dis-
tricts, while ensuring all employment-
based visa applicants are evaluated on
their merit, not where they come from.
Mr. Speaker, it is time that Congress
fixes this policy once and for all. Sev-
enty-year backlogs are only going to
dissuade talented individuals from
coming to the United States and fur-
ther hamper our economy. We need to
create an equitable system that helps
our businesses and is fair to the indi-
viduals who came here looking to
achieve their own dream to live and
work in the greatest country in the
world.
I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation, end the backlogs, and
make our employment-based green
card system first come, first served,
not based on where you are born.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. KHANNA), my colleague.
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank my good friend and esteemed
chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee
on Immigration and Citizenship for
moving this bill to the floor. Rep-
resentative LOFGREN has worked tire-
lessly for years to get us to this point.
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of this bill. Put simply, this bill is
good for American workers, and it is
good for the American economy.
For too long, people in this country
have been unable to get a green card
simply based on where they were born.
As a result, people have been stuck on
H–1B visas, and we all know that for-
eign outsourcing firms have abused
these H–1B visas. They are underpaying
people stuck on these visas, and that is
depressing American wages, and it is
hurting American workers.
The solution is to stop corporations
from abusing the H–1B visa system and
to move people on to green cards. Once
we do that, American wages will go up.
These companies will no longer be able
to hold people in indentured servitude
and force American workers to have
cuts in their wages.
So anyone who is for American work-
ers, who believes that the H–1B visa
program is being abused, and who
wants to stand up for a path for Amer-
ican workers to get the wages they de-
serve should be for this bill. If you op-
pose this bill, you are actually sup-
porting the abuse of the H–1B visa
process.
I want to thank, again, Representa-
tive LOFGREN for her leadership.
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Utah
(Mr. CURTIS), my friend.
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I am
proud to rise in strong support of the
Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants
Act.
In recent years, Utah has witnessed
incredible growth in our tech and inno-
vation sector, bringing thousands of
jobs and strengthening our economy.
However, everywhere I go, I hear from
business leaders that they do not have
enough high-skilled workers.
Even as we work to strengthen STEM
education and bolster the number of
homegrown engineers and programers,
the demand continues to outstrip the
supply. Current limitations in our im-
migration system are forcing talented
engineers who have trained in our uni-
versities to remain on temporary visas
or leave entirely for competing coun-
tries, while important jobs go unfilled
and economic opportunities are lost.
This legislation will create a first-
come-first-served system, providing
certainty to workers and families and
enabling U.S. companies to flourish
and compete in a global economy as
they hire the brightest people to create
products, services, and jobs, regardless
of where they were born. As these com-
panies expand operations with greater
input from high-skilled workers, they
create countless more American jobs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5326 July 10, 2019
Mr. Speaker, with the debate around
our broken immigration system grow-
ing increasingly challenging in recent
years, I have been thrilled to see this
bipartisan groundswell of support
around this effort. I urge my colleagues
to join me in supporting this bill.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI).
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in strong support of
H.R. 1044, the Fairness for High-Skilled
Immigrants Act. I am proud to be an
original cosponsor of this bipartisan
legislation with over 300 cosponsors.
I want to thank Chairwoman LOF-
GREN for her excellent leadership on
this legislation which will end dis-
crimination based on national origin in
our employment-based immigration
system and strengthen our economy.
Our current system limits the num-
ber of employment-based green cards
to 7 percent per country, regardless of
population. As a result, high-skilled
workers from certain countries face
backlogs of upwards of 70 years, while
applicants from other countries go to
the front of the line. That is not fair.
This legislation ensures that all high-
skilled visa applicants have an equal
opportunity to contribute to American
economic development, regardless of
their country of birth.
Many highly educated and high-
skilled workers who come to this coun-
try on temporary visas in the tech in-
dustry and other sectors raise their
children here, are a part of our commu-
nities, pay their taxes, and want the
opportunity to become lawful, perma-
nent residents. This legislation helps
keep families together, and it helps
American businesses retain top talent,
growing and making them more pros-
perous.
Mr. Speaker, it is long overdue that
we end the discriminatory per-country
cap on employment-based visas. I urge
my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation. I salute the bipar-
tisan cooperation between Chairwoman
LOFGREN and Congressman BUCK.
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. COLLINS), my friend and the
ranking member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I appreciate the gentleman from
Colorado and also the gentlewoman
from California, but, Mr. Speaker, I
rise today, and I am in reluctant oppo-
sition to H.R. 1044. This is not some-
thing I would like to be, but this bill
could be better. In fact, it is not going
to do what it said it will do, and that
is a problem.
Current law states that nationals of
one country can receive no more than
7 percent of employment-based green
cards allotted each year. H.R. 1044 re-
moves the 7 percent cap, effectively
moving the employment-based green
card categories to a first-come-first-
served basis. Okay. That is fine. The
bill also raises the current annual per-
country cap on family-based green
cards to 15 percent. Okay.
But to be clear, I agree with the con-
cept of eliminating the per-country
caps on employment-based green cards.
In fact, I think that there probably
should not have been a cap from the
onset of this, but Congress did not
place a statutory per-country limit on
green card issuance, and a result has
been an extremely large backlog of na-
tionals from certain countries who
have approved green card petitions but
whose green card is not available and
will not be for several years.
So I understand the desire of many,
including the distinguished lady from
California, whom I have great respect
for in this field, and also my ranking
member and many others who have
signed on to this bill, but I believe
many people who signed on to this bill
signed on to a bill that would actually
be put together and actually be able to
work. They did not sign on to a state-
ment bill that will not be able to work,
in which the agencies have already said
they can’t.
Before anybody says that there are
300-plus cosponsors, remember, this
Congress also took up a bill which had
almost 400 cosponsors but still went
through the process of actually being
changed and marked up, which is a dis-
tinct difference in this bill.
So just because you have a lot of co-
sponsors doesn’t mean, always, that it
is right and can’t still be perfected. In
fact, it is wrong to tell communities
that this bill will help them when, in
actuality, it won’t.
This is the problem I have. The bill
was introduced in February. It was
placed on a Consensus Calendar last
month and now on a suspension cal-
endar today. Neither the subcommittee
nor full committee had a hearing to
look at this issue in this Congress or
any potential ramifications of the leg-
islation, and the committee did not
mark up this bill. So those of us who
support the intent but have concerns
about the factual text have no oppor-
tunity to formally hear from agencies
affected by this legislation or even out-
side groups and individuals affected.
When my colleagues took over, they
promised regular order. This isn’t reg-
ular order, especially with a bill of this
importance. Lack of process is a big
concern of mine, but even more trou-
bling are the standard provisions of the
bill and how they are not ambiguous at
times but unworkable. I will give some
examples.
Section 2(e)(1) of the bill states that,
during an implementation transition
period, visas ‘‘shall be allotted to im-
migrants who are natives of a foreign
state or dependent area that is not one
of the two states with the largest ag-
gregate numbers of natives who are
beneficiaries of approved petitions for
immigrant status under such para-
graphs.’’
What does that mean, and how is the
USCIS supposed to interpret it? Does it
mean the largest aggregate number
from the time the green cards were
first issued or does it mean something
else?
I know that previous versions of this
bill have tied such transition to a spe-
cific fiscal year. But the language here
is ambiguous and is based on interpre-
tation by the agencies. That could have
very different ramifications. In fact,
the agencies have said they don’t know
how to interpret this. The agency that
will be in charge of this said, We can’t
do this. That should ring true with
every Member in this body.
More concerning, however, is section
2(e)(4), which portends to ensure that
aliens with currently approved green
card petitions are not adversely af-
fected by lifting of the caps. The bill
states that the visas ‘‘shall be allo-
cated such that no alien described in
subparagraph (B) receives a visa later
than the alien otherwise would have re-
ceived said visa had this act not been
enacted.’’
But the premise of the bill and the
idea that approved aliens cannot be ad-
versely affected is not true. Either the
visas are first come, first served or
they are not. And the agencies that
would have to carry out this legisla-
tion would not be able to move people
up in line to comply with first come,
first served while, at the same time,
ensuring visas for already approved
beneficiaries are taken care of.
There are a finite number of visas
available every year.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. BUCK. I yield an additional 1
minute to the gentleman.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. So I will be
reluctantly standing here against a bill
that I inherently agree with. In fact,
the speakers who have spoken already,
I agree with, and the speakers who are
going to come forward, I agree with
them, except for one thing: Don’t
promise something to groups of people
that you can’t deliver on. We can’t de-
liver with this bill.
We have an opportunity to say no
right now, fix this, and come back and
have a unanimous vote. But don’t send
a bill just because it makes us feel
good and was promised to somebody.
This is not my issue with this bill.
My issue with this bill is that it is
not right. It is not ready for prime
time, and it is definitely not ready for
the suspension calendar. We need to
make it right when we come to this
floor.
I think the chairwoman has done a
great job in trying to get it there. I be-
lieve my ranking member wants to
work on that, and I am willing to, as I
expressed to the chairwoman, as well,
to make this right. This is not the
time, even though we have a lot of co-
sponsors.
If the cosponsors would simply read
the bill and understand the problems
with the agencies and then go back to
the communities advocating for this,
they cannot look them in the eye and
say, ‘‘This is your fix.’’ As I have said

many times from this floor before in
the last 6 months, Mr. Speaker, what
makes you feel good, doesn’t often heal
you.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL).
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, let me
first thank our wonderful Immigration
and Citizenship Subcommittee chair
for her tremendous work over the years
on all issues related to immigration
and for her leadership on this par-
ticular issue.
I am very proud to rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1044, the Fairness for High-
Skilled Immigrants Act, to provide re-
lief to thousands of families that have
been waiting for decades in employ-
ment visa backlogs. Among Indian na-
tionals, the wait is upwards of 70 years.
I also want to thank the ranking
member of the Immigration and Citi-
zenship Subcommittee for his support,
as well.
This is a truly bipartisan bill because
these long backlogs are a result of our
broken, outdated immigration system,
and they are affecting States across
the country. Despite the high demand
for employment-based green cards, the
system hasn’t been updated in nearly
30 years.
This bill solves one piece, by making
sure that our colleagues and our neigh-
bors who have been working in our
tech sector and our hospitals, inno-
vating in our communities can stay
with a roadmap to citizenship.
But, Mr. Speaker, our work is not
done. We cannot tolerate the fact that
we have no orderly functioning process
for people to come to America, whether
it be for family unity, to bring their
talents to our economy, to serve the
needs of our economy, or to seek safe-
ty.
This bill, and the fact that we have
300 cosponsors on it, reminds me of an-
other time when there were 68 bipar-
tisan votes in the United States Senate
in 2013 for a comprehensive immigra-
tion reform bill, and I deeply hope
that, as we pass this bill off the floor
with bipartisan support, that we can
get back to the place where we can
once again agree on a bipartisan basis
that comprehensive immigration re-
form benefits our country, benefits our
future, and is absolutely necessary.
So I thank so much, again, Chair-
woman LOFGREN for her fierce deter-
mination and her years of service, and
I look forward to passing this bill off
the floor of the House.

Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I would note
for the RECORD that one of the reasons
that I am so proud to sponsor this bill
is it is not an amnesty bill. This is a
bill that is based on merit, and it even
further enhances the merit aspects of
this program. I am proud to sponsor
this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the
gentleman from Washington (Mr.
NEWHOUSE), my good friend.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my good friend from Colorado
for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, fixing our broken immi-
gration system has been a top priority
of mine while I have been in Congress.
Today, we in the House have an oppor-
tunity to address one small piece of our
broken system, but a very important
one.
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of the Fairness for High-Skilled Im-
migrants Act. This bipartisan legisla-
tion takes an important step toward
ensuring the United States can con-
tinue to recruit and maintain the high-
est caliber of educated professionals in
the world.
Mr. Speaker, as you have heard,
under current law, the quota of em-
ployment-based immigrants for a coun-
try like Iceland with a population of
338,000 people is the same as the quota
for India, which has a population of
more than 1.3 billion people.
Eliminating arbitrary per-country
caps and addressing the employment-
based green card backlog from highly
populated countries will allow high-
skilled professionals, many of whom
are already living and working in the
United States on a temporary visa, to
continue contributing more fully to
our local communities and economies.
It will also provide certainty to the
employers and communities that rely
upon these highly skilled workers.
Mr. Speaker, in my district, many of
these high-skilled professionals are
world-class medical scientists, includ-
ing oncologists and cardiologists. I
have heard from and met with many of
these professionals, just like Mr. BUCK
from Colorado has, throughout my
State in central Washington.
Dr. Obulareddy and her husband, Dr.
Chithiri, came to the United States in
2006 to study medicine. Dr. Obulareddy
is now a specialist in oncology serving
my constituents in Yakima and sur-
rounding communities. She states, ‘‘We
always wanted to give something back
to this great country, and hence, we
decided to move to rural America,
which is experiencing an acute short-
age of physicians for a long time now.
This shortage is more severe for spe-
cialist physicians like me.’’
She and her husband, and many like
them, also dream of opening businesses
to create more American jobs, but
their temporary status does not allow
them to do so.
Dr. Obulareddy and Dr. Chithiri are
from India and have been told the
backlogged wait time for them to ob-
tain their green cards is—now, get this,
Mr. Speaker—between 70 and 150 years.
This demonstrates just how seriously
flawed the current program is and why
we need this legislative fix.
We should continue to recruit and re-
tain these highly educated, highly
trained individuals in order to meet
the demands of our local communities
and economies.
The need for rural healthcare special-
ists is a problem across my district and
across rural America, which is why I
am grateful for these professionals who
are helping address these problems fac-
ing our local communities.
Mr. Speaker, as I continue to work
toward addressing other components of
our broken immigration system, I am
proud that this bill takes a step in the
right direction, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I do want to address the
points made by the ranking member of
the full committee.
This bill has been around a while. It
was introduced in 2011. At that point,
we did have a hearing and even a mark-
up. We have had it on the floor before.
We have, at this moment, 312 Members
on the bill, bipartisan.
Addressing the issue that he was
reading, and I don’t think it is at all
confusing, the Department of State is
actually the agency that allocates the
priority dates. They keep track of the
visas. We have communicated with
them frequently over the years.
We provided in this bill a transition
period because as time has gone on, the
delays have gotten even worse for large
countries, so we wanted to put a transi-
tion period in the bill. That is what the
section that he read about would do.
We do think that this has become an
emergency in some sectors.
I recently met with a physician and
his wife, who is also a physician, who
are here on H–1B visas, and they have
been for a number of years. They are
serving a medically underserved com-
munity. Their children, who are here
legally as dependents, are about to
‘‘age out.’’ They haven’t been back to
the country of their birth in who
knows how long; they don’t speak the
language; they don’t have anybody in
the country of their birth; and they are
about to be out of status even though
they have played by all the rules.
Those two physicians told their pa-
tients that they were going to close
their practice and move to Canada be-
cause they just couldn’t go on like
this.
That is not a situation we can coun-
tenance. That is happening all over the
country. We need to fix it.
Mr. Speaker, this bill does fix it, and
I hope that we can support it. I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, today, Congress can
create a truly fair and equitable em-
ployment-based immigration system.
The Fairness for High-Skilled Immi-
grants Act will fundamentally change
our employment-based immigration
system for the better by ensuring our
employers can hire people based on
qualifications and ability to do the job,
not the country of origin.
We must continue working to build
the U.S.-based high-skilled workforce,
but in the meantime, we simply do not
have enough U.S. workers to fill our
employment needs. Congress must ad-
dress the system to ensure that we are

not welcoming high-skilled workers
here and then promptly leaving them
in a limbo that may last a lifetime.
It is time that we fix the system to
create a merit-based, first-come-first-
served system that is fair for all em-
ployment-based immigrants.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this important legislation, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking
member for the excellent work he has
done on this bill; the collaboration
that we have had on bringing it for-
ward so it could be considered today;
and the tremendous bipartisanship
that has been exhibited throughout
dealing with this question, going back
for nearly 10 years of work on this.
I would note that the vast majority,
way over 90 percent, of employment-
based immigrants who have been spon-
sored for green cards are already work-
ing in the United States on some form
of temporary visa. This doesn’t bring
in additional people. These are people
who are already here.
The question is, are they going to be
able to get the stability that legal per-
manent residence provides? If they do,
it will be good for our country in sev-
eral ways.
One, they are contributing to our
economy, whether they are physicians
serving in medically underserved areas,
whether they are scientists breaking
new ground, or whether they are H–1B
nurses who are serving in underserved
areas.
Further, we know from studies that
people who are legal permanent resi-
dents are not vulnerable to those who
might be abusive employers trying to
suppress their wages. So, this is good
for American workers as well as those
who would gain bargaining power by
gaining legal permanent residence.
Mr. Speaker, I hope that we can have
a great vote of support for this bill
today. I thank all the cosponsors and
those who worked so hard to get us
here today.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 1044, the ‘‘Fairness for
High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019.’’
H.R. 1044 will help alleviate the massive im-
migrant visa backlog by eliminating the 7 per-
cent ‘‘per-country’’ limit on employment-based
visas and increasing the family-based per-
country limit from 7 percent to 15 percent.
The bill will also ease backlogs for certain
family-sponsored immigrants by modifying the
per-country limits in the family-sponsored
green card system.
Specifically, H.R. 1044 provides for the
phased elimination over three years of the
‘‘per country’’ cap for employment-based immi-
grant visas so that all workers are treated fair-
ly.
The legislation raises the ‘‘per country’’ cap
from 7 percent to 15 percent for family-spon-
sored immigrant visas and restores 1,000 em-
ployment-based visas per fiscal year to the
People’s Republic of China, that have histori-
cally been set aside for green card applicants
under the Chinese Student Protection Act of
1992.
Mr. Speaker, the United States makes
140,000 green cards available every year to
employment-based immigrants, including
many who first come here on temporary H–1B
or L visas.
Current law, however, provides that no more
than 79 percent of these green cards can go
to nationals of any one country—even though
some countries are more populous than oth-
ers.
This bipartisan bill alters the per-country lim-
its for employment-based immigrants so that
all are treated equally regardless of their coun-
try of birth.
Mr. Speaker, I have been a strong supporter
of the H–1B program.
Without it, American employers would not
be able to hire enough highly educated profes-
sionals for the ‘‘specialty occupations.’’
A ‘‘specialty occupation’’ is employment re-
quiring the theoretical and practical application
of a body of highly specialized knowledge.
This includes doctors, engineers, professors
and researchers in a wide variety of fields, ac-
countants, medical personnel, and computer
scientists.
An American employer who wants to bring
an H–1B employee to the United States must,
among other requirements, attest that it will
pay the H–1B employee the greater of the ac-
tual compensation paid to other employees in
the same job, or the prevailing compensation
for that occupation.
Additionally, the employer must attest that it
will provide working conditions for the H–1B
visa holder that will not cause the working
conditions of the other employees to adversely
be affected; and that there is no applicable
strike or lockout.
The employer also must provide a copy of
the attestation to the representative of the em-
ployee bargaining unit or, if there is no bar-
gaining representative, must post the attesta-
tion in conspicuous locations at the work site.
Mr. Speaker, as important as it is that the
H–1B program enables our country to benefit
from the services of foreign professionals who
have skills and knowledge that are in short
supply in this country, is the fact that Amer-
ican businesses use the program to alleviate
temporary shortages of U.S. professionals in
specific occupations and to acquire special ex-
pertise in overseas economic trends and
issues.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting H.R. 1044 to help alleviate
the immigrant visa backlogs and enhance the
nation’s economic competitiveness.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
LOFGREN) that the House suspend the

States Code, to add Flagstaff and
Yuma to the list of locations in which

trict for the State of Arizona.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:

resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. DISTRICT COURTS IN THE JUDICIAL
DISTRICT FOR THE STATE OF ARI-
ZONA.
Section 82 of title 28, United States Code,
is amended by striking ‘‘Globe, Phoenix,
Prescott, and Tucson’’ and inserting ‘‘Flag-

ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. STANTON) and the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) each will

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and include
extraneous material on the bill under
consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona?
There was no objection.
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of H.R. 1569, a bill unanimously sup-
ported by our entire Arizona delegation
that will amend title 28 of the U.S.
Code to add the cities of Flagstaff and
Yuma to the list of locations in which
Federal district court can be held in
my home State of Arizona.
The U.S. Code is outdated. It has not
been amended since it was enacted in
1948. It is preposterous that right now,
district court matters can only be held
in Globe, Phoenix, Prescott, and Tuc-
son.
That means Yuma and Flagstaff resi-
dents must travel at least 100 miles to
attend a hearing or report for jury
duty. That is totally unacceptable and
unnecessary.
A pillar of the United States struc-
ture of democracy is for all Americans
to have access to the courts, whether
that is by literal location or by reduc-
ing cost barriers. We are weakening
that pillar when residents must drive
over 100 miles for their day in court.
Access to justice should not be dic-
tated by where you live. I am proud to
support this legislation because it will
have a tremendous impact on the resi-
dents in these parts of Arizona.

support it, and I hope the Senate acts

President for his signature.
It is time for Arizona to have a more
efficient and effective court system.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I agree with everything the gen-
tleman just said. This is a good bill. It
needs to happen.
These locations are different, and
since 1948, the State of Arizona has
changed.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield
as much time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
O’HALLERAN), the sponsor of H.R. 1569.
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Chairman NADLER and Ranking
Member COLLINS for moving this bill
through the Judiciary Committee.
Similarly, I thank all the committee
members for supporting the bill on a
unanimous voice vote.
This legislation has the bipartisan
and bicameral support of the Arizona
delegation.
This simple, commonsense legisla-
tion allows current Federal judges to
sit in existing courthouses or mag-
istrates’ chambers in Yuma and Flag-
staff, two rapidly growing communities
where constituents do not have full ac-
cess to the Federal judicial system.
By allowing existing judges to sit in
Yuma and Flagstaff, residents of rural
Arizona will not have to travel the sig-
nificant distances they currently do to
Phoenix or Tucson to be heard by a
judge.
This will mean that police officers
can spend more time on patrol and that
individuals won’t have to travel to
serve on juries or participate in mat-
ters that require a judge.
b 1530
Easier access to courthouses will
help Tribal nations that are under sig-
nificant Federal jurisdiction. This will
only further support Tribal sov-
ereignty.
This legislation is a simple way to
improve life for residents of rural
America, and I encourage all of my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1569.
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Congressman O’HALLERAN for his lead-
ership on this important legislation. I
also thank Chairman NADLER for work-
ing with me and advancing this bill
through the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. It is going to make a positive
difference to Arizonans. And I thank
Representative COLLINS, as well, for his
support.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. STAN-
TON) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 1569.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

SUPPORTING AND TREATING
OFFICERS IN CRISIS ACT OF 2019
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S.
998) to amend the Omnibus Crime Con-
trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to ex-
pand support for police officer family
services, stress reduction, and suicide
prevention, and for other purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
S. 998
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Supporting
and Treating Officers In Crisis Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. EXPANDING SUPPORT FOR POLICE OFFI-
CER FAMILY SERVICES, STRESS RE-
DUCTION, AND SUICIDE PREVEN-
TION.
Part W of title I of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34
U.S.C. 10491 et seq.) is amended—
(1) in the part heading, by striking ‘‘FAMILY
SUPPORT’’ and inserting ‘‘SUPPORT FOR LAW

SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS AND FAMILIES.
Section 1001(a)(21) of title I of the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968
(34 U.S.C. 10261(a)(21)) is amended to read as
follows:
‘‘(21) There are authorized to be appro-
priated to carry out part W, $7,500,000 for
each of fiscal years 2020 through 2024.’’.

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. BASS) and the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5
legislative days to revise and extend
their remarks and include material on
the bill under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of S. 998, the Supporting and Treating
Officers in Crisis Act of 2019, also
known as the STOIC Act. This bill
would provide important mental health
and suicide prevention services to law
enforcement officers and their families.
Specifically, it would modify an ex-
isting, but expired, authorization pro-
viding support to law enforcement offi-
cers’ families to add mental health and
suicide prevention programs directed
at officers themselves. Additionally, S.
998 would also reauthorize the family
support provisions and would appro-
priate up to $7.5 million for each fiscal
year from 2020 to 2024 to carry out both
the family and law enforcement officer
mental health programs.
The law enforcement officers this
grant program would assist all too
often face dangerous and horrific chal-
lenges, which takes a hard toll on them
and, often, their families. Too fre-
quently, local resources are not readily
available or accessible for these pur-
poses. S. 998 would bridge this critical
gap.
Seeking help is often the hardest step
to take to address one’s mental health
issues. It can be especially difficult for
law enforcement officers because of the
stigma against it within the law en-
forcement community and, too often
still, in society as a whole. The aim of
this legislation is to help overcome
this reluctance by destigmatizing men-
tal health treatment in the law en-
forcement community.
Provisions in this legislation encour-
age recipients of grant funding to set
up suicide prevention hotlines. These
lifelines are a critical step for getting
those officers who need it the assist-
ance they require and thereby help ad-
dress the nationwide tragedy of officer
suicide.
The impact of on-the-job stress is not
limited to law enforcement officers,
however. The underlying expired grant
program, which this bill reauthorizes,
permits recipients of grant programs
for marital and adolescent support
groups. This ‘‘whole family’’ approach
to mental health services is essential
for retaining officers. It is often said
that departments recruit officers and
retain families. Family support pro-
grams, such as those authorized in S.
998, provide critical support that keeps
officers on patrol.

Lastly, included in the reauthoriza-
tion is the ability for recipients of this
grant to provide child care on a 24-hour
basis. This provision furnishes much-
needed support to single parent offi-
cers, many of whom are women. The
Bureau of Justice Statistics reports
that there are over 100,000 female law
enforcement officers nationwide. Child
care programs, as authorized in this
measure, help promote family-friendly
workplaces and facilitate the employ-
ment of more female officers.
S. 998 is identical to H.R. 2368, a bi-
partisan measure sponsored by our
House Judiciary Committee colleague,
the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
Representative GUY RESCHENTHALER,
with the support of the gentlewoman
from Pennsylvania, Representative
MADELEINE DEAN. I should also note
that the Judiciary Committee passed
the House bill by voice vote last
month.
Accordingly, I support this bill, and I
urge my colleagues to do the same.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, as a son of a state trooper and as
someone who also has served as a chap-
lain to police agencies and our first re-
sponders, this is a very important bill
to me. I cannot think of a better Mem-
ber from our side of the aisle who sup-
ported this, and also the chairwoman
and others who have supported this,
but GUY RESCHENTHALER is a champion
of this from his service days and also
from his background.
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
RESCHENTHALER), the lead author on
the Republican side of the STOIC Act.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in support of S. 998, the
Senate companion to this bipartisan
legislation, that I introduced with Con-
gresswoman DEAN, that will address
the mental health needs of our Na-
tion’s police officers.
Law enforcement officers put their
lives on the line every day to protect
our communities.
Last year, when the Tree of Life syn-
agogue was under attack, the Pitts-
burgh police and police from around
the region ran into open gunfire to stop
a deranged, hateful madman intent on
killing as many worshippers as pos-
sible. Were it not for the heroic efforts
of the police that day, the tragic loss of
life could have been much worse.
Across the country, we sleep safely in
our beds each night because of our law
enforcement officers. But the critical
work that these men and women under-
take does not come without a cost.
According to the National Study of
Police Suicides, law enforcement offi-
cers are two-and-a-half times more
likely to die from suicides than from
homicides. Studies show that police of-
ficers have above average stress levels
that lead to post-traumatic stress,
heart disease, and high blood pressure.
Despite all we do for our communities,
the Federal Government provides few
resources to address the consequences
of their taxing work.
The STOIC Act is a bipartisan piece
of legislation that will reform and ex-
pand an existing grant program to bet-
ter address the mental health and sup-
port needs of our law enforcement,
most importantly as it relates to sui-
cide prevention.
I am very grateful to Senator
HAWLEY and Senator WHITEHOUSE for
their work to get this bill through the
Senate.
I also, again, thank Ranking Member
COLLINS and Chairman NADLER for
prioritizing this important piece of leg-
islation.
And, most importantly, I thank my
friend and fellow Pennsylvanian, Con-
gresswoman DEAN, for her tireless
work to improve mental health treat-
ment for police across the country.
Throughout this entire process, Con-
gresswoman DEAN has shown tremen-
dous appreciation for law enforcement
officers and great concern for the well-
being of them and their families. It has
truly been a pleasure to work on this
bill with Congresswoman DEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
support the STOIC Act today. It is
time for us to take care of those who
take care of us.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN).
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Chairman NADLER, Chairwoman BASS,
and my colleague and friend from
Pennsylvania for their efforts in mov-
ing this important legislation forward.
Every day our law enforcement pro-
fessionals don their uniforms, show up
for work, and take on the extraor-
dinary responsibility of keeping us
safe. It is work that, too often, goes
unnoticed or underappreciated, a kind
of quiet heroism. But that work can
also exact a very heavy toll.
The Supporting and Treating Officers
in Crisis, STOIC, Act responds to the
growing emergency in the law enforce-
ment community. Studies show that
law enforcement officers face a wide
range of stressors, including respond-
ing to violent crime, managing crisis
situations, and, as 77 percent of officers
report, dealing with insufficient de-
partmental support for their mission.
This stress has serious consequences.
Studies indicate that 1 in 4 officers re-
port stress-based physical health prob-
lems, and 1 in 14 meet the criteria for
PTSD. Think of that: just showing up
for this important work places our law
enforcement professionals at increased
risk for a wide range of health prob-
lems.
Suicide among our law enforcement
community is rising at a troubling
rate, as well. The CDC reported in 2016
that the suicide rate in this commu-
nity is 50 percent higher than the na-
tional average. In recent years, the
number of law enforcement who have
died by suicide has even surpassed the
number of officers killed in the line of
duty.
According to Blue H.E.L.P., we lost
142 officers to suicide in 2016. Last
year, that number jumped to 167 com-
pared to 144 who tragically lost their
lives in the line of duty.
Officers in crisis need our support.
The STOIC Act, both the Senate and
the House version, will reform and ex-
pand existing grant programs to better
address mental health, establish sui-
cide prevention programs, and offer aid
to officers’ families.
Our law enforcement officers are true
public servants, and honoring their
service means providing them with the
support they deserve.
I thank my colleague, fellow Penn-
sylvanian, Congressman
RESCHENTHALER, for speaking in one
voice across the aisle and across cham-
bers. I thank him for his passion and
his leadership on this bipartisan bill. It
has been a pleasure to work with him
and his team on an issue we both care
deeply about. I look forward to our
continued efforts, and I urge all Mem-
bers to support the STOIC Act.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding;
and I thank the two cosponsors, the
gentleman from Pennsylvania and the
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, for a
very important initiative that not one
of us have, unfortunately, not heard of
one of our law enforcement officers in
recent years, in recent times, or in re-
cent months committing suicide. That
incident has occurred in my own com-
munity.
It is clearly important to be able to
provide this extra support, the Sup-
porting and Treating Officers in Crisis
Act of 2019, the STOIC Act. It is crucial
because it also impacts these families.
These officers every day deal with such
catastrophic incidences. In my own
community, we have seen six little
children killed over the last couple of
months.
b 1545
The individuals who arrive first to
the scene are law enforcement officers,
and they are moms and dads with chil-
dren. And I cannot imagine the impact
that those scenes, those crime scenes,
have day after day on these officers
who have joined the force to do good
and to help people.
We often say when we call 911, we are
looking for the men and women in
blue, and we are looking for them to
strengthen those families who are bro-
ken or in crisis. This particular act
would revitalize the DOJ’s grant pro-
gram for Law Enforcement Family Re-
sources, in addition to allocating funds
to establish suicide prevention, stress
management, and mental health pro-
grams.
We know that just as our military
men and women face the devastation of

PTSD, members of our various law en-
forcement agencies who work to pro-
tect us also experience post-traumatic
stress disorder.
This program to enhance the grants
that departments can secure will be
able to fill in the gap and work with
families and also deal with the ques-
tion of those experiencing mental ill-
ness. Post-traumatic stress disorder
can come in the form of depression,
burnout, and other mental-health re-
lated issues and anxiety.
We know that over the years, sui-
cides have increased, but in 2017, an es-
timated 140 officers died from suicide,
which exceeds the 129 that were killed
in the line of duty.
Mental illness is a silent, but lethal
killer. We are working in the Judiciary
Committee on the Law Enforcement
Trust and Integrity Act which will em-
phasize some of the protocols for im-
proving, policing, working on profes-
sionalism, and working with the 18,000
police departments across America. I
can’t imagine waiting to pass this leg-
islation to reignite the grant program
to be able to help those who are now
presently suffering.
I am glad that this is a bicameral ini-
tiative. I hope that this will move
quickly to the President’s desk to sign,
and I hope those funds will get to the
Houston Police Department, the Harris
County Sheriff’s Department, con-
stables’ offices, and various police de-
partments across America.
A healthy police officer, physically
and mentally, is the best community
relations that you could ever have. A
healthy officer who works with chil-
dren, who works with communities,
who works with families, and shows up
when the civic club asks them to come
and speak about safety and security in
the neighborhood, that is who we hope
will be the kind of officer who will
come to work every day.
These grant programs will ensure
that. Most of all, I would like to close
by saying: for those law enforcement
officers who are, many times, former
military personnel and committed to
the idea of service, go and get help. We
are standing ready to help. These grant
programs will allow police depart-
ments, cities, counties, and States to
put out an effective and strong re-
sponse to the needs of our law enforce-
ment, and to thank them for their
service.
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the
Committee on the Judiciary, and on Homeland
Security, I rise in strong support of S. 998, the
‘‘Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act
of 2019,’’ known for short as the ‘‘STOIC Act’’.
The STOIC Act would reintroduce and revi-
talize the DOJ’s grant program for Law En-
forcement Family Services, in addition to allo-
cating funds to establish, suicide prevention,
stress management, and mental health pro-
grams.
Mr. Speaker, as late as 2017, there were
more than 600,000 law enforcement officers
employed in the United States, charged with
protecting their communities.
Daily, the nation’s law enforcement officers
witness and experience all manner of trauma
in the line of duty.
As these brave members of our nation’s
various law enforcement agencies work to pro-
tect the individuals of their communities, the
difficulties they experience often leave them
with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
depression, burnout and other mental health
conditions related to anxiety.
These anxiety-related illnesses can even re-
sult in suicide.
In 2017, an estimated 140 officers died from
suicide, which exceeds the 129 that were
killed in the line of duty, making mental illness
the silent killer and most lethal threat to law
enforcement professionals.
There is no doubt that these men and
women suffering from mental health issues
that occurred as a result of their efforts to pro-
tect and serve their communities, deserve our
support throughout their recovery and treat-
ment.
By passing S. 998, officers combating anx-
iety related mental health conditions, and their
families, will receive improved support and
care.
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting S. 998 to ensure that the nation’s law
enforcement officers, and their families, re-
ceive the mental health care and rehabilitation
they deserve.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I am ready to close.
Again, it is a great bill. You have
heard the accolades of the gentleman
and gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.
They have made that case clear, along
with my friends from Texas and Cali-
fornia.
This is a good bill, I urge everybody
to support it, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the tragically high
number of law enforcement profes-
sionals who take their own lives each
year is a serious problem that must be
addressed.
According to Blue H.E.L.P., an advo-
cacy organization that works to reduce
mental health stigma in the law en-
forcement community, 167 law enforce-
ment officers committed suicide in
2018. By comparison, in the same year,
144 law enforcement officers died in the
line of duty.
S. 998 will help provide critical men-
tal health and suicide prevention as-
sistance to law enforcement officers in
need. I therefore urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting this important
measure, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
BASS) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, S. 998.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5332 July 10, 2019
This legislation will help ensure the
safety of our citizens and the security
of our Nation. S. 744, which the Senate
passed by unanimous consent earlier
this year, is identical to H.R. 1986,
which the House Committee on the Ju-
diciary recently approved by voice vote
last month.
In 1990, Congress imposed criminal
penalties with respect to the develop-
ment, production, stockpiling, trans-
fer, acquisition, retention, or posses-
sion of any biological agents, toxins, or
delivery systems intended for use as a
weapon.
Thereafter, Congress in 2001, added
section 175b to title 18 of the U.S. Code,
criminalizing the possession by unreg-
istered individuals or restricted per-
sons of certain biological agents,
termed ‘‘select agents,’’ as determined
by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services. A person found guilty under
section 175b can be imprisoned for up
to 10 years.
As originally enacted and thereafter
in subsequent amendments thereto,
section 175b referred to specific sec-
tions of the Code of Federal Regula-
tions that listed various biological
agents and toxins.
That provision was last amended in
2004, but subsequently, the Department
of Health and Human Services refor-
matted some sections of the Code of
Federal Regulations and inadvertently
rendered the references in section 175b
incomplete.
For example, one of the select agents
inadvertently eliminated from the list
of prohibited substances is ricin, a poi-
son found in castor beans. Ricin is in-
expensive, easy to make, and highly
toxic.
This result, the consequence of a
drafting error, is clearly not what Con-
gress intended. Unfortunately, there
have already been real-life con-
sequences for this error.
Last September, for instance, the
District Court for the Northern Dis-
trict of Georgia, dismissed the indict-
ment of William Christopher Gibbs, a
self-avowed white supremacist who was
charged with the unregistered posses-
sion of ricin. In dismissing the Gibbs
indictment, the court stated it:
Appreciates the potential dangers associ-
ated with individuals possessing potentially
hazardous agents and toxins without permis-
sion to do so. Equally, though, the Court
takes very seriously the principle that citi-
zens ought to have fair and clear warning of
the conduct for which they can be held
criminal responsible. It falls to Congress to
write criminal laws, or to amend them if
they yield unfair or unwanted results. The
role of the courts, on the other hand, is lim-
ited to fairly reading and applying the laws
Congress writes; not to change them.
As we consider S. 744 today, it is im-
portant to recognize and commend the
sponsor of the House companion bill,
the gentleman from Texas and our Ju-
diciary Committee colleague, Rep-
resentative JOHN RATCLIFFE; and Judi-
ciary Ranking Member DOUG COLLINS;
as well as the gentlewoman from New
York, Representative KATHLEEN RICE;
and the gentleman from Texas, Rep-
resentative WILL HURD, for their bipar-
tisan efforts to address this critical
problem.
I urge my colleagues to support this
important legislation, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of
H.R. 1986 because it fixes a technical,
but very important, error that oc-
curred in the Code, and the gentle-
woman from California, again, has
done a wonderful job of explaining this.
She brought up an interesting case.
She brought up the case out of the
Northern Circuit of Georgia which is
actually my circuit, and the judge in
that case is actually a judge named
Rick Story. And Rick Story is one of
the best jurists we have in this coun-
try. His comment here is really, I
think, telling for us that many times
in Congress we need to take heed of
when he says: ‘‘It falls to Congress to
write criminal laws or to amend them
if they yield unfair or unwanted re-
sults.’’ And that is exactly what we are
doing here today.
This needs to be added. It was a
scrivener’s error and a mistake that it
was not there, and it needs to be cor-
rected.
And with that, again, the gentle-
woman from California has been a
great help on this, and the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE), and oth-
ers for their work on this legislation.
As we go forward, I think this has
been a good process. I am glad to see it
coming to fruition, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, without question, Con-
gress should do everything within its
power to ensure the safety of all Amer-
icans. Clearly, the possession and dis-
tribution of ricin is dangerous and
should be included among the various
biological toxins prohibited under cur-
rent law, as Congress had intended.
S. 744 corrects this technical error
and addresses the serious consequences
presented by this oversight. For these
reasons, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting S. 744, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary and on Homeland Security, I rise in strong
support of S. 744 the ‘‘Effective Prosecution of
Biological Toxins and Agents,’’ which amends
18 U.S.C. 175b to prohibit the possession,
transport, or sale of biological agents and tox-
ins by individuals.
S. 744 also prohibits the transport, posses-
sion, or shipment of any biological agent or
toxin in interstate or foreign commerce.
Biological agents and toxins disseminate
disease-causing organisms or toxins to harm
or kill humans, animals or plants.
In addition to strategic or tactical military ap-
plications, biological weapons can be used to
infect livestock or agricultural produce to
cause food shortages and economic loss, cre-
ate environmental catastrophes, and introduce
pandemics.
Biological agents can also be deployed in
missiles, bombs, hand grenades, and rockets
to deliver death and destruction.
Mr. Speaker, there have also been docu-
mented efforts to develop delivery devices for
assassinations or sabotage operations, includ-
ing a variety of sprays, brushes, and injection
systems as well as means for contaminating
food and clothing.
It should concern us all that recent techno-
logical advances increase the likelihood that
these weapons could be acquired or produced
by non-state actors, including terrorist organi-
zations and mentally unstable individuals.
This is a major threat to our national secu-
rity as well as the safety of all American citi-
zens.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting S. 744.
In doing so we provide an added measure
of security for our homeland by prohibiting the
creation and proliferation of biological weap-
ons as well as the sale of such weapons.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5333
July 10, 2019
There was no objection.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, there will be a time in
this country when the President of the
United States will have a husband and
not a wife. In preparation for that day,
I urge the House to suspend the rules
and pass H.R. 677, the 21st Century
President Act, which removes gender
terms from current law criminalizing
threats against former Presidents and
their families.
Currently, we have a law that makes
it unlawful to threaten to kill, kidnap,
or inflict bodily harm upon a former
President, President-elect, Vice Presi-
dent-elect, or a major candidate for
President, or Vice President, or their
immediate family member.
The statute, however, defines imme-
diate family with terms such as:
‘‘wife,’’ ‘‘her,’’ and ‘‘widow,’’ which
makes presumptions that will not
stand the test of the future of this
country.
At present, one member of the
LGBTQ community and six women
have declared themselves to be can-
didates for the Presidency. Whether or
not any of these candidates is nomi-
nated or elected, it is clear that the
terminology in our law is outdated and
should be changed to refer to the
spouse of a former President.
The words we use shape the world in
which we live. We should act accord-
ingly. I support H.R. 677, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this. I
think the bill is a good bill. It does ex-
actly what it needs to do, and it clari-
fies for the future. I encourage every-
one to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. POCAN).
b 1600
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
Representative for the time.
The current field of Presidential can-
didates looks more like American soci-
ety than ever before, and we are closer
than ever to the possibility that a
woman or LGBT person could hold the
country’s highest office.
We have decades of activism by
women and the LGBT community to
thank for this fact, and the least Con-
gress can do is to ensure the law recog-
nizes the progress our country has
made.
We have come a long way from 1872
when Victoria Woodhull became the
first woman to seek the Presidency,
decades before women won the right to
vote. Today, six women, more than
ever before, are running for President.
Almost 100 years after the passage of
the 19th Amendment, and thanks to
trailblazers like Victoria Woodhull,
Shirley Chisholm, and Hillary Clinton,
we are closer than ever before to hav-
ing a woman in the Oval Office.
In 2012, Fred Karger, a Republican,
was the first openly LGBT candidate
for President, and the 2020 Democratic
Presidential field includes one openly
LGBT candidate.
The landmark 2015 Supreme Court
decision making gay marriage legal in
all 50 States means that a future Presi-
dent may have a spouse of the same
sex.
Unfortunately, current Federal law is
outdated and does not reflect the re-
ality that we could have a female or
gay President as soon as 2021.
Today’s bill updates Federal law to
reflect the possibility of a female or
LGBT President by replacing gendered
terms like ‘‘wife’’ and ‘‘widow’’ with
‘‘spouse.’’ It also replaces gender-spe-
cific pronouns when referring to the
President and their spouse with gen-
der-neutral terms.
Without this change, the law that
makes it a crime to threaten to kill,
kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon the
President or the President’s family
would fail to include a future female or
gay President.
The words we use matter, and it is
critically important that the law rec-
ognizes that soon we will have a Presi-
dent who is not a straight man.
I thank the chairman, the ranking
member, and all the members of the
committee for their support of this im-
portant bipartisan bill.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the 21st Century President Act.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let
me thank the gentlewoman for yielding
and let me thank the sponsor of the
legislation, the 21st Century President
Act.
I wanted to affirm Congressman
POCAN for the leadership that he has
given to an issue that many might not
pay attention to, and the term is ap-
propriate, the 21st Century President
Act, which deals with criminalizing
threats against former Presidents and
their families as well as providing se-
curity for those individuals who may
be impacted.
For example, section 879 of title 18,
enacted in 1982 after the assassination
attempt on then-President Ronald
Reagan, makes it unlawful to threaten
to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm
upon a former President, President-
elect, or Vice President-elect or major
candidate for President or Vice Presi-
dent or an immediate family member.
In the terminology, as has been indi-
cated, the terms are defined as ‘‘wife,’’
‘‘her,’’ and ‘‘widow,’’ which presumes
that the President of the United States
will always be a man and his spouse
will always be a woman.
We are very fortunate to have any
number of wonderful Americans run-
ning who will have the opportunity to
serve. Many women are running. Cer-
tainly, individuals from our LGBTQ
community will be in the future mix
for President of the United States.
I thank the gentleman from Wis-
consin for bringing us into the 21st cen-
tury, being enthusiastic about recog-
nizing the importance of ensuring the
safety and security of those who may
be running as candidates, those who
may be serving who come from the
wide, vast diversity of America.
It is clear that the time has come for
the language to change to a neutral
term of ‘‘spouse’’ to refer to the part-
ner of the President of the United
States.
It is also important that we update
our laws to welcome enthusiastically
the idea that America, excitingly, will
have an opportunity to elect a unique
and different person to the Presidency
of the United States, competent, quali-
fied, and able to serve.
I rise to support the 21st Century
President Act. The language speaks to
the idea of the new and exciting oppor-
tunity for this great country.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support
of H.R. 677, the ‘‘21st Century President Act,’’
introduced by my good friend, the gentleman
from Wisconsin, Congressman MARK POCAN.
I support this legislation, which updates the
current statutory provision set forth in 18
U.S.C. 879 criminalizing threats against former
presidents and their families.
It does this by removing the gendered terms
from the statute.
Section 879 of title 18, enacted in 1982 after
the assassination attempt on then-President
Ronald Reagan, makes it unlawful to threaten
to kill, kidnap or inflict bodily harm upon a
former President, President-elect, or Vice
President-elect, or a major candidate for Presi-
dent or Vice President, or [an] ‘‘immediate
family’’ member.
‘‘Immediate family,’’ however is defined with
terms such as ‘wife,’ ‘her,’ and ‘widow’—which
presumes the president will always be a man
and his spouse will always be a woman.
H.R. 677, the 21st Century President Act
makes an important contribution in recognition
of the historic progress we have made in our
country.
In 2016, the Democratic party, one of Amer-
ica’s two major political parties, nominated a
woman to be its standard bearer and nominee
of President of the United States.
The change that will be made by enacting
the 21st Century President Act is particularly
appropriate at this moment.
Competing for the 2020 presidential nomina-
tion of their party are six women candidates
and a member of the LGBTQ community.
It is clear that the time has come for the lan-
guage to change to a neutral term of ‘‘spouse’’
to refer to the partner of the president.
Under current law, it is assumed that the
President of the United States is male, and
the spouse is female.
This accords with America’s past, but does
not reflect its future.
It is time for Congress to change the law.
Equality is a principle that we must always
embrace and affirm, and a principle that we
must always keep working to advance and se-
cure for every American.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting H.R. 677 to amend federal
law to recognize that persons other than men

can and will be President, and presidential
spouses will not always be female.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, it is essential that we
update our statutes when necessary.
H.R. 677 does exactly that. It simply
amends current law so that it is more
inclusive and reflective of our society.
I thank the gentleman from Wis-
consin, Representative MARK POCAN,
for identifying this problem in the law
and for introducing this bill to rectify
it. H.R. 677 will indeed take this law
into the 21st century, as the title sug-
gests.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this commonsense measure,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
BASS) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 677.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

b 1702
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 2500) to
authorize appropriations for fiscal year
2020 for military activities of the De-
partment of Defense and for military
construction, to prescribe military per-
sonnel strengths for such fiscal year,
and for other purposes, with Mr.
CUELLAR in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall not exceed 1
hour equally divided and controlled by
the chair and the ranking minority
member of the Committee on Armed
Services.
The gentleman from Washington (Mr.
SMITH) and the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. THORNBERRY) each will control 30
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield myself 5 minutes.
Mr. Chair, this, as always, is an in-
credibly important piece of legislation.
This is a piece of legislation by which
we provide for the national security of
this country, and every little bit, as
importantly, we provide for the men
and women who put their lives on the
line to provide for the national secu-
rity of this country.
For 58 years, we have passed the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. It is
the one piece of legislation that has
not failed to pass in that timeframe,
and there is a very good reason for
that: It is enormously important, and
it is our opportunity to show those
men and women who serve in the mili-
tary that we support them, we support
what they do, and we are going to
make sure that they have all that they
need to carry out the missions that we
ask them to do.
One of the reasons that we have al-
ways been able to be successful on this
is because of the very strong bipartisan
tradition of our committee. We have
worked with various chairmen and
ranking members across the aisle for
all of those years and really made sure
that we worked together, regardless of
who was in the majority, to produce a
product that we can be proud of—and
we have.
On that measure, as we have moved
in the majority this year, my staff and
I have worked very hard with the rank-
ing member and with all the members
of the committee and their staffs to
maintain that bipartisan tradition.
When we had the bill in committee,
we had a large number of proposals,
which I will read to you.
There were 736 proposals from Repub-
licans, 889 from Democrats. We put
into our bill 53 percent of the Repub-
lican requests and 52 percent of the
Democratic requests.
In amendments, there were more
Democratic amendments in committee,
266 to 248 for the Republicans, but,
still, we accepted 57 percent of the Re-
publican amendments.
On the floor, there were a lot more
amendments from Democrats, 480 to
201, but, again, we accepted 50 percent
of the Republican amendments.
My staff and I and other members,
personally, on a large number of issues,
most notably on nuclear issues—Mr.
TURNER, who is the ranking member on
the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces,
was concerned that we weren’t working
together properly on a number of nu-
clear issues. There were 10 or 12 or
more. I reached out to him. We worked
together, and we resolved half of them,
because that is what we do. This is a
very strong bill that everybody on this
floor should feel proud to vote for.
Now, there are a couple of issues, but
the biggest thing is remember what is
in this bill. Once again, we give a very
high pay raise to the men and women
who serve, 3.1 percent pay raise.
We have also, through the amend-
ment process, included a priority that
has over 300 cosponsors in the House,
and that is JOE WILSON’s bill to finally
eliminate the offset that cuts the
amount of money that goes to widows
of men and women who have passed
away in the military. This is the bill to
eliminate that offset. There is a lot in
this bill that we can be proud of.
Now, the issues that we have had dis-
agreement on, I understand, but we al-
ways have disagreements. It is a large
bill. I don’t like everything in this bill.
I don’t think anybody does, but we can-
not forget the central mission of this
bill: to support the men and women
who serve the military and to make
sure that we have a strong national se-
curity.
The number one issue is how much
money we spend.
Let me just say—and I think there is
bipartisan agreement on this—we need
a budget caps deal. A continuing reso-
lution is unacceptable.
It is unacceptable for the entire dis-
cretionary budget, and it is certainly
unacceptable for the Department of De-
fense, which can’t simply keep doing
what it has been doing. There are al-
ways programs they need to get rid of
and new programs they need to create.
We need to get a deal on that. But the
number that we marked to, $733 billion,
was the number that the Pentagon
planned for for over a year.
After we got the last budget deal to
get $716 billion, the Pentagon planned
on what their next year’s budget would
be, and the President and the Pentagon
put together a $733 billion budget for
over a year. But then, at the end of last
year, the President felt that number
was too high.
By the way, I think I might agree
with him. I think there are greater effi-
ciencies to get out of the Pentagon.
So he said it ought to be cut by 5 per-
cent; it ought to be $700 billion. A num-
ber of people protested that, went to
the Pentagon and said: You can’t cut it
to 700.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5338 July 10, 2019
So the President said it can’t be 733;
it has got to be 700. And then he agreed
to 750. That doesn’t make a lot of
sense. The 733 number is the number
that we planned to.
Now, I will agree that there is a ro-
bust debate that can be had about that:
Should it be 750 or 733? I very strongly
support the 733 number. I don’t think
giving the Pentagon an additional $17
billion at the last minute is fiscally re-
sponsible.
I agree with the ranking member,
who has said, in the years when we
were cutting the defense budget by 20
percent, that wasn’t responsible either.
I think 733 is responsible, but I can
hear arguments for the other side.
What doesn’t make sense is to say
that, if you don’t get 750, somehow 733
is so bad that we have to vote against
it. That simply doesn’t make sense. 733
is the largest amount of money we
have ever spent on the Pentagon. It
more than funds our national security
needs.
I believe this is a very strong bill. We
will debate many other issues. When
we get done, I hope we can uphold that
bipartisan tradition and show that we
support national security and we sup-
port the men and women who are put-
ting their lives on the line for our
country.
I reserve the balance of my time.

concerning the bill H.R. 2500, the ‘‘National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2020’’. Certain provisions in the legislation
fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee
on Energy and Commerce. In the interest of
permitting your committee to proceed expe-
ditiously to floor consideration of this im-
portant bill, the Committee will not request
a sequential referral and is waiving its right
to said referral.
The Committee takes this action with the
understanding that it is not waiving any ju-
risdictional claim over this and similar leg-
islation or the subject matters contained in
the bill, that it will be appropriately con-
sulted and involved as this legislation moves
forward, and that its jurisdictional interests
over this and similar legislation are in no
way diminished or altered. I request that
you urge the Speaker to name members of
this committee to any conference committee
that is named to consider such provisions.
The Committee also reserves the right to
seek appointment to any House-Senate con-
ference on such legislation and requests your
support in the event the Committee makes
such a request.
Finally, I would appreciate a response to
this letter confirming this understanding
and that you would place our exchange of
letters into the committee report on H.R.
2500 and the Congressional Record during
consideration of the measure on the House
floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in
which you have worked with this committee
regarding this matter.
Sincerely,
FRANK PALLONE, Jr.,

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing to you

Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year

In the interest of permitting your Com-

this Committee’s right to sequential referral
and forego formal consideration of H.R. 2500

that by waiving consideration of the bill, the
Committee on Financial Services does not
waive any future jurisdictional claim over
the subject matters contained in H.R. 2500
which fall within the Committee’s Rule X ju-
risdiction. I also do so under the mutual un-
derstanding that the Committee on Finan-
cial Services will be appropriately consulted
and involved as this or similar legislation
moves forward. The Committee reserves the
right to seek appointment of an appropriate
number of conferees to any House-Senate
conference involving H.R. 2500, and I request

visions.
Please place this letter into the Com-

Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank
Chairman SMITH and the members of

work they have put into developing
this product over the course of the

the different insights based on their
background and perspective. It has
been very helpful.
I also want to thank the staff. As you
can tell, Mr. Chairman, from the size of
the bill, as well as the number of
amendments filed throughout the proc-
ess, it is a big job, and a limited num-
ber of staff have worked very hard to
get us to this point.
I think maybe it is helpful to just
step back for a second and talk about
what this bill is about.
The Preamble of the Constitution
says that one of the reasons we have a
government is to provide for the com-
mon defense, but Article I, Section 8
goes into specifics by putting the re-
sponsibility on Congress’ shoulders to
raise and support, provide and main-
tain the military forces for the United
States.
How well we do or do not do that job
that the Constitution puts on us has
real consequences. Literally, the life
and death of the men and women who
serve are at stake, as well as the secu-
rity, the safety, and the well-being of
men and women throughout the coun-
try. It is a significant responsibility,
and, again, the Constitution says it is
ours.
Now, as the chairman noted, for 58
straight years, one of the ways we have
fulfilled that responsibility under the
Constitution has been to pass, and a
President of both parties has signed, a
National Defense Authorization Act.
Fifty-eight straight years that has oc-
curred. And most of that time, at least
certainly in my experience over the
last 25 years, it has been done on a bi-
partisan basis.
For example, in last year’s bill, the
committee reported the bill favorably
by a vote of 60–1. The year before, it
was 60–1. The year before that, it was
60–2. The year before that, it was 60–2.
Last year, on final passage, the vote on
this floor was 351–66. The year before
that, it was 344–81.
I could go on, but the point is, that
there has been strong bipartisan sup-
port in fulfilling that essential respon-
sibility under the Constitution.
As you know, Mr. Chairman, this
year is different. This year, the bill was
reported out of committee by a vote of
33–24, and the reasons were serious,
substantive disagreements with provi-
sions that were in the bill.
As the chairman, himself, said in, I
believe, 2016: ‘‘There is nothing shame-
ful about making a legitimate policy
choice to oppose the NDAA or any
other bill. . . . Regardless of whether
we support the NDAA or not, we all
support the brave men and women of
our military who defend the country.’’
I think the chairman was right then,
and I think the statement is still true
today.
When the bill came out of com-
mittee, some of us had a hard time de-
ciding whether to support it or not be-
cause there are many good elements in
this bill. And it is absolutely true that,
from the ground up, a number of Re-
publicans, as well as Democrats, have
worked together to contribute to this
bill. My view was that there were some
adjustments that could be made that
would enable most Members to support
it.
Unfortunately, what has happened, as
the bill now has come out of the Rules
Committee, is, in my view, at least, un-
precedented.
First, the rule self-executes an
amendment that has a number of seri-
ous issues. Now, a lot of them have se-
rious support, but shouldn’t they be on
the floor so that we can talk about
them, perhaps discuss offsets on some
very challenging issues that we have
grappled with over the years?
But then when it comes to other
amendments, I believe that of the 439
made in order, 340 of them are Demo-
cratic-sponsored, 98 are Republican.
That is not the way it has been before.
Last year, more Democratic amend-
ments were made in order on the floor
than Republican amendments. The
year before, it was just about exactly
even. So we see the bill drifting in a
particular direction.
Most concerning, I think, in many re-
spects, is, of the contested amend-
ments—in other words, of those amend-
ments about which there is a difference
and there will be a debate and probably
a vote—63 of them are sponsored by
Democrats.
b 1715
I believe there is just one sponsored
by Republicans, Mr. TURNER’s on low
yield. I don’t believe there is another
contested amendment that the rule has
made in order.
Now, the problem with that, Mr.
Chairman, is there is virtually no op-
portunity to improve the bill.
I think Chairman SMITH made a very
important point in the Rules Com-
mittee yesterday. He said it is with
this bipartisan input and support,
every step in the process that results
in a better bill. And I think we have
proven that time and time again.
Unfortunately, that is not what we
are seeing today.
We have made a lot of progress in the
last 2 years. As most Members know,
starting in 2011, defense spending was
cut in real terms about 20 percent.
Both Republicans and Democrats share
responsibility for that, by the way.
And both Democrats and Republicans
share responsibility for making up
about half of that amount in the last 2
years, but we haven’t finished the job.
As a matter of fact, a study in the
Military Times earlier this year found
that military aviation accidents have
increased 40 percent over the past 5
years, but military aviation accident
deaths hit a 6-year high in 2018.
The point is, we made a good start at
fixing our problems, but we have not
finished the job. And that is part of the
reason that some of us are so con-
cerned about cutting the administra-
tion’s request by $17 billion, to fail to
keep that momentum on fixing our
readiness, on modernization, on re-
search in key areas, all of the different
categories in making sure that we con-
tinue to improve the situation for our
troops.
Mr. Chairman, there are a lot of good
things in this bill, but they can’t seem

to overcome the ways in which this bill
takes steps backwards.
I don’t know. There are lots of things
we could talk about. The bottom line,
however, is there is only one thing that
matters: does this bill adequately sup-
port our troops and American national
security? There is really nothing else,
no other criteria, that matters the way
that that fundamental question does.
I am concerned that this bill does not
meet that standard. I know a number
of my colleagues are concerned about
that as well.
We have hopes that at some point in
the process, the bill will actually come
closer to adequately supporting our
troops and American national security,
but it is not there yet. And I have con-
cerns, given what the Rules Committee
has done, that it will be hard to do so
on this floor.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, I will just say quickly
that I completely agree with the rank-
ing member. The question is, does this
bill adequately support our national se-
curity?
I don’t think that is even debatable.
There is no question that at $733 bil-
lion, with all the bipartisan provisions
that we put in there, this bill more
than adequately supports our troops
and supports our national security.
That is why I think it is so wrong
that even in committee, the Repub-
licans have decided to oppose it. It does
more than adequately support.
Now, there are things we disagree
with, certainly, but I totally agree
with that formulation. If you believe
this bill at least adequately, I think
more than adequately, supports it, you
ought to vote for it.
The only comment I will make on the
floor amendments is we submitted 480
on the Democratic side, the Repub-
licans submitted 201. So, yes, there are
going to be more Democratic amend-
ments, because we, I guess, are a little
bit more prolific in that regard, but
there is not a partisan effort in that.
Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NOR-
CROSS), the chairman of the Tactical
Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, I thank
the chairman for yielding and certainly
for the work that we have all done,
particularly under his leadership, to
bring this to the floor.
Mr. Chair, this bill continues that
long tradition of transparent and bi-
partisan work by the Tactical Air and
Land Forces Subcommittee to support
the development and delivery of capa-
bilities that make America’s land
forces the best in the world.
Mr. Chair, I would like to thank our
subcommittee ranking member, Mrs.
HARTZLER, for her collaboration and
contribution to the bill. Both she and
her staff have been helpful during this
entire process. It is certainly what
works well here in Congress. And I ap-
preciate her commitment to the bipar-
tisan tradition we proudly uphold on
our subcommittee.
The subcommittee mark was adopted
by unanimous voice vote, which is in-
dicative of how important it was to
both Democrats and Republicans, but
most importantly, Americans.
This cooperation helped us focus on
what is important: that we deliver a
defense authorization act that meets
the modernization and readiness re-
quirements of our Nation’s air and land
forces.
The committee used the $733 billion
as a top line based on sworn testimony
from military officials, and the $733
billion is the amount that would give
our forces a competitive advantage,
based on the capabilities of Russia and
China, by 2025.
In fact, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, General Dunford, said
that $733 billion:
Is completely informed by the analysis
conducted by the military, for the path of
capability development.
This goes to the heart of the con-
versation that we are having here: Are
we doing what is right? Certainly the
military spelled that out in the number
that they provided for the research, de-
velopment, and acquisition of modern
defense systems recommended by our
military leaders.
At the same time, this bill includes
bipartisan provisions that increase our
oversight of the Department’s largest,
most complex, and expensive programs
to protect the taxpayers, support our
troops, and boost American industry.
Overall, this is a thoughtful, care-
fully constructed bill that emphasizes
aggressive, effective oversight for the
development of our country.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.
HARTZLER).
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I
rise to express concerns regarding H.R.
2500, the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2020, specifi-
cally the overall top-line budget for
the Department of Defense that is out-
lined in the bill.
Senior military commanders, includ-
ing General Dunford and Secretary
Mattis, have testified that a 3 to 5 per-
cent real growth in the defense budget
top line is the minimum necessary to
maintain readiness recovery and our
competitive edge over peer adversaries
like Russia and China.
Regrettably, this bill in its current
form reduces the President’s budget re-
quest by $17 billion to achieve an arbi-
trary lower top line.
To reach this lower top line, many
critical modernization and readiness
programs had funding reduced that will
slow our recovery efforts. These pro-
grams include hypersonic munition de-
velopment, precision-guided munitions,
the Air Force Next Generation Air
Dominance program, and F–15C spares
and repair parts.
I am concerned that we are creating
conditions that could prohibit the real-
ization of the National Defense Strat-
egy and impact our ability to project
credible deterrence at a time when we
need it most, given the evolving
threats that we now face.
Mr. Chair, as the ranking member of
the Tactical Air and Land Forces Sub-
committee, I would like to thank our
subcommittee chairman, DONALD NOR-
CROSS, for his leadership and his bipar-
tisanship.
From a policy perspective, I am
pleased with the legislative outcomes
the subcommittee was able to accom-
plish with this bill. For example, the
bill rightfully recognizes the impor-
tance of fifth generation strike fighter
capability and also supports growing
fighter force structure capacity
through strong support for both the F–
15EX and the F–35 programs.
The bill appropriately provides over-
sight on vehicle Active Protection Sys-
tems for combat and tactical vehicles
and authorizes additional funding for
these critically needed systems.
The NDAA has always been a product
of bipartisan consensus, and I hope
that as we go forward with the floor
process, we can reach that level of con-
sensus again.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN), who is the chair of the Intel-
ligence and Emerging Threats and Ca-
pabilities Subcommittee.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I want to
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Today I rise in strong support of the
fiscal year 2020 NDAA, and I would like
to thank Chairman SMITH for his work
on this important legislation.
I am particularly pleased with the
provisions in the bill that were re-
ported out of the Intelligence and
Emerging Threats and Capabilities
Subcommittee, which I chair.
Mr. Chair, I want to also begin by
thanking my subcommittee ranking
member, Ms. STEFANIK, for her con-
tributions to this bill and her bipar-
tisan partnership throughout the proc-
ess.
Befitting our focus on emerging capa-
bilities, this bill provides for additional
investments in cybersecurity as well as
5G technology, and additive manufac-
turing, and supports education pro-
grams to grow the STEM workforce.
Recognizing the challenges of foreign
intelligence services targeting aca-
demic institutions, the bill establishes
a public-private partnership at the Na-
tional Academies to address counter-
intelligence concerns, while maintain-
ing an open and collaborative research
environment.
Provisions are included also to syn-
chronize efforts and leverage best prac-
tices across the Department relating to
network, industrial base, military in-
stallation, and weapon system cyberse-
curity. We strengthen oversight of
military operations in cyber operations
to ensure the administration’s more as-
sertive posture continues to promote
stability in cyberspace.

Several provisions in the bill also re-
flect my priority that Special Oper-
ations Forces remain a professional,
agile, and ready force postured for
high-end missions. In recognition,
though, of the tragic three-fold in-
crease of SOF suicides in 2018, the bill
increases funding for suicide preven-
tion. This bill also maintains a focus
on professionalism and ethics of the
force.
The NDAA places significant empha-
sis on ensuring the Defense Intel-
ligence Enterprise also is oriented to
provide maximum support to Depart-
ment requirements.
The bill also requires more rigorous
reporting on the progress of the Joint
Artificial Intelligence Center and the
technical achievements of Project
Maven.
Further, this legislation includes
critical investments in our submarine
fleet. I hail from the great State of
Rhode Island, and we are deeply proud
of our Nation’s submarines, all of
which start their journey being built at
Quonset Point in my district. Thanks
to the leadership of Congressman JOE
COURTNEY from Connecticut, this
NDAA recognizes the unique contribu-
tions of our undersea vessels, and for
the first time includes a third Virginia-
class submarine.
It also makes sustained investments
in game-changing technologies, like
electromagnetic railgun and directed
energy weapon systems, positioning
our warfighters to continue to domi-
nate the battlefield for decades to
come.
Finally, the fiscal year 2020 NDAA
makes measured investments that re-
flect both our many national security
challenges and the fiscal realities that
we face. It reflects the hard choices
that our constituents demand on us
when spending their tax dollars and it
enhances congressional oversight to
ensure those dollars are used wisely.
Now, I have heard my colleagues
across the aisle decry it as under-
funding the military. Well, I fundamen-
tally disagree.
This is my 17th NDAA, and if this bill
put our troops at risk, I would be the
first to say so and I would not support
it. It does not.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
LANGEVIN).
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, our mili-
tary is the finest in the world, but
there must be accountability and the
Department must live within its
means.
Mr. Chair, I commend Chairman
SMITH for striking an appropriate bal-
ance with this NDAA, and I urge my
colleagues to support it.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITT-
MAN).
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing.
Mr. Chair, I have supported every Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act since
I arrived in Congress 11 years ago.
Unfortunately, in its current form, I
rise in opposition to H.R. 2500, the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2020.
This bill does a number of good
things. Notably, it includes an author-
ization of 11 ships, it reaffirms congres-
sional support for midlife refueling of
the USS John C. Stennis, it robustly
supports the merchant marine with the
reauthorization of the Maritime Secu-
rity Program, and it provides for a new
tanker security program that our serv-
ices need.
In summary, the bill did a good job
with the resources that were provided.
However, due to the decrement of $15
billion from the President’s budget re-
quest, the bill imposed the limitations
on low-yield nuclear weapons, restric-
tions on the President’s request to se-
cure the border, and an entirely avoid-
able failure to adequately restrict the
9/11 detainees. All of these issues led
me to oppose final passage of the
NDAA in committee.
In the Seapower and Projection
Forces Subcommittee, the reduction of
$15 billion will lead to delay in the con-
struction of the next Ford-class air-
craft carrier by 1 year, eliminate a re-
plenishment ship, reduce the Navy’s in-
novation by limiting development of
unmanned surface vessels, and restrict
critical development of anti-mine war-
fare programs.
b 1730
Additionally, this top-line reduction
limited our subcommittee’s flexibility
to address critical shortfalls in am-
phibious ships and weapons. Simply
put, we can do better.
While I am concerned about the en-
tirety of this current bill, I am not
concerned about the bipartisan nature
of our subcommittee. I want to specifi-
cally thank Chairman COURTNEY and
his team for their extraordinary effort
and their leadership toward a bipar-
tisan subcommittee mark. He did ex-
traordinary work reaching across the
aisle and getting everybody’s thoughts
and ideas about what should be in the
subcommittee mark, something that
should also be part of every continuing
effort subsequently. I have no doubt in
his support for our national security,
and I appreciate his dedication and pas-
sion for this effort.
In the end, I am hopeful that our
amendment debate in the following
days will serve to make our bill a
stronger, bipartisan bill. But in its cur-
rent form, I urge my colleagues to op-
pose final passage.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COO-
PER), chairman of the Subcommittee
on Strategic Forces.
Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chairman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, the Strategic Forces Sub-
committee probably has the heaviest
responsibility of any in Congress, or
possibly in the world, because author-
izing nuclear weapons affects the fate
of the Nation and of the planet. I thank
all of our subcommittee members and
our wonderful staff for their hard work
on this bill.
The most important duty of our gov-
ernment is to defend the Nation, and
the number one priority of the Defense
Department is to make sure that we
have safe, secure, reliable, and effec-
tive nuclear weapons. This sub-
committee has a long tradition of bi-
partisanship on these vital issues.
This bill upholds our commitment to
maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent
force. We owe it to our constituents, to
our allies, and to the planet to
strengthen and preserve the remark-
able peace and prosperity that the
world has known for the last 75 years.
As an example, this bill funds the Na-
tional Nuclear Security Administra-
tion at 4.3 percent over last year’s ap-
propriation, which also means a $608
million increase to the NNSA Weapons
Activities programs.
We take steps to reduce the risk of
nuclear miscalculation. This bill denies
President Trump’s request for a new
low-yield nuclear weapon for use on
our nuclear submarines, a request that
would undermine our security.
The last 60 years of nuclear deterrent
strategy were based, in large part, on
the U.S. strategic nuclear submarine
force, that most survivable leg of our
triad, never being used for tactical nu-
clear weapons. Deploying another low-
yield nuclear weapon, of which we have
countless ones and other delivery sys-
tems, is not only unnecessary but a
dangerous policy.
We prioritize a production level of 30
plutonium pits a year and making this
happen as soon as possible by 2026. This
goal alone will be extremely chal-
lenging. We must set up NNSA for suc-
cess.
On arms control treaties, we con-
tinue to be challenged by the adminis-
tration, which continues to try to
upend treaties. This bill supports the
Open Skies Treaty.
Mr. Chair, I look forward to our col-
leagues supporting this important leg-
islation.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I am
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentlewoman from New
York (Ms. STEFANIK).
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I thank
the ranking member for yielding.
First, I thank my colleague and
counterpart, Chairman JIM LANGEVIN,
for his bipartisan work on this bill.
As ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Intelligence and Emerg-
ing Threats and Capabilities, I want to
highlight some broad themes that I am
supportive of in this bill.
First, this bill is active in all areas of
our subcommittee’s jurisdiction. We
continue our focus on emerging tech-
nologies, including manufacturing
technologies that are fundamental to
our advancements and scaling of

hypersonic weapons and directed en-
ergy. We also include an emphasis on
basic research and the important con-
tributions provided by universities and
Department of Defense labs. And we
enhanced capabilities and support for
our Special Operations Forces, includ-
ing additional funds for the Preserva-
tion of the Force and Families pro-
gram.
The bill also extends the National Se-
curity Commission on Artificial Intel-
ligence, which is a provision I spon-
sored in section 1051 of last year’s
NDAA that created this Commission to
advance the development of AI. The
Commission’s recommendations will
help us maintain global leadership in
AI research and prepare our citizens for
an AI-enabled future.
As a second broad theme, this bill
continues the tradition of robust con-
gressional oversight of sensitive mili-
tary operations and activities, includ-
ing cyber, counterterrorism, and intel-
ligence. These are broad, bipartisan
frameworks put in place several years
ago by then-Chairman MAC THORN-
BERRY, as well as myself and sub-
committee Chairman JIM LANGEVIN. I
am pleased that we continue to ad-
vance these frameworks.
As we move forward to debate and
consider this NDAA, we should remind
ourselves of our role in national secu-
rity as a legislative body. It is our
principal responsibility to protect our
homeland and provide our men and
women in uniform the tools and train-
ing they need to safely execute their
dangerous missions on our behalf.
I am very concerned about where our
colleagues in the majority are taking
this bill and whether we are fulfilling
that duty. Despite Ranking Member
THORNBERRY’s hard work in committee
to restore funding to $750 billion, this
bill remains $15 billion short of the rec-
ommendations from former Secretaries
of Defense, current Acting Secretaries
of Defense, and senior military com-
manders.
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentlewoman from New York.
Ms. STEFANIK. With the top-line of
$735 billion, this bill would cut per-
sonnel accounts; limit programs that
deter against great power competition,
such as Russia and China; and severely
regress all the efforts we have put in to
recover readiness from the devastating
blow of sequestration.
While I support portions of this bill,
and I supported this bill in committee,
I am deeply concerned that it is mov-
ing in the wrong direction as this
comes to the floor, that it fails to sup-
port the needs of our men and women
in uniform, and that it does not reflect
longstanding bipartisan tradition.
Mr. Chair, I look forward to a full
and fair debate on these issues, and I
urge my colleagues to consider this
lack of bipartisan support as they de-
cide their vote on the final passage.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.
COURTNEY), the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Seapower and Projection
Forces.
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in
strong support of the 2020 National De-
fense Authorization Act.
As chair of the Seapower and Projec-
tion Forces Subcommittee, I believe
this bill invests in critical priorities
for our Nation in a new era of great
power competition.
On seapower, we responsibly scrubbed
the portions of the President’s budget
request under our jurisdiction and
identified savings that allow us to
smartly provide for the ships, aircraft,
and capabilities our Nation needs.
This bill authorizes a $22 billion ship-
building budget to construct 11 battle
force ships, including three Virginia-
class submarines, three Arleigh Burke
destroyers, one frigate, one LPD am-
phibious ship, one T-AO oiler, and two
salvage and rescue ships.
Also, this bill will statutorily reverse
the administration’s baffling decision
to cancel refueling the carrier USS
Harry S. Truman, which would have
squandered $538 million of sunk costs
already paid for by the American tax-
payers.
Additionally, on sealift, we trans-
lated the urgent testimony from lead-
ers at MARAD into real action by leg-
islating a long-term reauthorization of
the Maritime Security Program, cre-
ating a new tanker security program to
secure our military’s fuel supply, and
establishing a new-build domestic sea-
lift vessel program.
This bill also provides strong support
for our projection forces, including the
KC–46 tanker, the B–21 long-range
bomber, and the B–52 re-engining pro-
gram.
Outside of seapower, the full com-
mittee worked hard to improve quality
of life for servicemembers and their
families. I am pleased that my amend-
ment at committee is included in this
bill, which reverses last year’s callous
DOD order blocking longer term serv-
icemembers’ ability to transfer their
GI Bill benefits to eligible dependents.
This mark would not have been pos-
sible without the work of my friend
and ranking member, ROB WITTMAN;
our subcommittee staff, Phil
MacNaughton, Dave Sienicki, and
Megan Handal; and all our sub-
committee members, particularly our
new members, and their contributions
to this year’s bill.
Overall, I am confident that the bill
we will vote on later this week, which
had significant bipartisan input, will
meet the pressing needs of the sea serv-
ices and protection forces and provide a
historic boost of quality of life that our
All-Volunteer Force deserves. I strong-
ly encourage my colleagues to support
this legislation when it comes to a vote
Friday.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I am
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentleman from Colorado
(Mr. LAMBORN).
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I thank
the ranking member for yielding and
for his leadership.
Mr. Chair, as we consider H.R. 2500,
the 2020 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, it is important to remember
that this bill is about ensuring the men
and women in our Armed Forces and
their families that they have what
they need to defend our great Nation.
We have done well in some respects,
but we have come up regrettably short
in other areas vital to our military.
I am proud of the bipartisan work the
Readiness Subcommittee completed
under the leadership of my friend,
Chairman GARAMENDI. We funded all
MILCON projects on the unfunded re-
quirements lists, prohibited nondisclo-
sure agreements in privatized military
family housing, directed development
of a tenants’ bill of rights, directed
TRANSCOM to do a business case anal-
ysis before awarding a global household
goods contract, and took major steps
to address fluorinated firefighting
foams.
This bill comes to the floor as we
emerge from a dangerous readiness cri-
sis. We have made big strides to rebuild
readiness while also modernizing for
near-peer competitors, but we cannot
move backward now.
Secretary Mattis and General
Dunford said we needed 3 to 5 percent
real growth to keep our competitive
edge against Russia and China. By not
supporting the $750 billion request, we
are not maintaining that edge.
The bill does not support strategic
priorities such as hypersonic and low-
yield weapons, and it fails to fund al-
most $1.5 billion in key readiness ac-
counts. It also failed to fund a high-
value detainee complex at Guantanamo
Bay.
For these reasons, I could not sup-
port final passage of the NDAA out of
committee. I am hopeful that we can
improve the bill in a bipartisan way
through the amendment process. Fail-
ing that, I will urge my colleagues to
vote against final passage.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
GARAMENDI), the chairman of the Read-
iness Subcommittee.
(Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was
given permission to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of this legislation. It is a good
piece of legislation.
I thank Chairman SMITH; Ranking
Member THORNBERRY; and my col-
league, Mr. LAMBORN, for working with
our committee. We worked closely
with members of the committee on and
off to ensure that the bill addresses
four priority areas affecting our mili-
tary.
First, we ask the question: Is the
military ready for climate change? It
is not. In the last 12 months, severe
storms have devastated Marine Corps

Base Camp Lejeune, Marine Corps Air
Station Cherry Point, Tyndall Air
Force Base, and Offutt Air Force Base.
This NDAA will accelerate and enhance
readiness by requiring the Department
of Defense to plan for and respond to
the threat that climate change poses to
military installations and operations.
Second, the bill includes a number of
bipartisan provisions aimed at address-
ing problems associated with the man-
agement and oversight of military
housing for families.
Third, the bill authorizes additional
funding and includes bipartisan provi-
sions to mitigate drinking water con-
tamination resulting from fluorinated
compounds used in military installa-
tions.
Fourth, the bill continues to uphold
the committee’s responsibility to con-
duct oversight of, and provide support
for, military training maintenance and
infrastructure. For example, the mark
authorizes $256.4 billion, an $8.8 billion
increase over fiscal year 2019 author-
ized levels, for operation and mainte-
nance accounts. This includes an addi-
tional $834 million to address sub-
marine and surface ship maintenance
shortfalls and an additional $309 mil-
lion for the Air Force weapon systems
sustainment accounts. It also includes
$11.5 billion for military construction,
family housing, and implementation of
previous Base Realignment and Closure
activities.
This includes $168 million above the
budget request for construction
projects associated with the European
Deterrence Initiative and authorizes 31
additional programs.
Mr. Chair, today I rise in support of the fis-
cal year 2020 National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA). I would like to start by thanking
Chairman SMITH and the House Armed Serv-
ices Committee staff who have worked many
long nights putting together this year’s NDAA.
The bill that is before the House is a good bill
and I encourage my colleagues to support its
passage.
As the Chairman of the Readiness Sub-
committee, I worked closely with members on
and off the committee to ensure the bill ad-
dressed three priority areas affecting our mili-
tary. First, the bill includes a number of bipar-
tisan provisions aimed at addressing problems
associated with the management and over-
sight of military family housing. The bill does
the following:
Requires the military services to establish a
tenants’ bill of rights for residents of privatized
military family housing;
Requires the Secretary of Defense to de-
velop an assessment tool to identify and
measure health and safety hazards in hous-
ing;
Prohibits the use of non-disclosure agree-
ments in connection with entering into, con-
tinuing, or terminating a lease for on-base mili-
tary housing;
Authorizes an additional $140.8 million to
hire additional civilian personnel to improve
oversight and management of military family
housing; and
Creates a public database for complaints re-
lated to military housing, requires annual fi-
nancial audits of randomly selected privatized
military family housing, and annual congres-
sional reports on the condition, maintenance,
and management of privatized military family
housing.
Second, the bill authorizes additional fund-
ing and includes bipartisan provisions to miti-
gate drinking water contamination resulting
from fluorinated compounds around military in-
stallations:
Prohibits the release of fluorinated fire-
fighting foam (AFFF) at military installations
except in cases of emergency response or in
limited circumstances;
Requires the Secretary of Navy to complete
a new military specification by January 2025
for a fluorine free firefighting agent to be used
at all DoD installations and a complete ban on
fluorinated foams on military installations by
September 2029, or sooner if possible;
Authorizes the National Guard to access
Defense Environmental Remediation Account
funds, for five years, for the limited purpose of
addressing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Sub-
stances (PFAS) exposure and contamination;
Prohibits the use of fluorinated AFFF in
training exercises and encourages the Depart-
ment to ensure adequate training for individ-
uals in regular contact with AFFF about the
potential dangers associated with PFAS;
Requires a report on the Department’s un-
derstanding of best-practices for cleanup and
disposal of PFAS;
Provides an additional $121.3 million in en-
vironmental restoration accounts for remedi-
ation activities related to perfluorinated chemi-
cals in drinking water on or near military instal-
lations; and
Authorizes DoD to provide fresh water and
treatment of contaminated water for agricul-
tural purposes adjacent to a military installa-
tion where water is contaminated due to mili-
tary activities.
Third, the bill contains a number of sensible
provisions requiring the Department of De-
fense to plan for and respond to the threat
that climate change poses to military installa-
tions and military operations:
Requires DoD to develop installation master
plans that assess current climate
vulnerabilities and plan for mitigating the risks;
Limits DoD’s ability to spend planning and
design funds until it initiates the process of
amending the building standards for military
construction to ensure that building practices
and standards promote energy, climate, and
cyber resilience at military installations;
Requires all proposals for military construc-
tion projects to consider potential long-term
changes in environmental conditions, and in-
creasingly frequent extreme weather events,
as well as, industry best-practices to withstand
extreme weather events;
Authorizes an additional $40 million for the
Department’s Energy Resilience and Con-
servation Investment Program; and
Directs the Secretary of Defense to develop
a climate vulnerability and risk assessment
tool to assist in providing standardized risk
calculations of climate-related impacts to mili-
tary installations and capabilities.
Further, the bill also includes important pro-
visions to reform border deployment and en-
sure funding for our military is spent wisely
and as Congress intended, and not on an un-
necessary border wall:
It prevents the President from diverting De-
fense funding to pay for an unnecessary bor-
der wall;
Includes a blanket prohibition on funding for
the construction of a wall, barrier, or fence
along the southern land border;
Prohibits reprogramming of funds into the
counter drug account, which has been used
by the Administration to do construction along
the southern land border;
Does not include the $7.2 billion requested
by the Administration to backfill MILCON
projects and/or forward fund portions of the
wall;
Modifies an authority the DoD uses when
deploying active duty personnel to the border
to require all support to be reimbursable and
require a wavier that the deployment won’t af-
fect readiness, the support task aligns with the
unit’s mission, the task is inherently govern-
ment and can’t be contracted; and
Amends the emergency construction author-
ity (10 USC 2808) to limit the total cost of mili-
tary construction projects undertaken during a
national emergency to $500 million, with a fur-
ther limit of $100 million for construction
projects within the United States and would
add elements to required congressional notifi-
cations.
In addition, the bill continues to uphold the
committee’s responsibility to conduct oversight
of, and provide support for, military training,
maintenance, and infrastructure. For example,
the mark authorizes $256.4 billion, an $8.8 bil-
lion increase over fiscal year 2019 authorized
levels, for operation and maintenance ac-
counts. This includes an additional $834 mil-
lion to address submarine and surface ship
maintenance shortfalls and an additional $309
million for Air Force weapon systems
sustainment accounts. The mark also included
$11.5 billion for military construction, family
housing, and implementation of previous Base
Realignment and Closure activities. This in-
cludes $168.6 million above the budget re-
quest for construction projects associated with
the European Deterrence Initiative and author-
ization for 31 additional construction projects
valued at over $1 billion, that were not in-
cluded in the budget request, but that the
committee were able to accelerate from the
military departments’ unfunded priority lists.
Additionally, this year’s NDAA funds impor-
tant priorities at Travis and Beale Air Force
Bases in my district. The military construction
projects authorized in this bill will support the
new KC–46 mission at Travis Air Force Base
and will improve resilience and power supply
at Beale Air Force Base, enabling it to con-
tinue to support intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) and multidomain oper-
ations.
I’m proud of the funding authorized by, and
legislative provisions included in the Readi-
ness mark. I believe the mark ensures Con-
gress fulfills its oversight responsibilities, helps
advance our military’s near-term readiness
goals, and drives the Department to plan for
and take action against long-term threats.
I’m also pleased this NDAA includes a 3.1
percent pay raise for our troops and includes
the text of my bill, H.R. 2617, the Occupa-
tional and Environmental Transparency Health
Act. This will require DoD to input any Occu-
pational Environmental Health hazards expo-
sure into servicemembers’ records while de-
ployed, so it is tracked throughout their career
and into veteran status. It will also require the
VA to retroactively update records based on
information contained in the Burn Pit Registry,
since many veterans’ health records do not
account for their exposures.

Additional provisions I’m pleased are in-
cluded in the fiscal year 2020 NDAA are in-
cluded below, many of which are related to
the critical oversight the Strategic Forces Sub-
committee is conducting over our nuclear
weapons enterprise:
Requires a report from the Secretary of De-
fense on military-to-military dialogue with for-
eign countries to reduce the risk of miscalcula-
tion, unintended consequences, or accidents
that could precipitate a nuclear war;
Prohibits funding for the deployment of new,
low-yield nuclear missile warheads;
Clarifies the Defense Nuclear Facilities
Safety Board’s authorities by providing prompt
and unfettered access to defense nuclear fa-
cilities for independent nuclear oversight;
Facilitates implementation of the Open
Skies Treaty and prohibits funding for with-
drawal unless Russia is in material breach or
DoD and State provide a certification that with-
drawal is in the best interest of national secu-
rity and have consulted with U.S. allies;
Increases funding for Nuclear Command,
Control and Communications.
Repeals the requirement to demonstrate
plutonium pit production of at a rate of 80 pits
per year by 2027, and instead prioritizes pro-
ducing 30 plutonium pits per year by 2026;
Until the National Nuclear Security Adminis-
trator submits an analysis of alternatives with
respect to replacing the ICBM W78 warhead,
this bill cuts $103 million from the Ground-
Based Strategic Deterrent, cuts $59 million
from the related warhead, and fences remain-
ing funding for the warhead;
Requires an independent technical study of
the W78 replacement and potential problems;
and
Repeals the conventional requirement for
the Long Range Stand Off Weapon.
I’m proud of the hard work that’s been done
to put together a strong National Defense Au-
thorization Act this year, and I urge my col-
leagues to support the fiscal year 2020 NDAA.

Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.
KELLY).
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise to express concerns with
the FY20 NDAA in its current form.
Specifically, I am concerned with the
plan to cut $15 billion from the top line
requested by the President and, more
specifically, $1.2 billion from the Presi-
dent’s request for military personnel
accounts.
I spent 33 years in uniform serving
the Nation but can’t support this bill
in its current form without changes to
the amendment process. While it is
true that personnel accounts have his-
torically had money left over at the
end of the year, several factors will
likely make fiscal year 2020 different.
Over the last few years, there have
been funds left over associated with the
transition to the new military-blended
retirement system because fewer serv-
icemembers are opting into the new re-
tirement system than expected. How-
ever, the opt-in period ends this year,
so there will be no leftover funds re-
lated to this in FY 2020.
Also, in fiscal year 2019, the Army
will likely fall short of its end strength
goals by approximately 9,500 troops,
which will result in excess funds for
2019 because fewer troops came into the
Army. However, the Army is likely to
meet their comparatively modest end
strength goal of FY 2020, so there will
likely be no excess funds relating to
end strength.
Finally, the 3.1 percent automatic
pay raise and the proposed increase in
total force end strength means that
personnel costs will increase, not go
down.
In sum, there is likely to be no excess
funding in the military personnel ac-
counts in FY 2020.
In addition, given the provisions in
this bill that would greatly restrict re-
programming authority, I am con-
cerned that, if personnel accounts are
underfunded, the Department may not
have sufficient transfer authority to
reprogram funds to fix it.
There are more important provisions
in this bill, and I particularly want to
thank Chairwoman SPEIER for her
work in arriving at a bipartisan sub-
committee mark. Specifically, the bill
would provide important end strength
increases and provide additional bene-
fits for military spouses seeking em-
ployment.
In closing, I want to thank Ranking
Member THORNBERRY and Chairman
SMITH for their leadership. I am com-
mitted to continuing to work with my
colleagues in a bipartisan manner to
improve this bill which is so important
for our troops and their families.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
I would simply note that, in last
year’s NDAA, when the Republicans
were in charge, they cut $751 million
from the personnel account, and then
the President, 6 months after that,
took another $1 billion out of the per-
sonnel account to fund his wall.
So, in last year’s NDAA, which all of
them enthusiastically supported, the
personnel account was cut by $1.7 bil-
lion. We do not simply rubber-stamp
the President’s request and never have.
What we are doing this year is per-
fectly in keeping with past history.
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. SPEIER), the chair
of the Military Personnel Sub-
committee.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I am
proud to speak in support of this bipar-
tisan bill that contains the priorities of
both parties. And while it wasn’t unan-
imous, it does nothing to change our
responsibilities to give military mem-
bers and families bipartisan support.
We did that in the Military Personnel
Subcommittee, and I thank Ranking
Member KELLY for his work.
This bill contains two landmark
achievements for our servicemembers
and their families. It institutes a com-
prehensive fix to the festering problem
of the so-called widow’s tax, ensuring
that surviving widows or widowers
won’t have their DOD and VA benefits
offset.
I was once a widow. I know the pain
and the emptiness. We must take care
of the spouses who sacrifice so much
for our Nation.
This bill rectifies a grievous denial of
rights to servicemembers who are vic-
tims of malpractice at military med-
ical facilities by allowing Active-Duty
servicemembers to sue the Department
for malpractice. For more than a half
century, those who put their lives on
the line have had fewer legal rights to
sue for malpractice than prisoners in
Federal prisons.
This bill moves the ball forward on
other personnel priorities by funding a
3.1 percent pay raise; shortening
childcare backlogs; improving sexual
assault prevention and response, in-
cluding at the service academies; pro-
moting spousal employment; creating a
housing ombudsman; and giving
TRICARE beneficiaries the same con-
traception coverage benefits as all
other Americans.
The bill also provides a historic 12
weeks of family and medical leave to
Federal employees and congressional
staff.
Mr. Chairman, we owe servicemem-
bers and their families. We owe them
this important set of benefits.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the
distinguished gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. TURNER).
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I am
disappointed by the fiscal year 2020 Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act that
is offered here on the floor today. This
bill represents a significant deviation
from our past sentiment of bipartisan-
ship.
Now, the Senate has passed their bill
by 86 votes, but not the House, not this
year. This bill, in its totality, makes
us less safe, which is why it does not
have bipartisan support on this floor.
Chairman SMITH said that we were
able to negotiate through a few things,
and that is right. But there are also
some that we were not, and one of
them is a big one, and it is why there
is not one Republican who voted in the
Subcommittee on Strategic Forces for
the bill to come out of subcommittee,
and not one Republican in the full com-
mittee voted for the Strategic Forces
portion of this bill to be referred to the
full committee and to this floor.
That is because it contains a provi-
sion that can only be described as uni-
lateral nuclear disarmament. It is uni-
lateral because it does not involve any-
body else; it only inhibits us. It is nu-
clear because it involves our nuclear
weapons; and it is disarmament be-
cause it recalls a nuclear weapon.
It prohibits the use of funds for the
deployment of low-yield ballistic mis-
sile warheads that have already been
funded and produced and are to be de-
ployed on a bipartisan basis. Efforts by
Congress to recall these assets from de-
ployment is unilateral disarmament.
Now, even if you are against nuclear
weapons, you should be against the

other side having nuclear weapons, and
that means that you should be pur-
suing restrictions by treaty.
Imagine how this conversation is
going to go in Moscow. Someone in the
Kremlin is going to walk into Vladimir
Putin’s office, and they are going to
say: Vlad, you have modernized our nu-
clear weapons. You have invaded our
neighbors. You have threatened the
U.S. and our adversaries and their al-
lies. And now, the U.S. Congress has
just voted to unilaterally pull the low-
yield nuclear weapon that was sched-
uled for deployment.
Putin is not going to believe them.
He is going to think that this is a joke,
because no one would believe that the
United States Congress in the National
Defense Authorization Act would re-
ward Russian aggression in this bill by
pursuing unilateral nuclear disar-
mament.
I am comforted that many of these
provisions will never become law. I
never thought I would say this, but I
am going to: Thank God for the Sen-
ate.
I encourage my colleagues to oppose
this bill and oppose unilateral nuclear
disarmament.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
It is a unique way of looking at the
world to describe a nation that has lit-
erally thousands of nuclear weapons as
unilaterally disarming. I assure the
public, we are not doing that.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
BROWN), a member of the committee.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank Chairman SMITH for un-
precedented bipartisanship in bringing
this bill to the floor.
This year’s NDAA provides the stra-
tegic funding we need to maintain a ro-
bust military that can tackle our glob-
al challenges, reversing the President’s
soft stance on Russia by bolstering the
European Deterrence Initiative with
our NATO allies, and collaborating
with our allies to contain North Korea
and counter China’s expansionist
moves throughout the Indo-Pacific.
It makes greater investments in
training, equipping, and providing for
our Armed Forces, funding a 3.1 per-
cent pay raise for servicemembers, the
largest in a decade.
In this year’s NDAA, we have the op-
portunity to increase research capacity
for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities. We empower the Depart-
ment of Defense to identify the scope
of white nationalism, extremism, and
violent misogyny in the military, and
we pursue a new diversity and inclu-
sion strategy within the DOD to ensure
minorities are more fully represented
in our officer corps.
We also rise to the challenge set
forth before us and reverse some of the
administration’s worst policy deci-
sions. We deny the increase of low-
yield nuclear warheads that would
lower the threshold for nuclear war. We
prevent the President’s use of the mili-
tary as a piggy bank for his border
wall.
With additional amendments, we will
allow transgender Americans to openly
and honorably serve our country in
uniform, and we will ensure that the
President cannot put us on the path to
war without congressional approval.
It is clear that we will pass, perhaps,
the most progressive and robust de-
fense authorization in years, and I am
proud to support it.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
am pleased to yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
BERGMAN), a general new to the com-
mittee, but not new to national secu-
rity.
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today with disappointment. What was
once a bipartisan bill is now a vehicle
for policies that hinder our readiness
and our defense capabilities.
For almost 60 years, the NDAA has
been a bipartisan endeavor. The NDAA
fulfills the number one role of Con-
gress: to provide for our common de-
fense. But House Democratic leader-
ship has turned this into yet another
partisan bill.
Let me be clear. I support a pay raise
for our troops. I support providing all
warfighters with the best resources
available and a National Defense Au-
thorization Act that empowers Amer-
ica and our allies. But, unfortunately,
this bill, in its current form, poses a
significant threat to our ability to
carry out the national defense strategy
now and in the years ahead.
As President Reagan often said of our
national defense strategy, ‘‘Peace
through strength.’’ This bill does not—
I repeat, does not—show strength. We
can and must do better.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I am pleased to yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN), a member of
the Armed Services Committee.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in support of the NDAA.
I want to thank Chairman SMITH, the
entire committee, Members on the
other side of the aisle, and staff on the
other side of the aisle.
Funding our national defense is and
should always be a bipartisan priority.
We have created a bill that is strong on
defense and stays true to our values as
a country. This bill includes important
provisions that all Americans can get
behind:
It funds our military at the highest
levels in history and ensures the readi-
ness of our forces;
It includes a 3.1 percent pay raise for
our servicemembers;
It strengthens provisions to combat
foreign information operations, pro-
tecting us from foreign adversaries
that wish us harm;
It enhances our military’s resilience
to climate change, which poses a grow-
ing threat to national security; and
It ensures protections for military
families.
As a former Pentagon official, as an
Army wife with a stepdaughter serving
on Active Duty right now, I firmly be-
lieve that we have a solemn responsi-
bility to our men and women to pass a
bill that funds our military. Failure to
do so, despite concerns about certain
provisions, would be an abdication of
that responsibility.
This bill also funds priorities that
are important to the economies and
the safety of our local communities
and our districts. I fought hard to in-
clude provisions that directly impact
my community in Michigan and com-
munities like ours across the country.
The NDAA will reduce PFAS con-
tamination by phasing out the fire-
fighting foam with PFAS chemicals
and ask the Pentagon to come up with
a plan of action on how they plan to
transition and clean up PFAS sites.
This NDAA includes provisions that
help States like Michigan capitalize on
our unique capabilities in autos, cyber,
robotics, and software to help fuel in-
novation at the Defense Department.
I urge my colleagues to support this
bill.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
am pleased to yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.
DESJARLAIS).
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing.
Mr. Chair, I rise to express my con-
cern and frustration with this bill in
its current form. While I appreciate the
work done on this NDAA, the legisla-
tion simply doesn’t provide our mili-
tary men and women with the re-
sources needed to adequately protect
the homeland and could negatively im-
pact facilities in and around the
Fourth District of Tennessee, including
Arnold Air Force Base, Redstone Arse-
nal, Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
and the Y–12 National Security Com-
plex.
Whether it be refusing to deploy the
W76–2 tactical nuclear weapon to deter
Russian aggression or underprioritizing
funding for research and development
of next-generation capabilities, such as
hypersonic weapons and directed en-
ergy, this NDAA does not adequately
meet the requirements for addressing
challenges posed from our adversaries.
b 1800
Finally, this NDAA highlights my
colleagues’ continuing disregard for
the national emergency occurring at
our southern border. This bill prevents
the DOD from playing a role in ad-
dressing the crisis. Our military’s num-
ber one responsibility is to protect the
homeland. If my Democratic colleagues
refuse to provide funding for DHS to
secure the border, then the military
must have a role.
Mr. Chairman, this bill, from its
funding top line to its policy, does not
support our military or our security
appropriately. For that reason, I can-
not support this bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’

Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
ESCOBAR), who is a member of the com-
mittee.
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Chairman, I am
proud to have helped craft this year’s
National Defense Authorization Act.
This fiscal year 2020 bill incorporates
ideas from both sides of the aisle to de-
liver essential support and a pay raise
to our deserving men and women in
uniform.
Our bill authorizes $733 billion to pro-
vide for a smart and robust national
defense, enhances housing and finan-
cial support for military families, and
addresses operational and budgetary
threats posed by climate change.
I was pleased to share with my
Armed Services Committee colleagues
the innovative work happening in dis-
tricts like mine which are home to
some of the military’s core training in-
stallations. This includes Fort Bliss’
leadership on net-zero energy and on-
going partnership with the VA that im-
proves soldiers’ medical expertise,
while also serving our local veterans.
I was proud to support our vibrant El
Paso community by advancing a com-
munity infrastructure support program
and ensuring promising technologies
like additive manufacturing, and the
unique contributions of our small busi-
nesses that always have a place in
building our national defense.
Finally, our bill enhances diversity
and inclusion efforts in our armed serv-
ices, improves oversight and account-
ability of DOD support to DHS and,
yes, blocks the President from robbing
finite military resources for a wall that
our military never requested.
This is a bill we can all be proud of.
I look forward to casting my vote in
support.
Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman
for his leadership, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it as well.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCH-
ELL).
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Chairman, I
thank Mr. THORNBERRY for yielding me
time.
It has been a pleasure to be on two
committees that have historically been
bipartisan, the House Armed Services
and Transportation and Infrastructure.
As was indicated, historically this has
been a bipartisan bill. Last year it
passed out of committee with one ‘‘no’’
vote. The Senate achieved it. It passed
the Senate Armed Services Committee
unanimously, and it passed the Senate
86–8.
Yet, here we stand because, Mr.
Chairman, bipartisanship is not simply
counting percentages of amendments
that were brought to the floor and
passed.
There are significant issues that we
are not dealing with in this bill. While
we give people an additional pay raise,
a significant raise to military, we cut
funding that impacts modernization,
readiness and training, and cuts mili-
tary funding $1.2 billion.
Further, the bill neglects to address
something that has had bipartisan sup-
port for a long period of time which is
nuclear readiness, our nuclear triad.
Here we take a hatchet to it as well.
I stress that we must make a bipar-
tisan effort to bring a bill to this floor
that supports our military consistently
and not have partisan politics take
over our military. I support that, I re-
ject this bill, and I urge my colleagues
to do the same.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the dis-
tinguished gentleman from Maryland
(Mr. HOYER), who is the majority lead-
er.
Mr. HOYER. Congratulations, Chair-
man SMITH, on bringing to the floor an
excellent bill. I want to also congratu-
late Mr. THORNBERRY from Texas, a re-
sponsible Member of this Congress, a
responsible member of the minority,
and a person who has been a strong
voice on behalf of national defense.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-
port of this year’s defense authoriza-
tion bill. It makes smart, strategic in-
vestments in our military to keep
America safe and defend our interests
overseas, and it reflects core values.
We are proud to fund the Department
of Defense. I have been in this body for
some 38 years. I have supported every
Defense bill. Now, when I say that,
very frankly, we have had some polit-
ical fights back and forth and there
have been political votes cast where we
thought that there were things being
done that shouldn’t be done. But I have
supported a strong national defense. I
supported most of Ronald Reagan’s
build-up which was, by the way, started
by Jimmy Carter.
I have supported making sure that
we had weapons we needed and the per-
sonnel we needed.
We are proud as Democrats to stand
behind our men and women in uniform.
As a matter of fact, some of the great
victories of democracy have been led
by people like Woodrow Wilson in
World War I, Franklin Roosevelt in
World War II, Harry Truman in Korea,
and John Kennedy confronting com-
munism and authoritarianism, the peo-
ple who want to rule by armed might.
This bill, the first written by a
Democratic majority in 8 years, raises
military pay by 3.1 percent and recog-
nizes the contribution of our men and
women in uniform. It supports a
stronger military by prohibiting fund-
ing for discrimination against
transgender, that denies us the talents
and courageous service of patriotic
Americans.
Now, that has happened before, and
Harry Truman stepped in and said
that, no, we are not going to segregate
our services. We are not going to dis-
criminate against those of color in our
services. He said that in the 1940s, post-
World War. And there were some who
said that would destroy our military
effectiveness. They are saying the same
thing about gays and transgender.
They were wrong then; they are wrong
now.
This bill cuts $17 billion. The chair-
man, the ranking member, and I had
discussions through the years. We need
to make sure that we spend our money
smartly and not just blindly spend
money. We need to make sure that
every dollar is spent effectively, but
that our national security is not in any
way undermined. I believe the savings
that have been effected are focused and
that we are taking that money and
using it for effective items and taking
it away from an expensive and ineffec-
tive wall on the southern border that
the President wants to spend money
on.
It also acknowledges the serious na-
tional security challenges posed by cli-
mate change. Surely, we know how
critical to our national security the ef-
fects of climate change are showing.
We experienced that just the other day
here in Washington, D.C.
It requires the Pentagon to develop a
plan, along with others in our govern-
ment, as to how we can confront, effec-
tively and on behalf of our national se-
curity, climate change.
This bill also accelerates the clo-
sure—long overdue—it is not the Amer-
ican way to hold people without find-
ing out whether they are, in fact,
guilty or not. I have been to Guanta-
namo. Nobody in America ought to
talk about how much it costs to incar-
cerate somebody in America, because
it is about one-tenth or one-twentieth
of what it is costing us in Guantanamo.
You talk about fiscal responsibility.
I am deeply disappointed that my Re-
publican friends are bucking a long tra-
dition. I did not like everything in
your Defense bill. I disagreed sincerely
with some of the provisions that you
put in your Defense bill, and I voted for
the Defense bills you offered on this
floor because I thought they were in
the best interests of our country—not
perfect—but in the best interests of our
country, of our military, and of our na-
tional security.
I am sorry that that is not happening
today or tomorrow or Friday when we
vote on it. This bill ought to have bi-
partisan support. It ought to have bi-
partisan support for our military, and
if the situations were reversed, my Re-
publican colleagues would be accusing
Democrats of not supporting our na-
tional security, not supporting our
troops, not supporting the men and
women who are put at the point of a
spear, in harm’s way, many paying the
ultimate price. That is what you would
have accused us of.
How sad it is that some in this House
are choosing loyalty to the President
and their party over a common com-
mitment to our troops—tough words,
but I think true. Republicans object to
this bill because they claim it does not
meet their demands for $750 billion.
Until March of this year, however, they
were demanding exactly the number in
this bill. Some on my side of the aisle

H5350 July 10, 2019
think this sum is too high. Mr. SMITH,
the Speaker, and I urged our colleagues
to adopt this number because it was a
bipartisan number—not the perfect
number.
More than 70 Republican Members
out of your 194 wrote to the President
citing the same number as their pre-
ferred figure for defense investment.
That is the number the Pentagon used
for the previous year around which it
built its budget.
That is what Joseph Dunford—Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen-
eral Dunford, said was the number the
Pentagon needed ‘‘after scrubbing
every account,’’ $733 billion. That is
the figure we included in this bill. That
is the figure that you are prepared to
vote against.
Ranking Member THORNBERRY, who
is my friend and whom I respect and
whom I have just spoken of, penned an
op-ed that President Trump must
‘‘move forward with the $733 billion
budget he originally proposed for 2020.’’
We took your number, and, yes, there
are some things you don’t agree with
in this bill, but there were things we
didn’t agree with. Very frankly, there
are very few bills that we consider on
this floor that I agree with 100 percent.
But we are a democratic body. We are
a collective, collegial body, and we try
to reach consensus.
We took your number. We took the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff’s
number. Indeed, at the same time that
Republicans are arguing that $733 bil-
lion isn’t enough, the White House is
calling for a continuing resolution that
spends far less. A former Member of
this body originally suggested seques-
ter which would devastate our national
security and our domestic security.
As Chairman ADAM SMITH has stated,
to claim that $733 billion is an abdica-
tion of our responsibility to fund our
troops is patently ridiculous and con-
trary to the representations that have
been made on your side of the aisle.
They claim this bill is partisan. That
is absurd. The bill includes more than
53 percent of the amendments offered
by Republican Members—a higher fig-
ure than Democratic amendments in
the bill. Chairman SMITH’s staff worked
tirelessly and collegially with Repub-
licans for months to ensure that the
defense authorization bill would be bi-
partisan as this legislation has been
historically.
Of course, there are provisions in this
bill with which Republicans disagree. I
would be shocked if that were not the
case. There are probably going to be
some provisions in there that I dis-
agree with. That doesn’t mean they
should vote against this entire bill,
however, Mr. Chairman. Democrats
supported this bill when we were in the
minority over the last 8 years—check
the record—even when Republicans
forced controversial measures into it
because we believed it was important
to support our military. We voted for it
over serious objections on policy be-
cause we viewed it as a must-pass bill.
Where has that bipartisanship on na-
tional security gone?
Is it just a strategy to defeat this
bill?
I am convinced that we are going to
have 218-plus Democrats vote for this
bill, Mr. Chairman. I urge my Repub-
lican colleagues to reconsider their op-
position and vote for their number and
put country over party.
To my Democratic colleagues, I say:
This is a strong Defense bill, as good as
you are going to get. It protects LGBT
rights and advances family leave. It
loosens the heinous restrictions on
transferring prisoners from Guanta-
namo Bay. Opposing this bill means we
will be stuck with a Senate version
that omits these provisions.
I thank Chairman SMITH and mem-
bers of the Armed Services Committee
for their hard work, and I thank the
ranking member. I congratulate you
both on producing a very strong, very
positive bill. You did that together.
Do not abandon your work. I hope
that it will pass with resounding sup-
port from both sides of the aisle. Our
troops in harm’s way deserve that af-
firmation, that trust, that faith, that
commitment. Let’s not let them down.
The CHAIR. Members are reminded
to address their remarks to the Chair.
b 1815
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself 2 minutes.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the re-
marks of the majority leader. I know
from some personal experience it is
certainly not easy to hold your side of
the aisle and the other side of the aisle
together to have the sort of votes like
we had—351, 349, and so forth—to pass
this bill.
That is part of the reason I began my
remarks by pointing out this is dif-
ferent. I am not sure that great Demo-
crats of the past—Roosevelt, Truman,
and Kennedy—would recognize this de-
fense bill that is before us, much less
the amendments that we see coming
down the pike.
I just want to emphasize two points,
briefly:
One, is we have lots of quotes being
thrown around here about what Gen-
eral Dunford has said or what he has
not said. I don’t have his words from a
transcript, but what I do have is De-
fense News, June 13, 2017, where he
says, directly: ‘‘We now know that con-
tinued growth in the base budget of at
least 3 percent above inflation is the
floor necessary to preserve just the
competitive advantage we have today,
and we can’t assume our adversaries
will remain still.’’
Consistent testimony from Dunford,
Mattis, Shanahan, et cetera, is that
the floor is 3 percent, and I think state-
ments to the contrary do not reflect
his view.
Secondly, the majority leader said
something like: Loyalty to the Presi-
dent over loyalty to our troops.
I want to quote back Chairman
SMITH’s comments that I mentioned
earlier, and expand a bit.
Chairman SMITH said, when he voted
against the bill on the floor: ‘‘There is
nothing shameful about making a le-
gitimate policy choice to oppose the
NDAA or any other bill. But it is hypo-
critical and the height of shameless
partisan pandering for him’’—and he
was referring to Speaker Boehner—‘‘to
now claim that a vote against the
NDAA is a vote against the troops. It is
not. Regardless of whether you support
the NDAA or not, we all support the
brave men and women of the military
who defend this country.’’
I think this side of the aisle, we have
nothing to apologize for in our support
of the troops and American national
security. We want a better product,
and I hope that at some point we will
get it.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
may I inquire as to how much time
each side has remaining.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Washington has 5 minutes remaining.
The gentleman from Texas has 3 3⁄4
quarter minutes remaining.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I am the only remaining speaker at
this point, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
am pleased to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the
distinguished gentleman from Florida
(Mr. WALTZ).
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Chairman, with 23
years of service as a Green Beret, as a
special operator with tours in the
White House and the Pentagon, I can
assure my colleagues that my primary
focus is the Floridians I represent and
the troops downrange.
There are many things that I support
in this bill: support and greater bene-
fits for Gold Star families—although
some of those recently introduced are
not fully funded; restricting additional
contracting with the Maduro regime;
fully authorizing the Navy’s anti-sub-
marine warfare capability; and, of
course, the emerging Space Corps.
But I would describe this bill is, in
many ways, necessary, but in a whole,
not sufficient, particularly in seeking
to close Guantanamo Bay without suf-
ficient alternatives that previous ad-
ministrations and Congresses have all,
I think, sought to do in good faith;
tying the President’s hands in pro-
tecting the border and on Iran; and, of
course, a wholly insufficient top line,
as we have discussed here today, to
deal with the global threat that re-
mains on terrorism, to deal with China,
to deal with Russia, Iran, North Korea,
and other near-peer threats.
Mr. Chairman, I hope this bill im-
proves, sincerely, with amendments on
the floor to be worthy of the men and
women downrange defending this great
country.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman,
may I inquire of the chairman if he has
only one more speaker remaining.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5351
July 10, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I have one more speaker,
and then I will be prepared to close.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
I would simply emphasize, as the gen-
tleman from Florida just did, the
strong desire of Members on this side
of the aisle is to continue to work con-
structively with anyone who wants to
work with us to help improve this bill
so that it strengthens America’s na-
tional security and does not take steps
backwards in any critical area.
As was pointed out earlier, the body
across the Capitol was able to do that
with a very strong vote of 86–8 just 2
weeks ago. I think that ought to be our
model. I think that this bill, if it
moves in that direction, will gain the
support of a number of Members here.
But it is the real substantive con-
cerns about what is in this bill, as well
as the lack of the ability to have
amendments to improve the bill, that
has so many Members on this side of
the aisle concerned.
Back to my original point: None of
this to-ing and fro-ing matters. What
matters is does it support our troops
and improve America’s national secu-
rity. We may have different judgments,
but that is the only criteria that mat-
ters. It is about them, and it is about
the country, and that will continue to
be our guiding standard.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chair, I would start on a note of
agreement. I stand by the comments I
made in 2016: Voting against the de-
fense bill doesn’t mean you don’t sup-
port the troops.
Now, it is interesting, as we go back
to the transcript from 2016, the number
of folks on their side of the aisle who
said the exact opposite, who rather
passionately said we were betraying
our country by not supporting the bill.
I didn’t agree with that then, and I
don’t agree with it now.
But the only partisanship that is
going on on this floor is coming 100
percent from the Republican Party. I
appreciate the gentleman’s words, and
I worked very well with him as the
ranking member. I continue to work
well with him. But on the statement
about how the Republican side of the
aisle stands ready to work with us to
make this bill better, I have seen no
evidence of that.
Talking about amendments on the
floor, the decision to oppose this bill
was made in committee before we even
got to the floor, and what we are hear-
ing is a whole series of excuses for why
they are opposing the bill.
It is very simple and straightforward
why they are opposing the bill: pure
partisanship. They keep talking about
the number of times the Democrats
voted with them and how this is dif-
ferent, yet the difference is the Repub-
lican Party has decided that, if it is
not their defense bill 100 percent, they
will not vote for it, and then they will
stand up and accuse us of being par-
tisan.
The reason I cite all of those num-
bers is that all of the outreach and ef-
fort we did to make this bill bipartisan,
they did not reach back. This is pure
partisanship: If we are in charge, they
are not going to support it to try to
make us look bad.
And the to-ing and fro-ing matters,
because that is what guts the biparti-
sanship. If they will not even try to
work with us if they are not in charge,
that is the definition of partisanship,
and it jeopardizes 58 years of history.
I am not going to give up; I am going
to keep trying to reach out and keep
trying to work with them. But, please,
for those of you watching this, under-
stand the only partisan thing going on
here is, if the Republicans aren’t in
charge, they are not going to vote for
it. And I will pick just a couple of ex-
amples.
We heard that we have taken a
hatchet to the nuclear budget, so I am
sure you are wondering how much we
have cut the nuclear budget by. Well,
we have increased it by 4 percent. That
is taking a hatchet to it?
We are engaged, believe it or not, in
unilateral disarmament on the floor of
this House as we increase the amount
of money that we spend on nuclear
weapons by 4 percent, as we fully fund
the B–21 bomber, the Columbia-class nu-
clear submarine, the LRSO, and the
modernization of our nuclear weapons
force. All of these arguments are non-
sense.
Going back to the personnel argu-
ment, they cut the personnel account
by more than we did because they
didn’t agree with the President.
All of these arguments are pure par-
tisanship, and nothing drives this point
home more clearly than the $733 bil-
lion.
Now, I can’t say it any better than
the majority leader said it, but the
quote from General Dunford in Janu-
ary of 2017. Well, if that is the case,
why did Chairman THORNBERRY—I am
sorry; that is the way I always think of
him—write an op-ed in the Wall Street
Journal in November of 2018 insisting
that we had to have $733 billion?
If we had said $750 billion, they would
be on the floor saying, ‘‘Not enough. It
has got to be $775 billion,’’ because that
is the partisanship.
This is a really important policy
point. These numbers also matter, be-
cause accountability at the Pentagon
matters. I would submit to you that
this bill doesn’t just maintain the bi-
partisan tradition; with Democrats
working on this bill, this bill is better
for national security because we don’t
believe in sending a blank check to the
Pentagon, and sending a blank check
to the Pentagon is not in the best in-
terest of our troops or our national se-
curity.
Now, Mr. THORNBERRY is the best per-
son working on reforming our procure-
ment system to try and increase effi-
ciency, and I support him in that ef-
fort. But if you try to reform a system
and make it more efficient but then
say, ‘‘You know what,’’ at the last
minute, ‘‘here is another $17 billion,’’
the people are not going to get the
message. They are going to say, ‘‘Ac-
countability? You don’t want account-
ability. You are going to give us more
money no matter what we do,’’ which
is what we have done for far too long.
So, yes, we have accountability in
this bill, but you have not heard a sin-
gle good reason to oppose this, other
than pure partisanship. And it is a bril-
liant way of doing things.
As a friend of mine said a long time
ago, when you are in an argument with
someone who is unreasonable, it is
hard not to sound unreasonable.
It is brilliant. Just vote against the
bill and say it is partisan; okay?
Partisan is when you ignore the
other side. And, my goodness, the peo-
ple behind me, I mean, I have worked
on it, but nobody has worked on it
more than my staff and, frankly, the
minority party staff. If you could see
the hours that we spent working with
Republicans to get to ‘‘good’’ on a vari-
ety of different amendments, you
would laugh out loud at the partisan-
ship claim.
And I think this is important. I think
if the minority party, if the Republican
Party, cannot work with us unless they
are in charge, then we are not going to
get to a bipartisan place.
And again, we talk about how we cut
the President’s budget. It was the
President who tweeted out in Novem-
ber that $733 billion was too much.
That is what the President said.
So as the majority leader said, we
took your number, and after we took
your number, you said we are being
partisan. That is absurd.
This is a good bill that protects our
country. Every Member of this body
should be proud to vote for it.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

bate has expired.
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be

SEC. 323. PROVISION OF UNCONTAMINATED
WATER FOR AGRICULTURAL USE ON
LAND CONTAMINATED BY PFOS AND
PFOA USED ON MILITARY INSTALLA-
TIONS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following
findings:
(1) Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (in this sec-
tion referred to as ‘‘PFOS’’) and
perfluorooctanoic acid (in this section referred
to as ‘‘PFOA’’) are part of a class of man-made
chemicals that have been used in a variety of in-
dustrial and consumer products to make the
products resist heat, stains, water, and grease.
Because PFOS and PFOA extinguish petroleum
fires quickly, the Department of Defense and
commercial airports began using aqueous film
forming foam containing PFOS and PFOA in
the 1970s.
(2) PFOS and PFOA can accumulate and stay
in the body for long periods of time. Exposure to
PFOS and PFOA may cause health problems,
including issues with the reproductive system,
liver and kidney damage, developmental issues
in children, and negatively impacted immune
system, and cancer.
(3) A common method of human exposure to
PFOS and PFOA is by consuming contaminated
drinking water.
(4) The Environmental Protection Agency
issued lifetime health advisories under the Safe
Drinking Water Act for individual or combined
PFOS and PFOA concentrations at 70 parts per
trillion in 2016, but has not yet issued any guid-
ance or regulation for groundwater or agricul-
tural water.
(5) The Department of Defense has provided
mitigations in many communities where drink-
ing water has tested at or above the lifetime
health advisory level, including bottled water
and drinking water filtration systems. Due to
the lack of regulatory guidance, these mitiga-
tions have not been mirrored in agricultural
water systems.
(6) As a result, farmers located adjacent to
military installations with PFOS and PFOA
contamination that has migrated off-installa-
tion are potentially impacted, and in at least
one case, such contamination has had a serious
impact on the livelihood of a dairy farmer.
(b) AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE UNCONTAMINATED
WATER FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—If an area has been identi-
fied under paragraph (2), and a military instal-
lation has been determined to be the source of
that contamination, the Secretary of Defense or
the Secretary concerned may provide, for the
purpose of producing agricultural products des-
tined for human consumption—
(A) water sources uncontaminated with
perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances,
including PFOA and PFOS, or
(B) treatment of contaminated waters.
(2) IDENTIFICATION OF AREAS.—An area identi-
fied under this paragraph is an area for which
the level of PFOA or PFOS contamination—
(A) is above the lifetime health advisory for
contamination for such compounds as issued by
the Environmental Protection Agency and print-
ed in the Federal Register on May 25, 2016;
(B) is at or above a regulatory standard set by
the Food and Drug Administration for PFOA
and PFOS in raw agricultural commodities and
milk; or
(C) is at or above a duly promulgated, non-
discriminatory standard promulgated by a State
regulatory entity for PFOA and PFOS in raw
agricultural commodities and milk.
(3) SOURCE OF FUNDS.—Amounts used to carry
out this section shall be derived—
(A) in the case of amounts made available by
the Secretary concerned, from amounts author-
ized to be appropriated for Operation and Main-
tenance for the military department concerned;
or
(B) in the case of amounts made available by
the Secretary of Defense, from amounts author-
ized to be appropriated for Operation and Main-
tenance, Defense-wide.
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING LAND AC-
QUISITION.—It is the sense of Congress that the
Secretary concerned should explore authorities
under which the Secretary could acquire land
the land adjacent to military installations where
the owners of the land have experienced impacts
to their livelihood due to PFOS and PFOA con-
tamination that has been verified to have been
caused by that installation, including the au-
thorities under sections 2663, 2864a, and 2869 of
title 10, United States Code.

SEC. 853. REVISED AUTHORITIES TO DEFEAT AD-
VERSARY EFFORTS TO COMPROMISE
UNITED STATES DEFENSE CAPABILI-
TIES.
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—Congress finds that
to comprehensively address the supply chain
vulnerabilities of the Department of Defense, de-
fense contractors must be incentivized to
prioritize security in a manner which exceeds
basic compliance with mitigation practices relat-
ing to cybersecurity risk and supply chain secu-
rity standards. Defense contractors can no
longer pass unknown risks on to the Depart-
ment of Defense but should be provided with the
tools to meet the needs of the Department with
respect to cybersecurity risk and supply chain
security. Incentives for defense contractors will
help stimulate efforts within the defense indus-
trial base to minimize vulnerabilities in hard-
ware, software, and supply chain services. The
Department of Defense must develop policies
and regulations that move security from a cost
that defense contractors seek to minimize to a
key consideration in the award of contracts,
equal in importance to cost, schedule, and per-
formance.
(b) INCLUSION OF SECURITY AS PRIMARY PUR-
POSE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ACQUI-
SITION.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Sec-

of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2018 (Public Law 115–91; 131 Stat.
1449; U.S.C. 2302 note) to include the security of
goods acquired by the Department of Defense as
one of the primary objectives of Department of
Defense acquisition. The Secretary shall revise
applicable Department of Defense Instructions,
regulations, and directives to implement the in-
clusion of security as a primary purpose of De-
partment of Defense acquisition.
(2) CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION.—The Sec-
retary shall submit to the congressional defense
committees—
(A) not later than 60 days before issuing the
revisions described in paragraph (1), the pro-
posed revisions; and
(B) not later than 180 days after the date of
the enactment of this Act, recommendations for
legislative action to implement the revisions de-
scribed in this subsection.
(c) CERTIFICATION OF RISK.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Before making a milestone
decision with respect to a major defense acquisi-
tion program (as defined under section 2430 of
title 10, United States Code), a major automated
information system, or major system (as defined
under section 2302d of title 10, United States
Code), the vice chief of the Armed Force con-
cerned shall issue a written assessment to the
Vice Chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
head of the Defense Acquisition Board stating
the determination made by the vice chief of the
armed force concerned of the risk to the supply
chain associated with the procurement. Such as-
sessment shall include—
(A) a description of actions taken to mitigate
potential vulnerabilities associated with the pro-
curement; and
(B) a certification from the Secretary of the
military department concerned or the Vice Chief
of the Joint Chief of Staff (as appropriate) that
the procurement will not interfere with the oper-
ations of the military department conducting
the procurement.
(2) AVAILABILITY TO THE CONGRESSIONAL DE-
FENSE COMMITTEES.—Upon request, the vice
chief of the Armed Force concerned shall make
available to the congressional defense commit-
tees a certification required under paragraph
(1), along with the data on which such certifi-
cation is based, not later than 15 days after the
submission of a request.
(d) DISPUTES RELATING TO ACQUISITIONS DE-
CISIONS.—The Under Secretary of Defense for
Intelligence, the Vice Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the Vice Chief of Staff of the
Army, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, the
Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the As-
sistant Commandant of the Marine Corps shall
each have the authority to submit to the Sec-
retary of Defense a written statement of dispute
relating to a decision made by the Defense Ac-
quisition Board with respect to an acquisition.
A dispute submitted under this subsection shall
include any reason why the decision fails to ef-
fectively address concerns regarding the item to
be acquired.
SEC. 854. PROHIBITION ON OPERATION OR PRO-
CUREMENT OF FOREIGN-MADE UN-
MANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.
(a) PROHIBITION ON AGENCY OPERATION OR

(c) WAIVER.—The Secretary of Defense may
waive the restriction under subsection (a) on a
case by case basis by certifying in writing to the
congressional defense committees that the oper-
ation or procurement is required in the national
interest of the United States.

period following the end the 30-day period de-

contractor and provide the prime contractor
with a 15-day period in which the prime con-
tractor may make the payment owed to the sub-
contractor.

tractor has not fully paid the amount owed
within the 15-day period described under sub-

SEC. 1226. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT
FOR MINISTRY OF PESHMERGA
FORCES OF THE KURDISTAN REGION
OF IRAQ.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the United States led coalition and coali-
tion enabled partner forces, including Ministry
of Peshmerga forces of the Kurdistan Region of
Iraq and Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), have made
significant gains in liberating all territory in
Iraq from Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)
control and disrupting ISIS safe havens and
networks;
(2) nevertheless, ISIS is regenerating key
functions and capabilities in Iraq, and ISIS ele-
ments will continue to exist in Iraq for the fore-
seeable future;
(3) ISIS will attempt to rebuild combat power
through clandestine networks providing sanc-
tuary, and ISIS will continue to attempt to con-
duct insurgent-type activities while simulta-
neously recruiting and training fighters, estab-
lishing facilitation networks, and attempting to
remain relevant in the information domain;
(4) the Ministry of Peshmerga forces of the
Kurdistan Region of Iraq made significant con-
tributions and sacrifices in the United States-led
campaign to degrade, dismantle, and destroy
ISIS; and
(5) the Department of Defense and the De-
partment of State should continue to work with
and support the non-partisan forces of the Min-
istry of Peshmerga of the Kurdistan Region of
Iraq in order to continue to develop their capa-
bilities, promote security sector reforms, and en-
hance sustainability and interoperability with
the other elements of the Iraqi security forces in
order to provide for Iraq’s lasting security
against terrorist threats.
Subtitle D—Matters Relating to Russia
SEC. 1231. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS
TO SUSPEND, TERMINATE, OR WITH-
DRAW THE UNITED STATES FROM
THE OPEN SKIES TREATY.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
(1) Since 1992, the United States has sup-
ported the Open Skies Treaty with dedicated
aircraft and observation mission teams, con-
ducting several hundred training and observa-
tion missions with other countries.
(2) This commitment by the United States has
helped to confirm and refine operational proce-
dures, to improve implementation and effective-
ness of the Open Skies Treaty, and provide
United States leadership and engagement oppor-
tunities that have supported broader objectives
and improved European transparency.
(3) The Open Skies Treaty provides signatories
with the ability to gather information through
aerial imaging on military forces and activities
of concern to them which contributes to greater
transparency and stability in the Euro-Atlantic
region, which benefits both the United States
and United States allies and partners.
(4) In order to maximize United States benefits
from the Open Skies Treaty, the United States
needs to recapitalize and modernize its aircraft
and sensors, and the ongoing work to certify the
Digital Visual Imaging System and the new ef-
fort for the Open Skies Treaty Aircraft Recapi-
talization (OSTAR) are critical to United States
leadership and involvement in the Treaty.
(5) The current 1960s-era United States air-
craft used with respect to the Open Skies Treaty
are ill-suited to extreme operating environments
in Russia and experience regular, unplanned
maintenance issues, often resulting in mission
delays or cancellations.
(6) The OSTAR effort will provide a United
States aircraft capability that allows the United
States to fully implement the goals and objec-
tives of the Open Skies Treaty.
(7) The United States also demonstrated in
December 2018, along with United States allies
of Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ger-
many, and Romania, that Open Skies Treaty
mechanisms can be used during times of crisis.
(8) Following Russia’s unprovoked attack on
Ukrainian vessels near the Kerch Strait, the
United States and United States allies con-
ducted an ‘‘extraordinary’’ Open Skies Treaty
observation mission over Ukraine to reaffirm
commitment to Ukraine.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the United States should forcefully address
Russian violations of its obligations under the
Open Skies Treaty; and
(2) due to the significant benefits that obser-
vation missions under the Open Skies Treaty
provide to the United States and United States
allies, the United States should commit to con-
tinued participation in the Treaty.
(c) PROHIBITION.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in para-
graph (2), none of the funds authorized to be
appropriated by this Act or otherwise made
available to the Department of Defense for fiscal
year 2020 may be obligated or expended to take
any action to suspend, terminate, or withdraw
the United States from the Open Skies Treaty.
(2) EXCEPTION.—The prohibition in paragraph
(1) shall not apply if the Secretary of Defense
and the Secretary of State jointly determine and
certify to the congressional defense committees,
the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House
of Representatives, and the Committee on For-
eign Relations of the Senate, that—
(A) Russia is in material breach of its obliga-
tions under the Open Skies Treaty and is not
taking steps to return to compliance with such
obligations, and all other state parties to the
Open Skies Treaty concur in such determination
of the Secretaries; or
(B) withdrawing from the Open Skies Treaty
would be in the best interests of United States
national security and the other state parties to
the Open Skies Treaty have been consulted with
respect to such withdrawal.

It is the sense of Congress that, in order to
strengthen the defense of United States and its
allies and partners in Europe and avert the risk
of miscalculation and unintended escalation
that could lead to a broader and dangerous mili-
tary catastrophe, the Secretary of Defense and
Secretary of State, in consultation with the com-
mander of United States European Command
and Assistant Secretary of State for European
and Eurasian Affairs, should—

the current Resolute Support Mission led by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
Afghanistan and the Multi-National Force in
Iraq.

the partnership capacity of Georgia so it can
work more closely with the United States and
NATO, as well as provide for its own defense.

Initiative, Georgia’s participation in the NATO
initiative Partnership for Peace is paramount to
interoperability with the United States and
NATO, and establishing a more peaceful envi-
ronment in the region.

partner, Georgia is committed to the Resolute
Support Mission in Afghanistan with the
fourth-largest contingent on the ground.

gia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within
its internationally-recognized borders, and does

with Taiwan to support the development of ca-
pable, ready, and modern defense forces nec-
essary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-
defense capability, including capabilities in sup-
port of an asymmetric defense strategy;
(3) the United States should continue to sup-
port the acquisition by Taiwan of appropriate
defensive weapons through foreign military
sales, direct commercial sales, and industrial co-
operation, with a particular emphasis on asym-
metric warfare, information sharing, air de-
fense, and maritime capabilities, consistent with
the Taiwan Relations Act;
(4) the United States should improve the pre-
dictability of arms sales to Taiwan by ensuring
timely review of and response to requests of Tai-
wan for defense articles and defense services as
well as timely notification to Congress and ad-
herence to congressional oversight and review
procedures; and

changes between senior defense officials and

operation partner of the United States, as recog-
nized in the ‘‘2005 Strategic Framework Agree-
ment between the United States and the Repub-
lic of Singapore for a Closer Partnership in De-
fense and Security’’, has an important role in
the promotion of peace and stability, and global
efforts to counter terrorism;
(4) Singapore’s provision of access to its mili-
tary facilities for the United States has sup-
ported the continued security presence of the
United States in Southeast Asia;
(5) the Singaporean armed forces’ support of
United States-led multinational reconstruction
efforts in Iraq from 2003 to 2008, reconstruction
and stabilization efforts in Afghanistan from
2007 to 2013, counter-piracy operations in the
Gulf of Aden under the ambit of Combined Task
Force 151, and contribution of physical and
military assets to the Defeat-ISIS Coalition since
2014, has contributed to global efforts to counter
terrorism;
(6) in recognition of the enduring security
partnership between the United States and
Singapore, the Secretary of State, in consulta-
tion with the Secretary of Defense, should, in

States Use of Facilities in Singapore’’ that is

curity cooperation partner of the United States;

STATES MILITARY INVESTMENT IN
EUROPE.
It is the policy of the United States to develop,
implement, and sustain a credible deterrent
against aggression and long-term strategic com-
petition by the Government of Russia in order to
enhance regional and global security and sta-
bility, including by the following:
(1) Increased United States presence in Eu-
rope, including additional permanently sta-
tioned forces, continued rotational deployments,
increased pre-positioned military equipment,
and sufficient and necessary infrastructure ad-
ditions and improvements throughout Europe.

tary footprint in Europe to recognize the essen-
tial role played by United States allies and part-
ners in establishing deterrence and advancing
regional and global security and stability.

Organization (NATO) and its founding values
and commitments by NATO allies to the common
defense, including NATO goals regarding de-
fense investments, and to NATO’s founding
principles of democracy, individual liberty, and

graphically appropriate for a comprehensive re-
sponse to the challenges posed by the Govern-
ment of Russia across numerous European
fronts.

tions, values, and institutions, and disrupt
United States alliances and partnerships,
through indirect action (such as information op-
erations intended to influence), including robust
information sharing and cooperation with part-
ners and allies to counter influence campaigns
and sufficient cyber, counter-messaging, and in-
telligence resources.
(6) Planning to take into account the impor-
tance of strategic stability, arms control, and
strategic dialogue as they contribute to United

gade, a NATO enhanced Forward Presence Bat-
talion, and a U.S. Aegis Ashore missile defense

tant role that Poland plays in NATO efforts to

with partners and allies have helped to solidify
and undergird the post-World War II inter-

SEC. 1267. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ACQUISITION
BY TURKEY OF PATRIOT SYSTEM.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
(1) The Government of Turkey has indicated
in a communication to Congress that there re-
mains an opportunity to meet Turkey’s require-
ment for an air and missile defense capability
through the acquisition of the Patriot system
from the United States.
(2) The acquisition of the Patriot system could
remove the need to acquire the S-400 air and
missile defense system from Russia, which is in-
compatible with the integrated air and missile
defense system of the North Atlantic Treaty Or-
ganization (NATO) and should preclude Tur-
key’s participation in the F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter (JSF) consortium program with the
United States.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—Congress—
(1) supports the efforts of the United States
Government to achieve a satisfactory arrange-
ment with Turkey by which Turkey acquires the
Patriot system to defend its airspace, which
would preserve Turkey as a production partner
in the F-35 JSF consortium program;
(2) encourages the Department of Defense to
secure the deployment of a Patriot system to
Turkey, under United States or NATO oper-
ational control, for the purpose of providing
Turkey with an interim capability to address ur-
gent vulnerabilities in Turkey’s air and missile
defense during the period in which an agree-
ment is reached for Turkey’s acquisition of the
Patriot system; and
(3) notes that any such deployment of the Pa-
triot or a NATO interoperable system in the in-
terim is contingent on Turkey’s commitment to
cancel the S-400 air and missile defense system
acquisition.
Subtitle H—Baltic Reassurance Act
SEC. 1271. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Russia seeks to diminish the North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization (NATO) and recreate its
sphere of influence in Europe using coercion, in-
timidation, and outright aggression.
(2) Deterring Russia from such aggression is
vital for transatlantic security.
(3) The illegal occupation of Crimea by Russia
and its continued engagement of destabilizing
and subversive activities against independent
and free states is of increasing concern.
(4) Russia also continues to disregard treaties,
international laws and rights to freedom of
navigation, territorial integrity, and sovereign
international borders.
(5) Russia’s continued occupation of Georgian
and Ukrainian territories and the sustained
military buildup in Russia’s Western Military
District and Kaliningrad has threatened conti-
nental peace and stability.
(6) The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania are particularly vulnerable to an
increasingly aggressive and subversive Russia.
(7) In a declaration to celebrate 100 years of
independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
issued on April 3, 2018, the Trump Administra-
tion reaffirmed United States commitments to
these Baltic countries to ‘‘improve military read-
iness and capabilities through sustained secu-
rity assistance’’ and ‘‘explore new ideas and op-
portunities, including air defense, bilaterally
and in NATO, to enhance deterrence across the
region’’.
(8) These highly valued NATO allies of the
United States have repeatedly demonstrated
their commitment to advancing mutual interests
as well as those of the NATO alliance.
(9) The Baltic countries also continue to par-
ticipate in United States-led exercises to further
promote coordination, cooperation, and inter-
operability among allies and partner countries,
and continue to demonstrate their reliability
and commitment to provide for their own de-
fense.
(10) Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia each
hosts a respected NATO Center of Excellence
that provides expertise to educate and promote
NATO allies and partners in areas of vital inter-
est to the alliance.
(11) United States support and commitment to
allies across Europe has been a lynchpin for
peace and security on the continent for over 70
years.
SEC. 1272. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress as follows:
(1) The United States is committed to the secu-
rity of the Baltic countries and should strength-
en cooperation and support capacity-building
initiatives aimed at improving the defense and
security of such countries.
(2) The United States should lead a multilat-
eral effort to develop a strategy to deepen joint
capabilities with Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia,
NATO allies, and other regional partners, to
deter against aggression from Russia in the Bal-
tic region, specifically in areas that would
strengthen interoperability, joint capabilities,
and military readiness necessary for Baltic
countries to strengthen their national resilience.
(3) The United States should explore the feasi-
bility of providing additional air and missile de-
fense systems in the Baltic region, including
through leveraging cost-sharing mechanisms
and multilateral deployment with NATO allies
to reduce financial burdens on host countries.
SEC. 1273. DEFENSE ASSESSMENT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year after
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of Defense and the Secretary of State

eral assessment of the military requirements of
such countries to deter and resist aggression by
Russia that—
(1) provides an assessment of past and current
initiatives to improve the efficiency, effective-
ness, readiness and interoperability of Lith-
uania, Latvia, and Estonia’s national defense
capabilities; and
(2) assesses the manner in which to meet those
objectives, including future resource require-
ments and recommendations, by undertaking ac-
tivities in the following areas:
(A) Activities to increase the rotational and
forward presence, improve the capabilities, and
enhance the posture and response readiness of
the United States or forces of NATO in the Bal-
tic region.
(B) Activities to improve air defense systems,
including modern air-surveillance capabilities.

lance, and reconnaissance capabilities.
(F) Activities to enhance maritime domain
awareness.
(G) Activities to improve military and defense
infrastructure, logistics, and access, particularly

security and electronic warfare capabilities.
(J) Bilateral and multilateral training and ex-
ercises.

with United States and NATO allies to reduce
financial burden.
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 1 year after the
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary
of Defense and the Secretary of State jointly

SEC. 1607. INDEPENDENT STUDY ON PLAN FOR
DETERRENCE IN SPACE.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
(1) Threats to space systems of the United
States have increased and continue to grow.
(2) While the United States must invest in ca-
pabilities to defend such systems in the event of

bilities for enhancing resilience of such systems.
(4) However, the proper balance between ac-
tive defense, resilience, and the still lagging in-
vestment area of reconstitution to enhance de-
terrence remains unclear, as does the balance
between classified and unclassified activities
needed to create deterrence.
(5) Independent analysis and assessment is
necessary to identify steps to increase deterrence
in space.
(b) INDEPENDENT STUDY.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 30 days after
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of Defense shall seek to enter into a con-
tract with a federally funded research and de-
velopment center or other independent entity to
conduct a study on deterrence in space.

paragraph (1) shall include, at a minimum, the
following:
(A) An assessment of the existing range of
major studies and writings on space deterrence
and a comprehensive comparative analysis of
the conclusions of such studies and writings.
(B) An examination, using appropriate ana-
lytical tools, of the approaches proposed by such
studies and writings with respect to creating
conditions of deterrence suitable for use in the
space domain, including, at a minimum, an as-
sessment of all aspects of deterrence in space,
including varying classification, strategies to
deny benefit or impose cost, and space mission
assurance (including resilience, active defense,
and reconstitution).
(C) A determination, made either by extending
such studies and writings or through new anal-
ysis, of a holistic and comprehensive theory of
deterrence in space appropriate for use in de-
fense planning.
(D) An evaluation of existing policies, pro-
grams, and plans of the Department of Defense
to provide an assessment of the likely effective-
ness of those policies, programs, and plans to
achieve effective space deterrence.

United States Code, is amended to read as fol-
lows:
‘‘§ 2886. Specified rights of tenancy in military
housing units
‘‘(a) CONTRACT REQUIREMENT FOR MILITARY
HOUSING UNITS.—
‘‘(1) INCLUSION OF RIGHTS OF TENANCY.—Each
contract between the Secretary concerned and a
landlord shall guarantee the rights of tenancy
specified in this section for military tenants who
reside in military housing units covered by the
contract.
‘‘(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—The rights of
tenancy in military housing units specified in
this section are not intended to be exclusive.
The omission of a tenant right or protection
shall not be construed to deny the existence of
such a right or protection for military tenants.
‘‘(3) WRITTEN LEASE AND EXPLANATION OF
TENANCY.—(A) The lease between a landlord
and military tenant shall be in writing to estab-
lish tenancy in a military housing unit. The
landlord shall provide the military tenant with
a copy of the lease, any addendums, and any
other regulations imposed by the landlord re-
garding occupancy of the military housing unit
and use of common areas.
‘‘(B) The Secretary concerned shall require
that a military tenant receive a plain-language
briefing regarding the rights of tenancy guaran-
teed by this section and the respective respon-
sibilities of landlords and military tenants re-
lated to tenancy, including the existence of any
additional fees authorized by subsection (c)(2),
any utilities payments, the procedures for sub-
mitting and tracking work orders, the identity
of the military tenant advocate, and the dispute
resolution process.

ate against a military tenant, directly or
through the chain-of-command of a member of
the armed forces who is a military tenant, in re-
sponse to a military tenant making a complaint
relating to a military housing unit or common

attempts to commit such an action:
‘‘(A) Unlawful recovery of, or attempt to re-
cover, possession of a military housing unit.
‘‘(B) Unlawfully increasing the rent, decreas-
ing services, or increasing the obligations of a
military tenant.

AMOUNTS IN ADDITION TO RENT.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A landlord may not impose
on a military tenant a supplemental payment,
such as an out-of-pocket fee, in addition to the
amount of rent the landlord charges for a unit
of similar size and composition to the military
housing unit, without regard to whether or not
the amount of the member’s basic allowance for
housing under section 403 of title 37 is less than
the amount of the rent.
‘‘(2) EXCEPTIONS.—Nothing in paragraph (1)
shall be construed—
‘‘(A) to prohibit a landlord from imposing an
additional payment—
‘‘(i) for optional services provided to military
tenants, such as access to a gym or a parking
space;

termined in accordance with regulations pro-
mulgated by the Secretary concerned; or

agreements or payments do not require a mili-
tary tenant to pay an out-of-pocket fee or pay-
ment in addition to the basic allowance for
housing of the member.
‘‘(d) DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS.—
‘‘(1) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary con-
cerned shall establish a dispute resolution proc-
ess for the resolution of disputes between land-
lords and military tenants related to military
housing units. The resolution process shall use
neutral arbitrators and minimize costs incurred
by military tenants to participate.
‘‘(2) TREATMENT OF BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR
HOUSING.—During the dispute resolution process
between a landlord and military tenant, the
Secretary concerned may withhold from the
landlord amounts of the military tenant’s basic
allowance for housing under section 403 of title
37 that otherwise would be paid to the landlord
directly by the military tenant or through allot-
ments of the pay of the military tenant under
section 701 of such title.
‘‘(e) PROMPT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary concerned
shall ensure that landlords—
‘‘(A) respond promptly to requests for the

of the white sands and additional features of
scenic, scientific, and educational interest’’.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. SMITH OF
WASHINGTON
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 1 printed in part
B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 696, line 8, strike ‘‘Secretary of De-
fense’’ and insert ‘‘Director of National In-
telligence’’.
Page 697, line 4, strike ‘‘Secretary’’ and in-
sert ‘‘Director’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 476, the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. SMITH) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield myself 2 minutes.
This is an amendment that was actu-
ally adopted at the committee level,
but there was a technical problem with
it which we couldn’t get corrected by
UC, so we are re-debating it on the
House floor. I think it is appropriate.
Last year, the Trump administration
decided to stop reporting on civilian
casualties that were caused by our
raids. This amendment reinstates that
and requires the Director of National
Intelligence to report to us on civilian
casualties that have resulted in raids
that we have done outside of existing
combat zones.
We are engaged in many military op-
erations, which we have read about, in
places like Somalia, Libya, and Yemen.
We think it is appropriate to keep sta-
tistics on how effective those raids
have been, and one of those measures
of effectiveness is the number of civil-
ian casualties that are included in
that.
That is what this amendment does.
We have gotten the support of the
chairman of the Intelligence Com-
mittee, Mr. SCHIFF, to do this for both
DOD operations and intelligence oper-
ations.
I think it is an important trans-
parency measure that will help us bet-
ter understand the effects of our mili-
tary policy.
And, I guess, the final thing I would
say on this is it is part of an under-
lying theme. One of the other things
that the minority party doesn’t like
about our bill is that, again, we want
to hold the Pentagon accountable. We
think Congress actually has a role in
defense policy and we shouldn’t simply
turn it over to the Pentagon.
For us to know what is going on with
this will inform our decisions as we at-
tempt to exercise legitimate and effec-
tive oversight of Pentagon operations.
Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from
New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this
amendment. First, I know the majority
feels this is just a technical fix to an
administrative error, but it raises an
important issue, again, for us to dis-
cuss now on the House floor, and we
should debate the merits of the under-
lying provision.
First of all, the Secretary of Defense
is already charged with compiling this
information, and we have already put
in place a full and transparent over-
sight framework with publicly avail-
able reporting.
As we debated in committee, the DNI
is not the place to conduct such a re-
view and report. We need the intel-
ligence community focused on gath-
ering and analyzing intelligence that is
vital to our national security.
So, pulling our national-level intel-
ligence staff and resources away from
those important missions to conduct a
review that is already taking place—
done by the DOD—is a poor use of re-
sources and is just bad policy.
I can say this, as one of the few mem-
bers on the Intel Committee and HASC:
The place we should be debating this is
the Intelligence Authorization Act, not
the National Defense Authorization
Act.
So, there are jurisdictional issues
here, which is one of the reasons why I
am opposed to this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I would simply say that there are re-
porting requirements; there are not
comprehensive reporting requirements.
And that is the purpose of this amend-
ment, to make sure we report every-
thing and so that we have all of the in-
formation that is available to us.
And, I guess, to a certain extent, if
the opposition feels like it is already
being done, then why not do it effec-
tively and efficiently. Regrettably,
DOD is not in charge of all of the oper-
ations involved here.
The Director of National Intelligence
would take into account everything we
are doing and make sure that we have
an accurate picture of that.
Again, I urge support, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. WENSTRUP).
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to this amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5534 July 10, 2019
I have had the pleasure of serving
with Ms. STEFANIK on the House Intel-
ligence Committee, and I couldn’t
agree more with the points she has
made.
As a veteran and as a member of the
House Armed Services Committee for
the previous three terms and a member
of the House Intelligence Committee, I
am familiar with the U.S. military as
well as with the intelligence commu-
nity.
This amendment, if adopted, would
require the Director of National Intel-
ligence, not the Secretary of Defense,
to submit a report to Congress regard-
ing strikes taken against terrorists
outside of areas of active hostilities, as
well as an assessment of combatant
and noncombatant deaths.
This amendment is problematic for
several reasons. First, there already
exists transparent oversight mecha-
nisms with respect to civilian casual-
ties, and that report is fully available
to the public.
Requiring the DNI to conduct a re-
view already completed by the Sec-
retary of Defense is not only wasteful
but demonstrates a gross disregard for
the DNI’s time that should be spent
overseeing the intelligence commu-
nity’s efforts against U.S. adversaries.
Further, this amendment cir-
cumvents the normal legislative proc-
ess and completely bypassed the House
Intelligence Committee.
Tasking the office of the Director of
National Intelligence, an organization
over which House Intelligence has
oversight responsibilities, requires con-
sultation with the House Intelligence
Committee. However, we were not
given the opportunity to weigh in on
this amendment until now.
At the eleventh hour, various cospon-
sors of this amendment performed a sly
bait-and-switch, changing what was
voted on by the Armed Services Com-
mittee and inserting an organization
solely within the House Intelligence’s
jurisdiction. To say am I disappointed
with that is an understatement.
This amendment is irresponsible and
reflects a disregard for the House Intel-
ligence Committee’s equities in this
debate.
It failed to navigate the proper juris-
diction process and takes time and re-
sources away from critical national se-
curity missions.
So, I understand the desire of this
type of well-meaning legislation; how-
ever, committees of jurisdiction exist
for a reason, and I am surprised that
various members of the House Intel-
ligence Committee would flagrantly
disregard the implications of ceding
our jurisdiction on this matter.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield myself the balance of my time.
Just a couple of quick points: First of
all, we did not bypass the committee of
jurisdiction. We were in constant con-
sultation with the Intelligence Com-
mittee, with their staff, and we had
that conversation and worked with
them to get this result.
We did not bypass them. In fact, we
got a waiver from the Intelligence
Committee to have this amendment be-
fore our committee.
Our committee takes jurisdiction
that this bill has a number of provi-
sions in it, including one on which I
worked very closely with the gentle-
woman from New York, that has juris-
diction within the intelligence commu-
nity. We include in this bill items that
have their jurisdiction, but we worked
with them and in careful consultation.
I really don’t think it is a lot to ask
of our national intelligence to look at
the very important issue of how our
military action, regardless of who is
doing it, impacting casualties, both ci-
vilian and otherwise.
That is all this amendment does. I
think that it is something that we
should be doing, regardless, and it is
information that will be valuable to
this House.
Mr. Chair, I would urge adoption of
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. BACON).
Mr. BACON. Mr. Chair, I rise today
opposing amendment 546 that would
use the NDAA to task the Director of
National Intelligence reporting rules
for civilian casualties.
As Chairman SMITH knows and, also,
Ms. STEFANIK and the ranking member,
though I voted for the NDAA in mark-
up, I opposed this amendment then,
and I still do.
The long story short is that this
tasking should be in the Intelligence
Authorization Act and not in the De-
fense Authorization Act.
This tasks the Director of National
Intelligence, and, thus, it should be
handled by the Intelligence Committee
and in the intelligence authorization
bill.
We believe in transparency. We be-
lieve in doing all we can to minimize
civilian casualties. We believe in pro-
portionality. We believe in knowing if
we are targeting and handling these op-
erations correctly.
I know from my experience working
three decades in the Air Force that our
military goes through extensive vet-
ting, extensive legal reviews, and ex-
tensive crosschecks before putting a
weapon on a target that could threaten
civilians.
But let’s be clear: DOD has a full and
transparent oversight framework in
place for DOD and U.S. military oper-
ations.
The FY18 NDAA established a robust
civilian casualty reporting mechanism
for the U.S. military, and the DOD re-
porting is fully available to the public.
Even more, there are two additional
provisions in this bill that increase the
level of CIVCAS reporting and directs
an independent assessment of DOD’s
reporting and policy.
But, what is important here: This is
about DOD and military operations,
not the intelligence operations. It is
not the DOD’s role to report on the in-
telligence community.
It is not the role of the NDAA to task
the intelligence community.
I recommend voting against this
amendment. We should send it to the
Intelligence Committee and let them
do it the right way, if the Intelligence
Committee wants to take it on.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I yield 30
seconds to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. WALTZ).
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Chair, there is a dis-
tinct difference between oversight and
unnecessary micromanagement.
Protection of civilians is a funda-
mental part of military operations.
DOD standards and policies are some
of the most stringent in the world. No
force in history has been more com-
mitted to limiting harm to civilians
than the U.S. military.
As a special operator who has had to
make these decisions, we need to be
very careful of secondary effects of
these types of reports, from putting
soldiers unnecessarily in harm’s way,
to pilots being overly cautious to pro-
vide close air support, to terrorists liv-
ing another day to kill more civilians,
ironically, because of this overreach
and overcaution.
Our policies and procedures are suffi-
cient.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote against this amendment.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. SMITH).
The question was taken; and the
Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of
rule XVIII, further proceedings on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Washington will be postponed.

SEC. 1283. GUIDANCE RELATING TO THE MINING
SECTOR OF BURMA.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) In 2015, the nongovernmental organiza-
tion Global Witness estimated that the value
of total production of jade in Burma in 2014
was $31,000,000,000, almost 48 percent of the
official gross domestic product of Burma. As
much as 80 percent of that jade sold is smug-
gled out of Burma.
(2) Burma’s military and associated enti-
ties, including companies owned or con-
trolled by Myanmar Economic Corporation
and Myanmar Economic Holding Limited,
their affiliated companies, and companies
owned or controlled by current and former
senior military officers or their family mem-
bers, are linked to the mining sector, includ-
ing the gemstone industry, and benefit finan-
cially from widespread illegal smuggling of
jade and rubies from Burma.
(3) Illegal trafficking in precious and
semiprecious stones from Burma, including
the trade in high-value jade and rubies, de-
prives the people of Burma and the civilian
government of critical revenue and instead
benefits military-linked entities, non-state
armed groups, and transnational organized
criminal networks.
(4) In 2016, the Government of Burma began
to take steps to reform aspects of the mining
sector, but the Gemstone Law adopted in
January 2019 does not adequately address
corruption and tax avoidance, conflicts of in-
terest, or the factors fueling conflict in
Kachin State and other gemstone mining
areas.
(5) The lifting in October 2016 of United
States sanctions on the importation of jade
and jadeite and rubies from Burma allowed
such gemstones to legally enter the United
States market, but some retailers have re-
frained from sourcing gemstones of Burmese
origin due to governance and reputational
concerns.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) notwithstanding Burma’s ‘‘Trafficking
in Persons’’ ranking, the President should
continue to provide assistance to Burma,
pursuant to the waiver authority under sec-
tion 110(d)(4) of the Trafficking Victims Pro-
tection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7107(d)(4)), in
order to re-engage with the Government of
Burma with respect to the mining sector and
should make available technical, capacity-

building and other assistance through the
Department of State or the United States
Agency for International Development to
support the Government of Burma in efforts
to reform the gemstone industry; and
(2) companies that seek to import to the
United States gemstones or minerals that
may be of Burmese origin or articles of jew-
elry containing such gemstones should—
(A) obtain such materials exclusively from
entities that satisfy the transparency cri-
teria described in subsection (d)(2) or from
third parties that can demonstrate that they
sourced the materials from entities that
meet such criteria; and
(B) undertake robust due diligence proce-
dures in line with the ‘‘Due Diligence Guid-
ance for Responsible Business Conduct’’ and

Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Af-
fected and High-Risk Areas’’ promulgated by
the Organization for Economic Cooperation

ior Burmese military officer, or any person
sanctioned by the United States pursuant to
any relevant sanctions authority; and

meeting the criteria described in subsection
(d)(2).

July 10, 2019
SEC. 10ll. TRANSPARENCY OF ACCOUNTING
FIRMS USED TO SUPPORT DEPART-
MENT OF DEFENSE AUDIT.
Section 1006 of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232) is amended—
(1) by striking ‘‘For all contract actions’’
and inserting ‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—For all con-
tract actions’’;
(2) by inserting ‘‘fully adjudicated’’ before
‘‘disciplinary proceedings’’; and
(3) by adding at the end the following new
subsections:
‘‘(b) TREATMENT OF STATEMENT.—A state-
ment setting for the details of a disciplinary
proceeding submitted pursuant to subsection
(a), and the information contained in such a
statement, shall be—
‘‘(1) treated as confidential to the extent
required by the court or agency in which the
proceeding has occurred; and
‘‘(2) treated in a manner consistent with
any protections or privileges established by
any other provision of Federal law.
‘‘(c) DEFINITION OF ASSOCIATED PERSON.—In
this section, the term ‘associated persons’
means, with respect to an accounting firm,
any of the key personnel of the firm who are

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 476, the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. SMITH) and the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY) each will
control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL),
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, this is a good
amendment, and I would like to men-
tion two measures.
First, key provisions of my BURMA
Act are included, as they were in the
last Congress. The Burmese security
forces perpetrated genocide against the
Rohingya people, and those same forces
are continuing to terrify Burma’s other
ethnic minorities with horrific vio-
lence.
The victims deserve justice, and they
deserve our unwavering support. This
measure will hold these military offi-
cials accountable for their crimes and
help support democracy in Burma.
Next, is my provision to prevent an-
other phony emergency declaration to
push through arms sales, as the admin-
istration did in late May.
The administration misused the law
and went around Congress to sell more
than $8 billion in arms to the Saudis
and Emiratis.
This fix would make sure that an
emergency declaration cannot be used
if the weapons won’t be delivered for
more than 3 months, because then
there was no emergency in the first
place.
It is a commonsense reform that will
protect Congress’ role in the arms sale
process.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting the en bloc.
I am also honored to join Chairman
SMITH as a cosponsor of amendment
No. 1. The American public deserves to
know the impact of our military oper-
ations abroad.
There must be more openness and
transparency when tragedy occurs, and
civilian casualties are caused by U.S.
military action.
Being open is our moral obligation
and the right thing to do, and it also
strengthens our security. We are better
equipped to tackle our counterterror-
ism challenges when we have the full
confidence of our citizens and our
international partners.
U.S. military operations depend on
close relationships with host nations,
and we must do everything we can to
ensure our partners that we take civil-
ian casualties seriously.
In the past, the Director of National
Intelligence prepared reports on civil-
ian casualties and strikes outside areas
of active hostilities. This administra-
tion brought that sensible practice to a
halt.
This amendment would restore the
DNI’s role. Restoring this responsi-
bility is a commonsense step to bring
transparency back to our counterter-
rorism operations, and I urge all of our
colleagues to support the amendment
as well.
b 1845
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HAR-
RIS).
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chair, I just raise
concerns with two of the amendments
that are in this en bloc amendment.
Amendment No. 5 is one that extends
free coverage for pregnancy prevention,
and with the amendment, extends to
all FDA-approved drugs and methods.
Why I find it interesting is that, of
course, a couple of years ago, we actu-
ally increased the copays on TRICARE
for former members.
If a former member has diabetes,
they have a $28 copay for insulin. So
this is kind of strange because what we
are doing is selecting one type of drug
and saying there are no copays for this,
yet we have thousands, if not tens of
thousands, of members who take an
important drug like insulin and have
to pay a copay. It just doesn’t make
sense.
With regard to amendment No. 13,
amendment No. 13 extends in vitro fer-
tilization coverage which, up until
now, has been for members whose prob-
lems have been related to their mili-
tary service. It extends it to all mem-
bers as well. It is going to greatly in-
crease the number of embryos created.
Although I have no disagreement
with extending the coverage, the prob-
lem is, the amendment and the statute
don’t deal with what members are
going to do with these embryos. It pre-
sents serious life concerns, due to the
sheer number of embryos created that
will often be discarded, now with gov-
ernment payment involved. Many will
subsequently be killed or frozen indefi-
nitely, leaving these early lives in
limbo.
There are no limits within the
amendment as to how many cycles of
IVF may be covered, how many em-
bryos may be created or frozen. Of
course, there are no requirements to
protect the embryos that have been
formed.
It is for that deficiency, it is for cre-
ating a permanent statutory entitle-
ment without dealing with what some
people object to, which is treating
those embryos created in a comprehen-
sive, long-range fashion, for those rea-
sons, I express concerns about amend-
ments No. 5 and No. 13.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I have no further speakers on this first
en bloc. I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON).
Mr. BACON. Mr. Chair, I come here
to support the en bloc. There are three
great amendments in here that I want
to briefly mention.
First, we are funding the replace-
ment of three simulators at Offutt Air
Force Base, as well as programming
equipment that will help us exploit
data that is collected during the mis-
sions. This is critical for the backbone
of the Air Force’s medium-altitude
manned ISR program.
Having those three simulators will
have a huge impact. Instead of taking
aircraft home that should be flying to
Russia, China, Korea, Iran, or wherever
it may be—without those simulators,
they have to come back to Offutt Air
Force Base to do training—this will
allow us to do training at home and
continue our real-world operational
missions.
I also want to thank the Chamber for
supporting a bill that will help enable
our civilian professors to be retained in
our military academies, the National
War College, and all the different mili-
tary schools that we have by allowing
them to own the copyrighted material
that they have. Prior to this bill, the
civilian instructors would not be able
to have ownership of these copyrighted
materials, and many of them get out
because they want to progress with
their careers. This fixes that and al-
lows them to stay in and maintain that
ownership.
Finally, I want to praise another
amendment that is in this en bloc. We
are allowing the academies now to en-
dorse, as well as participate with, foun-
dations that are there to help support
the cadets. Prior to this, the academies
were not allowed to partner or to en-
dorse these foundations, and it really
limited the ability for these founda-
tions to help our cadets.
Now that they can work together,
they can help provide more money for
new facilities and gym equipment, pro-
viding a better quality of life for our
cadets, while at the same time low-
ering the burden on taxpayers.
Mr. Chair, I want to praise this ef-
fort, and I support the en bloc.

minutes to the gentleman from Rhode
Island (Mr. CICILLINE).
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of the en bloc package, and I
thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking
Member THORNBERRY for their support
of two amendments that I have offered,
particularly my amendment clarifying
the statutory rights of servicemembers
and their families under the Service-
members Civil Relief Act.
For too long, forced arbitration
clauses buried deep within the fine
print of everyday contracts have erod-
ed workplace discrimination protec-
tions for servicemembers and blocked
them from having their day in court to
hold corporations accountable. Under
these agreements, a servicemember can
be called up for Active Duty, express to
his or her employer a desire to return
to his job following deployment, and
then be fired on his last day at work
before he deploys. This actually hap-
pened.
The servicemember would then learn
that he or she has waived the right to
due process because of the contract he
or she signed, removing the procedures
and safeguards afforded to individuals
in our justice system. These forced ar-
bitration clauses allow corporations to
choose their arbiter and their venue
and to deny servicemembers the right
to press their claims for unjust termi-
nation.
This bipartisan amendment would
end this shameful practice by clari-
fying that arbitration clauses are only
enforceable if agreed to by the service-
member or their family after a dispute
arises, thereby protecting their rights
under the Servicemembers Civil Relief
Act.
I thank my colleagues, Congressman
GUY RESCHENTHALER and Veterans Af-
fairs’ Committee Chairman MARK
TAKANO, for their strong, bipartisan
support for this amendment to protect
our men and women in uniform. I
thank the chairman and the ranking
member for their support of this
amendment.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I have
no further requests on this en bloc
package.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to say that I urge support for the

sider amendment No. 3 printed in part
B of House Report 116–143.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle C of title V, add the
following:
SEC. 530. NONDISCRIMINATION WITH RESPECT
TO SERVICE IN THE ARMED FORCES.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 37 of title 10,
United States Code, is amended by inserting
after section 651 the following new section:
‘‘§ 651a. Members: nondiscrimination
‘‘(a) STANDARDS FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR SERV-
ICE.—Any qualifications established or ap-
plied for eligibility for service in an armed
force shall take into account only the ability
of an individual to meet gender-neutral oc-
cupational standards for military service
generally and the military occupational spe-
cialty concerned in particular, and may not
include any criteria relating to the race,
color, national origin, religion, or sex (in-
cluding gender identity or sexual orienta-
tion) of an individual.
‘‘(b) EQUALITY OF TREATMENT IN SERVICE.—
Any personnel policy developed or imple-
mented by the Department of Defense with
respect to members of the armed forces shall
ensure equality of treatment and oppor-
tunity for all persons in the armed forces,
without regard to race, color, national ori-
gin, religion, and sex (including gender iden-
tity and sexual orientation).
‘‘(c) GENDER IDENTITY DEFINED.—In this
section, the term ‘gender identity’ means the
gender-related identity, appearance, manner-
isms, or other gender-related characteristics
of an individual, regardless of the individ-
ual’s designated sex at birth.’’.
(b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of
sections at the beginning of chapter 37 of
such title is amended by inserting after the
item relating to section 651 the following
new item:
‘‘651a. Members: nondiscrimination.’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 476, the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. SPEIER) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self 2 minutes.
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment to affirm the right of all people,
regardless of race, religion, national
origin, or sex, including sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity, to serve openly
in our Armed Forces, so long as they
meet gender-neutral standards.
This debate affects real servicemem-
bers who have served courageously. I
want you to hear their stories.
Navy Lieutenant Commander Blake
Dremann, a trans man, has served for
over 15 years and received the pres-
tigious Navy Batchelder Award.
Captain Jennifer Peace is a trans
woman who has served for over 15 years
and has deployed to Afghanistan and
Iraq multiple times.
Army Captain Alivia Stehlik, a trans
woman, commissioned out of West
Point over 10 years ago and received
the Bronze Star Medal.
Hospital Corpsman Third Class Akira
Wyatt, a trans woman, has been in the
Navy for over 7 years and has deployed
across the globe.
Finally, Staff Sergeant Patricia King
is a trans woman who is retiring after
20 years, 20 years, and has led combat
infantry units over three deployments
in Afghanistan.
Over the last 3 years, 14,000
transgender servicemembers have
served openly and successfully. All five
service chiefs affirmed they do not
hamper lethality or cohesion.
Malice and ignorance cannot stop us
from giving medically necessary care
to individuals brave enough to serve.
We know what transgender service-
members bring to the fight. Let them
bring it.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Mrs.
DAVIS), who has aptly represented this
committee many times over.
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Chair,
I want to first thank my colleague
from California for her work to undo
the damage the President has done to
transgender servicemembers and our
Armed Forces.
This ban endangers transgender sol-
diers and tells all transgender Ameri-
cans that they are not fit to serve their
country. The Harry Truman amend-
ment will reverse the President’s
harmful ban and protect transgender
soldiers from further discrimination.
Though the administration cited con-
cerns over readiness, unit cohesion,
and medical costs to justify its ban, it
has been unable to back up its claims.
Mr. Chair, transgender troops have
served openly at home, overseas, and in
combat zones since 2016 without inci-
dent, a finding supported by the Chief
of Staff of every service branch.
The Truman amendment extends
Federal protections to transgender sol-
diers and makes it unlawful to exclude
anyone from service based on their
gender identity.
Transgender servicemembers, as my
colleague noted, testified in the House
that serving openly dramatically im-
proved their quality of life and their
service to our country.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this
amendment.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
claim the time in opposition, although
I am not completely sure I am opposed
to the amendment.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman from Texas is recognized for
5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.
HARTZLER).
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, first of
all, I would say, being from Missouri, I
would think that Harry Truman would
be shocked that this would try to be
named after him.
But anyway, this amendment elimi-
nates all enlistment requirements ex-
cept for the gender-neutral occupa-
tional standards.
It says, ‘‘Any qualifications estab-
lished or applied for eligibility for serv-
ice in an armed force shall take into
account only the ability of an indi-
vidual to meet gender-neutral occupa-
tional standards for military service,’’
and it goes on.
Intended or not, I am concerned that
this means that an individual with a

chronic illness, with zero ability to de-
ploy, could apply for and join the mili-
tary as long as the candidate meets the
gender-neutral occupational standards.
This is not how the military recruits
and retains the best military fighting
force. The military prides itself on
high medical and physical standards.
Currently, if you meet both standards,
then you may be granted the honor of
serving. The military is under no obli-
gation to accept individuals who do not
meet the medical criteria for service.
The military’s recruitment process
doesn’t screen for race, religion, color,
national origin, or sex. Neither does it
screen for gender preference.
It seems that the intent of this
amendment is to gut the President’s
recently implemented policy on
transgender servicemembers, which, I
will remind everyone, allows
transgenders to serve. It allows
transgenders to serve in their biologi-
cal sex, except for those—except for
those—who have undergone treatments
for gender dysphoria, which would
make them nondeployable.
I would remind my colleagues that
the DOD policy is based on medical
conditions, not an individual’s fluid
and preferred gender identity. It is
based on deployability and readiness,
not discrimination.
The Trump policy states that anyone
who meets military standards without
special accommodations can and
should be able to serve. This includes
transgender persons.
This amendment appears to gut the
military’s ability to ensure our sol-
diers, sailors, airmen, and marines can
medically serve by stating the DOD
can only take into account whether or
not an individual meets gender-neutral
occupational standards.
Military service is a privilege. It is
not a right. It would be unwise for us
to make exceptions to service for one
specific entity who could not meet
medical standards. That is why I urge
my colleagues to oppose this amend-
ment.
b 1900
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45
seconds to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN), my great colleague.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in support of Congress-
woman SPEIER’s amendment.
As an African American veteran, my
service and my background lead me to
believe that all Americans who want to
serve and can meet our military stand-
ards should be afforded the opportunity
to serve. This amendment, which codi-
fies the military’s existing non-
discrimination standards for all Ameri-
cans, would end President Trump’s ban
on transgender servicemembers and
would realize President Truman’s
promise of the equality of treatment
and opportunity for all those who serve
in our country’s defense that he made
when he desegregated the Armed
Forces.
Those who argue against transgender
service often say it disrupts unit cohe-
sion, erodes morale, and reduces effec-
tiveness. These arguments, regret-
tably, were used to keep African Amer-
ican, women, lesbian, and gay members
from serving. Transgender servicemem-
bers, we need their service; we need
their skills; we need their experience;
we need their courage; we need their
patriotism; and they need our support.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
only have myself to close, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, may I
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing.
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 13⁄4
minutes remaining.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
minute to my colleague from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. KENNEDY).
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the chairwoman for her pas-
sionate work on this issue.
The President’s transgender military
ban doesn’t just ignore science, expert
testimony, military experience, and
the advice of all five military chiefs of
staff, it ignores the men and women
who are willing to die in defense of our
freedom.
So I ask my colleagues one simple
question: Are you willing to look into
the eyes of a trans servicemember and
tell them that they are not qualified to
serve in our Nation’s Armed Forces
simply because of who they are, that
our country won’t allow them their
most basic freedom while expecting
them to die for our own?
If our Nation’s fundamental promise
that we are all created equal doesn’t
apply to all, then what are we asking
them to defend in the first place?
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30
seconds to the gentlewoman from New
Mexico (Ms. HAALAND), my great col-
league.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chairman, Amer-
ica must live up to its values, and that
means treating transgender service-
members with the same respect and
dignity as their counterparts. Both of
my parents served and only judged
their fellow servicemembers on one
standard: their ability to complete the
mission.
Transgender servicemembers honor-
ably serve this country and are not any
different than any other servicemem-
ber. They come from families where
service is a tradition. They go through
the same training and abide by the
same requirements. They deserve fair-
ness and respect, and I urge the pas-
sage of this amendment.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I am
prepared to close. How much time do I
have left, Mr. Chairman?
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 15
seconds remaining.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, these
are servicemembers who deserve our
support. These are servicemembers who
have already identified as trans mem-
bers in our military. They provide no
issues in terms of lethality or cohesion.
They serve with distinction, with
honor, and it is time for us to repeal
this ill-advised amendment.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, I would simply say my
view is that, if a servicemember is
qualified and can do the job without
some sort of special accommodation,
then we ought to take advantage of
that member’s service.
I note that Secretary Mattis has tes-
tified: ‘‘It is a bedrock principle of the
Department of Defense that any eligi-
ble individual who can meet the high
standards for military service without
special accommodations should be per-
mitted to serve.’’
That is what I believe. I have read
the gentlewoman’s amendment. It is
not clear to me that her amendment is
in violation of that statement or my
belief.
I heard and listened clearly to the
concerns Mrs. HARTZLER stated, so
maybe we need to continue, as we move
forward, to look at whether there are
other consequences to the language.
But it seems to me the standard that
Secretary Mattis has set out—if you
can do the job, you ought to be able to
do the job—that is the right one.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. JACKSON
LEE). The question is on the amend-
ment offered by the gentlewoman from

The question was taken; and the Act-

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. SPEIER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Chair, we with-
drew this particular amendment during
the committee’s disposition on the
NDAA at the request of Mr. KELLY be-
cause I recognized that he had some
important points to make. I think this
addresses his concern.
This particular amendment ensures
access to high-quality education on
family planning across military
branches to give our servicemembers
the tools they need to make the best
healthcare decisions for themselves
and their families.
According to DOD estimates, the
vast majority—some 95 percent—of all
women serving in our military are of
reproductive age, yet data from the De-
partment of Defense survey shows in-
sufficient access to comprehensive
family planning education among our
servicemembers. Inadequate family
planning education puts servicemem-
bers at high risk of unplanned preg-
nancies and creates uncertainty in the
retention of critical personnel.
Not surprisingly, research shows that
Active-Duty servicemembers of repro-
ductive age have a rate of unplanned
pregnancies that is 60 percent—I re-
peat, 60 percent—higher than that of
comparable women in the general pop-
ulation.
Education on family planning is not
just about contraception or pregnancy;
it is also about preventing sexually
transmitted infections, including HIV,
and staying healthy and informed.
This amendment would create a uni-
form education program across all
branches of the military so that serv-
icemembers receive current and medi-
cally accurate information. The edu-
cation would be mandatory within the
first year of service, and additional
education may be offered at the discre-
tion of each service branch.
This is an issue of basic healthcare,
but it is also a matter of military read-
iness and national security. Our troops
deserve the very best, regardless of
which branch of the military they
serve.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Mrs.
DAVIS).
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam
Chair, I rise today to support the
amendment offered by my colleague
from California (Ms. SPEIER). It pro-
vides our servicemembers with medi-
cally accurate educational resources to
help prevent unintended pregnancies
and the spread of sexually transmitted
infections.
The courageous Americans who put
their lives on the line for our country
deserve the best wellness education we
can offer, and keeping them healthy
helps maximize our military’s readi-
ness.
This commonsense amendment is
recommended by the Pentagon’s non-
partisan Defense Department Advisory
Committee on Women in the Services,
and, therefore, there should be broad
bipartisan support. I encourage my col-
leagues who support our troops to vote
for it.
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from New
Mexico (Ms. HAALAND).
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment, and I
want to highlight three key points:
The military women of reproductive
age lack access to adequate healthcare.
This is a healthcare problem.
Unplanned pregnancies hamper readi-
ness and make it harder for women to
advance their careers, and this per-
sonnel issue can be easily remedied.
A service branch shouldn’t determine
the quality of care our servicemembers
should have, and this is an equality
issue.
I thank Chairwoman SPEIER, and I
urge passage of this amendment.
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Chair, I
rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Missouri is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I rise today in opposition to this
amendment, which establishes and
mandates the establishment of a cur-
riculum to be used in education pro-
grams on family planning for every
military serviceman and -woman, and I
will be the first to say I think this
amendment is excessive.
We already have DOD policy that re-
quires the defense health agency in
each military service medical depart-
ment to administer its own training on
counseling and methods of contracep-
tion to all DOD healthcare providers so
that they may provide assistance to
our military members when it is need-
ed.
In addition, I am a former teacher,
and I believe knowledge is important,
but a simple brochure would suffice;
however, this amendment is over the
top. It would require an entire cur-
riculum to be developed, which would
be used in education programs.
It requires every military member,
men and women, to come in off the
field, and, instead of honing their skills
on a target range or in the cockpit,
they would be subjected to perhaps
hours of PowerPoint presentations,
worksheets, and lectures not on what
China is doing in the South China Sea
or the latest tactics of Russian aggres-
sion, but on family planning.
Not only would this amendment force
every servicemember to be subjected to
this curriculum and programming, sug-
gesting that this training is more im-
portant than their military training,
but it ambiguously defines what com-
prehensive family planning is. As writ-
ten in this amendment, this training
would include information about the
prevention of unintended pregnancy
and the importance of providing com-
prehensive family planning.
I am extremely concerned this am-
biguous terminology will be inter-
preted to include abortion counseling
or services. We already see this dan-
gerous terminology in places like New
York, where their comprehensive fam-
ily planning program funds over 57
Planned Parenthoods.
I would like to know from the author
of this amendment whether this
amendment encompasses information
about abortion services as part of com-
prehensive family planning services.
Madam Chair, I yield 10 seconds to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
SPEIER) to answer this question.
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman from Missouri for
yielding.
Let me be clear, we are already pro-
viding this service in the branches.
They are not uniform. This would
make it uniform. So whatever is being
provided now would continue to be pro-
vided, but it would be consistent and
uniform.
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Chair, it
sounds like a little ambiguous answer
there. We don’t know if this includes
abortion counseling or not.
Madam Chair, I just think that this
is an unnecessary mandate to push
family planning curriculum on a cap-
tive audience, and perhaps it is not the
best use of the time of our military.
Other government employees are not
forced to leave their job duties to at-
tend family planning training. You

don’t hear of the Department of Edu-
cation having their employees go or
the Department of Transportation or
any of the other departments, yet we
want to take our soldiers, sailors, air-
men, and marines off the training field
and bring them in for this curriculum.
I would suggest that we should not
target our military population and use
their precious time in this way. I be-
lieve too much is at stake.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Chair, I really
object to my good friend and col-
league’s definition of what this is actu-
ally doing. We are already providing
this kind of training, this kind of edu-
cation to our servicemembers in all our
branches. We do know that the Navy
and Marines are considered to do it
best, while the Army and Air Force
have room for improvement.
A recent study found that female
Army soldiers have more children in
their first 2 years of enlistment and
miss more work than do females in
other military branches, in part due to
the differences in policies on birth con-
trol education.
The Navy’s approach is much more
comprehensive, and it is on that basis
that we want to have all of the services
providing the same level of education
as the Navy and Air Force.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
b 1915
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Chair, I ap-
preciate what my colleague is trying to
do, but I do think that it is unneces-
sary, it is excessive, and it is redun-
dant. The author of the amendment al-
ready said it is already being done. And
servicemembers already have access to
counseling on methods of contracep-
tion, so we should not require manda-
tory training for every servicemember
and have this expanded curriculum and
bring them off the training field and sit
them down for a PowerPoint presen-
tation.
Madam Chair, I urge all my col-
leagues to join me in opposing this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I support
Amendment No. 6 to H.R.2500, offered by my
colleague from California, Ms. Speier. It pro-
vides our servicemembers with medically-ac-
curate educational resources to help prevent
unintended pregnancies and the spread of
sexually transmitted infections. As a member
of the Armed Services Committee and a
former board member of Planned Parenthood
Mar Monte, I’ve seen first-hand the importance
of family planning education, especially in our
military. The courageous Americans who put
their lives on the line for our country deserve
the best wellness education we can offer.
Keeping them healthy helps maximize our mili-
tary’s readiness. This common-sense amend-
ment is recommended by the Pentagon’s non-
partisan Defense Advisory Committee on
Women in the Services. Therefore, there
should be broad bipartisan support, and I en-
courage my colleagues who support our

AMENDMENT NO. 9 OFFERED BY MR. BRINDISI
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 9 printed in
part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. BRINDISI. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle A of title VIII, add
the following new section:
SEC. 815. ADDITION OF DOMESTICALLY PRO-
DUCED STAINLESS STEEL FLAT-
WARE AND DINNERWARE TO THE
BERRY AMENDMENT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 2533a(b) of title
10, United States Code, is amended by adding
at the end the following new paragraphs:
‘‘(3) Stainless steel flatware.
‘‘(4) Dinnerware.’’.
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—Paragraphs (3) and
(4) of section 2533a(b) of title 10, United
States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall
apply with respect to contracts entered into
on or after the date occurring 1 year after
the date of the enactment of this Act.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from New York (Mr. BRINDISI) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. BRINDISI. Madam Chair, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, I rise today in support
of my bipartisan amendment, and I
would like to thank Congressman
MCKINLEY for leading this important
effort with me.
This amendment would reinstate the
Berry amendment’s longstanding De-
partment of Defense domestic sourcing
requirement for stainless steel flat-
ware.
This amendment would support
American manufacturers, ensure our
servicemembers are using safe flatware
and dinnerware, and gives the Depart-
ment of Defense flexibility should
American-made flatware not be avail-
able or affordable.
There is historical precedent for this
provision. In fact, from 1976 to 2006, the
Berry amendment included a domestic
sourcing requirement for stainless
steel flatware, but it was removed in
the 2007 NDAA due to a lack of domes-
tic supply.
Since then, domestic flatware pro-
duction has rebounded significantly. In
the past decade, domestic manufactur-
ers have sold over $9 million in flat-
ware to the Federal Government. This
rebound has led to a stable domestic
supply chain and manufacturer base.
Our American manufacturers have
demonstrated their reliability as a sta-
ble domestic supplier of stainless steel
flatware to Federal customers, which
supports restoring the longstanding do-
mestic sourcing requirement.
As my colleagues know, President
Trump is a staunch supporter of Amer-
ican manufacturers, a commitment to
American jobs that he and I share.
Congress constantly pays lip service
to bringing back good-paying American
jobs and keeping them here. Well, this
is an opportunity for my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to actually do it.
Reinstating the Berry amendment’s
domestic sourcing provision for stain-
less steel flatware is a win-win for ev-
eryone involved. It supports local man-
ufacturing in the U.S., and DOD would
retain the ability to waive the domes-
tic sourcing requirement if domestic
flatware could not be procured at mar-
ket prices.
In my view, this should not be a dif-
ficult question. When choosing between
supporting and creating American jobs
over Chinese jobs, I will choose hard-
working Americans every time, and I
urge my colleagues to do the same by
supporting this amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, this is the third year
in a row, I believe, we have had this at-
tempt to require DOD to only buy
knives and forks and spoons from a cer-
tain supplier.
I opposed it when it was brought by a
Republican and I oppose it when it is
brought this year as well.
In all 3 years, I have yet to hear a na-
tional security justification to dictate
where DOD buys its knives and forks
and spoons and plates. I have not heard
it yet.
At one point, there was a view that
certain textiles and food were of such
importance to the functioning of our
military, that there needed to be re-
strictions on where they were pro-
cured. Again, I have not heard that
when it comes to knives and forks.
I will say that adding this mandate
will hurt our troops, because the only
situation in which DOD would choose
other than a domestic supplier would
be if it saves money if you can buy
knives and forks and spoons cheaper
from some other supplier. So that
means you are taking away money
from ammunition or whatever it is and
spending more than you would other-
wise need to spend on your plates and
knives and forks. I can’t tell you how
much, probably not a lot, but it takes
away money for other vital programs.
The big question I have, Madam
Chair, is where does this stop? I admire

all Members who try to support manu-
facturing in his or her district. That is
part of our job as Members of Congress.
Got it.
But if we are going to say, ‘‘Okay.
The DOD has got to buy their plates
and cups and knives and forks and
spoons from a domestic supplier in my
district,’’ what about the napkins?
What about the soap to wash your
hands? Where does it stop?
I don’t think that we want to go
down this road without a clear na-
tional security reason to limit the sup-
pliers available to DOD.
Computer chips, that is one thing,
but knives and forks, that is something
else.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BRINDISI. Madam Chair, this
amendment would not cost the Depart-
ment of Defense any more money. In
fact, this amendment retains all exist-
ing waivers under the Berry amend-
ment.
If there were significant negative
charges to the price or quality of do-
mestic flatware, the Department of De-
fense will be able to use other sources
of flatware and would be able to import
flatware.
This amendment reaches beyond flat-
ware and would support multiple
American manufacturers.
This amendment would also allow
American manufacturers all over the
country to compete against each other
to provide our servicemembers with
American-made flatware.
Unlike the items that were men-
tioned that have never been included in
the Berry amendment, flatware was in-
cluded in the Berry amendment for 30
years. It was only removed because do-
mestic supply could not sustain the
Pentagon’s demand at the time.
Domestic supply has since rebounded.
Because of this, I see no reason why
not to reinstate this longstanding pro-
vision that would help American manu-
facturing.
I would argue that it is in our na-
tional security interest, because sup-
porting American manufacturing, sup-
porting American jobs helps grow our
economy, helps create more taxpayers
who then contribute revenue to fund
our military. I would much rather sup-
port American manufacturers who pay
taxes in this country than support
manufacturers in China and support
the Chinese economy.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
reserve the balance of my time to
close.
Mr. BRINDISI. Madam Chair, I urge
adoption of the amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair,
creating domestic jobs in industry
after industry is not the primary pur-
pose of the Department of Defense, es-
pecially without a national security
reason to do so.
What this amendment would do, if it
does anything, is to add another cat-
egory of bureaucracy and burdens that
the Department of Defense has got to
go through before it decides where it is
going to procure its plates and spoons.
This has not been the law since 2006.
I think our military folks have been
reasonably well fed in the 13 years
since this was last part of the law.
Again, the only reason to do it is if
the domestic supplier is not cheaper.
So it costs money, if it does anything.
Madam Chair, there are lots of im-
portant national security issues. Man-
dating where the Department of De-
fense gets its plates and spoons and
cups and bowls and however else you
want to define dinnerware, I do not
think, is appropriate, and I urge oppo-
sition to the amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle E of title X, insert
the following:
SEC. 10ll. UNITED STATES MUNITIONS LIST.
The President may not remove from the
United States Munitions List any item that
was included in category I, II, or III of the
United States Munitions List, as in effect on
August 31, 2017.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from California (Mrs. TORRES) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Chair, my amendment would
maintain congressional oversight over
certain weapons sales and ensure that
dangerous weapons do not end up in the
wrong hands.
Whatever our views on firearm policy
may be, we should all be able to agree
that putting more firearms in the
wrong hands would make the world a
lot more dangerous.
Since the passage of the Arms Export
Control Act in 1976, the State Depart-
ment has overseen licensing authority
for exporting deadly weapons, sup-
ported by congressional oversight au-
thority.
Under Republican Presidents and
Democratic Presidents alike, this has
been the system in place, so the ex-
perts who spend their lives monitoring
hotspots around the world can put U.S.
national security interests first, and
not profits for weapons manufacturers.
That is why many Members have ex-
pressed concern about the Trump ad-
ministration’s plan to change our fire-
arm export licensing system.
Under the administration’s plan, fire-
arms and other items in categories 1, 2,
and 3 of the United States Munitions
List would move from the Commerce
Control List. That may sound like a
technical change, but it would have
real world consequences.
Congress would lose oversight over
sales, preventing this body from object-
ing to sales that could harm national
security or lead to human rights viola-
tions.
We would also be taking licensing au-
thority for exporting deadly weapons
away from the State Department and
giving it to the Commerce Department,
without any clear evidence that Com-
merce has the expertise or capacity to
handle this new responsibility.
This amendment would stop that
plan from going forward.
To be clear, this amendment would
not prevent the export of firearms.
This amendment would not create any
new restrictions on firearms exports.
This amendment would simply keep
the status quo in place so we can focus
our efforts on strengthening the cur-
rent system.
When it comes to keeping firearms
out of the hands of terrorists and drug
cartels, we should err on the side of
caution.
That is what this amendment does.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

ment.

Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Chair, I stand
in opposition to the amendment offered
by my dear colleague, Mrs. TORRES,
that prohibits the President from re-
moving any items listed in categories
1, 2, and 3 of the U.S. Munitions List.
One of the first Oversight and Inves-
tigations Subcommittee hearings this
year was a review of a large inter-
agency process to modernize the
United States Munitions List to ensure
the State Department retained over-
sight over only the most critical de-
fense articles with military end-use.
The decision to transfer certain de-
fense articles and services from State
to Commerce had strong, bipartisan
support but got caught up in a debate
that had nothing to do with export con-
trol reform.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5551
July 10, 2019
The process to move certain defense
articles has already begun. In fact,
here are just some of the categories of
weapons that have already moved to
Commerce licensing controls: launch
vehicles and missiles, explosives, mili-
tary aircraft, submersible vessels,
tanks, and the list goes on. Once again,
these defense articles have already
moved to Commerce control.
This rule change should be finalized.
After years of input from both sides of
the aisle to make the change from
State to Commerce, there is no reason
this decision, which started in the last
administration, needs to be delayed
any longer.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam
Chair, it is true that parts and compo-
nents for military equipment have been
moved to the CCL. However, none of
the items previously transferred from
the USML to the CCL were complete
weapons that would allow a soldier to
aim and fire on a target.
The Obama administration did not
move, or even propose to move, fire-
arms and ammunition. They saw what
happened at Newtown and knew that
we needed to be cautious about these
weapons.
If the administration’s proposal goes
through, it would be the first time that
the Commerce Department was put in
charge of licensing for lethal weapons
designed to kill people. This is not
business as usual.
Voting ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment will
prevent this administration from going
beyond what the Obama administra-
tion chose to do by ensuring that ex-
ports of firearms and ammunition re-
main under the jurisdiction of the
State Department, with congressional
oversight.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Chair, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, this is a very important issue
and something that our committee
worked on over a long stretch of time
on export controls. We made very care-
fully thought-out reforms in that proc-
ess.
The process was a nightmare. Dual-
use was the big problem. We could
have, just as an example, a bolt that
happened to go into a piece of military
equipment. If it was to be put in some-
thing else, it was subject to this far
more aggressive export control thing.
But we fixed all of that.
What the gentlewoman is trying to
prevent is stepping way over the line
here and allowing the export of things
that really are clearly within the mili-
tary use concern. We covered what
wasn’t. This goes beyond that and un-
dermines our ability to make sure that
we are not giving potential adversaries
access to weapons that can jeopardize
our national security.
I do think we need to take this step
to make sure that the Trump adminis-
tration doesn’t go beyond what we
worked out. I realize this word is being
overused, but we did work this out in a
bipartisan way. With the chairman’s
help, we included this in the National
Defense Act a few years ago. That was
helpful.
This goes too far by the President. I
think this amendment is perfectly ap-
propriate.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Chair, it is im-
portant to point out that not all fire-
arms will move to Commerce. The
State Department will continue to re-
tain oversight for certain firearms:
fully automatic firearms; modern artil-
lery; silencers, components, parts, and
accessories specially designed for auto-
matic firearms and shotguns. The list
goes on. It is actually a long list of
firearms-related components that will
stay on USML.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam
Chair, no one here is arguing against
firearm exports, and no one here is try-
ing to place new restrictions on manu-
facturers. What we are asking is to
keep the system we have so that Con-
gress can continue to do its job and
make sure that deadly weapons don’t
end up in the wrong hands.
Madam Chair, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Chair, the
USML and the CCL are for listed ex-
ports of firearms. This jurisdictional
transfer does not govern the illicit
transfer of firearms that are often used
in violent crimes and human rights
abuses overseas.
The U.S. Government will continue
its longstanding end-use modernizing
efforts, including vetting of potential
end-users, to help prevent human
rights abuses.
As I stated during my opening re-
marks, when assessing Commerce’s
ability to take over this responsibility,
it is hugely important to recognize ev-
erything that Commerce is already
now in charge of, including, as I men-
tioned earlier, launch vehicles and mis-
siles, explosives, military aircraft, sub-
mersible vessels, tanks, and the list
goes on.
This is not a new function for Com-
merce. It is a transition that started
years ago during the last administra-
tion. This new rule should be finalized.
What shouldn’t be lost in this debate
is how effectively Commerce is han-
dling this responsibility with all the
very important parts and categories
that have already moved to their De-
partment.
Madam Chair, I urge all of my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and
I yield back the balance of my time.

tlewoman from California (Mrs.

AMENDMENT NO. 11 OFFERED BY MR. CONNOLLY
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 11 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of title XI, add the following:
SEC. 1113. LIMITATION ON TRANSFER OF OFFICE
OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT.
The President or his designee may not
take any action to transfer, transition,
merge, or consolidate any functions, respon-
sibilities, programs, authorities, information
technology systems, staff, resources, or
records of the Office of Personnel to or with
the General Services Administration, the Of-
fice of Management and Budget, or the Exec-
utive Office of the President.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Virginia.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, the Trump administra-
tion has proposed to abolish the Office
of Personnel Management altogether
and give the White House control of
governmentwide Federal employee
policies.
My simple amendment would pro-
hibit that proposed reorganization
from being implemented because, as
my subcommittee has uncovered, this
proposal lacks merit, justification, or
even a coherent rationale. That is the
opinion of the Government Account-
ability Office, not just me.
The GAO has testified that OPM’s
leaders ‘‘have not established outcome-
oriented goals, developed a cost-benefit
analysis or implementation plans, and
have not fully involved or commu-
nicated their efforts with the Congress,
employees, and other key stake-
holders.’’
Both Republicans and Democrats on
our subcommittee expressed deep skep-
ticism about the so-called plan.
My Republican counterpart in the
Senate, Senator JAMES LANKFORD, said,
‘‘It’s hard to get to a determination of
how this makes things better.’’
I couldn’t agree more. OPM’s 5,500
employees run programs that serve our
Federal Government’s 2.7 million ac-
tive employees.
OPM administers, for example, the
largest employer-sponsored health in-
surance program in the world and proc-
esses the world’s largest retirement

program for 2.5 million Federal retirees
and their survivors.
It provides human services con-
sulting and regulates the implementa-
tion of laws essential to our Nation’s
merit-based civil service, including the
Hatch Act, which prohibits Federal em-
ployees from using Federal resources
for political and campaign purposes.
It also provides dental, vision, and
medical insurance to 8 million Federal
employees and their families.
In short, OPM is the agency that
serves the people who serve the Amer-
ican people.
On May 21, our subcommittee held a
hearing that eviscerated the adminis-
tration’s plan to eliminate OPM. I told
Acting Director Weichert at that time
that the plan was dead on arrival as
submitted and that she needed to start
over to find a way to work together on
a bipartisan basis to rebuild OPM the
right way. She said she would, and I
took her at her word. Despite these
clear messages and continued over-
sight, Ms. Weichert failed to live up to
her end of the agreement.
Recently, OPM officials announced
their intention to lay off or possibly
furlough 150 employees because they
could not afford to keep them on the
payroll, they claimed. That threat was
made in spite of the proposed appro-
priations levels, which are above what
would be needed to fill any budget gap.
The administration’s inadequate plan
to dismantle OPM has been a disaster.
After realizing that it cannot prevail
on the merits, the administration is
now resorting to blackmail.
On June 27, our subcommittee held
another hearing to question OPM offi-
cials on the lack of documents pro-
vided to Congress about the plan to
eliminate OPM. At that hearing, OPM
admitted they have failed to determine
whether actions they are already tak-
ing to eliminate OPM are even legal.
They could not provide the underlying
legal guidance justifying their action.
The language in this simple amend-
ment largely mirrors language already
included in the Financial Services and
General Government Appropriations
Act for fiscal year 2020 already passed
by the House last month.
We have not seen anything, unfortu-
nately, from the administration to con-
vince us that any part of this plan is a
good idea and would make our Federal
Government more effective and effi-
cient. In fact, GAO has said that the
administration’s proposal could further
hinder the Federal retirement backlog
by creating additional uncertainty.
That could make it difficult for OPM
to plan large-scale changes in its oper-
ations.
The Acting Director of OPM and the
Deputy Director for Management of
OMB was reported as saying that the
administration plans ‘‘to play chicken
with Congress’’ to effectuate its pro-
posal to eliminate OPM.
We must pass this amendment, as we
did on the appropriations bill, to send a
clear message that threatening Con-
gress is not the way to do business,
whether it is with a Republican admin-
istration or a Democratic administra-
tion.
I urge my colleagues to work with us
to ensure that Federal employees are
treated with respect and are protected
through the OPM process.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Chair, I
rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, it is true that on June
21, 2018, President Trump’s Office of
Management and Budget released a
plan to reorganize the executive
branch. In that plan, they identified
numerous ways to eliminate duplica-
tive programs, to combat waste, fraud,
and abuse in the government. One of
the recommendations would merge the
Office of Personnel Management with
the General Services Administration.
I think it is important that we high-
light the word ‘‘merge.’’ This is not an
elimination of OPM. It is a merger of
the two.
OPM’s employees work hard to serve
retiring Federal employees. Unfortu-
nately, they are working with outdated
20th-century technology. It is ex-
tremely difficult for them to be able to
attract IT talent necessary to operate
this outdated IT system.
The intent of OPM’s proposed merger
is to fix this problem by creating one
agency focused on delivering efficient,
effective employee services govern-
mentwide.
Admittedly, OPM has not shown that
this is an effective way to address the
many problems that are facing OPM.
Further, it is true that despite re-
peated requests for legal analysis on
the administrative authorities and
cost-benefit analysis, the Oversight
and Reform Committee continues to
wait for supporting information.
b 1945
The gentleman from Virginia knows
that we have supported that effort to
try to get that information so that we
can do our job.
The whole challenge that we are fac-
ing is, indeed, ongoing. And while I
share the gentleman’s frustration with
the lack of information to inform our
committee, this amendment is not the
answer. We have the same goal. We
want to find ways to improve services
for Federal employees and get retire-
ment benefits for Federal retirees. But
while we search for a solution, we need
to keep all solutions and all options on
the table.
Maybe a merger could gain consider-
able operational efficiencies, including
providing support to OPM’s belea-
guered IT operation. If we see any evi-
dence to support that, we should give
this proposal serious consideration.
We should also give serious consider-
ation to other proposals. If the chair-
man of the Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee’s Government Operations Sub-
committee is aware of any other pro-
posals, I would certainly hope and en-
courage him to incorporate those pro-
posals into bipartisan oversight efforts.
But in the meantime, this amend-
ment does nothing to help OPM’s mis-
sion, and actively closes options to
help OPM. For that reason, I stand in
opposition to this amendment, but
look forward to working with the gen-
tleman as we move forward.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Chair, may
I inquire of the Chair how much time is
remaining on both sides.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Virginia has 30 seconds remain-
ing. The gentleman from Georgia has
11⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Chair, I am
prepared to allow my friend to close,
and then I will close. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Chair, I
would just again reiterate that we need
to keep all options on the table, and
this amendment takes a possible solu-
tion off the table.
I think we just need to do further re-
search and consider this. I just encour-
age my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Chair-
woman, I am sad my good friend, who
I know shares my concerns, feels the
need to oppose an amendment that is
designed to prevent a very bad thing
from happening that has no rationale,
has no supporting documentation, and
has threatened Congress with extor-
tion. We will RIF 150 people if you
don’t do what we want—even though
you don’t quite know what we want—

should tolerate that. This amendment
needs to pass, as it did in the appro-
priations bill.

(a) NICS RECORDS.—Section 101(b) of the
NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007
(34 U.S.C. 40911(b)) is amended—
(1) by redesignating paragraph (2) as para-
graph (3); and
(2) by inserting after paragraph (1), the fol-

‘‘(2) DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.—Not later

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Virginia.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chairwoman, this amend-
ment is simple, bipartisan, and has the
support of leading domestic violence
prevention advocates and veteran serv-
ice organizations.
First of all, I want to thank my
friend and colleague from New York, a
Republican, Mr. PETER KING, for co-
sponsoring this amendment. PETER is a
veteran and a respected voice in na-
tional security issues in the House, and
his support is appreciated immensely.
Our amendment does two things:
First, it codifies existing Department
of Defense policy which requires DOD
to report to the National Instant
Criminal Background Check System
servicemembers who are prohibited
from purchasing firearms pursuant to
current law.
Again, this provision of the amend-
ment merely codifies existing DOD pol-
icy as outlined in the instruction
6400.06 and places no new legal restric-
tions on access to firearms.
This provision is responsive to the
DOD inspector general’s report, ‘‘Eval-
uation of Military Services’ Law En-
forcement Responses to Domestic Vio-
lence Incidents’’ within the military.
In that report, the IG found that the
DOD has failed consistently to report
domestic violence convictions within
DOD that would have disqualified a
servicemember from purchasing a fire-
arm.
One of the domestic abuses that DOD
failed to report to the FBI was Devin
Kelley, who entered a house of worship
in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in No-
vember of 2017, and killed 27 people
with guns he should have been prohib-
ited from purchasing under current
law.
According to the IG, of the 219 do-
mestic violence cases examined at
eight military installations, 201 were
found not to comply with at least one
of the Defense Department’s policies
for reporting domestic violence.
In other words, more than 90 percent
of the cases were not properly reported.
And in four of five cases, 86 percent
were not properly reported to the FBI
or the NICS. That is a problem because
we know NICS works.
According to the FBI, from Novem-
ber 30, 1998, through December 31 of
2018, 206,080 gun purchases were denied
based on convictions of domestic vio-
lence or protective orders based on do-
mestic violence.
Codifying this reporting requirement
gives it more teeth and helps Congress
in its oversight of these important pub-
lic safety measures that protect all of
our military and their families.
The second part of the amendment
would task DOD with studying the fea-
sibility of creating a database of mili-
tary protective orders issued in re-
sponse to domestic violence and report-
ing such MPOs to NICS or establishing
a process by which military judges
could issue protective orders in re-
sponse to domestic violence.
This provision is responsive to the in-
spector general’s report on the inves-
tigation of the United States Air
Force’s failure to submit Devin
Kelley’s criminal history information
to the FBI.
Under current law, a military protec-
tive order issued in response to a do-
mestic violence incident does not pro-
hibit an individual from purchasing a
firearm. However, a comparable civil-
ian protective order would.
The IG recommended that the Sec-
retary of Defense consider pursuing
legislation amending the Gun Control
Act to specifically include military
protective orders.
The Senate-passed National Defense
Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019
included a provision which would have
mandated that DOD create a mecha-
nism by which military judges could
issue protective orders that would trig-
ger prohibitions on firearm purchases
in a Republican Senate.
We are sensitive to the concerns
about due process and mandates re-
garding this matter. That is why we
have adopted a middle ground that re-
quires DOD to study the feasibility of
complying with the IG recommenda-
tions and MPOs and the Gun Control
Act, as well as to study the feasibility
of establishing a system that the Sen-
ate NDAA would have established.
According to the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, 30 percent of female vet-
erans reported having been a victim of
domestic violence within their adult
life, and 22 percent say the abuse oc-
curred while on Active Duty. Accord-
ing to the DOD, in more than 30 per-
cent of domestic violence cases—1,100
out of 3,000—where the victim is a
member of the military, their spouse is
also a member of the military. This
amendment is not about protecting ci-
vilians only, but about protecting
those in uniform especially.
In closing, I want to thank all of the
organizations that have endorsed this
bipartisan amendment including: the
National Coalition Against Domestic
Violence, Futures Without Violence,
Domestic Violence Legal Empower-
ment and Appeals Project, Service
Women’s Action Network, and Protect
Our Defenders.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair-
woman, I claim the time in opposition
to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair-
woman, I would say the first part of
the gentleman’s amendment is cer-
tainly appropriate. There is no ques-
tion that DOD did not do what it
should in reporting to the national
database and there have been instances
where that made a difference, tragic
instances.
So requiring DOD to report within 3
days, I think, as the gentleman from
Virginia said, codifying the current
policy, I think makes sense. I hope
someday we can get to the point, by
the way, where we require State and
local governments to report within 3
days as well, because as the study was
conducted on DOD’s failure to report to
the database, it turns out that some
State and localities are even worse. So
I think we all ought to up our game
when it comes to that.
I do want to express some concerns,
however, about the second part of the
gentleman’s amendment. It requires a
feasibility study on a military data-
base for military protective orders. If
it is a feasibility study about whether
it is technically possible to have a
database, that is one thing. But it is
important for Members to understand
that military protective orders are
issued by commanders, and do not have
any sort of due process that is associ-
ated with civilian protective orders or
much due process at all.
Now, military members can go and
get a civilian protective order with ap-
propriate due process. But right now, a

military protective order by com-
manders is just issued at the request of
the victim or the victim’s advocate.
There are some opinions that there are
even instances where this process has
been abused.
I just think we should be careful in
treading down a road where we do not
provide due process with significant
consequences. So as the gentleman
noted, there are some related provi-
sions in the Senate bill. I think it
would be appropriate to take this
measure and look deeper into those
consequences, especially to ensure that
all servicemembers have due process as
well as all servicemembers and civil-
ians have the protection that the gen-
tleman is seeking to achieve.

SEC. 5ll. REVIEW OF INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER

ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.
(a) LIST OF PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS.—

(A) each institution of higher education
that receives funds under the Department of

ance Program if the institution does not
meet the financial responsibility standards
under section 498 of the Higher Education
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1099c).
(2) PUBLICATION REQUIRED.—The results of

shall be made available on a publicly acces-
sible website of the Department of Defense
not later than 30 days after the date on
which the audit is complete.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. SHALALA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Chairwoman,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chairwoman, the Department
of Defense Tuition Assistance program
provides financial assistance to serv-
icemembers for voluntary off-duty edu-
cation programs in support of profes-
sional and personal development.
Tuition assistance is available for
courses that are offered in the class-
room or by distance learning and are
part of an approved academic degree or
certification program.
These courses must be offered by
schools that are recognized by the
United States Department of Edu-
cation, and they must abide by all
rules governing the higher education
sector.
Because of a loophole that exists in
Federal law, known as the GI Bill loop-
hole, however, many for-profit colleges
target veterans and servicemembers
with aggressive and deceptive recruit-
ing tactics in order to collect as much
GI Bill and DOD revenue as possible.
b 2000
In fact, research has demonstrated
that the for-profit college sector is the
only sector in higher education that in-
creases tuition when additional Fed-
eral student aid becomes available. As
one for-profit college president turned
whistleblower told veterans’ organiza-
tions and Federal officials last sum-
mer:
We cleaned up all our materials, but be-
hind closed doors, our recruiters will do any-
thing and say anything to get their hands on
GI benefits and DOD Tuition Assistance
funds.
This is simply unacceptable. Through
the selfless sacrifice of our men and
women in uniform, we as citizens re-
ceive freedom, a freedom that many
people in this world envy. We owe an
immense debt of gratitude to those
who serve and must not allow anyone
to abuse their benefits.
Madam Chair, this amendment is
simple, and it will ensure that vet-
erans, Active Duty servicemembers,
and their families are not taken advan-
tage of by anyone in the predatory for-
profit college sector. This amendment
requires the Secretary of Defense to
publish on its website the distribution
of DOD Tuition Assistance funds at in-
stitutions of higher education and con-
duct an audit for any for-profit institu-
tion that fails to meet the financial re-
sponsibility standards set in the Higher
Education Act of 1965.
Madam Chair, a for-profit college
has, by definition, a fiduciary duty to
its shareholders to maximize profits.
Success is determined by the amount
of tuition revenue brought in and the
profits made, not by the quality of edu-
cation provided to its students.
We speak about the good and bad ac-
tors in the for-profit college sector, and
this amendment seeks to tell us just
that. I know that my good friends on
the other side of the aisle have always
supported our veterans. I know they
deeply care about fiscally responsible
policies and transparency.
Supporting our veterans and Active
Duty servicemembers has historically
drawn large, bipartisan support. It is
incumbent upon us as elected officials
to put forth an accountability system
that distinguishes bad actors from
good actors and looks out for the
American taxpayer and protects our
military community.
Madam Chair, this is personal for me.
Every generation of my family has
served in our country’s military, and
all have used their educational bene-
fits. I know the value of a good edu-
cation. I have seen it firsthand in my
four decades as an educator and as a
college president. Our veterans deserve
better than policies that allow bad ac-
tors in our education system to take
advantage of their service and their
sacrifice.
I want to thank my colleagues who
have worked with me on this issue and
my good friend, Congresswoman KATIE
PORTER, for cosponsoring this amend-
ment. I urge my colleagues to support
this commonsense amendment and
stand on the side of our servicemem-
bers.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I rise in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman

Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Chair, my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle are relentless in
their pursuit to eliminate an entire
sector of postsecondary education—
proprietary institutions, or taxpaying
institutions.
In their zealous effort to bury these
types of institutions under additional
red tape and redundant bureaucratic
mandates, Democrats are wasting tax-
payer dollars and valuable Pentagon
time.
I have said during our Education and
Labor Committee hearings, and I will
say it again and again, I support ac-
countability for all postsecondary edu-
cation institutions. Students should
not be taken advantage of or harmed at
any institution. That is why Congress
and the armed services have tough
standards in place that hold all institu-
tions accountable for taxpayer dollars.
These requirements include two
agencies already overseeing schools
participating in aid programs. The
Pentagon is already required through
the Tuition Assistance program to
evaluate the educational institutions’
overall effectiveness in administering
its academic program, courses, and
general customer satisfaction; and the
Department of Education is tasked
with—and has the expertise to—mon-
itor the school’s fiscal health according
to standards established by the Amer-
ican Institute of Certified Public Ac-
countants. If institutions fail to meet
either of these requirements, there are
serious consequences.
In addition to doubling bureaucracy,
this amendment fails to help students
and their families in any meaningful
way.

being spent properly when those insti-
tutions have been identified.
My amendment allows the Secretary
to broadly apply much-needed over-
sight to a sector that continues to de-
fraud servicemembers and siphons off
billions of dollars from the Federal
Government.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I would like to inquire of the
Chair how much time is remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
has 23⁄4 minutes remaining.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I yield 11⁄4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
SMUCKER).
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Chair, I
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing.
I rise today in opposition, as well, to
this amendment which seeks to limit
education choices for our Nation’s
servicemembers. Under current law, in-
stitutions receiving Federal funding
must meet the financial responsibility
standards under the Higher Education
Act. That is why the Department of
Defense and the Department of Edu-
cation are already required to oversee
and evaluate an educational institu-
tion’s fiscal health and academic pro-
gramming. Let me repeat, they are al-
ready required to do that.
This amendment is not only unneces-
sary, but it is also misleading. Let’s be
honest about what this amendment is
really about. It is just another effort at
eliminating all for-profit higher edu-
cation institutions.
Just a few weeks ago, I met with a
group of veterans from my district who
are attending or recently graduated
from YTI Career Institute in Lan-
caster. They each shared similar sto-
ries about how traditional institutions
of higher education—and I have a lot of
good ones in my district—but in this
particular instance they did not meet
their needs.
YTI Career Institute in Lancaster, a
for-profit institution, did meet their
needs and offered them a pathway to
fast-track them into the workforce.
Why should we take this option
away?
These veterans were very concerned
that the programs which have worked
so well for them and many others may
be eliminated by this overregulation.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I yield the gentleman from
Pennsylvania an additional 15 seconds.
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Chair, if my
colleagues truly were interested in im-
proving accountability, then they
would apply these standards to all in-
stitutions of higher learning, not just
the ones they dislike.
I strongly oppose this unneeded
amendment.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P.
ROE).
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Chair, I am a U.S. Army vet-
eran who has used the GI Bill.
While I strongly support being good
stewards of resources expended by the
Department of Defense to various edu-
cational institutions across the Nation,
the amendment offered by my friend
across the aisle goes too far by includ-
ing the term proprietary when refer-
ring to universities. Congress and the
Department of Education have set
standards of financial responsibility
and are already reviewing whether cer-
tain colleges and universities meet
those standards.
Let’s continue to hold all univer-
sities accountable for these standards,
not just a select few. There is no rea-
son for this amendment to exclude any
colleges because all students deserve to
know that their choice of school meets
Federally set responsibility standards
whether public, private, or proprietary.
Fortunately, this is already hap-
pening.
Unfortunately, this amendment is
duplicative of the work that the De-
partments of Defense and Education
are conducting and is simply an effort
to further categorize colleges and uni-
versities and hold them to different
levels of scrutiny.
Let’s work together to make sure all
students have access to a high quality,
affordable education in a setting and
format that works best for them.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I want to reiterate again what I
said before: we support veterans. We
want them to get a great education,
but we want them to have the choices
that they have fought for. They have
sacrificed for freedoms for our country,
and they deserve to have all the free-
doms that they possibly need.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from Florida will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 17 OFFERED BY MS. OMAR
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 17 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Ms. OMAR. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle G of title X, insert
the following:
SEC. 10ll. REPORT ON FINANCIAL COSTS OF
OVERSEAS UNITED STATES MILI-
TARY POSTURE AND OPERATIONS.
Not later than March 1, 2020, the Secretary
of Defense shall submit to the congressional
defense committees a report on the financial
costs and national security benefits of each
of the following for fiscal year 2019:
(1) Operating, improving, and maintaining
overseas military infrastructure at installa-
tions included on the enduring location mas-
ter list, including adjustments that take
into account direct or in-kind contributions
made by the host nations of such enduring
locations.
(2) Operating, improving, and maintaining
overseas military infrastructure supporting
forward-deployed forces at overseas contin-
gency locations, including adjustments that
take into account direct or in-kind contribu-
tions made by the host nations of such en-
during locations.
(3) Overseas military operations, including
support to contingency operations, rota-
tional deployments, and training exercises
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Minnesota.
Ms. OMAR. Madam Chair, my amend-
ment mandates reporting on the finan-
cial costs and national security bene-
fits of the Department of Defense’s op-
erations overseas. This includes the
cost of operating, improving, and main-
taining military infrastructures both
on our permanent bases and installa-
tions and at short-term contingency lo-
cations.
In order for Congress to properly con-
duct its oversight and appropriation
rules, we need to have a transparent
explanation of how much each of these
operations cost. We also need a trans-
parent justification for how each of
these operations contribute to keeping
Americans safe.
We hear a constant drumbeat from
the other side of the aisle on the need
for fiscal responsibility when it comes
to our domestic spending, but when it
comes time to fund the Pentagon, no
amount is too much, and no project is
too expensive, even though we spend
more on the military than the next 10
countries combined.
When we talk about fiscal responsi-
bility and wasteful spending, the Pen-
tagon must not be above reproach. We
have to ask what is actually necessary
for our national security and what is
part of an outrageously bloated budget

that lines the pockets of defense con-
tractors.
So this amendment is an important
step in accountability for the Pentagon
spending. It is necessary for the depart-
ment that cannot pass an audit. The
American people deserve to know what
their tax dollars are being spent on and
not take it on blind faith that every
dollar that is given to the Pentagon is
a dollar that is protecting their safety.
It is especially true for our overseas
operations. We send our men and
women in uniform abroad and they are
separated from their families not just
to win in wars but to man the bases we
maintain in places like Germany,
Japan, and Honduras. We need to be
asking them to do that for a reason.
This is why my amendment requires
the Pentagon to justify national secu-
rity benefits of overseas operations.
So I ask my colleagues to join me in
supporting this amendment and mak-
ing sure that we have an account-
ability in how we spend our taxpayer
dollars.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. MOORE). The
gentleman from Colorado is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chairman,
there are a number of flaws with this
amendment. I oppose it, and I would
ask everyone to vote ‘‘no’’ on it.
There are a number of reasons why
this is not a good amendment. For one
thing, what is being asked for in this
amendment has already been done. I
have some documents here I would like
to show you.
This is the defense budget overview.
It goes into exhaustive detail, thou-
sands of line items on where the Pen-
tagon spending is going right now—do-
mestic, foreign, everything.
b 2015
This is available to all Members of
Congress. This is the National Security
Strategy, the National Defense Strat-
egy, and just a smattering of other doc-
uments: the Missile Defense Review,
the National Defense Strategy Com-
mission, the Nuclear Posture Review.
All of these documents do what is
being asked for.
So it is unnecessary. Any Member of
Congress, even if they are not on the
Armed Services Committee, can come
to the committee, can ask the Pen-
tagon, can ask staff on the committee
for all of these documents. These are
already available. So to ask the Pen-
tagon to regurgitate this to us is just a
big waste of their time and money.
So for that reason, and there are
other reasons also—I will see if there
are any further arguments—this is un-
necessary and wasteful, and I would
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. OMAR. Madam Chair, may I in-
quire as to how much time I have re-
maining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota has 21⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Ms. OMAR. Madam Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. SMITH), the distinguished
chair.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I strongly support this amend-
ment.
The documents that the gentleman
just pointed to don’t even begin to
scratch the surface of addressing the
issue that the gentlewoman is raising.
Those are very broad documents about
where the Defense Department spends
its money.
And I am sure they mention in
there—actually, I am not sure. They
might mention in there exactly how
much money they spend on overseas
bases.
Actually, I would be surprised if they
outline all the overseas bases we have
and what their purpose is, and that is
what this amendment calls for. Not the
broad strategy, but really how many
bases do we have, how much money are
we spending, and what do they all con-
tribute to that national security pol-
icy.
I have read through those documents.
They do not have that type of detail.
Yes, they point out, for instance, here
is why we are in all the places that we
are—in Asia, for instance—as we are
trying to defend it, but they don’t go
through all the bases and say why this
particular place, that particular place.
We are overseas in a lot of places
that many people are not aware of. It
is not just the big ones that we are all
aware of that would be contained in
that. There are a lot of other places
where we own property and maintain
bases.
And the gentlewoman is also correct
that the inability of the Pentagon to
audit—in fact, one of the things that
the audit found is that the Pentagon
doesn’t actually know all of the prop-
erty that they own—or they can’t doc-
ument it, at any rate.
So getting this piece of it docu-
mented would be helpful and would
begin to answer the question: Is that
money well spent? Is that even advanc-
ing the policy that is outlined in all of
those documents?
So I think this is necessary, appro-
priate, and will be helpful in getting us
to a more efficient defense budget.
And, again, that is a major difference
in our approach from the minority. We
don’t want to just give the Pentagon
money. We want to make sure that
they are accountable and spending it
well.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chair, it is
not even really easy or practical to do
what the chairman and the sponsor of
the amendment are just proposing.
There is not a fine line between what is
overseas and what is domestic. Let me
give you an example.
I have a brigade combat team from
Fort Carson in my district that is now
in Afghanistan. One of the things that
is called for to be expensed in this re-
port is training exercises.
Okay. When the brigade combat team
is in Fort Carson in Colorado training
to go over to Afghanistan, at what
point do you draw the line and say: Oh,
that is domestic; everything beyond
that is foreign?
Is it when they step on the airplane?
Is it when the airplane lands at
Bagram in Afghanistan?
Is it when they start doing live-fire
exercises in Colorado?
Where do you draw the line there?
This is really not even a well-written
amendment. It is very impractical.
But the worst objection to this
amendment is it abdicates responsi-
bility. The chairman said let’s have the
Department tell us what they are
doing. No, they tell us what they are
doing, and we determine whether that
is what they should be doing.
This amendment is calling for the na-
tional security benefits to be told us by
the Department of Defense. That is our
oversight role as Congress. We oversee
the Department of Defense. We deter-
mine if they are giving us the national
security benefits that we tell them to
give us.
We don’t tell them: Tell us what you
are doing and tell us if what you are
doing is okay and helpful. No, they tell
us what they are doing. They specify,
including the dollar amount, then we
determine, with our oversight role, if
that fulfills the national security pur-
poses that they are supposed to be
doing.
The way this amendment is written,
we are abdicating that responsibility
to them. They are supposed to tell us
what the benefits are of what we are
doing. That is Congress’ role. That is
not their role to tell us. That is our
role as oversight.
For that reason alone, we should re-
ject this amendment. It is an abdica-
tion of our responsibility.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. OMAR. Madam Chair, I agree
with my colleague: It is our responsi-
bility to have oversight. That is simply
what this amendment does. It makes
sure that we have an understanding of
what our money is being spent on and
the benefits that that money will get
us.
We have to have a clear under-
standing of what the purposes are of
the over 800 different military bases we
have around the world and how much
money it is costing us to continue to
operate them. That is simply what we
are asking for. That is what the Amer-
ican people want to know, and that is
the kind of responsibility we shouldn’t
abdicate.
So I want to make sure that we have
a report that clearly lays out the kind
of money that is being spent and the
kind of benefits that we are getting for
it.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chair, may I
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing.

July 10, 2019
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado has 1 minute remaining.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Madam Chair, to conclude, let me
offer this to every Member of Congress.
Almost 300 pages, with thousands of
line entries, of where every dollar in
the Pentagon is going, we have this in-
formation right now. Why should they
have to regurgitate that for us all over
again?
And then let’s exercise our responsi-
bility and not have them tell us if what
they are doing fulfills national secu-
rity. Tell us what you are doing, and
then we will determine if that fulfills
national security.
So for all these reasons, Madam
Chair, I would say because it is waste-
ful, it is duplicative, it is impractical,
and it abdicates our responsibility, I
would urge that we reject this amend-
ment.
The work has already been done. If
anyone wants to show a little bit of
initiative, they can get this informa-
tion already. It is available. It is right

AMENDMENT NO. 19 OFFERED BY MR. SMITH OF
WASHINGTON
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 19 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk, which I am offering as the des-
ignee for the gentlewoman from Massa-
chusetts (Ms. CLARK).
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle H of title X, insert
the following:
SEC. 10ll. CONTRACTS BY THE PRESIDENT OR
VICE PRESIDENT.
(a) AMENDMENT.—Section 431 of title 18,
United States Code, is amended—
(1) in the section heading, by inserting
‘‘the President, Vice President, Cabinet Mem-
ber, or a’’ after ‘‘Contracts by’’; and
(2) in the first undesignated paragraph, by
inserting ‘‘the President, Vice President, or
any Cabinet member’’ after ‘‘Whoever,
being’’.
(b) TABLE OF SECTIONS AMENDMENT.—The
table of sections for chapter 23 of title 18,
United States Code, is amended by striking
the item relating to section 431 and inserting
the following:
‘‘431. Contracts by the President, Vice Presi-
dent, or a Member of Con-
gress.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. SMITH) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, this amendment is very
straightforward.
Currently, all Members of Congress
are prohibited from having contracts
with the Federal Government, either
way. In other words, if you are a Mem-
ber of Congress, you own something,
you can’t lease it to the government,
rent it to the government.
Similarly, you cannot rent or lease
something from the government for, I
think, obvious reasons. As Members of
Congress, we could potentially have
undue influence. We could get a deal
that other Members of the public could
not get. Therefore, we would have an
unfair advantage and be using our posi-
tion as elected officials to enrich our-
selves, which is supposed to be prohib-
ited.
This amendment is very straight-
forward. It adds the President, the Vice
President, and Cabinet members to
that list of people who cannot contract
with the Federal Government, again,
either the Federal Government leasing
something to us or we leasing some-
thing back to the Federal Government
that is owned, in this case, by the
President, the Vice President, and
members of the Cabinet.
Because, again, particularly in the
executive branch, they would actually
have, in many ways, more control over
this than a Member of Congress, who
does not have the power over the assets
that the President, the Vice President,
and Cabinet members would.
It prohibits them from doing that so
that there are no ethical problems, so
the President, Vice President, and Cab-
inet members cannot profit off of being
in the office that they are in. This is
part of the way we maintain a trans-
parent and ethical government.
I think it is a good amendment that
will improve the ethics of our govern-
ment, and I urge all Members to vote
in favor.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Chair, I
rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Chair,
this amendment is nothing other than,
once again, an attack on President
Trump and his family.
We have seen this time and time and
time again from the Democrat major-
ity. They are simply obsessed with
President Trump. Instead of doing the
hard work of governing, my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle are con-
tinuing to waste our time here in Con-
gress with their never-ending attempts
to go after the President.
And as it relates to this specific
amendment, we have already seen this
amendment. It was in H.R. 1, the so-
called For the People Act, which
passed the House here on a party-line
vote. It was a bad idea then in March,
and it is still a bad idea.
If an incoming President, Vice Presi-
dent, or Cabinet member took office
while owning a business that held a
previously existing contract with the
Federal Government, this amendment
would criminally fine that individual
after taking office. And since the Presi-
dent has not committed a crime under
existing laws, this majority is consid-
ering making new crimes, again, in
order to go after the President.
How far will they go in their attempt
to go after the President?
But even if we ignore the reprehen-
sible aspects of this bill, this amend-
ment has real implications that go far
beyond this administration. For exam-
ple, we have seen, with this President,
talented individuals with backgrounds
in business, not politics, that can bring
a refreshing change to the swamp here
in Washington. But this amendment
would drive qualified people away from
public service by imposing more and
more disincentives on individuals with
actual, real-world experience.
This amendment is nothing more
than a weakly veiled attempt at harm-
ing this administration by trying to
make new crimes out of business deci-
sions that occurred long before the
President took office.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
This doesn’t require someone to com-
mit a crime. It requires you to divest
of your interest if you move into this
position, something which, by the way,
all Members of Congress have to do.
We are not permitted to have outside
income over what we have as a Member
of Congress. So if you are elected to
Congress and you have another job, you
have to leave that job; you have to let
go of a particular business interest.
That is part of public service.
It does not require them to be
criminalized. That is like saying hav-
ing a law against taking bribes is crim-
inalizing the elected official. Now,
there is actually something you can do:
Don’t take the bribe, and you will be
okay.
As far as our ‘‘obsession’’ with the
President, I couldn’t help but laugh at
the statement, ‘‘instead of doing the
hard work of governing.’’
I am counting how many hours I have
slept over the course of the last month-
and-a-half as we have worked to put to-
gether a nearly 2200-page bill that fully
funds the Defense Department—sorry,
in my opinion, fully funds the Defense
Department—and all the amendments.
Let me assure you, we are capable of
doing both. We are capable of doing the
hard work of government and actually
trying to make sure that our elected
officials are at least passingly ethical
so that the American public doesn’t
think what they already think, which

is that too many people get elected
simply to enrich themselves.
This is not something new. We have a
long list of ethics laws that restrict
what you can do as an elected official
or a member of government. I would
hope that the gentleman is not sug-
gesting that we shouldn’t have that be-
cause it is somehow inconvenient.
b 2030
I think it is incredibly important
that we have ethical standards, that we
make sure that elected officials are not
able to enrich themselves based on
being in the elected position that they
are in.
That is all this amendment does. It is
targeting good government, which is
part of our job.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Chair, I
would remind my friend that the exec-
utive branch is already required to di-
vest.
As it relates to finding it laughable
that I made a comment about the in-
ability of the majority party to govern,
I don’t find that a laughing matter at
all.
Week after week—week after week
after week right now—we are coming
into this people’s House, wasting time
on messaging bills and amendments, as
we are doing even right now, that have
no chance of going anywhere.
It is an absolute waste of time and
continual evidence being proven right
before us that this majority has lost its
capacity to govern because of its obses-
sion to go after this President. This
amendment before us here is a clear ex-
ample of yet another step in that direc-
tion. This is what it is.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
I don’t know where the gentleman
was over the course of the last month
when we passed 10 appropriations bills
and took hundreds of votes on the sub-
stantive business of funding the gov-
ernment. That is not a waste of time.
I realize the Senate has decided that
they are not going to do it, but it is our
job to pass appropriations bills. That is
what we did for the last month-plus.
We are now working on the defense
bill. I would trust the gentleman
wouldn’t think of that as a waste of
time. It is incredibly important.
We have passed an entire rewrite of
the ethics laws for the United States
House of Representatives. Whether you
support it or not, it is certainly not a
waste of time.
We have passed countless other bills
and important pieces of legislation.
The Senate hasn’t been doing much. I
understand its rules are more com-
plicated, so I am sympathetic, but we
are working on the substantive ability
to govern. We are doing it, even if the
gentleman doesn’t agree with the bills.
This is where bipartisanship becomes
difficult because as we do that, to have
someone stand up and say that is not
what government is supposed to be
doing, I mean, what are we doing here?
That is what we have been doing.
Part of that should also be to have an
ethical government; ethical elected
Members of Congress; and ethical
Presidents, Vice Presidents, and Cabi-
net members.
As I have said, there are a bunch of
rules governing that. This is one more
that I think would help to make it ap-
propriate.
Madam Chair, I urge support for the
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

SEC. 1075. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING
MODULAR AIRBORNE FIRE FIGHT-
ING SYSTEM; REPORT.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) Congress established the Modular Air-
borne Fire Fighting System (in this section
referred to as ‘‘MAFFS’’) after civilian fire
fighting tanker fleets were overwhelmed by
the 1970 Laguna Fire that killed eight indi-
viduals and destroyed 382 homes.
(2) Air National Guard C-130 aircraft
equipped with the MAFFS provide emer-
gency capability to supplement existing
commercial tanker support on wildland fires.
(3) A MAFFS II unit can discharge its load
of 3,000 gallons of flame retardant in less
than five seconds, covering an area one-quar-
ter of a mile long and 60 feet wide.
(4) Air National Guard and Air Force Re-
serve units equipped with MAFFS II have
provided critical support in fire fighting re-
sponse efforts in recent years, including the
Camp and Woolsey Fires in November 2018.
(5) The National Guard Bureau is currently
developing a replacement system to the cur-
rent, aging fleet of MAFFS II systems.
(6) The current MAFFS II system requires
significant maintenance and repair, includ-
ing deteriorating compression systems, that
could reduce MAFFS capability in as soon as
two years.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) MAFFS provides a necessary capability
to support national, State, and local fire
fighting response efforts;
(2) fire fighting response would be severely
affected if MAFFS II or replacement MAFFS
systems were not available, including reduc-
ing the number of sorties and drops planes
can fly during emergencies; and
(3) the Department of Defense should use
funding provided under the National Guard
and Reserve Equipment Account to develop,
sustain and maintain continued MAFFS ca-
pability, including IMAFFS systems to re-
place the current fleet.
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 90 days after
the date of the enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of Defense shall submit a report to
the congressional defense committees re-
garding plans of the Secretary to fund long-
term sustainment and operation and mainte-
nance of MAFFS capabilities, including
plans for the National Guard Bureau to sub-
mit program objective memoranda for fund-
ing for lifetime costs to the Department of
Defense to be included in future Department
of Defense Budget Requests, including the
feasibility of establishing a dedicated pro-
gram-of-record.

July 10, 2019
Samarra, Iraq, during Operation Iraqi Free-
dom, when, as a Sergeant First Class in Com-
pany A, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regi-
ment, 3rd Infantry Division, with no regard
to his own safety or wellbeing, he repeatedly
entered a burning Bradley Fighting Vehicle
after it struck an improvised explosive de-
vice. While receiving small arms fire, he
made his first evacuation of his Soldiers. On
his second evacuation of Soldiers, his own
fuel-soaked uniform caught on fire, yet he
returned to the burning Bradley Fighting
Vehicle for a third evacuation. Cashe, in-
jured the worst of all involved, with second-
and third- degree burns over 72 percent of his
body, still led recovery efforts and refused
medical evacuation until his men were evac-
uated to safety and treatment. Cashe’s ac-
tions saved the lives of six of his Soldiers.
Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe suc-
cumbed from his wounds on November 8, 2005
at Brooks Army Medical Center, Fort Sam
Houston, San Antonio, Texas. He was post-
humously awarded the Silver Star for his
heroism.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. SMITH) and the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN-
BERRY) each will control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I don’t have any speakers. We
have been doing so many votes on the
House floor that it appears we have
worn down the Members of Congress.
We don’t have as many people over
here to speak as we normally do on our
en bloc packages.
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the en bloc package, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Chair, the Merit
Systems Protection Board is a small but
mighty independent federal agency created by
Congress to protect the merit system prin-
ciples and to promote an effective federal
workforce free of prohibited personnel prac-
tices.
Typically, the Board is led by three presi-
dentially-appointed and Senate confirmed
members. However, the term for the last re-
maining Board member expired on March 1,
2018. That board member already extended
his term in a holdover capacity, but was lim-
ited by statute to one year extension, meaning
the Board has been without even a single
Board member since March 2019.
The Office of Special Counsel refers cases
to the Board when it suspects a federal agen-
cy has performed an unfair or adverse action
against a federal employee.
The Board can then temporarily table the
agency action while adjudicating the employ-
ee’s claim.
However, the Board can only table the ac-
tion or adjudicate it if it has a quorum—or two
members. As the Board currently sits, there
are no confirmed members, and the Board
has been without a quorum since January 7,
2017.
This means that the Board cannot perform
any of these actions to protect federal workers
from agency actions that OSC deems suspect.
This Amendment would provide urgent, tem-
porary relief to whistleblowers while the Board
waits for at least one appointee.
My amendment would delegate temporary
authority to the Board’s general counsel to
stay questionable personnel actions brought
by agencies against whistleblowers. Under this
provision, the Board could still act on egre-
gious cases of suspected retaliation, even
without any board members.
The general counsel’s authority would ex-
pire when a single Board member is confirmed
by the Senate.
This amendment is absolutely necessary to
protect federal workers. And, needing this
amendment was completely avoidable. Whis-
tleblowers shouldn’t be held hostage by the
failures of the political system.
This amendment would at a minimum keep
the lights on for the Board. The general coun-
sel would be authorized to prevent an agency
from taking a retaliatory or prohibited per-
sonnel action against those who disclose
wrongdoing.
I held a hearing in February of this year to
examine the effects on the Board because of
the vacancies of two Board members and the
potential ramifications if the final member left
his post in March.
This hearing followed my attempt to save
the Board from going without leadership when
the final Board member’s term expired.
With Chairman Cummings, I introduced leg-
islation to prevent the Board from having no
members. H.R. 1235, the MSPB Temporary
Term Extension Act, would have provided a
one-time, one-year extension to the final
Board member’s term. This measure passed
the House, but the Senate refused to take it
up.
As a result, in June, I introduced H.R. 2530
to amend Title 5 to give the general counsel
temporary stay authority, which the Committee
on Oversight and Reform voice voted out of
Committee.
It is imperative that we preserve the impor-
tance and integrity of this vital Board. Passing
this amendment means that the Board will be
able to resume its work protecting whistle-
blowers more quickly.
There is a lot at stake. The status quo is un-
tenable.
Federal employees deserve to have their
appeals heard by the Board, and employees
of the Board deserve to work at a fully func-
tioning agency.
Whistleblowers help hold leaders account-
able, and we owe it to them to protect them
from retaliation.
Addressing this problem should be a bipar-
tisan concern.
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this amendment.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Chair, I rise today
in support of this en bloc package of amend-
ments to H.R. 2500, which includes my simple
amendment that would require a report to
Congress on those who have received secu-
rity training from the United States and subse-
quently been sanctioned for human rights vio-
lations or terrorist activities.
Security cooperation programs are a critical
tool of U.S. foreign policy, especially as we in-
creasingly rely on partner forces to protect
U.S. national security interests.
It is vital that we both thoroughly vet partici-
pants in our security cooperation programs,
and ensure accountability after such training
has been delivered.
If recipients of U.S. security training go on
to commit gross violations of human rights or
acts of terrorism, then we need to know about
it.
My amendment would require the Secre-
taries of State and Defense to submit to Con-
gress a report on each individual and security
force unit that has received U.S. security train-
ing and been designated by the United States
for human rights violations or terrorist activities
at any point during the previous ten years.
This reflection would yield key information
helping us to ensure that U.S. security training
programs are aligned with American values
and that we are applying consistent standards
regarding human rights.
That is why I urge my colleagues to support
my amendment to this bill and enhance Con-
gress’ ability to provide oversight and account-
ability of U.S. security cooperation programs.
Mr. CASE. Madam Chair, I rise today in
support of my amendment requesting the De-
partment of Defense to assess the status of
security cooperation and assistance with Pa-
cific Island Countries and the feasibility of ex-
panding it.
The Department of Defense currently oper-
ates a Maritime Security Initiative in the South
China Sea that works to build regional capac-
ity to address a range of maritime challenges.
This effort includes a wide range of assistance
including International Military Education and
Training, Foreign Military Financing, oper-
ations combating the narcotics trade, and the
transfer of excess defense articles.
Our nation launched this program, in part, to
help check Chinese influence in the region.
China provides its assistance without regard
for America’s principles for a free and open
Indo-Pacific that has governed the region
since the end of World War II.
Given the rise of Chinese influence in the
Pacific Island Countries, the question we have
before us is can this program be replicated to
help the island nations in the Pacific who are
seeing a push by China to expand its influ-
ence into Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, the
Solomon Islands, Fiji, the Federated States of
Micronesia, Palau, Kiribati, the Marshall Is-
lands, Nauru, and Tonga. This Chinese influ-
ence threatens the blood, sweat, and treasure
spent by our country during World War II in an
effort to ensure freedom and the rule of law
would thrive throughout the Indo-Pacific.
My amendment takes the first step to see
what can be done to protect these nations
who share our values and are under pressure
for Chinese influence. The amendment would
direct the Defense Department to assess the
current status of security cooperation and as-
sistance with Pacific Island Countries and the
feasibility of expanding it to advance our na-
tional security objectives in the Indo-Pacific.
I urge support of my amendment to deter-
mine how to ensure our traditional allies in re-
gion have the tools and training needed to
help America ensure a free and open Indo-Pa-
cific.
Mr. CASE. Madam Chair, I rise today in
support of my amendment directing our mili-
tary intelligence agencies to determine the de-
gree of foreign influence in the Pacific Island
Countries and to assess how to close any in-
telligence gaps our nation has in the region.
Because my home state of Hawai‘i is closer
to Asia than Washington D.C., I have met with
many leaders from the Pacific Island Coun-
tries, which includes Papua New Guinea,
Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, the Fed-
erated States of Micronesia, Palau, Kiribati,
the Marshall Islands, Nauru, and Tonga.
Time and time again, I have heard stories of
troubling Chinese influence in the region. Ef-
forts to bribe senior government leaders.

Questionable foreign business investments
near U.S. military installations, and even an
effort that might have thrown a parliamentary
government into crisis. We need our intel-
ligence community to assess what is hap-
pening so we can determine how to respond.
To address these threats, my straight-
forward amendment only asks for three things.
First, the Defense Department would assess
the actions of foreign militaries in the Pacific
Island Countries. Second, the department
would assess any gaps in our intelligence col-
lection capabilities that may undermine this in-
telligence assessment, and third, the Defense
Department would determine how to eliminate
any gaps in our intelligence.
With this information, we can fully assess
what is happening in the Pacific Island Coun-
tries to and determine how we should respond
to ensure that our partners in the region are
not undermined by a foreign influence that is
combating our nation’s goal of ensuring a free
and open Indo-Pacific.
Mr. CASE. Madam Chair, I rise today in
support of my amendment directing the De-
partment of Defense to provide a report re-
garding the risks posed by non-military aircraft
flying over our nation’s military installations.
Not unlike many other states, on the Island
of Oahu in my home state of Hawaii we have
multiple military installations situated near a
major international airport and a large airport
supporting general aviation.
Although agreements have been made to
help control this air traffic, on a regular basis
these agreements are violated. For example, I
have personally seen tour helicopters fly right
over sensitive locations around Pearl Harbor,
the home of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and Pacific
Air Forces.
My amendment seeks to achieve two com-
monsense steps to address the potential risks
from these nonmilitary aircrafts operating near
U.S. military installations. First, the Depart-
ment of Defense will assess the encroachment
challenges and security risks posed by non-
military aircraft that fly over military installa-
tions, to include operational impacts, installa-
tion and personnel security and intelligence
concerns. Second, the department would pro-
pose practicable strategies and recommenda-
tions for mitigating any significant risks.
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment so we can start responding to encroach-
ment and security risks from non-military air-
craft today before waiting until an incident
forces us to act because our nation’s security
and safety have been compromised.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. SMITH) and the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN-
BERRY) each will control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
CUELLAR).
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Chair, I
thank Chairman SMITH and his staff for
working with our office, and also the
ranking member and his staff for work-
ing on making this a bipartisan amend-
ment.
I would like to speak about an
amendment that will do a Western
Hemisphere resource assessment.
This amendment will require the Of-
fice of the Secretary of Defense to con-
tract for an independent study on the
sufficiency of U.S. resources in the
Western Hemisphere by the Depart-
ment of Defense, the Department of
State, and the United States Agency
for International Development. The
purpose is for Congress to receive an
unbiased view of all U.S. investments
in the region.
With ever-increasing investment by
China, Iran, and Russia in the Latin
American region, we must refocus our
efforts with our southern neighbors.
Russia is flying nuclear-capable bomb-
ers out of Venezuela, near our U.S. bor-
der. China intends on investing $250 bil-
lion in Latin America by 2025. A new
study also has shown that China has
become more popular than the United
States in many of the Latin American
countries.
The United States must remain vigi-
lant in Latin America and help the re-
gion from succumbing to Chinese, Rus-
sian, and Iranian influences.
Again, this Western Hemisphere re-
source assessment is the first step in
helping refocus U.S. efforts in the re-
gion, and I ask my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment and the en bloc
amendment.
Madam Chair, I thank Chairman
SMITH and his staff, and the ranking
member and his staff, for allowing this
amendment to be part of the en bloc,
and I urge my colleagues to support
this.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
have no requests for time, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I have no further requests for
time. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on en bloc
package No. 4, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendments en bloc offered by
the gentleman from Washington (Mr.
SMITH).
The en bloc amendments were agreed
to.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I move that the Committee do
now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.
CUELLAR) having assumed the chair,
Ms. MOORE, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration

priations for fiscal year 2020 for mili-
tary activities of the Department of

CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC
CAUCUS
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
MOORE). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO) is
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam
Speaker, I want to speak tonight about
the very deep humanitarian situation
at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Immigration has been the lifeblood of
our Nation for generations. The United
States has been blessed that people
from all over the world have come to
our country fleeing oppression, dic-
tators, violence, poverty, desperation,
and seeking opportunity in our Nation
that has been built up by those very
same people to become the most pros-
perous and powerful Nation on the face
of this Earth.
But our immigration system is bro-
ken. Our enforcement system is bro-
ken.
And tonight, we want to talk about
what we have learned, after repeated
visits to Department of Homeland Se-
curity facilities, operated by Customs
and Border Protection, ICE, and also
HHS facilities operated by the Office of
Refugee Resettlement.
I am going to be joined tonight by a
few of my colleagues, JIMMY GOMEZ,
who represents part of Los Angeles,
DARREN SOTO, a Congressman from
Florida, and perhaps other Members of
Congress this evening.
Before I turn it over to DARREN, I
want to speak for a second about what
is known as the largest for-profit cen-
ter that is operated to detain children.
It is in a town called Homestead, Flor-
ida, and it is a massive operation. The
operators of this facility, it is reported,
make over $700 per child per day, and
its size continues to grow.
There are many troubling things
going on at Homestead, and about a
system that keeps growing and grow-
ing for the sake of profit, holding and
detaining children, some of them in-
fants and toddlers, longer and longer.
My colleague, DARREN SOTO, is here
to describe Homestead and his visits
there.
I yield to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. SOTO).
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Texas, Congress-
man CASTRO, for putting together this
Special Order hour. And it is timely, to
say the least.
There are many borders that our Na-
tion has. We have a lot of focus on the
southwestern borders, such as in Texas,
Arizona, New Mexico, and California.
But there are also borders like what we
have in Florida, with the Caribbean
surrounding us, and a short, either
plane ride or longer sea voyage to our
peninsula.
We have immigrants from Venezuela
coming in, fleeing tyranny. We had for
generations Cuban-Americans escaping
the issues down there. We have folks of
Mexican descent who are farm workers
in Polk County, and in other areas,
that are now second and third genera-
tion.
And, yes, we have many refugees,
particularly children, who have left the
Triangle in Central America and are
part of this great humanitarian crisis
at the border.
I got the opportunity to be able to
visit the Homestead facility, a facility
that had blocked several of us from
several requests of touring it. And I
saw over 900 children, between the ages
of 12 and 17, that were in a facility not
made for over 500. And I suspect those
numbers have grown since then.
There are a few of us who did speak
Spanish, like myself, and were able to
talk briefly to the children, even
though they told us not to; but you
know our responsibility that we have.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. That is an im-
portant point. When you went into that
facility, this HHS facility, you were
told, as a Member of Congress that has
oversight authority over these Federal
agencies and facilities, you were told
not to speak to anybody that was in-
side that facility.
Mr. SOTO. Sure. No speaking to the
kids there; no photos. And then we
were given kind of a song and dance
about how well everybody was treated.
These young people hailed from Hon-
duras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, coun-
tries that we hear over and over be-
cause of the strife from drug cartels
down there that are warring.
I saw six to eight beds per room,
sometimes more, in rooms that
couldn’t be any bigger than 10 to 15 by
15, with shared showers between two of
those rooms. And then I saw class-
rooms and recreation facilities in giant
makeshift tents, these big, kind of
puffy ones that were clearly not perma-
nent facilities.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. And there has
been concern because of the weather in
Florida, because you have a hurricane
season in Florida, about the ability of
these tents to withstand strong weath-
er and the danger that that could
present to the kids there.
Mr. SOTO. There is no question;
those tents would be at great risk if a
3, 4, or Level 5 hurricane hit South
Florida. And they are at the very end
of it in Homestead, which is even south
of Miami.
I want to talk a little bit about the
root causes of it. We go back to the
Triangle and what is happening. You
know, these families are fleeing as an
act of love because if their kids stay,
they could be brought into these cartel
drug wars and may not even survive to
be 18 years of age, let alone go on to
live productive lives.
So one of the root causes of this is
that the funding, the foreign aid fund-
ing down in the Triangle hasn’t been
where it was under the Obama adminis-
tration.
And of course, then, this idea that we
have to detain all of these kids, which
has really helped manufacture this bor-
der crisis. It could be easily resolved by
getting them to families in the United
States. I have been briefed that many
of them are here to visit families, and
we could have ways to track every-
body; everything as tough as an ankle
bracelet to having a case worker and
having something less draconian.
But they chose not to do that. They
chose to hold these kids back because
they don’t want them to go out into
the general population of the United
States.
So, if we just did things the way the
last two to three Presidents did,
Obama, Bush and Clinton, we wouldn’t
be in this situation right now, this de-
liberate holding of kids, as well as asy-
lum seekers, in general, at the border
that doesn’t need to happen here in the
United States.
And with asylum seekers, it violates
many treaties that we are a part of.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. The gen-
tleman mentioned the point about the
Trump administration has done some-
thing fundamentally different than the
prior administration in a few ways.
First, its zero tolerance policy. So it
started aggressively separating fathers
and mothers from their young kids.
Thousands of those kids were lost in
the system. Literally, the administra-
tion had absolutely no way ahead of
time to track them and to reunite
them with their parents.
And also, what is known as the Re-
main in Mexico, or MPP policy; that
once people come seeking asylum, the
administration has done a few things:
Number 1, for the people that do make
it here, they then send many of them
right back to Mexico. And these are,
unfortunately, the cities that—some of
these cities that the United States
Government and the Department of
State recommends that Americans do
not travel to. And we are sending peo-
ple back there, when we are recom-
mending to our own folks that they
don’t go to these same cities.
Then the other thing they have been
doing is metering, as you alluded to,
and trying to block people from le-
gally—remember, these people are le-
gally presenting themselves for asy-
lum. And they are blocking these folks
from presenting themselves for asylum.
So what happens is, the situation
that you have with the young man and
his young daughter, 2-year-old daugh-
ter, the photo from about three weeks
ago that the whole world saw. And I
didn’t speak to a single person who saw
that photograph of the father and his 2-
year-old daughter, dead in the water,
with the young girl, her arm over her
dad—I didn’t speak to anybody who
said that they saw that photo that
didn’t cry.
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for his leadership as our
chairman of the Congressional His-
panic Caucus, and that is why we are
here tonight, for those injustices.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5577
July 10, 2019
I am proud to be joined by my good
friend, Congressman JIMMY GOMEZ, of
Southern California, of L.A., who has
been a champion of issues related to
immigrants and related to Hispanics
across the Nation.
JIMMY, thanks for being here.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you,
DARREN. Thank you for keeping an eye
on the Homestead facility in Florida,
for the CODELS, which are official con-
gressional visits to these facilities.
Thanks for all the work that you have
been doing.
Mr. SOTO. And as we go into the
budget, the protections that we
couldn’t get in recent bills, we will
double down on to make sure we have
them going into the appropriations
process.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Absolutely.
JIMMY, I know you are from Los An-
geles. You have also been on many of
these CODELS. You have seen the hor-
rific conditions that folks are being
kept in, the separation of families, all
of these things.
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for inviting me to
participate today.
I actually serve on the House Over-
sight and Government Reform Com-
mittee, and today we had a hearing
about the conditions of the camps at
the border, the conditions that the
children are kept in.
We have lost six kids at the border,
and I want to just highlight their
names, because we need to recognize
that there is a human face to the trag-
edy that we see; it is not just numbers.
We have Carlos Hernandez Vasquez;
he was age 16. Wilmer Josue Ramirez
Vasquez, age 2; Juan de Leon Gutier-
rez, age 16; Felipe Gomez Alonzo, age 8;
and Jakelin Caal Maquin, age 7, and
Mariee Juarez, age 1.
Mariee’s mother actually testified in
front of the committee to tell her story
of what she was trying to accomplish
by coming to this country and about
the fear that she had as she crossed and
as she was detained.
I want to remind people; a lot of peo-
ple think that it is a crisis that is
being created on its own. It is not. It is
something that is a result of this ad-
ministration’s zero tolerance policy.
I want to remind people that the zero
tolerance policy started because this
President, as he was running for office,
said that he was going to be tough on
this issue, and that he would be the
only one that could solve it. So what
we ended up seeing is that we saw the
zero tolerance policy.
And what is it? The zero tolerance
policy states that anybody that crosses
in between ports of entry will no longer
be held civilly and administratively re-
sponsible; that they will be convicted
criminally.
Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General
when this policy was started to be im-
plemented said: Zero tolerance policy
shall supersede any existing policies.
And what this did is it caused people,
when they are criminally convicted or
being held for breach of criminal law,
the parents are being separated from
the kids.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. That is an im-
portant point, JIMMY. People wonder,
well how is it that these families got
separated? Why would the government
do that?
There is, in the law, which is known
as Section 1325, a law that allows the
government to basically charge the
parents with a crime; therefore, sepa-
rate them from their kids, and send the
kids off somewhere else.
Mr. GOMEZ. Correct. And that is
where we want to make sure people un-
derstand that this crisis, the sepa-
rating of the children, was a direct re-
sult of this policy. It doesn’t say, yeah,
they will be separated. But it is that
they would be—zero tolerance led to
the separation. One triggered the
other.
People then also try to make the ar-
gument that this happened under the
Obama administration, but the Obama
administration didn’t do that. They
were dealing with unaccompanied mi-
nors that were flowing into the coun-
try, and they had to deal with that hu-
manitarian crisis at that moment.
So this administration has really
taken a zero tolerance policy, which
has had a ripple effect on capacity to
handle influx, the metering issue, the
Remain in Mexico issue, the separating
of the kids and not keeping appropriate
track of those children to make sure
that they are actually returned to
their parents.
And this administration, time and
time again, now says that they never
had a child separation policy.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. That was bi-
zarre. You remember, several months
ago now, when Secretary Nielsen was
still the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity in, I think it was the first hearing,
where she was asked about the govern-
ment’s, the Trump administration’s
family separation policy. She said, flat
out, that there was no child separation
or family separation policy; very
bizarrely said that there was no family
separation policy.
Mr. GOMEZ. And it wasn’t only Sec-
retary Nielsen. It was Kelly Anne
Conway. It is a fabrication and a lie
that has been repeated by the adminis-
tration; and that is something that we
want to call out, to make sure people
understand that what is going on now
is a direct result of the zero tolerance
policy.
Additionally, we want to make sure
that people understand that a lot of
the decisions were made based on, I be-
lieve, on politics. My own personal be-
lief was this, they wanted to seem
tough, so they implemented policies
without really understanding how they
implement it on the ground.
I have taken tours not only of Otay
Mesa, Adelanto, I went out to
Victorville; I went to Tornillo, Texas,
so I have been to the border quite a bit
of times, a number of times.
b 2100
And when you start talking to the
people who are responsible for imple-
menting these policies, the men and
women who are in Customs and Border
Protection, some of them are trying to
do a good job. They are saying that
they are being put in an impossible sit-
uation by this administration by often
determining policy at a whim. And the
problem is, when you are making pol-
icy not on rational decisions but on
politics, then you end up with this sit-
uation, which is a big mess on the bor-
der.
I actually spent a night at the border
with one of my colleagues.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. That is right,
you and NANETTE BARRAGÁN, who also
represents part of southern California,
and you saw the metering policy, what
is known as the metering policy.
Again, that is where they block people
from legally presenting for asylum.
You all saw it firsthand. In fact, you
ended up spending almost the whole
night, I think, sleeping there on the
concrete.
Mr. GOMEZ. Yes, at Otay Mesa. We
spent the night at the Mexican side of
the border, literally on the line, and we
were there just to observe migrants to
present themselves for asylum. They
were on U.S. soil. They presented
themselves. They were told that it was
full. Congresswoman BARRAGÁN and I
asked to see the facility. They refused
to show us.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. These were
CBP agents who were refusing to show
you.
Mr. GOMEZ. Yes, correct. Customs
and Border Protection refused to let us
in to see it. So the migrants sat down.
We sat down with them. We got there
around 1 o’clock in the afternoon, and
we didn’t leave until the next day,
around 7 a.m. So we spent the night. It
was cold. We slept on the ground.
The migrants couldn’t leave the U.S.
soil or the Mexican authorities would
have grabbed them. So we actually got
corralled, using bike racks, into kind
of a cage to keep us in a certain area.
Every so often, Customs and Border
Patrol would wake us up to ask us who
is here, how many kids, how old, but
these were questions that we answered
three or four times.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. So it is a pur-
poseful way to disrupt your rest, your
sleep, to try to get as many people out
of there as possible?
Mr. GOMEZ. Correct. And what we
were trying to remind them is that, by
international law, by U.S. law, these
migrants had a right to present them-
selves for asylum and then ask so that
they can be processed. They ended up
getting in. It was the woman who was
tear-gassed at the border in that fa-
mous——
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. With her kids.
Mr. GOMEZ. With her kids. She was
one of the folks, and she asked for a
credible fear asylum hearing, and she
went through the process. That is why
we have this process, so that we don’t

end up with just a backlog at the bor-
der that is more dangerous for the kids
and the migrants, and it is unnecessary
under what we believe under our rule of
law.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. You men-
tioned the Trump administration’s
policies, and there was a really excel-
lent article written not too long ago by
a gentleman by the name of Adam
Serwer, and I think he wrote it for The
Atlantic, although I could be wrong.
But his point is that the cruelty is the
point, it seems like, and the further
along we go, the more it seems that
that is the case, that some of these
policies are done for sheer harshness
towards the people who these policies
are directed toward.
And you know that last week there
were a group of us from the Congres-
sional Hispanic Caucus who went over
to two Border Patrol stations in El
Paso, Texas, first the El Paso Border
Patrol Station number one, and then
the Clint facility, which is now infa-
mous.
This was the same day or the day
after that a story had broken about a
Facebook page. I think it is the I’m 10–
15 Facebook page that was set up as a
secret group, or a private group, set up
for Border Patrol agents, former Bor-
der Patrol agents and current Border
Patrol agents, 9,500 members of this
group who had made some very vile
and very vulgar comments about the
people in their care, about Members of
Congress, about the work that they do.
A lot of it is stuff that I just can’t read
on the House floor because they would
probably shut me down for being vul-
gar.
Mr. GOMEZ. And if I can interject.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Yes.
Mr. GOMEZ. I mentioned this article
in the Oversight hearing. It is actually
a ProPublica article, entitled: ‘‘Inside
the Secret Border Patrol Facebook
Group Where Agents Joke about Mi-
grant Deaths and Post Sexist Memes.’’
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. And if our col-
leagues have not read that article, Re-
publican and Democrat, you should
read that ProPublica article that was
published last week, because it tells
you exactly the problems with CBP
right now and the culture at CBP.
I want to read one thing. We were
talking about the father, and when he
and his daughter died they were face
down on the river. She had her arm
around him. So everybody saw that
photo around the world and throughout
the country. I want to tell you a post
that was on this Facebook page, posted
by a Border Patrol agent or a former
Border Patrol agent, and so I am going
to quote here. It says: ‘‘Okay. I’m
gonna go ahead and ask, have y’all ever
seen floaters this clean? I’m not trying
to be an ‘a,’ but I have never seen float-
ers like this. Could this be another
edited photo? We’ve all seen the Dems
and liberal party do some pretty sick
things.’’
Now, that was his post. There were a
few responses to that post. Some of
them were memes. One of the memes
had a Sesame Street character, and the
language below the Sesame Street
character says ‘‘oh, well’’ about these
deaths.
Another meme from another agent or
former agent has a picture. There is a
famous scene in a movie ‘‘Rocky IV’’ of
the Russian fighter, and he uses a fa-
mous line for anybody who has ever
seen it. The meme says, ‘‘If he dies, he
dies.’’ They are talking about the little
girl and the man who are hugging face
down in the river.
I reached out to Secretary
McAleenan, I think still the Acting
Secretary of DHS. I think he is still
acting. I think I am right about that.
And I said, over the weekend: I would
like to have a discussion with you this
coming week. And we are trying to set
it up about the accountability and dis-
ciplinary system for CBP agents who
have made the most vile and vulgar
comments.
Look, don’t get me wrong. There
were some people who were part of this
group who I am sure never made a com-
ment. There were people who were part
of this group who never said anything
close to some of the worst stuff on
here, who would not be subject to dis-
cipline.
A big part of the problem right now
is the culture at CBP, and as far as I
can tell, there is close to zero account-
ability for anything like this or what
happened in Maine on the northern
border a few weeks ago.
It was reported, because if you take a
Greyhound bus from McAllen, Texas,
for example, and you are going to go to
San Antonio or Dallas or Austin or
whatever, you get stopped along the
way by CBP agents. Same thing in
California if you are coming up from
San Diego or near the border. And the
CBP agents will get onto the bus, go up
to each person, or at least the people
they suspect could possibly be immi-
grants, and they will ask you to basi-
cally prove your citizenship.
So we have been in a battle with
Greyhound over that because of the
rights that Americans have, having to
prove citizenship. But here is my point.
I think it was ACLU that got emails
made public of a few agents on a few
occasions, or it may have been one
agent on a few occasions, saying to his
agents who were going out to do these
checks on the buses, his message to
them was ‘‘happy hunting.’’ Happy
hunting.
I asked Secretary McAleenan: Well,
what are you going to do about that
person? Somebody is describing going
after human beings here as hunting.
What is the disciplinary process?
Congress has not gotten any answers
about what the disciplinary and ac-
countability process is at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, at CBP for
actions like this.
Then one more thing—and then, of
course, I want to hear more of your
perspective—is also, besides the fact
that there is hardly any accountability
as far as we can tell, it is also very se-
cretive. I mean, really, Border Patrol
right now is probably the most—except
for the Secret Service, probably the
most secretive law enforcement agency
in the country, the least transparent
law enforcement agency in the coun-
try.
You and I both know when we have
gone and visited the border, when we
have gone to these facilities, there are
good agents who are doing their work,
who are doing it honestly and ear-
nestly, who are not mistreating any-
body, who are helping to defend and
protect the United States. But those
people are overwhelmed by a system
that is undercut by a bad culture at
this point and by these rogue agents
who have essentially ruined the culture
at CBP, and I don’t know that the
higher-ups, right now, are lifting a fin-
ger to do anything about it.
Mr. GOMEZ. I think you make some
excellent points.
One point I want to kind of talk
about, this culture that is permeating
Customs and Border Protection, I
think that it is also based because of
the leadership of this administration.
The attitude of zero tolerance, as in,
like: Nope, it doesn’t matter what con-
ditions you are leaving, it doesn’t mat-
ter if you are fleeing violence, it
doesn’t matter if you are a victim of
domestic abuse, you can no longer use
that as a rationale for seeking asylum.
That zero tolerance mentality is what
is also helping drive this rotting of the
culture within Customs and Border
Protection.
Changing the leadership makes a dif-
ference, but as long as there is a
change in the civilian leadership.
Oversight is crucial. A lot of people
ask: What is the difference between
Democrats and Republicans? What is
the difference between you guys being
in charge versus Republicans being in
charge?
One of the things that I noticed when
I was on Oversight in the minority
from my first year, year and a half in
Congress is that we couldn’t call in
Customs and Border Protection and
ICE and the Department of Homeland
Security to have a public hearing on
these issues. The only hearing we had
regarding the zero-tolerance policy was
behind closed doors, no cameras
present. I don’t even believe staff was
allowed in the room.
So we had to sit there and ask, and
we asked enough questions to get more
information about how the zero-toler-
ance policy worked, how it was the
nitty-gritty. But if people don’t hear
it, the public doesn’t hear their testi-
mony, then it lacks the credibility be-
cause some people think we are making
it up.
So we need not only the right kind of
leadership to reform the culture, we
also need to make sure that there is di-
rect oversight by Congress, and that is
our job.
I voted against the emergency sup-
plemental because I didn’t feel that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5579

there were enough constraints on the
money that was going to be sent to the
agencies, that they were going to actu-
ally use it to improve the humani-
tarian crisis that was going on on the
ground at the border region.
So we need to continue pushing that
oversight, and that is what I plan on
doing. I know that, under your leader-
ship, the Congressional Hispanic Cau-
cus is doing so.
At the same time, I want to highlight
another issue. People act like ICE has
been around forever. We have to re-
mind people that our system was re-
structured after 9/11 to make sure that
we do have appropriate security at the
border, at the ports of entry, through
the airports, right, that we had major
flaws. So reorganizing and changing
and holding a bureaucracy account-
able, that is the job of Congress. That
is the job of everybody who gets elect-
ed.
So the idea of what should be done, I
think that first we need to make sure
that we are more specific on our
money, make sure there is better lead-
ership and, at the same time, never run
away from our values that this country
is based on immigrants and built by
immigrants.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. In fact, I want
to talk to you, because Americans ask
the question, rightfully, of Members of
Congress, ‘‘Okay. So you have identi-
fied a problem or you are complaining
about a problem. What is your solution
to it?’’ So I want to talk about that for
a second.
But a few more examples on the
Facebook group, because I really want
our colleagues to have a sense of how
deep this problem is and that it is not
just imaginary.
b 2115
This is right here in writing, in pic-
tures, and in language.
There was a post, and this is one of
the milder posts, but it is a meme. The
language on the meme says: ‘‘You
know what? I’m just going to say it.
. . . Hondurans have the stupidest
names ever.’’ Again, this is either a
current or former Border Patrol agent.
One more, and before I read this, I
want to explain something. In Border
Patrol, they have their own language.
One of the slurs that they use talking
about the desperate people who are pre-
senting themselves is the word ‘‘tonk.’’
People probably wonder what that
means. That word is supposed to be
what it sounds like when they hit one
of these folks over the head with a
flashlight. It makes that sound,
‘‘tonk.’’ They are using that as a slur
to describe the folks who are at the
border.
The meme is a picture of red, dead
meat laid out flat. The caption says,
‘‘Little tonk blanket ideas!’’
I mean, this is sick stuff.
I told McAleenan that some of these
people need to be taken off the beat.
These people, some of them are clearly
a danger to human life, in the way they
are talking and acting.
Combine that with a system where
there is hardly any accountability, if
any accountability at all, and it is very
dangerous, very dangerous not only for
the people who come into their care
but dangerous for their coworkers as
well.
These good agents are overrun. When
they try to do the right thing, try to
report abuse, try to report neglect, try
to report malfeasance, they are thwart-
ed by people higher up in Border Patrol
who take that information and do ab-
solutely zero about it.
What happens? A lot of people then
figure, ‘‘Well, nothing is going to hap-
pen if I actually report it, and there is
a chance that if these people find out I
am reporting it, they are going to take
retribution against me.’’
There is a whole group of people who
are working in the system who actu-
ally want to do the right thing, do
their jobs honestly, who are undercut,
thwarted, and slowly brought into this
rotten system because the people at
the top will not do anything to change
it.
Madam Speaker, Mr. GOMEZ men-
tioned some of the solutions. He men-
tioned the supplemental bill.
The supplemental bill was the Trump
administration coming forward and
asking for billions of dollars more in
funding because, it argued: There is a
surge at the border; there are more
people coming; so we need more money
for ICE, CBP, and HHS, which are the
kids.
There was a House version of that
bill. There was a Senate version of that
bill. The Senate bill is what finally
passed.
As Mr. GOMEZ mentioned, a big con-
cern that we had was that this Presi-
dent likes to play games with funding
in this administration. They like to
take money that Congress appropriates
for one purpose and then go use it for
something else.
Madam Speaker, as Mr. GOMEZ
knows, the biggest example of that was
when they wanted to take this military
money and use it to build a wall.
When I was in law school, and maybe
every law student studied this, there
is, of course, a famous jurist, Oliver
Wendell Holmes. In legal theory, he
had this ‘‘bad man’’ theory. The idea
was that laws needed to be written in
such a way that somebody who has no
shame at all, a bad man who is looking
to take advantage of any little crack in
the law that he can, we need to write a
law that prevents that from happening.
Right now, we are not in that situation
because the Trump administration is
able to do all these things and move
money around.
One of the big problems we had was a
lack of guardrails. They could take
this humanitarian aid and, instead of
using it for humanitarian purposes, di-
rect it toward a wall or toward some-
thing else, toward more ICE beds, to-
ward more HHS beds so that the pri-
vate contractors who run Homestead
and who also run private prisons can
make another $775 a day per child be-
cause they are growing their number
by 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 10,000 people.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, Mr.
CASTRO makes a good point regarding
the guardrails, the funding.
One of the things that I would like to
point out is if this administration, this
President, as he claimed, was the only
one who could solve this problem, then
why hasn’t it been solved?
It is a bigger mess and a bigger dis-
aster than we have ever seen, and that
is resulting in these conditions on the
border where people are mistreated.
This culture that is becoming rotten to
the core is starting to just fester. We
have seen an uncounted number of chil-
dren who have died.
According to Newsweek, there were
no migrant children who died while in
CBP custody during the final 6 years of
the Obama administration. Former
DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen pre-
viously admitted that it had been more
than a decade since a child had died in
CBP detention until December of last
year when the 8-year-old Guatemalan
national passed away on Christmas
Eve. Since then, at least four other
children have died while detained.
We are seeing this crisis get worse
and worse, and my fear is that we
haven’t hit the bottom yet. Until Con-
gress steps in and puts those guardrails
in place, until we flex our constitu-
tional muscle, we are going to see
things deteriorating further.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam
Speaker, in order to make sure that we
start to solve this problem, there is
legislation that the Congressional His-
panic Caucus and others are pushing
immediately.
There are a few specific things that
we need to do. One of them is that we
need to raise standards of care. Many
of us went out to Antelope Wells, New
Mexico, parts of rural New Mexico, and
we witnessed that CBP is understaffed,
underprepared, and under-resourced to
handle medical emergencies by these
asylum seekers, the folks who come in
with medical emergencies. Maybe they
go into diabetic shock. They encounter
some respiratory illness, and they are
very sick.
It is not that they were unprepared
to handle medical emergencies by asy-
lum seekers. They are also very unpre-
pared to handle emergency situations
by their own workers, Federal employ-
ees, CBP agents.
Dr. RAUL RUIZ, also from southern
California, is an emergency room med-
ical doctor. He was in Haiti after the
earthquake. He has been in disaster sit-
uations. He and his staff have done an
excellent job and spent a lot of time
coming up with legislation that raises
those standards of medical treatment
and of care.
We believe, based on everything that
we have seen, that some of these
deaths of these young children could
have been prevented if the standards of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5580 July 10, 2019
care had been appropriate and if these
kids had just been treated better. We
have to raise the standard of care.
When we went over to Antelope
Wells, they get 200 people who come to
present themselves for asylum. They
put them all in this sally port. They
have 200 people there, including some
infants, toddlers, et cetera.
What do they give them to eat? They
give them frozen burritos that they
heat up, frozen burritos for a 3-year-
old.
Pumping more cash into the system
is not the full answer to this. We don’t
just pump more cash into the system
so they can buy people burritos and
still not have nurses and doctors when
there is an emergency. We have to
raise the standard of care.
The second part is that we have to
move people through the process fast-
er. Remember, I said that with Presi-
dent Trump and the zero-tolerance pol-
icy, the remain-in-Mexico policy, all
this stuff, it has created a situation
where people are being held longer.
When we saw these dozen or so Cuban
women who were in this cell at El Paso
Border Station 1, some of them had
been at that Border Patrol station for
50 days. Some of them said they had
not showered or taken a bath for over
15 days. Some were grandmothers.
Some had been separated from their
kids and didn’t know where their kids
were. There were a few who said they
had not been given their prescription
medication. One of them had epilepsy,
and she said she had not gotten her
medication for epilepsy.
We walked over to what is this steel
toilet, because it is basically like a
prison cell. They are sleeping on con-
crete floors. There are painted cinder-
block walls. We go over to this steel
toilet. Directly above it, it has a sink.
The sink is not working. There is no
sink.
All these people going to the rest-
room, they can’t wash their hands be-
cause the sink doesn’t work. They are
staying there many, many, many days,
well beyond what the law prescribes
and the court settlements have pre-
scribed for how long somebody should
be staying there.
The final piece, as we know, is a
longer term thing, which is that we be-
lieve the United States and other coun-
tries in the Western Hemisphere—and I
believe that we should wrangle our al-
lies from around the world because
whenever there is some major crisis in
some other part of the world, those na-
tions ask the United States to help
out. We should ask the same of those
countries when something happens in
the Western Hemisphere, in this case,
in Central America.
My point is that we need to make se-
rious investments in the Northern Tri-
angle countries of Central America be-
cause I don’t believe that these people
want to get up and leave their homes
to make a 1,200-mile journey to the
United States if they don’t have to, if
they weren’t so desperate, if they
weren’t fleeing violence, if they
weren’t fleeing oppression. But that is
where they find themselves.
By the way, one more point on this:
The President wants to spend billions
and billions of dollars on the wall but
over the last several years has com-
mitted only hundreds of millions of
dollars in Central American aid.
I was speaking with MATT CART-
WRIGHT the other day, our colleague
from Pennsylvania. He made a great
point, which is if we took those billions
of dollars that we are spending on a
wall and used that as seed money to
start investing in Central America,
what we would do is help create safety
and opportunity in those countries so
that people don’t feel the need to come
to the United States, and we wouldn’t
have a surge of migration.
Like I said, I think those people want
to stay in their countries.
Also, Madam Speaker, even a few
days ago, I saw an article where there
was a very famous columnist, a writer
who made the case that this is a dif-
ferent situation. This migration from
Central America is a different situa-
tion from refugees who have fled to the
United States in previous generations.
His point was that they are not fleeing
state-sponsored oppression.
I believe that kind of thinking is an
anachronism. It is old thinking.
The fact is, somebody who is living in
Central America or anywhere around
the world can be just as oppressed and
put in danger and have their life
threatened and the lives of their family
threatened systematically by a drug
gang or a drug lord and these groups as
some dictator did in the 1960s or 1970s
in some other country.
I believe that threats to people have
evolved, that the refugee situation, the
asylee situation, has evolved and that
the United States should recognize
that evolution, just like other things
have evolved.
We should recognize that evolution
and recognize that the threats these
people are facing, even though it may
not be coming directly from the Cen-
tral American governments, are just as
dangerous as people who were fleeing
Vietnam in the 1970s or are just as dan-
gerous as the Cubans who were fleeing
the dictatorial Castro regime in the
early 1960s. We should recognize that.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I want
to stress a few points.
Mr. CASTRO mentioned that this ad-
ministration hasn’t invested in aid to
the Northern Triangle countries. One
of the things that we need to recognize
is that the zero-tolerance policy isn’t
working. It might feel good for
hardliners to say: ‘‘It is zero tolerance.
We are not going to take it anymore.
We are going to push back,’’ but it is
not solving the problem.
For example, the statistics show that
net migration from Mexico to the
United States is zero. In some in-
stances, it has declined, where more
Mexican nationals are returning to
Mexico than ever before.
Why is that? Mexico still has issues
regarding security, but its economy
has built up more and more.
b 2130
I have family members who are in
Mexico, and they have no desire to
move to the United States because
they believe that their opportunity
there is just as good as it is here.
So imagine if we want to be serious
about tackling the issue of undocu-
mented immigration to the United
States, especially from Latin American
countries. The way you do it is first by,
of course, creating a comprehensive
immigration reform here in this coun-
try but, at the same time, investing
the resources and the policies that
build up the economies of Latin Amer-
ica, thereby creating a situation where
people feel that, instead of risking
their lives to get here, they would
rather stay at home.
That is one thing that this adminis-
tration doesn’t understand, but we also
need to highlight for the American peo-
ple. The zero-tolerance policy, the
tough on undocumented immigration
hasn’t worked.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. In fact, more
people have come since the announce-
ment of that policy. It is an abject fail-
ure.
Mr. GOMEZ. And they know about
the conditions on the border, they
know about the risk that they are tak-
ing, but they are leaving some des-
perate situations. So the way you
make it so that they don’t want to
leave is that you make things better
for them at home.
Some folks will say, well, that is not
our responsibility; that is the responsi-
bility of their home countries. But if
you want to be a political realist about
how we solve it, you have to have
international aid, almost a Marshall
Plan, for Latin America in order to
build up their countries, their econo-
mies, their infrastructure, their train-
ing, and then make sure that we have
a system here that has enough legal
immigration in order for people to not
try to come into this country illegally.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Absolutely.
We talked about that piece, basically a
Marshall Plan for Central America, the
investment. And ZOE LOFGREN, another
colleague of yours from California—
northern California, San Jose—has got
legislation that addresses, essentially,
the start of a Marshall Plan for Central
America, which I believe she has filed
already.
And I mentioned RAUL RUIZ’s bill on
lifting standards.
Another bill that we are pushing very
strongly is the accountability piece.
We were talking about the CBP officers
and the fact that I can’t tell whether
there is any legitimate accountability
over there. My colleague from Texas,
VERONICA ESCOBAR, who represents El
Paso, has got a bill on accountability
that she has also filed.

So we are pushing these pieces of leg-
islation really hard, working with the
Speaker and others, to try to get some
of them passed before the end of this
July, before we go on the long August
recess.
LORI TRAHAN, another member of the
CHC, from Massachusetts, has got a
bill.
One of the problems, and you spoke
to it, is that DHS and HHS will often
try to deny Members of Congress ac-
cess to the facilities. People might say:
Okay, well, you are Members of Con-
gress and they are a different agency.
Why should you be able to go in when-
ever you want; right?
Well, remember, the legislative
branch has oversight over these execu-
tive agencies, and you can’t do your
job of oversight if they don’t let you in.
Or, if you have got to give 7 days’ no-
tice, they have a chance to just clean
everything up. In fact, if you read that
Facebook page by the Border Patrol
agents, they are talking about the fact
the facilities are cleaned up before
Members of Congress actually have a
chance to visit. So that is a problem.
Lori has got a bill that says that,
with 24 hours’ notice, we could, as
Members of Congress, go in there and
inspect these facilities.
So these are some of the pieces of
legislation, practical solutions, that we
are working on to overhaul the system
and improve this situation.
And, real quick, I mentioned that
trip last week to Clint and to El Paso
Border Patrol station number one. It
was a very intense visit and very tense,
also, a lot of people on that trip. It was
about half and half, half CHC members,
half not CHC members, but there were
many people who stepped up, and par-
ticularly the women who were on that
trip.
I got some video that I released. But
there are other portions of that, in that
room, other times in that room, where
MADELEINE DEAN, AYANNA PRESSLEY,
and, of course, ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-
CORTEZ were pressing the CBP officers
and a doctor there to explain why these
folks were being neglected.
In fact, to give a lot of credit to AL-
EXANDRIA, we would not have been able
to go into that room and I would not
have been able to document what had
happened except for the fact that she
basically insisted and barged into that
room to go see and talk to those
women.
NANETTE BARRAGÁN was great.
JOE KENNEDY, he and I went over to
another cell, and we spoke to a woman
who was in the early stages of preg-
nancy. She was there with another
family that included a young boy. They
had a seat that was working, actually.
But what I noticed was, in their cell,
they were reusing the same, like, seven
or eight or nine paper cups over and
over.
Paper cups are cups you throw away
or you recycle and you get another
one. They were making these people
use the same paper cups day after day.
For what?
Mr. GOMEZ. And we know, because
of that, you have a situation where
people are getting sick in these facili-
ties, and then putting the kids and the
people whose immune systems are
compromised into more vulnerable po-
sitions.
We definitely have a lot of work to
do, but in order to do that, we need to
make sure that the American people
know what is going on, to tell the story
and to not let people forget about the
kids who have passed away: Wilmer,
Carlos, Juan, Jakelin, Felipe, and
Mariee. Because if we forget, we turn
away, only more kids will perish and
more people will die at the border.
It is our moral obligation. It doesn’t
matter if they are not U.S. citizens. It
is our moral obligation to ensure that
doesn’t happen.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. That is abso-
lutely right.
These folks may not be citizens, they
are not legal residents when they
present themselves, but they are
human beings. This is the most power-
ful, prosperous, and, we believe, hu-
mane country on the face of this Earth.
We should be treating them a lot better
than we are treating them. I firmly be-
lieve that the overwhelming majority
of Americans believe that, regardless
of their politics.
Madam Speaker, Mr. GOMEZ read the
names of the six children who have
died over the last several months. Over
the last few years, there have been
about 24 adults who have died. I have
only been able to find 16 of their
names, but I want to read their names
also to remember them:
Yimi Alexis Balderramos-Torres;
Johana Medina Leon;
Simratpal Singh;
Abel Reyes-Clemente;
Guerman Volkov;
Mergensana Amar;
Wilfredo Padron;
Augustina Ramirez-Arreola;
Efrain De La Rosa;
Huy Chi Tran;
Zeresenay Ermias Testfatsion;
Roxana Hernandez;
Ronald Cruz;
Gourgen Mirimanian;
Luis Ramirez-Marcano, and
Yulio Castro-Garrido.
May all of them rest in peace. May
the children who also died rest in
peace. They were doing what people
throughout the generations have tried
to do from all over the world who were
fleeing oppression, violence, and des-
peration. They were trying to make it
to the United States of America. They
were trying to live in the United States
of America, and they died.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was

tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal Spirit, may our lawmakers
delight today in Your guidance, finding
joy in their fellowship with You. Lord,
strengthen them by this fellowship, en-
abling them to be like productive trees
planted by streams of water.
Lord, give our Senators the wisdom
to live for Your glory, using them to
provide deliverance for captives and
freedom for the oppressed.
In you, O God, we find refuge. Con-
tinue to guide us, strong deliverer, for
we are pilgrims in this life.
We pray in Your sovereign Name.

United States of America, and to the Repub-

indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to speak for 60
seconds as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
EAGLES ACT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President,
we are all very much concerned about
several mass instances of violence
around the country. The Secret Service
has a program of alerting people to
some of those things and training peo-
ple.
Understanding the common factors of
the past acts of mass violence can help
us prevent future tragedies. The Secret
Service, through its National Threat
Assessment Center, compiles and stud-
ies data on these risk factors.
Yesterday, the Secret Service re-
leased its report entitled ‘‘Mass At-
tacks in Public Spaces,’’ which con-
firms that there are often warning
signs before targeted violence.
Following up on the expertise of the
Secret Service, I introduced a bill that
goes by the acronym EAGLES Act to
expand the National Threat Assess-
ment Center to conduct additional re-
search and training to prevent targeted
violence.
Congress should pass this law to help
stop violence before it happens.
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-

f
ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
later today, all Senators will have the
opportunity to receive a classified
briefing on an issue of huge national
importance: the security and integrity
of our elections.
It is fitting that today’s session be
one bipartisan, all-Member briefing be-
cause, while it is a cliche to say that
certain priorities ought to be above
partisan squabbling, I know that every
one of us shares a genuine concern in
maintaining the process through which
American democracy plays out.
Those of my colleagues who have
read the January 2017 intelligence as-
sessment and the Mueller report will
understand that it is precisely our
unity and our faith in our democratic
system that Vladimir Putin seeks to
undermine.
Along with Americans’ First Amend-
ment rights to express themselves and
speak out, there are few things more
fundamental to the maintenance of our
Republic than the electoral process
itself.
Thomas Paine wrote, ‘‘The right of
voting for representatives is the pri-
mary right by which other rights are
protected.’’
So preserving and protecting the
elections that our State and local au-
thorities conduct is a crucial task.
From the Federal Government’s per-
spective, States are firmly in the lead,
but sometimes that means lending a
hand to local authorities. Obviously,
during the Civil Rights era, for exam-
ple, some Federal guidelines were nec-
essary to preserve integrity.
But many other times, doing the
right thing means defending against in-
terference, be it political interference
in the constitutionally protected role
of the States to conduct elections by
politicians and bureaucrats here in
Washington or, certainly, interference
from America’s adversaries abroad.
In 2016, Vladimir Putin sought to
interfere in our elections. I have read
the intelligence reports. I have read
the Mueller report. I have talked with
our Intelligence Committee, which has
investigated this indepth and has a re-
port coming out soon.
It is important to put Putin’s efforts
to interfere in our democracy in con-
text because he didn’t just decide in
2016 to take such a bold step. He kind
of worked up to it, undermining an
array of U.S. interests slowly but sure-
ly over 8 years of the previous adminis-
tration’s misguided approach to Rus-
sia.
Under President Obama, the U.S.-
Russia relationship seemed to be de-
fined by two constants: Putin’s grow-
ing assertiveness in foreign meddling
and the administration’s failure to con-
front it.
Putin’s 2008 invasion of the sovereign
country of Georgia was met by the so-
called reset in 2009, which swept the ag-
gression under the rug. The United
States may have reset our policy to

business as usual, but Putin’s aggres-
sion continued full bore.
There was the failure to respond to
Putin’s efforts to strangle democracy
in his own country by shuttering west-
ern NGOs, arresting dissidents, or pos-
sibly ordering the murder of political
opponent Boris Nemtsov.
To the extent that the United States
responded to the torture and murder by
Russian authorities of lawyer Sergei
Magnitsky, it was due to congressional
pressure.
There was also President Obama’s re-
sponse to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine
in 2014. Do any of my colleagues believe
the administration’s response to that
outrageous assault on the sovereignty
of Ukraine was sufficiently tough to
defend against Putin’s outrageous as-
sault on fundamental principles of sov-
ereignty and the international order?
There was the debacle with the Presi-
dent’s redline in Syria, which turned
out to be more like a red carpet for
Russian influence in Syria and the
Middle East.
And there was the President telling
Putin’s puppet Medvedev that he could
have more ‘‘flexibility’’ to treat Russia
differently once he became a lameduck.
All this was under a President who
thought it was a clever laugh line to
mock our now-colleague Senator ROM-
NEY for correctly labeling Russia as a
threat.
The consequences of American weak-
ness toward Russia were numerous.
The more Obama gave, the more Putin
took.
Among those consequences, as we all
know, was that Putin felt sufficiently
emboldened to seek to interfere in our
2016 Presidential election. Through ef-
forts to divide Americans on social
media and to hack a political party,
agents of a foreign government sought
to inject division, doubt, and chaos
into our democracy—a sad and embar-
rassing episode.
President Trump has expressed an in-
terest in a better relationship with
Russia, but the actions his administra-
tion has taken—which he has author-
ized—demonstrate that such a relation-
ship will not prevent America from
pushing back against Russian aggres-
sion.
The administration has pushed back
against Russia in meaningful ways, im-
posing new costs on Putin and his cro-
nies for their malign activities and im-
proving our defenses against Russian
active measures. We have adopted new
national security and defense strate-
gies that treat Russian aggression like
the serious threat that it is. We have
begun to rebuild our military strength,
which was eroded by years of budget
cuts and further damaged by sequestra-
tion. We have taken steps to provide
Georgia and Ukraine with arms to de-
fend against Russian aggression—weap-
ons denied to them by the previous ad-
ministration despite bipartisan support
from Congress. We worked to block
Moscow’s efforts to increase European
reliance on Russian oil and gas. Sec-
retary Mattis led efforts—continued by
his successors—to reform and strength-
en NATO.
So important changes are underway
at the strategic level. Now we are back
to projecting the strength, principle,
and resolve that America ought to
project.
In addition, the Trump administra-
tion has also punched back in very spe-
cific ways in response to the election
interference that happened on the
Obama administration’s watch. Thanks
to the work of the Special Counsel and
the Department of Justice, 28 Russian
nationals, intelligence officers, and
corporate interests were indicted for
their participation in the interference.
And in 2018, the administration ex-
pelled another 60 Russian agents in re-
sponse to the poisoning of a former of-
ficial living in the United Kingdom.
These agents are no longer free to con-
duct intelligence operations or active
measures here in America.
These are all tough, important steps
that pertain to our broader foreign pol-
icy efforts to defer future threats, but
there has also been significant work
done specifically on our election secu-
rity. The administration worked quick-
ly to address vulnerabilities and ensure
that 2018 wouldn’t be a reprise of 2016.
The administration directed re-
sources through the Department of
Homeland Security to help local elec-
tion authorities implement stronger
cybersecurity measures. Information
sharing was streamlined between DHS,
FBI, and State and local officials.
They worked hard to gain the trust
of State election officials in my State
of Kentucky and around the country
and provide them with valuable infor-
mation through a voluntary informa-
tion-sharing program that has seen
participation from all 50 States and
1,400 localities.
Here in Congress, we appropriated
hundreds of millions of dollars in addi-
tional aid for State governments to
strengthen their systems, and our ef-
forts continue. This year’s Defense and
Intelligence authorization bills include
provisions that will help defend our-
selves and our allies against Russian
aggression.
The administration will brief us
today in classified session about the
many steps U.S. agencies have taken
since 2016 to improve our defenses and
bolster our deterrence against adver-
saries who seek to undermine our de-
mocracy.
The smooth and secure execution of
the 2018 election illustrates the success
of these measures. This was not a coin-
cidence.
Congress has taken even further ac-
tion since then, building new legisla-
tive safeguards to increase trans-
parency and coordination with the in-
telligence community on election secu-
rity.
In short, it is abundantly clear that
the administration and Congress take
this issue seriously. I look forward to
hearing more from the administration
today about what steps have led to this
greater success and what even further
safeguards they are working on in ad-
vance of 2020.
Of course, Congress will need to con-
tinue closely monitoring the progress
and assess whether future legislative
steps might be needed as well. But, as
with any time when Washington politi-
cians are clamoring to grab greater
control over something this important,
we need to make sure this conversation
is clear-eyed and sober and serious.
I remember it was President Obama’s
first Chief of Staff who said: ‘‘You
never want a serious crisis to go to
waste.’’ In other words, bad news can
give politicians cover to do things they
have wanted to do for a long time.
Remember, it was only months ago
that the new Democratic majority in
the House decided their top priority for
the entire Congress was a massive bill
I called the Democratic politician pro-
tection act—a sprawling Federal power
grab over election law and citizens’ po-
litical speech.
Among other provisions, it would
make the FEC, the currently non-
partisan body that regulates political
speech, into a partisan weapon.
They also want to give Washington
more power to prohibit citizens groups
from weighing in on politicians’ job
performance. They have twice passed
bills aimed at centralizing election ad-
ministration decisions in the Federal
Government, in part on the hope that
election attorneys, not voters, will get
to determine the outcome of more elec-
tions—provision after provision that
would erode longstanding safeguards.
That was the huge proposal just a few
months ago.
In light of this, it is interesting that
some of our colleagues across the aisle
seem to have already made up their
minds before we hear from the experts
later today that a brandnew, sweeping
Washington intervention is just what
the doctor ordered.
I, for one, am looking forward to lis-
tening to the experts, to hearing more
about why the Trump administration
was more successful in 2018 than the
Obama administration was in 2016. I
look forward to ensuring that any addi-
tional Federal action actually address-
es the problems at hand; that it pre-
serve, rather than undermine, the care-
ful checks and balances that have long
been key parts of American democracy
since the beginning.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, a new
report from NBC News last night de-
tailed the inhumane treatment of mi-
grant children at the Arizona border
stations: allegations of sexual assault,
retaliation by Customs and Border Pro-
tection officers, overcrowding, lack of
showers, lack of clean clothes, and lack
of space to sleep. The accounts made
by dozens of children at these facilities
are horrifying and are completely un-
acceptable.
In the wake of several similar reports
about the treatment of migrants by
CBP officers in Texas, in the wake of
revelations of secret Facebook groups
where Border Patrol officers joke about
the horrid treatment of migrants, it is
abundantly clear that there is a toxic
culture at Border Patrol that can only
be changed—only be changed—by the
immediate firing and replacing of top
leadership at the Agency. CBP needs to
clean house. The top people at CBP
ought to be fired now.
In just a few days on the job, Mark
Morgan, the Acting Commissioner, has
already shown himself to be far too cal-
lous about the way in which children
and their families are treated. We need
committed law enforcement profes-
sionals to take over the CBP, particu-
larly those who have training and ex-
pertise in working with vulnerable pop-
ulations.
There are rumors that Mr. Morgan
was chosen because he is a tough guy—
a tough guy—on kids. But he is a tough
guy who will tolerate an out-of-control
culture in many parts of the CBP.
It is a perfectly wrong choice for
what is going on there. I will say this
to President Trump. He is not going to
help you. Whatever Americans’ views
are on immigration, they don’t like
pictures of little children in squalid
and awful conditions, whoever they
are.
The Acting Secretary of Homeland
Security, Kevin McAleenan, who over-
sees CBP, needs to take this matter
into his own hands. He has shown far
more balance, far more expertise, and
far more ability to talk about the
truth—not some ideology—than Mor-
gan or some of the others. He should
take this matter into his own hands
and pursue changes to the Agency that
go beyond mere investigations and re-
ports.
CBP needs a real change in personnel
and in leadership, and it needs it now.
The reports by NBC News and many
others are a stain on this great Nation.
We are not perfect. We are a lot better
than most everyone else. But in the
past, when there was a problem, we
didn’t revel in it; we tried to solve it.
We cannot allow what is happening at
the border to continue.
SOCIAL MEDIA
Mr. President, on another matter, a
few weeks ago, it was reported that the
author of a blatantly, virulently anti-
Semitic cartoon depicting the Roth-
schilds and Soros was invited—actually
invited to a social media summit at the
White House. Up until yesterday, when
the White House was asked questions
about why he was invited, there was no
answer. Reportedly, some in the ad-
ministration privately defended the in-
vitation of this out-and-out bigot. Only
last night when it all became public did
the White House finally revoke the in-
vitation. But it is an absolute disgrace
that it was extended in the first place
and that it took them long to rescind.
And it is a disgrace that the White
House has not rescinded the invitations
for several other individuals planning
to attend who have spewed hateful and
bigoted views online.
The plain truth is this: This Presi-
dent and this administration are
shockingly willing to provide succor to
some of the most hateful ideologues,
ideologies, and viewpoints. The Presi-
dent has promoted White supremacists
on his Twitter feed while constantly
criticizing social media platforms for
removing hateful content. In doing so,
he has defended people like Alex Jones
and his detestable, conspiracy-ridden
radio show.
The idea that everybody should be
able to post on social media sites no
matter how disgusting the content is
wrong, in my view. When vicious, rac-
ist, anti-Semitic, and Islamophobic
hate speech is posted online, social
media sites, as private companies,
should be able to remove that content.
But this President amazingly seems to
believe that when offensive language is
coming from a rightwing source and it
is taken off social media sites, that is
censorship. That is the message this
social media summit seeks to advance,
and it is un-American.
At the same time, we hear that the
White House and congressional Repub-
licans are all too eager to decry anti-
Semitism when they perceive it from a
political opponent on the left. Well,
where are those folks when the White
House does something like this? Where
are they? It seems some of our friends
on the other side of the aisle want to
politicize the issue of anti-Semitism,
which should be condemned when any-
body talks about it, but unfortunately
we heard silence from our Republican
friends when this virulently anti-Se-
mitic cartoonist was invited to the
White House—not a peep. And what he
did was despicable and reminiscent of
what was done before dictatorships
took over in Europe.
The White House was right to revoke
the invitation. It never should have
been issued in the first place. A social
media summit designed to give support
to the most radical viewpoints on so-
cial media should never have been
planned by the White House in the first
place. It should be obvious, but with
this President, unfortunately, the obvi-
ous bears repeating: The President of
the United States should appeal to the
better angels of our nature and not
provide support to the basest voices in
our society. It is another reason this
Presidency is just a disgrace—a dis-
grace in terms of American values,
American morals, and American hon-
esty.
ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. President, now on election secu-
rity, later this afternoon, Members
from both sides of the aisle will take
part in an all-Senate briefing on the
threats faced by our elections in the
2020 campaign cycle. We are all no
doubt aware of the general threat to
our elections from foreign interference.
It is crucial to hear from our law en-
forcement, defense, and intelligence
communities about the specific nature
of those threats and, just as impor-
tant—probably more important—how
we can counteract them and how we
can prevent foreign interference in the
2020 election, which everybody, regard-
less of party—Democratic, Republican,
liberal, or conservative—should be

interfere in our elections. It didn’t
seem too much of a problem for dec-
ades and centuries, but it has now
reared its ugly head—by the way,
showing the amazing wisdom of the
Washingtons and the Madisons and the
Franklins and the Founding Fathers.
The briefing we are going to have
should serve as a turning point for this
Chamber. It should focus our attention
and spark an urgent debate on how to
protect our democracy from future at-
tacks. The briefing this afternoon
should be a springboard for action. So
I was amazed to listen to Republican
Leader MCCONNELL this morning, who,
before the briefing has even taken
place, seems to be prejudging the re-
sults of the meeting, saying that an-
other Washington intervention in this
matter is misguided. I was amazed to
hear Leader MCCONNELL take credit for
the election security funding which
Democrats fought tooth and nail to in-
clude in the Appropriations bill and
which was initially opposed by many of
our Republican colleagues. They skip
over the fact that Leader MCCONNELL
and Republicans are right now block-
ing our efforts to include additional re-
sources this year.
Leader MCCONNELL, if you are brag-
ging about having put it in in 2016 and
the FBI says the threat in 2020 will be
greater, why aren’t you letting us put
more money in now? Why aren’t you
supporting that?
It makes no sense—a contradiction
once again.
And here, amazingly enough, we hear
Leader MCCONNELL echoing President
Trump blaming President Obama for
the interference in the 2016 election—
blaming President Obama. The Rus-
sians interfered. They certainly had
conversations with the Trump adminis-
tration. Donald Trump encouraged
them to interfere, publicly. And now
Leader MCCONNELL has the temerity to
blame President Obama? What a re-
markable feat of revisionist history.
Let’s be clear on two things. First,
President Putin interfered in our elec-
tions, and he is to blame. Second, the
Trump administration has not done
enough to hold him and his oligarchs
accountable. President Trump re-
cently, when he met with President
Putin, sort of made a joke of it. That is
disgraceful. That is un-American. That
is not defending the security of Amer-
ica.
Now, according to reports, we learn
that the majority leader refused to
work on a bipartisan basis to warn the
public about Putin’s interference in
our elections in the midst of the 2016
election. And he blames President
Obama when he was the one who didn’t
want to make it public? Give us a
break.
We have a duty to the country to
take this seriously and not whitewash
the facts or prejudge the conclusions.
This is about protecting the wellspring
of our democracy—it is not political—
and ensuring Americans have absolute
faith that our elections will be free and
fair.
It is unbelievable that in this Trump
administration, unlike any other ad-
ministration—Democratic or Repub-
lican—before it, interference in the
election by a foreign power is made po-
litical. It is a disgrace.
I hope today’s briefing provides Mem-
bers with specific information about
what the departments and agencies are
doing to combat the threat to our elec-
tions and what we ought to do next.
After it concludes, we cannot let this
issue sit on the back burner. Demo-
crats and Republicans alike must roll
up their sleeves and get to work—the
majority leader included.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. President, on healthcare, finally,
as oral arguments continue today in
Texas v. the United States, we must
not lose sight of what is at stake here.
Republican attorneys general, with the
Trump administration’s full support
and backing, are trying to dismantle
our healthcare system. They are argu-
ing that millions of Americans—in-
cluding 133 million Americans under 65
who live with a preexisting condition—
should lose their care and their protec-
tions.
The lawsuit that President Trump
supports and our Republican colleagues
refuse to condemn would say to a
mother or father of a child with cancer:
If the insurance company wants to cut
you off, tell you that you can’t get the
treatment your kid so desperately
needs to live, that is OK.
Where are those Republican voices?
We all know the statistics, but there
is a human cost and a human story be-
hind each one. Emilie is one of my con-
stituents, and I shared her story on the
steps of the Senate yesterday. She was
a healthy and active, vibrant young
girl at age 7, but her life was turned
upside down after a tragic accident.
She fell off a horse and suffered a trau-
matic brain injury. Emilie had to re-
learn how to walk, how to talk, and
how to eat—a 7-year-old.
The biggest challenge Emilie’s fam-
ily faced came when her private insur-
ance said to her: Only 60 days of rehab,
Emilie, and then you are out. It doesn’t
matter if you still can’t feed yourself,
and it doesn’t matter if you can’t walk.
But she was saved because of Med-
icaid. Medicaid stepped in, and the pro-
tections for Americans with pre-
existing conditions prevailed. Now
Emilie has a great chance in the fu-
ture. Do we want to tell Emilie’s par-
ents that we want to just cut this off?
What is wrong with our Republican
friends here? It is the height of hypoc-
risy for Republicans to pledge support
for Americans with preexisting condi-
tions during the campaign season and
then be silent as the Trump adminis-
tration sues to take away all protec-
tions.
I call on Senate Republicans, for the
sake of the Emilies and the millions
like her, to speak out against this
reckless lawsuit—a lawsuit that would
spell disaster for millions of hard-
working, fine citizens in this country.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we just
heard the Democratic leader talking
about the issue of healthcare and at-
tacking the President and Republicans
for not being supportive of protections
for preexisting conditions, and I can
tell you that is just not true. I can’t
think of a single Republican who
doesn’t believe we ought to provide
protection for people with preexisting
conditions.
Democrats have not acknowledged
that ObamaCare has failed, and I think
we can all see the evidence of that. We
have seen skyrocketing premiums,
copays, out-of-pocket costs,
deductibles—all of those things have
gone through the roof for a lot of peo-
ple, particularly in the individual mar-
ket—as well as a reduction in the num-
ber of choices and options. Fewer op-
tions and higher costs have been the
legacy of ObamaCare, so the Democrats
know it has to be replaced. The reason
they know it and you can tell it has to
be replaced is that they are already out
there talking about a proposal—a com-
pletely one-size-fits-all, government-
run, national approach to taking over
people’s healthcare in this country
called Medicare for All, at a cost of $32
trillion, which I will come back to in
just a moment.
The President and his administration
have also acknowledged that
ObamaCare has failed because of the
skyrocketing costs and fewer choices
and have chosen to try to get that re-
pealed through the courts. Either way,
we are going to be having a discussion
about healthcare here and about what
is the best system moving forward.
Republicans, of course, as I men-
tioned, believe we have to protect peo-
ple with preexisting conditions. What-
ever follows in ObamaCare’s wake, I
think there is agreement on both sides
of the aisle—both Republicans and
Democrats—that preexisting condi-
tions will be covered.
So let’s just take that political argu-
ment off the table because that is all it
is. It is nothing more, nothing less,
nothing else than a political argument
made by Democrats when they know
full well that Republicans are on the
record in support of protecting people
with preexisting conditions.
The question is, What will we replace
it with? We believe, obviously, that
there is a much better approach that
gives people more choices, more op-
tions, and creates more competition in
the marketplace, which would put
downward pressure on prices.
The Democrats, as I said, have en-
dorsed and are supporting a $32 trillion
government takeover of the healthcare
system in this country, which will put
enormous costs on the backs of work-
ing people in this country. I will come
back to that in just a moment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4747
July 10, 2019
created in June, the latest piece of
good news about our strong economy.
Thanks to the historic tax reform we
passed in 2017 and our efforts to lift
burdensome regulations, our economy
has been thriving. Economic growth is
up, and wages are growing at the
strongest rate in a decade. Personal in-
come is up, and unemployment is near
its lowest level in half a century.
The benefits of this progress are
being spread far and wide. Wages for
the lowest earning workers are rising
faster than for the highest earning
workers. Hundreds of thousands of new
blue-collar jobs have been created. Un-
employment rates for minorities have
fallen. The unemployment rates for
Asian Americans, African Americans,
and Hispanic Americans are all at or
near record lows.
The Wall Street Journal notes,
‘‘Nearly one million more blacks and 2
million more Hispanics are employed
than when Barack Obama left office,
and minorities account for more than
half of all new jobs created during the
Trump Presidency.’’
When Republicans took control of
the Congress and the White House 21⁄2
years ago, we had one goal: Make life
better for hard-working Americans. We
knew that Americans had a tough time
during President Obama’s administra-
tion, and we were determined to put
more money in Americans’ pockets and
to expand opportunities for working
families. That is exactly what we did.
Our tax reform legislation, combined
with other Republican economic poli-
cies, has created an economy that has
lifted up Americans from across the
economic spectrum.
There is still more work, of course,
that needs to be done. Farmers and
ranchers, for example, in places like
my home State of South Dakota, are
still struggling thanks to years of com-
modity and livestock prices below pro-
duction costs, protracted trade dis-
putes, and natural disasters. But over-
all, American workers are doing better
than they have in a long time.
Now we need to focus on preserving
and building on the policies that have
made life better for American workers
over the past 2 years, but that is not
what will happen if Democrats have
their way. Democrats are not only in-
terested in eliminating a large portion,
if not all, of the tax relief that Repub-
licans passed; they are pushing pro-
posals that would result in massive tax
hikes on ordinary Americans.
Take Medicare for All, as I men-
tioned earlier, which is a Democratic
proposal for government-run
healthcare. A conservative estimate
sets the pricetag for this proposal at
$32 trillion over 10 years—more money
than the U.S. Government has spent in
the past 8 years combined on every-
thing. A more realistic estimate is
likely substantially higher, given that
the Senator from Vermont’s current
Medicare for All plan includes coverage
for long-term care, which is an enor-
mously expensive benefit.
On top of that, most of the Demo-
cratic Presidential candidates have en-
dorsed providing government-funded
healthcare to illegal immigrants as
well. It is not just a matter of pro-
viding healthcare to the millions of un-
documented immigrants already here
in the United States. More and more
Democrats are embracing what is effec-
tively an open-border policy, which
means the number of individuals here
legally can skyrocket, further driving
up the massive costs of the one-size-
fits-all, government-run healthcare
proposal the Democrats are putting
forward. The final pricetag, I am sug-
gesting, could be far more than $32 tril-
lion.
Of course, Democrats’ proposals are
not limited to putting the government
in charge of healthcare. They have lots
of other ideas for more government
spending, such as having the govern-
ment pay for millions of students’ col-
lege education or eliminating student
loan debt—although they don’t men-
tion any benefits for Americans who
have already done a lot of work to help
pay off their student loans.
As expensive as paying for these pro-
posals would be, they pale in compari-
son to the Democrats’ most expansive
socialist fantasy, the Green New Deal,
which has been estimated to cost some-
where between $51 and $93 trillion over
10 years—$93 trillion. That is more
money than the economic output of
every country in the entire world in
2017 combined.
How are Democrats going to pay for
these policies? Well, when they have an
answer, it usually involves taxing the
rich. That is all very well, until one re-
alizes there is no way to pay for these
policies just by taxing the rich. Medi-
care for All alone would ultimately re-
quire massive tax hikes on ordinary
Americans and on American busi-
nesses.
What will be the consequences of
that? Well, a substantially lower stand-
ard of living for American families who
would see their tax bill soar and their
take-home pay shrink, plus massive
tax hikes would wreak devastation on
the economy. Load a small or larger
business with new taxes, and its ability
to grow, invest, expand, and hire new
workers shrinks dramatically. That
would mean lower wages, fewer jobs,
and reduced opportunities for Amer-
ican families already burdened with
new tax hikes.
Lowering taxes for American fami-
lies and American businesses has
grown Americans’ paychecks and pro-
vided them with access to new and bet-
ter jobs and opportunities. Raising
their taxes would have the opposite ef-
fect. Yet raising Americans’ taxes is
exactly what would happen under the
Democrats’ plans.
Let’s hope that Democrats think bet-
ter of their proposals before the Amer-
ican people are forced to foot the bill.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that notwith-
standing the previously scheduled vote
at 11 o’clock, I be allowed to complete
my remarks before that vote occurs.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
DEBBIE SMITH ACT
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President,
throughout my career, dating back to
my days as Texas attorney general, I
have long been a proud advocate for
crime victims’ rights. I believe we all
have a responsibility to provide men
and women impacted by such trau-
matic events the resources and care
they need when they need it.
Right now the Congress has an oppor-
tunity to pass two separate pieces of
legislation to support victims of sexual
assault and domestic violence. Sadly,
both bills have been caught in the
crosshairs of political jockeying in the
House, with Democrats using a tit-for-
tat strategy that has frozen both bills.
One of those bills is called the Debbie
Smith Act. The namesake of this legis-
lation is a woman whom I have had the
honor of working with many times
over the years. She is a fierce advocate
for victims of sexual assault.
Like so many victims, her advocacy
was born from a personal experience. In
1989, she was abducted from her home
and raped in a wooded area. She re-
ported the crime to police and went to
the emergency room for a forensic ex-
amination, but there were no imme-
diate answers. Though exact numbers
are difficult to estimate, some experts
believe that there are hundreds of
thousands of untested rape kits that
remain across the United States.
For 61⁄2 years the DNA evidence of
Debbie’s attacker sat on a shelf in an
evidence locker while she constantly
wondered who her attacker was and
when he would appear again. Chan-
neling that fear and frustration, Debbie
made it her mission in life to eliminate
the rape kit backlog. I have no doubt
that because of her and the important
legislation this Congress has passed for
the past 15 years, we were making
some pretty incredible progress toward
her goal.
In 2004, the Debbie Smith Act was
signed into law to provide State and
local crime labs with the resources to
end the backlog of unsolved crimes.
More than $1 billion has been provided
to these forensic labs because of this
law, and the legislation passed by the
Senate in May will provide even great-
er resources for the program.
While the original purpose of the leg-
islation was to reduce the rape kit
backlog, this DNA evidence serves mul-
tiple purposes. It enables law enforce-
ment to identify and convict people
who commit other violent crimes and
takes more criminals off the street. It
also has a corresponding benefit for the
wrongfully accused. It can actually ex-
clude people based on the DNA test re-
sults in the forensic rape kit.
Because of the Debbie Smith Act,
more than 860,000 DNA cases have been

processed, and 360,000 DNA profiles
have been uploaded into the FBI’s
database. This accounts for 43 percent
of all forensic profiles in the FBI’s
DNA database. The benefits of this law
cannot be overstated. That is why the
Debbie Smith Act was easily reauthor-
ized in both 2008 and 2014.
Now it is time once again to reau-
thorize this important legislation. Ear-
lier this year, Senator FEINSTEIN and I
introduced the Debbie Smith Act of
2019, which reauthorizes the important
funding that supports the testing of
this DNA evidence. Things like train-
ing for law enforcement, correctional
officers, training for forensic nurses
and other professionals who assist vic-
tims of sexual assault are also included
in this bill. When the Senate voted in
May, not a single Senator voted
against it—not one. It was unanimous.
But here we are nearly 2 months later
and the House of Representatives
hasn’t lifted a finger.
The bill isn’t partisan. It is not divi-
sive. It is not controversial. So why do
they refuse to bring the bill up for a
vote? Well, they are not holding this
bill up because they are working on a
different version or because they dis-
agree with any of the provisions or be-
cause they simply don’t like it. No,
they are actually holding it hostage to
try to force a vote on their
ultrapartisan version of the Violence
Against Women Act, or VAWA, the sec-
ond piece of legislation they are stop-
ping. Actually, Democrats allowed the
current Violence Against Women Act
to expire over Republican objections so
that they could maintain this leverage
to pass their ultrapartisan version of
VAWA sometime later.
Folks on both sides of the aisle can
agree it is time to make some impor-
tant improvements in VAWA, and our
colleague Senator ERNST from Iowa has
been working very hard to try to come
up with a good bipartisan bill. It de-
serves to be reauthorized and strength-
ened to ensure victims have access to
the services and protections they need.
Going through the regular order is
something I support, and it is an effort
that has been led by, as I said, Senator
ERNST from Iowa. But the version of
the bill that has passed in the House is
a far cry from any kind of consensus
legislation. It includes provisions that
would never pass in the Senate, and
that is why it passed the House, in
order to create that conflict and that
obstacle.
It is not fair to Debbie Smith and
other victims of sexual assault for
House Democrats to hold them hostage
over a separate bill that is still being
negotiated in good faith by Members
on both sides of the aisle.
Despite repeated requests from advo-
cates and victims’ rights groups to pass
the Debbie Smith Act freestanding, the
House has, once again, chosen to play
politics.
I understand Debbie has requested to
meet with leadership in the House, and
I strongly encourage them to take the
time to talk to Debbie and hear her
perspective on why this legislation is
so critical and why it must be passed
now. House Democrats refuse to pass
the Debbie Smith Act and help crime
labs eliminate the rape kit backlog.
They refuse to negotiate in good faith
on VAWA, Violence Against Women
Act, reauthorization and what that
might look like. Unfortunately, they
have succumbed to the temptation of
playing partisan politics with pretty
important legislation and hurting a lot
of innocent people in the meantime. I
find that absolutely unacceptable.
I would urge our colleague Speaker
PELOSI to bring the Debbie Smith Act
up for a vote and quit using sexual as-
sault victims as a bargaining chip.
I yield the floor.

HEALTHCARE
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I
come to the floor because Democrats
out on the campaign trail continue to
spin their one-size-fits-all healthcare
plan that they call Medicare for All.
The name itself is misleading. I will
state that as a doctor who has prac-
ticed medicine in Wyoming for 24
years.
Even many Democrats in the first
Presidential debate sounded confused
about their own proposal. The can-
didates were asked a simple question.
They were asked to raise their hands if
they supported eliminating private
health insurance. That is the health in-
surance people get from work. ‘‘Just
four arms went up over the two
nights,’’ but ‘‘five candidates who kept
their hands at their sides,’’ the New
York Times has now reported, ‘‘have
signed onto bills in [this] Congress that
do exactly that’’—take health insur-
ance away from people who get it from
work.
On one point, though, they all raised
their hands. That was on the question
that was asked of all 10 Democrats in
round 2 of the debate. They all en-
dorsed taxpayer-funded healthcare for
illegal immigrants. Every hand went
up.
It seems Democrats have actually
been hiding their real, radical agenda.
‘‘Most Americans don’t realize how
dramatically Medicare-for-all would re-
structure the nation’s health care sys-
tem.’’ That is not just me talking; that
is according to the latest Kaiser Fam-
ily Foundation poll. We need to set the
record straight, and I am ready to do
that right now.
The fact is, Democrats have taken a
hard left turn, and they want to take
away your health insurance if you get
it from work. The proposal abolishes
private health insurance, the insurance
people get from work. In its place, they
would have one expensive, new govern-
ment-run system. Still, Democrats
know most of us would rather keep our
own coverage that we get from work.
Even the people on Medicare Advan-
tage—20 million people—would lose it
under the Democrats’ proposal. The
Kaiser poll confirms Americans’ top
concern is, of course, lowering their
costs or, as the Washington Post
‘‘Health’’ column put it, people simply
want ‘‘to pay less for their own health
care.’’
That is what we are committed to on
this side of the aisle.
Many Democrats running for Presi-
dent continue to promote and support
this radical scheme by Senator SAND-
ERS. The Sanders legislation would
take away healthcare insurance from
180 million people who get their insur-
ance through work, through their jobs.
In addition, 20 million people who buy
their insurance would lose coverage as
well.
You also need to know that the
Democrats’ proposal ends the current
government healthcare programs.
Medicare for seniors would be gone.
Federal employees’ health insurance
would be gone. TRICARE for the mili-
tary would be gone, and the children’s
health coverage also would be gone
under this Democratic healthcare, one-
size-fits-all plan. That is confirmed by
the Congressional Research Service.
The Congressional Research Service
recently sent me a formal legal opin-
ion. I requested it from them. It is a
formal, legal opinion, stating: Medi-
care for All ‘‘would . . . largely dis-
place these existing federally funded
health programs’’ that I just men-
tioned—Medicare, Federal employees’
health insurance, TRICARE, children’s
health coverage. It would largely dis-
place these existing Federal health
programs as well as private health in-
surance, the insurance people get from
work.

sent to have printed in the RECORD the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4750 July 10, 2019
Congressional Research Service memo-
randum, dated May 29, 2019.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
MEMORANDUM
To: Senator John Barrasso, Attention: Jay
Eberle.
From: Wen S. Shen, Legislative Attorney.
Subject: Effect of S. 1129 on Certain Feder-
ally Funded Health Programs and Pri-
vate Health Insurance.
Pursuant to your request, this memo-
randum discusses the legal effect of S. 1129,
the Medicare for All Act of 2019 (MFAA or
Act) on various public and private health
care programs or plans. Specifically, the
memorandum analyzes whether the MFAA
would authorize the following programs or
plans to continue in their current form:
Medicare (including Medicare Advantage
and Part D);
Medicaid (including the Children’s Health
Insurance Program);
TRICARE;
Plans under the Employee Retirement In-
come Security Act; and
Individual, Small and Large Group Market
Coverage.
For reasons discussed in greater detail
below, the Program created by the MFAA
would, following a phase-in period and with
some limited exceptions, largely displace
these existing federally funded health pro-
grams as well as private health insurance.
This memorandum begins with a description
of the key provisions of the MFAA before
turning to its legal effect on the programs
and plans that are the subject of your re-
quest.
MEDICARE FOR ALL ACT OF 2019
The MFAA aims to establish a national
health insurance program (Program) that
would ‘‘provide comprehensive protection
against the cost of health care and health-re-
lated services’’ in accordance with the stand-
ards set forth under the Act. Specifically,
under the Program, every resident of the
United States, after a four-year phase-in pe-
riod following the MFAA’s enactment, would
be entitled to have the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (Secretary) make pay-
ments on their behalf to an eligible provider
for services and items in 13 benefits cat-
egories, provided they are ‘‘medically nec-
essary or appropriate for the maintenance of
health or diagnosis, treatment or rehabilita-
tion of a health condition.’’ Except for pre-
scription drugs and biological products, for
which the Secretary may set a cost-sharing
schedule that would not exceed $200 annually
per enrollee and meet other statutory cri-
teria, no enrollee would be responsible for
any cost-sharing for any other covered bene-
fits under the Program. The bill would direct
the Secretary to develop both a mechanism
for enrolling existing eligible individuals by
the end of the phase-in period and a mecha-
nism for automatically enrolling newly eligi-
ble individuals at birth or upon establishing
residency in the United States.
All state-licensed health care providers
who meet the applicable state and federal
provider standards may participate in the
Program, provided they file a participation
agreement with the Secretary that meets
specified statutory requirements. The Sec-
retary would pay participating providers
pursuant to a fee schedule that would be set
in a manner consistent with the processes
for determining payments under the existing
Medicare program. Participating providers
would be prohibited from balance billing en-
rollees for any covered services paid under
the Program, but providers would be free to
enter into private contracts with enrollees
to provide any item or service if no claims
for payment are submitted to the Secretary
and the contracts meet certain statutory re-
quirements.
With respect to payment for covered phar-
maceuticals, medical supplies, and medically
necessary assistive equipment, the Secretary
would negotiate their payment rate annually
with the relevant manufacturers. The bill
would further direct the Secretary to estab-
lish a prescription drug formulary system
that would encourage best practices in pre-
scribing; discourage the use of ineffective,
dangerous, or excessively costly medica-
tions; and promote the use of generic medi-
cations to the greatest extent possible. Off-
formulary medications would be permitted
under the Program, but their use would be
subject to further regulations the Secretary
issues.
With respect to the Program’s administra-
tion, the bill would authorize the Secretary
to develop the relevant policies, procedures,
guidelines, and requirements necessary to
carry out the Program. The Secretary would
also establish and maintain regional of-
fices—by incorporating existing regional of-
fices of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services where possible—to assess annual
state health care needs, recommend changes
in provider reimbursement, and establish a
quality assurance mechanism in the state
aimed at optimizing utilization and main-
taining certain standards of care.
To fund the Program, the bill would create
a Universal Medicare Trust Fund. Funds cur-
rently appropriated to Medicare, Medicaid,
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Pro-
gram (FEHBP), TRICARE, and a number of
other federally funded health programs
would be appropriated to the new fund.
The MFAA also includes a number of other
provisions related to the administration of
the Program, including an enforcement pro-
vision aimed at preventing fraud and abuse,
provisions relating to quality assessment,
and provisions concerning budget and cost
containment.
EFFECT OF THE MFAA ON CERTAIN FEDERALLY
FUNDED HEALTH PROGRAMS AND PRIVATE
HEALTH INSURANCE
Federally Funded Health Programs
The federal government currently funds a
number of health programs, including (1)
Medicare, which generally provides health
insurance coverage to elderly and disabled
enrollees, (2) Medicaid, which is a federal-
state cooperative program wherein states re-
ceive federal funds to generally provide
health benefits to low-income enrollees, (3)
the Children’s Health Insurance Program
(CHIP), which is a federal-state cooperative
program that provides health benefits to cer-
tain low-income children whose families
earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but
cannot afford private insurance; (4) the
FEHBP, which generally provides health in-
surance coverage to civilian federal employ-
ees, and (5) TRICARE, which provides civil-
ian health insurance coverage to dependents
of active military personnel and retirees of
the military (and their dependents). Fol-
lowing an initial phase-in period, the MFAA
would prohibit benefits from being made
available under Medicare, FEHBP, and
TRICARE while also prohibiting payments
to the states for CHIP. These payment prohi-
bitions would effectively terminate these
programs in their current form. This reading
is confirmed by § 701(b)(2) of the MFAA,
which redirects funding for these programs
to the national Program.
With respect to Medicaid, the MFAA would
significantly limit its scope. After the
MFAA’s effective date, Medicaid would only
continue to cover services that the new na-
tional Program would not otherwise cover.
Thus, Medicaid benefits for institutional
long-term care services (which are not
among the 13 categories of covered services
under the MFAA) and any other services fur-
nished by a state that the Program would
not cover, would continue to be administered
by the states. The bill would direct the Sec-
retary to coordinate with the relevant state
agencies to identify the services for which
Medicaid benefits would be preserved and to
ensure their continued availability under the
applicable state plans.
PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE
Currently, private health insurance in the
United States consists of (1) private sector
employer-sponsored group plans, which can
be self-insured (i.e., funded directly by the
employer) or fully insured (i.e., purchased
from insurers), and (2) group or individual
health plans sold directly by insurers to the
insured (both inside and outside of health in-
surance exchanges established under Section
1311 of the Affordable Care Act). The MFAA
would prohibit employers from providing,
and insurers from selling, any health plans
that would ‘‘duplicate[]the benefits provided
under [the MFAA].’’ Given that the benefits
offered under many existing private health
plans would likely overlap with—i.e., be the
same as—at least some of the benefits within
the Program’s 13 categories of covered bene-
fits, those existing health plans would likely
‘‘duplicate’’ the benefits provided under the
MFAA. Thus, this prohibition of duplicate
coverage would effectively eliminate those
existing private health plans. Employers and
insurers, however, would be allowed to offer
as benefits or for sale supplemental insur-
ance coverage for any additional benefits not
covered by the Program. As a result, employ-
ers and insurers could offer, for instance,
coverage for institutional long-term care
services, which are not among the 13 cat-
egories of covered services.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this
report details how the bills cut off
funding.
The CRS memo concludes: These pay-
ment prohibitions would effectively
terminate all of those programs I men-
tioned in their current form.
The Congressional Research Service
finds that Medicare for All actually
terminates Medicare in this country.
So Democrats want to turn Medicare,
currently for 60 million seniors, into
Medicare for None. It will become
Medicare for None, not Medicare for
All. Plus, 22 million people would lose
Medicare Advantage. I know many of
my patients who signed up for Medi-
care Advantage because there are ad-
vantages to doing it—coordinated care,
working on preventive medicine. There
are reasons for signing up for Medicare
Advantage. That would all be gone
under the one-size-fits-all approach
that the Democrats are proposing.
That is not all. This report says the
Sanders bill ends Federal employee
health insurance. There are more than
8 million Federal workers, families,
and retirees who rely on this Federal
Employee Health Benefits Program.
The Congressional Research Service
says that this bill, sponsored by over
100 Members who are Democrats in the
House of Representatives and spon-
sored by a number of Democrats in this
body, will abolish TRICARE, the insur-
ance for the military. More than 9 mil-
lion military members, their families,

and retirees rely on TRICARE for their
healthcare.
The report says the bill ends the
Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Nine million of our Nation’s children
rely on the CHIP program.
Interestingly, ObamaCare would end
as well, according to the CRS report.
After less than a decade, Democrats
want to repeal and replace their failed
ObamaCare healthcare law with a one-
size-fits-all system.
Again, the Congressional Research
Service says the bill bans private
health insurance. One hundred eighty
million people get their insurance
through work.
To sum up, hundreds of millions of
American citizens—American citi-
zens—stand to lose their insurance, and
I believe that is just the start of the
pain for American families. In the new
system, we would all be at the mercy of
Washington bureaucrats. That means
we would be paying more to wait
longer for worse care—pay more to
wait longer for worse care. The Demo-
crats’ massive plan is expected to cost
$32 trillion. That is trillion with a ‘‘t.’’
That is a 10-year pricetag.
Guess who is going to pay for that
mind-boggling bill—of course, every
American taxpayer. Senator SANDERS
admitted in the Democratic debate the
other night that his proposal would
raise taxes on middle-class families.
His proposal will raise taxes, he said,
on middle-class families.
In fact, even doubling our taxes
wouldn’t cover the huge cost of what
they are proposing. So Washington
Democrats are planning to drastically
cut payments to doctors, nurses, hos-
pitals, and to people who are providing
care. The bureaucrats would ration
care, restrict care—the care you get
that you need—and it would be re-
stricted in terms of treatment as well
as technology. People would lose the
freedom to choose the hospital or doc-
tor they want.
As a doctor, I am especially con-
cerned about the impact on patient
care. Patients could wait weeks, even
months, for urgently needed treat-
ment. Keep in mind care delayed is
often care denied. So the Democrats’
grand healthcare vision is to force you
to pay more to wait longer for worse
care.
As a Senator and a doctor, of course,
I want to improve your care, make it
less costly. You should get insurance
that is appropriate for you and afford-
able. You should be free to make your
own medical decisions. That is what it
is like in America.
No question, healthcare needs to be
more affordable, and Republicans are
working to lower costs without low-
ering standards. To me, that is the big
difference. Democrats are proposing
the reverse. Their plan would lower
your standard of care and raise your
costs. Democrats can keep cam-
paigning hard left on healthcare. That
is where they are headed.
Republicans are going to stay focused
on real reforms that promote more af-
fordable healthcare, cheaper prescrip-
tion drugs, protections for patients
with preexisting conditions, and, of
course, the end of surprise medical
bills. President Trump recently took
Executive action that increases price
transparency to lower the costs that
patients pay.
You just need to know the facts
about the Democrats’ one-size-fits-all
healthcare. Don’t let far-left Demo-
crats fool you. Radical Democrats want
to take away your current healthcare.
There would be no more Medicare or
private plans, just a one-size-fits-all
Washington plan.
Why pay more to wait longer for
worse care? Instead, let’s give patients
the care they need from a doctor they
choose at lower costs. That is our goal.
That is our objective, and that is what
we are going to accomplish.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, just a
few minutes ago, four young people
from the State of Illinois visited my of-
fice. They were a variety of different
ages, from 10 years of age to the age of
17. They all came because they had a
similar life experience, and they want-
ed to share it with me. Each one of
them had been diagnosed with type 1
diabetes.
Ten-year-old Owen from Deerfield
told a story—the cutest little kid;
great reader; read me a presentation
that he put together—and the young
women who were with him all talked
about how their lives changed when
they learned at the age of 7 or 8 that
they had type 1 diabetes. For each one
of them, from that point forward, insu-
lin became a lifeline. They had to have
access to insulin, and they had to have
it sometimes many times a day, in the
middle of the night. It reached a point
where, through technology, they had
continuous glucose monitoring devices
and pumps that were keeping them
alive, but every minute of every day
was a test to them as to whether they
were going to get sick and need help.
It was a great presentation by these
young people, whose lives were trans-
formed, and their parents, who were
hanging on every word as they told me
their life stories.
They brought up two points that I
want to share on the floor this after-
noon. The first is the importance of
medical research. As one young woman
said—she is about 17 now. She has lived
with this for 8 or 9 years. She said she
is a twin, and her brother told her
when she was diagnosed that he hated
the thought that, as an old woman, she
would still be worried about her insulin
every single day. She said: I told my
brother ‘‘We are going to find a cure
before I am an old woman.’’
Well, I certainly hope that young girl
is right, but she will be right only if we
do our part here on the floor of the
Senate and not just give speeches.
What we have to do is appropriate
money to the National Institutes of
Health. It is the premier medical re-
search agency in the world.
We have had good luck in the last 4
years. I want to salute two of my Re-
publican colleagues and one of my
Democratic colleagues for their special
efforts. For the last 4 years, Senator
ROY BLUNT, Republican of Missouri;
Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER, Repub-
lican of Tennessee; and Senator PATTY
MURRAY, Democrat of Washington,
have joined forces—I have been part of
that team too—to encourage an in-
crease in medical research funding
every single year, and we have done it.
The increase that Dr. Collins at NIH
asked for was 5 percent real growth a
year. That is 5 percent over inflation.
Do you know what we have done in 4
years? NIH has gone up from $30 billion
to $39 billion. Dramatic. A 30-percent
increase in NIH research funding.
We are going to have a tough time
with this coming budget, as we have in
the past, but I hope we really reach a
bottom line, as Democrats and Repub-
licans, that we are committed to 5 per-
cent real growth in medical research
every single year so that we can an-
swer these young people who come in
dealing with diabetes, those who are
suffering from cancer, heart disease,
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s—the list goes
on and on—that we are doing our part
here in the Senate; that despite all the
political battles and differences, there
are things that bring us together, and
that should be one.
The second point they raised—one of
the young girls there, Morgan of
Jerseyville, started telling me a story
about the cost of insulin. As she was
telling the story about the sacrifices
being made by her family to keep her
alive, she broke down and cried. What
she was telling me—her personal expe-
rience, her family experience—was
something that every family with dia-
betes knows: The cost of insulin—
charged by the pharmaceutical compa-
nies—has gone up dramatically, with-
out justification, over the last 20 years.
In 1999, one of the major insulin
drugs—called Humalog, made by Eli
Lilly—was selling for $21 a vial. That
was 20 years ago. In 1999, it was $21 a
vial. The price today is $329 a vial.
What has caused this dramatic in-
crease? There is nothing that has hap-
pened with this drug. It is the same
drug. And, I might add, Eli Lilly of In-
dianapolis, IN, is selling the same insu-
lin product—Humalog—in Canada for
$39. So it costs $329 in the United
States and $39 in Canada.
These families told me they were
lucky to have health insurance that
covered prescription drugs. That
sounds good, except they each had
large copays—$8,000 a year. And what it
meant was that for this young girl, this
beautiful little girl who was in my of-
fice and who has juvenile diabetes,

S4752 July 10, 2019
they would spend $8,000 a year at the
beginning of the year for 3 months of
insulin before the health insurance
kicked in and started paying for it. Of
course, there are families who aren’t so
lucky—they don’t have health insur-
ance to pay for their drugs.
So what are we going to do about it?
It happens to be something the Senate
is supposed to take up. We are supposed
to debate these things and decide the
policy for this country. We will see.
Very soon, we will have a chance. A
bill is coming out of the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee, and we will have a chance to
amend it on the floor and to deal with
the cost of prescription drugs. I will
have an amendment ready if my col-
leagues want to join me—I hope they
will—on the cost of insulin, and we will
have a chance if Senator MCCONNELL,
the Republican leader, will allow us—it
is his decision. We will have a chance
to decide whether these kids and their
families are going to get ripped off by
these pharmaceutical companies for
years to come.
It isn’t just insulin; it is so many
other products. It is time for us to
stand up for these families and their
kids, to put money into medical re-
search, and to tell pharma once and for
all: Enough is enough. Insulin was dis-
covered almost 100 years ago. What you
are doing in terms of increasing the
cost of it for these families is unac-
ceptable and unconscionable.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. President, in the last 21⁄2 years of
this administration, we have seen an
incredible situation when it comes to
immigration and our border. We have
seen, unfortunately, some of the sad-
dest and most heartbreaking scenes in-
volving children at the border between
the United States and Mexico.
The pattern started with the Presi-
dent’s announcement shortly after he
was sworn in that he was imposing a
travel ban on Muslim countries. That
created chaos at our airports and con-
tinues to separate thousands of Amer-
ican families.
Then the President stepped up and
repealed DACA, the Executive order
program created by President Obama
that allowed more than 800,000 young
immigrants to stay in this country
without fear of deportation and to
make a life in the only country many
of them had ever known.
Then the President announced the
termination of the Temporary Pro-
tected Status Program, a program we
offer—and have throughout our modern
history—for those who are facing op-
pression or natural disaster in their
countries. President Trump announced
that he was going to terminate it for
several countries, affecting the lives of
300,000 immigrants.
Then came the disastrous separation
of thousands of families at the border—
2,880 infants, toddlers, and children
separated from their parents by the
Government of the United States. This
zero-tolerance policy finally was re-
versed by President Trump after the
public outcry against it.
Then what followed was the longest
government shutdown in history over
the President’s demand that he was
going to build a border wall, even at
the cost of shutting down the Govern-
ment of the United States for 5 weeks.
We’ve also seen the tragic deaths of 6
children apprehended at the border and
24 people in detention facilities in the
United States.
The President then announced that
he was going to block all assistance to
the Northern Triangle countries—El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras,
the source of most of the immigrants
who come to our border—and that he
would shut down the avenues for legal
migration, driving even more refugees
to our border.
Now, on President Trump’s watch, we
have an unprecedented humanitarian
crisis. We have seen that crisis exem-
plified by the horrifying image of Oscar
Alberto Martinez Ramirez and his 23-
month-old daughter, Valeria, who fled
El Salvador and drowned as they tried
to cross the Rio Grande 2 weeks ago.
We have seen this crisis play out in
the overcrowded and inhumane condi-
tions at detention centers at the bor-
der.
In April, I visited El Paso, TX. What
I saw in the Border Patrol’s over-
crowded facilities was heartbreaking.
In May, I led 24 Senators in calling
for the International Committee of the
Red Cross and the inspector general of
the Department of Homeland Security
to investigate our Border Patrol facili-
ties. I never dreamed that I would be
asking the International Red Cross to
investigate detention facilities in the
United States. They do that, but usu-
ally you are asking them to look into
some Third World country where inhu-
mane conditions are being alleged.
After being in El Paso, after seeing
what is going at our border, I joined
with 23 other Senators in asking the
International Red Cross to investigate
the U.S. detention facilities.
Later that same month, the inspec-
tor general of the Department of
Homeland Security released a report
detailing the inhumane and dangerous
overcrowding of migrants at the El
Paso port of entry. The Inspector Gen-
eral’s Office found that overcrowding is
‘‘an immediate risk to the health and
safety’’ of detainees and DHS employ-
ees.
One week ago, the Inspector Gen-
eral’s Office issued another scathing re-
port, this time about multiple Border
Patrol facilities in the Rio Grande Val-
ley. The Inspector General’s Office
asked the Department of Homeland Se-
curity to take immediate steps to al-
leviate the dangerous overcrowding
and prolonged detention. They stated:
‘‘We are concerned that overcrowding
and prolonged detention represent an
immediate risk to the health and safe-
ty of DHS agents and officers, and to
those detained.’’
Congress recently passed legislation 2
weeks ago that included $793 million in
funding to alleviate overcrowding at
these CBP facilities and other funding
to provide food, supplies, and medical
care to migrants. The bill also includes
critical funding for the Office of Ref-
ugee Resettlement to care for migrant
children.
We must now make sure that this
money is spent effectively by the
Trump administration. We gave them
over $400 million in February, and they
came back to us within 90 days and
said: We are out of money. I would like
to know how they are spending this
money, and I want to make sure it is
being spent where it is needed.
There is a gaping leadership vacuum
at the Trump administration’s Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. Think of
this: In 21⁄2 years, there have already
been four different people serving as
head of that Department. Every posi-
tion at the Department of Homeland
Security with responsibility for immi-
gration or border security is now being
held by a temporary appointee, and the
White House refuses to even submit
nominations to fill these positions.
Two weeks ago, I met with Mark
Morgan, one of those temporary ap-
pointees. In May, President Trump
named him Acting Director of U.S. Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement.
Mr. Morgan was asked at that time to
carry out the mass arrests and mass
deportations of millions of immigrants
the President had threatened by his in-
famous tweets.
Shortly before I met with Mr. Mor-
gan to ask him about the mass arrests
and mass deportations, there was a
change. They took him out of that po-
sition and named him Acting Director
of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
He went from internal enforcement to
border enforcement. Now he is in
charge of solving the humanitarian cri-
sis that President Trump has created
at our border.
The Trump administration can shuf-
fle the deck chairs on this Titanic, but
we must acknowledge the obvious:
President Trump’s immigration and
border security policies have failed.
Tough talk isn’t enough. We need to do
better.
This morning, I met with Dr. Goza,
the president of the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics. She came to give me
a report about her visit to several bor-
der facilities that has been well docu-
mented and reported in the press. She
said that it was hard for her, as a doc-
tor for children, to see these things and
realize they were happening in the
United States.
Yes, children are being held in caged
facilities with wire fences and watch-
towers around them, some of them
very young children. As a pediatrician,
she told me those things have an im-
pact on a child—on how that child
looks at the world and how that child
looks at himself.
She said that she took a lot of notes
as she went through these facilities,
but it wasn’t until she got on the air-
plane on the way home that she read

through them. She said: Then I started
crying. I am supposed to be a profes-
sional who can take this, but I couldn’t
imagine what we were doing to these
children at the border. There just
aren’t enough medical professionals
there—not nearly enough.
The United States is better than
that. We can do better than that. We
can have a secure border and respect
our international obligations to pro-
vide a safe haven to those who are flee-
ing persecution, as we have done on a
bipartisan basis—Democrats and Re-
publicans—for decades.
I stand ready, and I believe my party
stands ready, to work with Republicans
on smart, effective, and humane solu-
tions to the crisis at our border. I sug-
gest that the following be included:
Crack down on traffickers who are
exploiting immigrants. That is unac-
ceptable.
Provide assistance to stabilize the
Northern Triangle countries. That is
long overdue.
Provide in-country processing and
third-country resettlement so that mi-
grants can seek safe haven under our
laws without making the dangerous
and expensive trek to our border.
Eliminate the immigration court
backlog so that asylum claims can be
processed more quickly.
We have authorized more than 100
immigration court judges, and this ad-
ministration can’t find people to fill
them. They want more judges. They
have authority to hire 100 more, and
they have been unable to do it.
We need to ensure that children and
families are treated humanely when
they are in the custody of the U.S.
Government.
Eventually, the history of this period
will be written, and there will be ac-
countability, not just for the officials
in government but for all of us—those
of us in the Senate and the House and
those in journalism and other places.
We are going to have to answer for the
way these people have been treated.
Whether or not they qualify for legal
status in the United States, I hope we
can hold our heads up high and say
that, at least from this point forward,
we are going to show them that we are
humane and caring people. No matter
where they come from, no matter how
poor they may be, we will take care
that children are treated in a merciful
way and a compassionate way; that the
adults are given appropriate opportuni-
ties to exercise whatever rights they
have under the laws of our country;
and that at the end of the day we can
hold our heads high because we have
done this in a fashion consistent with
the values of the United States of
America.
We haven’t seen it yet. It is time for
the President to acknowledge that get-
tough, bizarre tweets just aren’t
enough. We have to have a policy that
makes sense to bring stability to our
border.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I recently
received a letter from a gentleman liv-
ing in Cedar Falls, IA, who suffers from
Parkinson’s disease. As I speak, he is
going without his $1,450-per-month
LYRICA prescription in order to keep a
roof over his head. That is right, folks.
He must choose between making a
mortgage payment and getting his pre-
scription.
Here is another story a woman from
Davenport, IA, shared with me. Last
October, she was able to get a 3-month
supply of blood pressure medication for
$17, but when she went to the phar-
macy for her refill in late December,
she was told the price had nearly tri-
pled to $55. She wrote to me and said:
Thinking this was a mistake, I refused the
refill and checked online about the change in
price and found I couldn’t get it cheaper any-
where else. So I went back in ten days and
thought I would just have to pay the new
cost [which was $55]. In that time . . . the
prescription had gone up to $130!
Whether I am talking to folks back
home in my townhalls and other events
on my 99 County Tour or in meetings
right here in Washington, DC, the cost
of prescription drugs is the No. 1 issue
I hear about from Iowans. Every day, I
hear stories just like these about the
outrageous costs associated with their
prescription medications.
For too long, hard-working Iowans
have borne the brunt of skyrocketing
prescription drug prices. Stories like
the man from Cedar Falls and the
woman from Davenport have become
the norm. We have to change that, and
that is exactly what we are doing here
in the Senate.
We have been hard at work in ad-
vancing bills to drive down drug prices,
increase competition, and close costly
loopholes that are being exploited by
those bad actors. I am proud to lead on
three such bills that were recently ap-
proved in committee.
First, I have teamed up with Senator
COTTON on a bill that aims to eliminate
an egregious loophole in the patenting
process. This loophole allows drug com-
panies to take advantage of the well-
intentioned concept of sovereign im-
munity for Native American Tribes in
order to dismiss patent challenges and
unfairly stifle competition.
Our legislation would put an end to
this manipulative practice and actu-
ally provide Iowans with access to
cheaper options for their prescription
drugs. That is not all we are doing in
the Senate to make more low-cost ge-
neric drugs available to folks in Iowa.
We have also been working across the
aisle on a bipartisan bill that would
put a powerful check on drug compa-
nies seeking to keep generics off the
market.
The bill would empower the makers
of generic drugs to file lawsuits against
brand-name manufacturers if they fail
to provide required resources, such as
drug samples, needed for generics to
clear the regulatory process. In turn,
we would see cheaper alternatives
available for my folks in Iowa.
I am also working with my fellow
Iowan, Senator GRASSLEY, on a bill
that focuses on the middlemen behind
some of the prescription drug price
hikes we have seen recently. The bill
would direct the Federal Trade Com-
mission to examine anti-competitive
behavior in the prescription drug mar-
ket. As mergers push drug prices high-
er and higher, this bill will be instru-
mental in helping Congress develop
policies to increase competition and
lower those costs for both patients and
our taxpayers.
Make no mistake. The rising cost of
prescription drugs is an issue that sig-
nificantly impacts hard-working
Iowans. We in Congress have a respon-
sibility to take action, to give folks a
voice, and to make sure no family is
ever forced to choose between making
a mortgage payment and purchasing
their medications.
That is what we are doing. We have
some great bills in the Senate—bills
from both Republicans and Demo-
crats—that can help lower those drug
prices, increase competition, and close
loopholes. Let’s build on this effort and
continue working together in a bipar-
tisan way to get these bills and others
across the finish line and signed into
law. Iowans are counting on us.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PERDUE). The Senator from Florida.
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
as is now obvious to everyone,
ObamaCare made healthcare even more
expensive. Premiums are up. Copays
are up. Deductibles are way up.
ObamaCare has been a disaster, and
even the Democrats are admitting it.
Let’s all remember, ObamaCare was
sold and based on a bunch of lies. You
didn’t get to keep your doctor, your
health plan, and your premiums didn’t
go down.
The Democrats want Medicare for
All, which will absolutely ruin the
Medicare system and throw 150 million
people off of the employer-sponsored
health insurance they like. That would
be a disaster. There is something we
can do and must do right now to help
American families: We must lower pre-
scription drug costs.
This is very personal to me. I grew up
in a family without healthcare. My
mom struggled to find care for my
brother who had a serious disease.
Eventually she found a charity hos-
pital 4 hours away for his treatment. I
remember asking my mom how much
lower drug costs would have to be for
her to consider changing pharmacies.
Without missing a beat, she said: a dol-
lar.
This story is not uncommon. All over
my State I hear the same thing: Drug
prices are rising, and we are having
trouble affording the lifesaving medi-
cation we need.
I recently met Sabine Rivera, a 12-
year-old from Naples, FL, who was di-
agnosed with type 1 diabetes more than
2 years ago. She is 12 years old, and she
is already worried about how she will

afford the rising cost of insulin—some-
thing no 12-year-old should ever have
to stress about.
Patients want to shop for better cov-
erage and lower costs, but too often
they can’t or don’t know how. At the
same time, pharmaceutical companies
are charging low prices for prescription
drugs in Canada, Europe, and Japan
but charging American consumers sig-
nificantly more. Why? Because for too
long politicians have done nothing.
American consumers are subsidizing
the cost of prescription drugs in Eu-
rope and Canada and all over the world.
Why should we be doing that? That cer-
tainly is not putting America first, and
that is not putting American families
first. That is why I am working with
President Trump and Republicans and
Democrats in Congress to fix this prob-
lem.
I recently introduced the America
First Drug Pricing Plan with Senator
JOSH HAWLEY to take real steps to
lower costs for patients and put the
consumers back in charge of their
healthcare decisions. Part one of my
bill focuses on transparency.
First, pharmacies must inform pa-
tients what it will cost to purchase
drugs out of pocket instead of using
their insurance and copays. If patients
choose to pay out of pocket, which is
sometimes cheaper, the total cost
would be applied to their deductible.
Second, insurance companies should,
and must, inform patients of the total
cost of their prescription drugs 60 days
prior to open enrollment. This allows
patients to be consumers and shop
around for the best deal.
Finally, my bill would simply require
that drug companies cannot charge
American consumers more for prescrip-
tion drugs than the lowest price they
charge consumers in other industri-
alized nations.
I have found that provision to be con-
troversial in Washington. Do you know
where it is not controversial? Every-
where else. In Tampa and Orlando,
Miami and Panama City, all over Flor-
ida, this just makes sense. I don’t
spend a lot of time outside of Florida,
but I would wager and say that across
the country my bill would make a lot
of sense too.
Why would we as American con-
sumers, who make up 40 percent of the
market for prescription drugs, pay two
to six times more for drugs than con-
sumers in Europe or Canada or Japan?
That needs to change. My bill takes
real steps to change this, and I believe
it should have bipartisan support.
I also led seven of my colleagues in a
letter to pharmaceutical companies
asking them to work with us on solu-
tions to lower the cost of prescription
drugs. We are still waiting to hear
back.
American consumers are facing a cri-
sis of rising drug costs, and we can’t
wait any longer. I will not and cannot
accept the status quo of rising drug
costs. We need to get something done
this year, and I am fighting every day
to make sure we do.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I am
pleased to join my colleague on the
Senate floor to talk about an ex-
tremely important topic—that is, low-
ering the cost of prescription drugs in
this country. Just a few weeks ago, on
June 20, West Virginia celebrated our
156th birthday. There is plenty to cele-
brate about West Virginia, from its
breathtaking beauty and wonderful
families to our kind and hospitable
West Virginia spirit.
Unfortunately, West Virginia has its
challenges, too, including health chal-
lenges. We have some of the highest
rates in the Nation for heart disease,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, can-
cer, and arthritis. While there are
many nonpharmaceutical steps people
are taking to prevent and control dis-
eases, for many, their prescription
medicine is the difference between
wellness and illness or even between
life and death.
That is why it is so important that
West Virginians are able to secure
their medications and that we as a
Congress make sure they are not pay-
ing too much for those medications. Of
all the issues that my constituents
come to me with—whether it is a phone
call, a letter, or casually running into
them at the grocery store—this is the
issue I hear most about because it is
something that affects so many West
Virginians’ way of life, and it is some-
thing that affects them every day. If it
doesn’t affect them, it affects some-
body in their family.
The same can be said for Americans
across this country, and that is why it
has become one of our Nation’s top pri-
orities, one that is shared by Repub-
licans and Democrats and one that is a
significant bipartisan focus of this ad-
ministration and this Congress. It is a
far-reaching problem with many dif-
ferent factors contributing to it, and
that is why we have to address it on
many different fronts.
The chairman of the HELP Com-
mittee is here today. He has worked
through his committee diligently, and
I applaud him for his efforts and look
forward to joining him on the floor in
support of those efforts.
As we all know, the path a medica-
tion takes from the manufacturer to
the patient is very complex, with many
factors impacting the price a consumer
pays. While making changes to this
pathway is very important, my con-
stituents really don’t care about the
pathway. They are more concerned
with the total on their bill that their
pharmacist is ringing up. That is why I
have focused a lot of my personal ef-
forts on the important role that our
pharmacists play in lowering drug
costs.
In many small towns and rural com-
munities—which is my entire State—
pharmacists are the healthcare pro-
viders people go to quite regularly, and
they are often some of the most trust-
ed, friendly, and welcoming. It is essen-
tial that patients, especially seniors,
are able to access the local pharmacy.
West Virginians and Americans
across the country should be able to
trust that their pharmacist is not
being restricted about telling them
how to get the best prescription drug
prices. They need to know they aren’t
facing higher cost sharing for drugs
and being accelerated into the cov-
erage gap or the doughnut hole phase
of Medicare Part D due to an overly
complicated system of fees and price
concessions that nobody really under-
stands—certainly not at the phar-
macist’s desk.
In order to ensure that seniors have
access to a pharmacy of their choice,
Senator BROWN and I introduced the
Ensuring Seniors Access to Local Phar-
macies Act last Congress. We will be
reintroducing this bill, which requires
that community pharmacists in medi-
cally underserved areas be allowed to
participate in the Medicare Part D pre-
ferred pharmacy networks.
Why is this important? If a local
pharmacy is not included in a preferred
network, a senior must either switch
to a preferred network pharmacy,
which could be a lot farther away or
less convenient, or pay higher copay-
ments and coinsurance to access their
local pharmacy. In some cities and
towns, you can find a pharmacy on
nearly every corner. In rural areas,
that is just not the case, and accessing
a preferred pharmacy could require sig-
nificant time and difficult travel.
Additionally, many seniors rely on
their local pharmacies not only to ac-
cess prescription drugs but also to re-
ceive those needed services like preven-
tive screenings and medication therapy
management.
As important as access to a local
pharmacy is, it is also essential that
patients can trust their pharmacists to
let them know which payment method
provides the most savings when pur-
chasing their prescription drugs.
I was proud to join Senator COLLINS
last year as a cosponsor of the Patient
Right to Know Drug Prices Act. This
commonsense bill, which the President
signed into law in October, bans the
use of the pharmacy gag clause. It was
hard to believe this still existed. These
clauses were put into place by insurers
and pharmacy benefit managers, and
they prevented our pharmacists from
proactively telling consumers that
their prescriptions could cost less—
less—if they paid out of pocket rather
than relying on their insurance plan.
I am also currently working with
Senators TESTER, CASSIDY, and BROWN
on legislation that would help improve
transparency and accuracy in Medicare
Part D drug spending. Our bill would
reform the application process of phar-
macy price concessions, also known as
direct and indirect remuneration, or
DIR fees, in the Medicare Part D Pro-
gram. It sounds complicated, but it is
driving up the cost of our pharma-
ceuticals.

This will ensure that our seniors are
not facing higher cost sharing for their
drugs or, again, being accelerated into
the coverage gap. It will also help en-
sure that local pharmacies are able to
stay open. This is critical. We have to
keep our local pharmacies open for a
vast majority of rural America and
have them continue to stay open and
continue to serve Medicare bene-
ficiaries and other communities that
rely on them. It would provide needed
financial certainty for these phar-
macies, which are often small busi-
nesses.
My colleagues and I hope to see this
legislation included in the soon-to-be-
released Senate finance package. These
are just a few examples of how we are
working to lower prescription drug
costs.
I have been listening to my col-
leagues and have heard a lot of other
ideas. They are small but much needed
steps that can be, and already are,
making a real difference in our con-
stituents’ lives, but our work is far
from over. We have to continue looking
at both commonsense and complex so-
lutions to the problem. This is a com-
plex problem. While as a Congress and
a country we may not agree on the best
way to do that, we do all agree that it
is a problem that needs to be solved.
I look forward to continuing to work
with Senator ALEXANDER and Senator
LANKFORD, who are on the floor here
today, and my other colleagues and the
administration to find that pathway
forward to lowering the cost of pre-
scription drugs.
I yield back.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
thank the Senator from West Virginia
for working to reduce the cost of pre-
scription drugs. That is the question I
hear most often in Tennessee: How can
I reduce what I pay for out of my own
pocket for healthcare costs? The most
obvious way to reduce what you pay
out of your own pocket for healthcare
costs is to reduce the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs.
Shirley, from Franklin, TN, is one of
those Americans who asked me that
question. This is what she said:
As a 71 year old senior with arthritis, I rely
on Enbrel to keep my symptoms in check.
My copay has just been increased from $95.00
to $170.00 every ninety days. At this rate I
will have to begin limiting my usage in order
to balance the monthly budget.
There has never been a more exciting
time in biomedical research, but that
progress is meaningless if patients
can’t afford these new lifesaving drugs.
Last month, as Senator CAPITO men-
tioned, our Senate Health Committee
passed legislation by a vote of 20 to 3
that included 14 bipartisan provisions
to increase prescription drug competi-
tion as a way of lowering generic drug
costs and biosimilar drugs that reach
patients.
Here is what that includes: The CRE-
ATES Act—the Senator from Iowa, Mr.
GRASSLEY, is on the floor. He, Senator
LEAHY, and many others have proposed
the CREATES Act, which will help
bring more lower cost generic drugs to
patients by eliminating anticompeti-
tive practices by brand drugmakers.
That is in the bill we approved. It also
includes helping biosimilar companies
speed drug development through a
transparent, modernized, and search-
able patent database. That was pro-
posed by Senators COLLINS, KAINE,
BRAUN, HAWLEY, MURKOWSKI, PAUL,
PORTMAN, SHAHEEN, and STABENOW.
This legislation we have was approved
20 to 3. There are 55 different proposals
by 65 different U.S. Senators—about
the same number of Republicans and
Democrats—all to reduce healthcare
costs.
Here are some other examples. The
bill improves the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration’s drug patent database by
keeping it more up to date to help ge-
neric drug companies speed product de-
velopment, a proposal offered by Sen-
ator CASSIDY and Senator DURBIN.
Another provision is it prevents the
abuse of citizens’ petitions. These are
used to unnecessarily delay drug ap-
provals. This was proposed by Senators
GARDNER, SHAHEEN, CASSIDY, BENNET,
CRAMER, and BRAUN. President Trump
included that in his 2020 budget.
Another provision is it clarifies that
the makers of brand biological prod-
ucts, such as insulin, are not gaming
the system to delay new, lower cost
biosimilars. That came from Senators
SMITH, CASSIDY, and CRAMER.
Another provision is it eliminates ex-
clusivity loopholes. These allow drug
companies to get exclusivity and delay
patient access to less costly generic
drugs by just making small tweaks to
an old drug. That came from Senators
ROBERTS, CASSIDY, and SMITH, which
President Trump also proposed in his
budget.
Another provision prevents the
blocking of generic drugs. This is done
by eliminating a loophole that allows a
first generic to submit an application
to FDA and block other generics from
the market. Again, the President in-
cluded this in his budget.
Another provision in our bill pre-
vents delays of biosimilar drugs by ex-
cluding biological products from com-
pliance with U.S. Pharmacopeia stand-
ards. That sounds pretty complicated,
but what it means is that it could
delay patient access and lower the cost
of drugs. Again, that is another pro-
posal by President Trump.
Another provision is it increases
transparency on price and quality in-
formation by banning the kind of gag
clauses Senator CAPITO talked about.
These are gag clauses in contracts be-
tween providers and health plans that
prevent patients, plan sponsors, or re-
ferring physicians from seeing price
and quality information.
Another provision bans pharmacy
benefit managers from charging more
for a drug than it paid for the same
drug.
Instead of remaining stuck in a per-
petual partisan argument over
ObamaCare and health insurance—and
I can guarantee you that is going to
continue to go on for a while—we have
Senators on that side of the aisle and
Senators on this side of the aisle work-
ing together to lower the cost of what
Americans pay for healthcare out of
their own pockets.
Since January, Senator MURRAY and
I have been working in parallel with
Senator GRASSLEY and Senator WYDEN
of the Finance Committee. They are
continuing to work on their own bipar-
tisan bill. Last month, the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee also voted to lower
the cost of prescription drugs. In the
House, the Energy and Commerce,
Ways and Means, and Judiciary Com-
mittees have all reported out bipar-
tisan bills on the cost of prescription
drugs.
As I have mentioned, President
Trump and Secretary Azar have been
focused on this. Last year, the adminis-
tration released a blueprint on steps
the President would take to lower pre-
scription drugs. Last year, the Food
and Drug Administration set a new
record for generic drug approvals. Ge-
neric drugs can be up to 85 percent less
expensive than brand drugs.
So I believe the cost of prescription
drugs is an area where Democrats and
Republicans in Congress and the ad-
ministration can find common ground
to help Americans reduce the cost of
healthcare that they pay for out of
their own pockets.
I am very hopeful that our bill, with
55 proposals from 65 Senators, which
has been reported to the Senate floor,
will be placed by the majority and mi-
nority leaders on the Senate floor be-
fore the end of the month. We can pass
it, the House will do their job, and we
can send it to the President to lower
prescription drug costs.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I rise
to talk to this body again about
healthcare and the cost of healthcare.
This has been an issue and an ongoing
dialogue for a long time around the
Senate and around Congress.
It is an issue that was supposedly set-
tled when the Affordable Care Act was
passed, but, ironically enough, my
Democratic colleagues have now joined
Republicans in saying they want to re-
peal and replace the Affordable Care
Act. They are not using the term ‘‘re-
peal and replace’’; they are just saying
they want to do Medicare for All. Built
into that is completely taking out the
Affordable Care Act and replacing it
with something different.
So, ironically, in some ways, we are
in the same spot. We have both come to
the same realization that the Afford-
able Care Act didn’t pass—it actually
did pass, but it is not working. So now
the challenge is what to do with
healthcare.

pieces what we can actually do to-
gether to get this done, beginning with
the cost of prescription drugs.
I continue to hear from Oklahomans
all over the State about how hard it is
to deal with the cost of prescription
drugs, how rapidly the costs are in-
creasing, and how sporadic the cost
changes really are. They will have a
drug that costs a small amount one
month and come back a month later
and find a dramatic increase for the
exact same drug. They can go phar-
macy to pharmacy and find a different
price for the exact same drug or find
that the pharmacy closest to them
doesn’t offer that drug, and a different
pharmacy is the only one that is al-
lowed to have that drug. The com-
plexity is driving them crazy and right-
fully so.
As we peel back the layers on phar-
macy issues, we are finding that the
complexity is that cost overruns being
built in are too high.
For the past few months, we have
looked at every step in the drug proc-
ess, from the approval to research and
development, to try to figure out how
the cost is actually getting to the con-
sumer.
Along the way, several things have
occurred. The administration has ag-
gressively been approving generics. In
fact, the administration has approved a
record number of generics. Those ge-
neric pharmaceuticals are much less
expensive than the branded pharma-
ceuticals. Many of those have been
waiting a very long time at the Food
and Drug Administration to actually
be approved. The Food and Drug Ad-
ministration is rapidly getting those
out the door, and that helps consumers.
Something else we have done in Con-
gress is to try to address something
called the gag clause. The gag clause is
one of those things that was behind the
scenes that no one knew about except
for the pharmacists because, if you
came in with your insurance card to
pick up your prescription, the phar-
macist knew the actual cost you would
pay if you paid in cash. Often, you
could get that same prescription for
less by paying in cash than you could if
you were to pay with your insurance
card, but the pharmacist was prohib-
ited from actually telling you that. We
have addressed that in Congress, in a
bipartisan way, to release that gag
clause and allow pharmacists to actu-
ally tell people their options on pric-
ing.
You might say: That is an absolutely
crazy thing. Who put that gag rule in?
Well, the system, and the structure
behind the scenes that negotiates all of
it, said: If you want to be a pharmacy
that sells these drugs, you have to sub-
mit to these rules. As we found, the
culprit behind many of these issues is a
group called pharmacy benefit man-
agers. You will hear it referred to as
just the PBMs.
Those pharmacy benefit managers
are supposed to negotiate between the
manufacturers and the insurance plans
to lower the prices. In many areas,
they have lowered prices, but they
have also given preferred formulary
placement to some of their preferred
pharmacies so some pharmacies get
that drug and other pharmacies that
are competing with them don’t get ac-
cess to that drug. Often, it is the drug
that is the highest margin drug only
their pharmacies will get and other
pharmacies will not.
It has become an anti-competitive
piece in the background, when it was
supposed to be something that was a
highly competitive piece to actually
help the consumer.
Unfortunately, PBMs have created
one of the most elaborate, complex,
and opaque system of pricing, which
has a tremendous amount of market
distortion and at times has limited pa-
tients’ access to those drugs. Often-
times, it is a system they have been
able to take advantage of and have cre-
ated financial incentives to help their
bottom line in the process rather than
actually help the consumer.
Many consumers have heard about
rebates, but they wonder who is getting
a rebate. They go to their pharmacy to
pay for their drugs, and they are not
getting the rebate. There is a rebate
going somewhere, just not to them.
Here is the challenge. We are trying
to peel back with greater transparency
what is happening in the pharmacy
benefit manager world and figure out
how a small group—it is actually three
companies that have 90 percent of the
market nationwide, how that middle-
man in the process actually handles
pricing and negotiation.
If you talk to any pharmacist any-
where in the country—and certainly
across my great State—who is an inde-
pendent pharmacist, they will all ex-
press their frustration with pharmacy
benefit managers and their access to
some drugs and not others and the stip-
ulations they deliberately put there to
hurt them and help others.
I have joined my colleague Senator
CANTWELL in trying to shine some light
on the operations of PBMs within the
drug chains. Consumers deserve greater
transparency. That will help us under-
stand the actual cost of drugs and how
those costs are actually getting to con-
sumers or not to consumers in the
process. The PBMs need greater exam-
ination, and we are finally taking that
up to walk through the process.
On the Finance Committee, we are
dealing with several issues. Led by
Senator GRASSLEY, we are walking
through Part B of Medicare, Part D of
Medicare, and trying to examine what
can be done to help the actual con-
sumer. Our goals are how do we actu-
ally increase the options in drugs that
are out there, how do we stop the cost
increases, and how do we decrease out-
of-pocket costs for pharmaceuticals.
In Part B—these are drugs that are
often intravenous, but they are done in
a hospital setting or in an inpatient
setting. As we are working through
that process, we are trying to find the
perverse incentives that are built in be-
cause, right now, physicians are actu-
ally paid a percentage of the medicine
they prescribe in Part B. That means if
there are three medications that are
out there, if a doctor prescribes the
highest cost medication, they get a
much higher reimbursement. It is not a
flat amount. Now, all three may be in-
travenous, but whichever is the most
expensive actually helps the doctor the
most. I am not challenging doctors and
saying they are always prescribing the
branded drugs and the most expensive
in the process—that is between the
doctor and the patient to determine—
but there is no doubt a perverse incen-
tive is built into this; that if they pre-
scribe a more expensive drug, the doc-
tor and his office actually benefit from
it. We need to fix that.
In Part D, there are reforms that can
actually slow the growth in cost in-
creases and allow people to have great-
er access to drugs. We are not inter-
ested in some kind of formula where we
are actually going to decrease the pa-
tients’ options of what drugs they can
actually get in their formulary. That is
a great thing about being an American;
that we don’t have limited formularies.
It is very open in the process so Ameri-
cans can try different pharmaceuticals
to see which one works best for them.
That is not chosen by government; it is
chosen by them and their doctors. The
Part D definitely needs a redesign of
the benefit structure because right now
things like the doughnut hole drive up
costs for consumers. We are exploring a
way to limit the out-of-pocket costs for
beneficiaries so there is a lifetime cap
sitting out there. There is an oppor-
tunity to know that if I end up with
cancer or some other rare disease, I am
not going to have these out-of-control
costs on the pharmaceutical side and
know there is not a doughnut hole
waiting for me, where when I get a cou-
ple thousand dollars in, I am suddenly
going to have a very expensive time. So
I can afford my insurance in January,
February, and March, but from April to
August, I can’t afford prescriptions
anymore. We can’t have that. We have
to address those issues because that
dramatically affects the out-of-pocket
costs.
There are lots of other options we are
looking at while working through this
process, like the rebates, as I men-
tioned before, actually getting to the
consumer, not to the companies behind
the scenes, and dealing with how to
take greater advantage of biosimilar
drugs—very similar to the generic
drugs but just in a different category
and at a reduced cost—to allow them
to have opportunities to get to those
drugs faster. We have to deal with
some of the patent issues to make sure
drug manufacturers can’t hold on to
their patents abnormally long so the
generics can’t actually get out to peo-
ple or bundle them together to restrict
their patents.
We have to end this practice of sur-
prise medical bills. Some folks have no

idea what that is, and other folks know
all too well. They look at their insur-
ance. They go to a hospital that is in
network, and their doctor is in net-
work. So they go to a hospital that is
in network, and they go to a doctor
who is in network, but they get a giant
bill from an out-of-network anesthe-
siologist, or the lab is out of network
and the hospital is in network, and
they get a giant bill from the lab. We
are working to end the practice of hav-
ing labs that are out of network or cer-
tain specialists a doctor has sent them
to—the patient assumes they are in
network, but then they find out that
certain individuals who have taken
care of them are out of network.
We are also dealing with the issue of
air ambulance surprise bills, which has
been a great challenge for those folks
in rural America who are having to be
transferred long distances to get to a
hospital and then are getting an enor-
mous bill for an out-of-network air am-
bulance as a surprise billing. There are
ways we can address this to deal with
the out-of-pocket costs.
We are focused on areas where we can
find agreement and things we can do to
work through this process.
There is much to be done in the area
of prescription drugs and in the area of
in network, out of network, and sur-
prise medical bills. We should be able
to find common ground, and I am
grateful I am part of this dialogue to
help try to find ways we can come to-
gether, get this resolved, and get a bet-
ter situation for American consumers
and patients in the days ahead.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
want to update my colleagues and the
American people about efforts to re-
duce the cost of prescription medicine.
Last week, our country and the
American people celebrated Independ-
ence Day, marking 243 years of self-
government. As elected representa-
tives, it is our job to make the govern-
ment work for the people, not the
other way around.
For more than two centuries, our
system of free enterprise has unleashed
American innovation, investment, and
ingenuity. Robust competition incu-
bates advances in science and medi-
cine. It leads to lifesaving cures and
promising treatments for cancer, Alz-
heimer’s, diabetes, and other debili-
tating diseases.
However, prescription medicine too
often smacks consumers with sticker
shock at the pharmacy counter. The
soaring prices leave taxpayers with a
big tab—particularly under the Medi-
care and Medicaid Programs—and they
weigh heavily on the minds of moms
and dads all across the country.
Last week, I held meetings with my
constituents in 12 counties across Iowa.
The cost of prescription drugs comes
up at nearly every single Q-and-A
county meeting that I hold. Iowans
want to know why prices keep climbing
higher and higher. They want to know
why the price of insulin keeps going up
and up and up—nearly 100 years after
the lifesaving discovery was made.
They want to know what can be done
to make prescription drugs more af-
fordable.
I am chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, and in that position, I have
been working with Ranking Member
WYDEN from Oregon on a comprehen-
sive plan to do just that. We have held
a series of hearings to examine the
drug price supply chain. We are work-
ing on a path forward. We are taking
care to follow the Hippocratic Oath:
‘‘First, do no harm.’’ In other words,
let’s be sure we don’t try to fix what is
not broken. Americans don’t want to
give up high-quality lifesaving medi-
cine. That is why I support market-
driven reforms to boost competition
and transparency, because with trans-
parency brings accountability and the
marketplace working more free of se-
crecy.
Congress needs to get rid of perverse
incentives and fix problems that under-
mine competition in the drug pricing
system, including withholding samples
by brand-name pharmaceutical compa-
nies, pay for delay, product-hopping,
and rebate-bundling. There is too much
secrecy in the pricing supply chain.
Consumers can’t make heads or tails of
why they are charged what they pay
for their medicine.
President Trump has made reducing
drug prices a top priority of this ad-
ministration, and they have taken sev-
eral steps under various laws—includ-
ing even under ObamaCare—to do
things that give more freedom to con-
sumers of medicine and on other
healthcare priorities.
In another instance, on Monday, the
Federal court took a negative move,
knocking down a rule that would re-
quire drug companies to disclose the
price of their drugs in television ads.
This is very, very disappointing. Sen-
ator DURBIN and I worked on this in
the last Congress, and I am going to
continue to work with Senator DURBIN
to get this job done. Congress must
correct what the Federal court said the
administration didn’t have the author-
ity to do. I disagree with the court, but
Congress can fix that. Big Pharma is
already required to disclose side effects
in their ads. Consumers ought to know
what the advertised drug will cost.
Today, I call upon my colleagues to
climb aboard that effort Senator DUR-
BIN and I will be pursuing.
Let’s pass the bipartisan healthcare
bills thoughtfully crafted in various
committees. The previous three speak-
ers spoke to some of those issues. Let’s
get these various bills correcting some
of these problems over the finish line.
Working together, we can drive down
the price of prescription drugs without
derailing quality and without derailing
innovation, all of which saves lives and
improves the quality of life for the
American people.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana.
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, Senator
GRASSLEY and I attended the rollout of
President Trump’s Executive order to
get the healthcare industry on the
move. The chairman of the Finance
Committee, the chairman of the
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee, and Senators like
me—I am a mainstream entrepreneur—
came to the Senate to discuss issues
just like this.
I have probably been on the floor
more than any other Senator, and
every time I do it, I tell the industry:
Wake up. I took you on 10, 11 years ago,
in my own business, to give good
healthcare coverage to my employees.
Year after year, it was a litany of, you
are lucky your premiums are only
going up 5 to 10 percent this year. You
have all heard it before. It took risk,
and it took some novel thinking, but it
can be done. Most entrepreneurs aren’t
going to put the time I put into it to
make it work for my own employees.
When you hear Democrats, Repub-
licans, three or four committees, and
the President of the United States
talking about a healthcare system that
is broken, you should get it through
your thick head that there need to be
changes made. It shouldn’t be coming
from Congress, even though it will
keep coming.
I think the message is out loud and
clear: Wake up and start fixing these
things, or you are going to have a busi-
ness partner whose name is BERNIE
SANDERS and another idea of Medicare
for All that we would regret once we
got it. But, like most things here, like
most big problems in this country, we
wait too long to solve the issue.
To give you a few things on what led
me to be passionate about it, when I
had to give up my own company’s good
health insurance, I had a very generic
prescription that I needed to get re-
newed. There were eight pharmacies in
the little town of Jasper, roughly, so I
knew I would be able to get quotes. I
had no health insurance. I was in be-
tween being a CEO of a company and a
Senator. I said, I am going to try to see
what this is going to be like. I knew it
should cost 20 or 25 bucks, maybe a lit-
tle less.
The first place I called, they stum-
bled around and couldn’t even give me
a quote on a common prescription. Fi-
nally, after about 3 to 4 minutes, they
said $34.50. I called another place that
I thought would be a little quicker on
its feet. It took 10 seconds, I got a
quote for $10, and they said: By the
way, you can pick it up in 10 minutes.
That is more the way the rest of the
economy works, but healthcare con-
sumers have gotten used to not doing
any of that heavy-lifting themselves.
And believe me, the industry has
evolved from Big Pharma, to big hos-
pital chains, to the health insurance
industry, which is in the middle of all
of it. There are pharmacy benefit man-
agers, and the drug companies give

them $150 billion worth of rebates, and
through their costs and profits, less
than half of that makes it to the con-
sumer or to the pharmacy.
The case is out there. We, as Sen-
ators and Congressmen on the other
side, shouldn’t need to be going to the
floors of our Chambers to tell you the
obvious: If you don’t do these things, I
don’t believe we here—at the speed at
which we normally operate—can do it
quickly enough for you to save your-
selves from that other business plan,
which is Medicare for All.
So what do we do to prevent that?
No. 1, the industry should be out there
doing what all other companies do—be
transparent. In any other part of our
economy, where do you not ask for and
have plenty of information to work
with. What does it cost, and what is the
quality? I know that where I live, peo-
ple would drive 60 miles to save 50
bucks on a big-screen TV that costs a
thousand bucks.
When I instituted a plan in my own
business that encouraged my employ-
ees to do that, to have skin in the
game, amazing things happened. Every
time you pick up the phone or get on
the web and look for that comparison,
it is kind of hard to find, but it is
there. The industry just needs to give
more of it and not hide behind a sys-
tem that has benefitted them. When we
created that in my own business, peo-
ple shopped around for prescriptions
and routinely saved 30 to 70 percent, as
they do on MRIs, CAT scans, and most
other procedures.
I put the time and effort into it. Most
CEOs—and you always hear about how
employees are happy with their em-
ployer-provided insurance. That is be-
cause the employers are generally pay-
ing for anywhere from 85 to 100 percent
of it. So folks working somewhere
don’t really have skin in the game.
Consumers of healthcare need to do
what they do in all other industries
and in all other things that they buy—
take the time to ask how much it
costs, what is the quality, and then the
industry get with it so that we can fix
the system before the other option ac-
tually takes place. There aren’t enough
CEOs and there aren’t enough legisla-
tors to, I think, get the industry in
shape, and the industry itself knows
what these problems are. Get with it
before you have a different business
partner whom you won’t like.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana.
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I, too,
come to speak today regarding phar-
maceutical costs and what we can do to
make lifesaving medications—and
sometimes these medications make our
lives a little bit better—more afford-
able to the average American.
I happen to be a doctor, and I will ap-
proach these remarks as a fellow who
has seen medicine evolve, who has seen
the incredible, positive benefits of
pharmaceutical innovation, but also as
a doctor who sometimes saw that pa-
tients were unable to afford innova-
tion. The question in my mind is, How
do we give the patient the power to af-
ford these innovative medicines, be-
cause if she cannot afford them, it is as
if the innovation never occurred, and
for her, it never did occur. So give the
patient power.
Let me make some remarks about
pharmaceutical companies. There are
some incredible examples.
When I was in medical school, cut-
ting away a part of one’s stomach—not
the belly but part of the stomach; as I
would tell patients, where the food
goes after you swallow it—cutting
away a part of the stomach because of
ulcerative disease was one of the most
common procedures done in surgery.
Then histamine blockers came along,
H2 blockers. Cimetidine was the first.
All of a sudden, a surgery that was
done multiple times a week was scarce-
ly ever done. Those medicines are now
sold over the counter.
This morning, I got a little bit of ar-
thritis, so I took my nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory, which used to be sold by
prescription and now is over the
counter, along with my H2 blocker, my
Pepcid, which used to be sold by pre-
scription but now is over the counter. I
take them in the morning, and my
back feels better. All of these are medi-
cines that are generic, routine, and we
almost—in fact, we indeed take the in-
novation for granted.
I can go on. I am a liver doctor. Hep-
atitis C used to be an incurable disease
which, in a certain percentage of those
affected, would lead to cirrhosis, vom-
iting blood, liver cancer, and death.
Now hepatitis C is cured by taking pills
for several weeks. Amazing.
Human immunodeficiency virus,
AIDS. When I was in residency, if you
got HIV, you died. There was no cure
whatsoever. Now people live with it for
decades. It is a disease you live with
but do not die from. We speak of actu-
ally now developing cures for HIV.
That is the promise of a vibrant
pharmaceutical industry—people who
not only live when otherwise they
would have passed away but who also
have a better quality of life.
Now, that said, if the patient doesn’t
have the power, the patient has no le-
verage in this situation.
I was recently with others in a con-
versation with the new head of the
Congressional Budget Office. The CBO
head said: You know, everybody has le-
verage in the healthcare marketplace
except the patient. Everybody has le-
verage but not the patient.
That is so true. Let me give some ex-
amples of how the patient lacks lever-
age in the pharmaceutical market-
place.
First, I will say, if I go to church—
and I do go to church regularly—and
there is a BERNIE SANDERS supporter
yanking on this lapel and a Donald
Trump supporter yanking on this lapel
and they are complaining about the
same thing, they are talking about ei-
ther surprise medical bills or the high
cost of drugs. It is something that
touches each American, but it doesn’t
have to be that way.
Consumer Reports did an article over
1 year ago now in which they sent se-
cret shoppers out to retail pharmacies
to buy five generic medications, a pre-
scription for each type—again, generic,
like the over-the-counter pills I am
taking. They went, and they paid any-
where from $66 to $900 for the same five
drugs. Now, we can assume that the ac-
quisition cost was about 60 bucks, be-
cause you could buy it someplace—an
independent pharmacy or online—for
$66, but three or four chain pharmacies
were charging $900 for medications that
they could acquire for less than $60.
You could argue, why did the patient
pay? Because we have so little adver-
tising, if you will, cost competition, on
what a generic medicine would cost. So
imagine you have a health savings ac-
count, and you are going to buy your
prescriptions, and you get charged $900
for something that should cost $60.
This is the situation in which the pa-
tient has no leverage.
By the way, you can ask, why didn’t
insurance cover it? It is because these
patients were posing as uninsured. So
the chain pharmacy figured out that it
is the uninsured who do not have some-
body working on their behalf who are
going to be the most ripe for the pick-
ing for the high prices. The uninsured
are the ones we are going to exploit,
the ones paying cash. That is wrong.
That is not the patient having the
power; it is the patient being used as a
victim.
There are other things we can see.
One is called evergreening. You have a
drug, and you make just a little bit of
a tweak to it that doesn’t improve its
importance or the efficacy of the
drug—no clinical benefit—but it ex-
tends the intellectual property protec-
tions. Now laws that were conceived of
and passed by Congress to reward inno-
vation and to encourage creativity are
instead being used to stifle competi-
tion and to extend patent lives so that
we, the patients and the taxpayers,
have to pay more—not for innovation
but, rather because, somebody figured
out how to evergreen it.
So on the one hand, I am going to
praise pharmaceutical companies for
lifesaving drugs that have meant so
much to me, my family, and everyone
who is listening today, but I must also
ask, why should we reward that which
is not innovative but which is merely
arbitraging laws meant to encourage
innovation? We should not encourage
arbitraging laws.
There are other issues, such as pat-
ent abuse, where companies file large
numbers of patents on parts of their
drugs that are not innovative but are
byproducts of the production process in
order to keep out competition; citizen
petitions, which typically come on 6
months before a drug is about to be-
come generic, so all of a sudden, we
have all these petitions that must be
navigated by the companies seeking to

introduce the generic; and the rebate
system, which works to preserve mar-
ket share but also to increase prices
and to keep them high so patients do
not benefit from competition.
If we are going to say the patient
should have the power in order to have
lower prices, we can say right now that
the system seems to be aligned against
the patient.
What can we do? Well, my office and
others have several proposals in the
current pieces of legislation going
through, such as the so-called real-
time benefit analysis. A prescription is
ordered for a patient. The patient scans
a barcode, and it would say: At this
point, with your deductible and your
copay, this is how much this drug is
going to cost you, but there is a ge-
neric available, and you can get that
generic instead. That would be a real-
time benefit analysis that would save
the patient money.
We just talked to the folks at Blue
Cross California. They are coming up
with so-called gainsharing. If a patient
selects a lower cost medication, the pa-
tient receives some of the savings that
would otherwise have all gone back to
the insurance company—another great
idea. Senator BRAUN was speaking
about the patient having skin in the
game. In this case, there will be skin in
the game because the patient shares
the benefit with the payor for being
cost-conscious. That is the patient hav-
ing the power.
We can also add value-based arrange-
ments, which pharmaceutical compa-
nies, to their credit, have proposed. If
you are the pharmaceutical company,
you get paid only if the medicine
works. If the medicine doesn’t work,
you don’t get paid. If it does work, you
do. That is a value-based arrangement.
We have a bill with Senator WARNER
that would do that.
I would also mention attempting to
cap Part D exposure. If there is a sen-
ior citizen who is in the catastrophic
portion of her policy, then you can cap
the amount the senior might be ex-
posed to. Under current law, she might
be paying 5 percent of $100,000 worth of
medicine. She is taking an essential
drug to treat cancer, and she is paying
5 percent of that $100,000, in addition to
5 percent of the other medications she
is receiving. This is something many
seniors cannot afford and this is some-
thing we as Congress can find mecha-
nisms by which we can cap that expo-
sure but still hold taxpayers whole.
We have to enhance existing mar-
kets. As you might guess, my theme is
that we should enhance it in terms of
giving the patient the power, but we
also have to preserve the innovation
that has led to the great drugs I spoke
about earlier. If all we do is steal intel-
lectual property from the pharma-
ceutical companies, we will lose these
innovative drugs. But, again, we need
to have the drugs affordable for the pa-
tients. This is the tension—promote in-
novation but ensure affordability.
We have a number of solutions, such
as those I have just mentioned, in the
HELP Committee and now in the Fi-
nance Committee. Republicans have
solutions. My office continues to work
on those. I look forward to working
with my colleagues on their implemen-
tation.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF JOHN P. PALLASCH
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I
come to the floor today to speak about
the two nominations we are about to
vote on.
The first one is the nomination of
John Pallasch to be the Assistant Sec-
retary of Labor overseeing the Employ-
ment & Training Administration. This
is a critically important role that man-
ages nearly two-thirds of the Depart-
ment of Labor’s budget and our Na-
tion’s workforce development pro-
grams, which serve over 22 million
youth, workers, jobseekers, and seniors
who are working to improve their em-
ployment opportunities and the lives of
their families.
This position is particularly impor-
tant now as we are seeing the Trump
administration work to undermine
some of the most crucial programs
within the Employment & Training Ad-
ministration. They are attempting to
close Job Corps centers that help train
at-risk youth, conserve our natural re-
sources, and provide economic opportu-
nities in rural areas and communities
in need. They are also proposing a du-
plicative, lower quality apprenticeship
program that would put workers at
risk and give taxpayer dollars to for-
profit colleges with very little account-
ability.
It is clear that the Employment &
Training Administration needs a leader
now who is knowledgeable, who is expe-
rienced, and who is committed to pro-
viding workers with the training, sup-
port, and benefits they need to succeed
in this changing economy. Unfortu-
nately, Mr. Pallasch is not that person.
Throughout this nomination process,
Mr. Pallasch has shown that he has
very limited experience with or under-
standing of the programs that he would
be overseeing.
I am going to vote against this nomi-
nation, and I urge my colleagues to do
the same.
At this time, I also want to once
again reiterate my disappointment in
the unprecedented obstruction to
Democratic nominees to the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission and
the National Labor Relations Board.
Last Congress, Republicans refused to
confirm two very highly qualified and
respected nominees to additional terms
on the EEOC and the NLRB.
Earlier this year, Republicans broke
yet another longstanding tradition by
confirming a majority nominee to the
EEOC without a Democratic pair.
Last week, the White House an-
nounced its intention to nominate a bi-
partisan pair of nominees to the EEOC.
After a year of obstruction, I am en-
couraged by this small step toward bi-
partisanship and normalcy, but I am
here today to urge the White House to
formalize these nominations as quickly
as possible so that the Senate can con-
firm them and restore balance to the
EEOC.
I strongly urge the White House to
nominate a full slate of nominees—Re-
publican and Democrat—to both the
NLRB and EEOC.
For those reasons and because of Mr.
Pallasch’s lack of experience and
knowledge about the programs and the
policies he would be responsible for, I
will vote against his nomination.
NOMINATION OF ROBERT L. KING
Madam President, I also come to the
floor today to oppose the nomination
of Robert King to be the Department of
Education’s Assistant Secretary for
Postsecondary Education. This posi-
tion is especially important because so
many of our Nation’s students are
struggling today in higher education.
Over the last few years, I have heard
from students who are worried about
how they are ever going to afford their
textbooks or their rent or even their
food, who are worried if their college is
preparing them for a good education
and if they are going to be able to get
a good-paying job and pay off their
loans.
First-generation college students are
struggling to navigate their financial
aid and how to succeed on a college
campus for the first time. I am hearing
about those worried about being able
to get an education without being dis-
criminated against or harassed or as-
saulted on campus. Those are just a
snapshot of the issues students are fac-
ing in higher education today.
These challenges are not easy to
solve. That is why Chairman ALEX-
ANDER and I are working now to ad-
dress all of those issues and more in
our reauthorization of the Higher Edu-
cation Act.
As we work to update this critically
important law, we cannot ignore the
current actions of this Department of
Education, which is loosening and
eliminating rules that benefit preda-
tory colleges instead of protecting stu-
dents. Students should have an ally at
the Department of Education, someone
who understands the challenges they
are facing and is committed to helping
students succeed.
Among other responsibilities, this
Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary
Education is responsible for developing
rules, for developing a budget and leg-
islative proposals for higher education,

and overseeing our country’s quality
assurance system of accreditation—a
system this Secretary is currently dis-
mantling.
This position is also responsible for
programs that help our low-income
students and first-generation students
and students with disabilities as they
prepare for and try to succeed in col-
lege and programs that help support
minority-serving institutions.
On these issues specifically, Mr.
King’s record is particularly con-
cerning. Mr. King blamed students for
the daunting challenges in higher edu-
cation today, even saying students are
making ‘‘bad economic choices.’’ He
also refused to answer questions on
whether he believes students face sys-
temic barriers in higher education or
whether income inequality plays a role
in a student’s ability to earn a degree.
There are students in higher education
who are skipping meals today or living
in a car. Mr. King would not acknowl-
edge that problem.
Finally, on an issue that is so impor-
tant to me and one that is imperative
to a student’s ability to succeed in
higher education, Mr. King blamed al-
cohol and bad judgment—not perpetra-
tors—for the epidemic of sexual assault
on college campuses.
I don’t believe Mr. King has the right
understanding of what students are
facing today to be our Nation’s next
Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary
Education. I urge my colleagues who
are committed to making higher edu-
cation within reach for all students to
join me in voting against his nomina-
tion.
I yield the floor.

ator from Maryland.
U.S. WOMEN’S WORLD CUP VICTORY
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, Sun-
day morning, I did what I think most
people in this Nation did if they were
not in France. I turned on the tele-
vision to watch the women’s national
soccer team perform in an incredible
showing of talent and commitment on
the soccer field. It was an incredible
victory for the women’s national team,
and we are all very proud of what they
were able to accomplish. This has been
an incredible streak.
Since the Women’s World Cup was es-
tablished in 1991, there have been eight
competitions. The United States has
won four—and the last two consecu-
tively—beating the Netherlands on
Sunday by a score of 2 to 0.
We all congratulate the team. We are
very proud. They represented our Na-
tion extremely well. Each of us shares
that pride.
As a Maryland Senator, I want to ac-
knowledge Rose Lavelle and Mallory
Pugh, who are from the Washington
Spirit, which is based in Germantown,
MD.
GENDER PAY INEQUALITY
Madam President, this team rep-
resents our entire country and the best
of our Nation. Their performance high-
lighted an issue that they raised, which
I hope this body will respond to, and
that is the pay inequity based upon
gender in this country.
It is shocking that these women soc-
cer players are paid less, receive less in
compensation than their male counter-
parts, even though the women on the
world stage have consistently out-
performed the men. They have a dif-
ferent pay structure. In 2014, the men’s
total performance bonus totaled about
$5.4 million, even though they were
eliminated in the round of 16. The fol-
lowing year, the women received about
one-third less than the men did, even
though they were the world champions.
In 2016, this body acted by passing a
resolution about the gender pay in-
equity—to treat all athletes with the
respect and dignity they deserve. That
was the right thing for us to pass in
2016, and I know my colleague Senator
MANCHIN is working on legislation now
that will follow that up since, obvi-
ously, the soccer league did not re-
spond the way they should have in re-
gard to our women’s national soccer
team.
In 1963, Congress passed the Equal
Pay Act. Yet, when you look at what
women earn versus men for comparable
work, women are paid 77 cents for
every dollar a man earns. It is much
worse for minorities. Native Hawaiians
and Pacific Islanders versus White
males are 62 cents versus a dollar; Afri-
can-American women are 61 cents
versus a dollar for a White male; Na-
tive Americans are 58 cents; and
Latinos are 53 cents. The wage gap af-
fects not only their current earnings,
but it puts women behind men in ca-
reer earnings of around $400,000 during
the course of their careers, which
weakens their ability to save for their
retirements. It also means there being
fewer Social Security benefits. It af-
fects their ability to be compensated
fairly—to have the wealth of this Na-
tion and the security of this Nation.
We can do something to change this.
I have already mentioned Senator
MANCHIN’s efforts and that we could do
something specifically in regard to the
soccer players, but I urge us to do
something a little bit more permanent,
and that is to pass the Equal Rights
Amendment.
I think Americans would be surprised
to learn that in the Constitution of the
United States, there is no protection
for equal rights for women. Most Amer-
icans think we already did that. Any
constitution of a democratic State that
has been created since the end of World
War II has contained constitutional
protections for equal rights for women.
Many of our State constitutions have
provisions for equal rights for women,
but our Constitution of the United
States does not.
In 1972, the Congress of the United
States passed an equal rights amend-
ment to the Constitution to be ratified
by the States. Originally, Congress
gave the States until 1979. Then Con-
gress extended it until 1982. Now 37
States have ratified the Equal Rights
Amendment. We are one State short of
the 38 required for the ratification of a
constitutional amendment. Yet there
is a problem here. We need to get the
38th State, but we also need to extend
the time, for the last amendment that
dealt with the pay amendments of Con-
gress that was adopted to our Constitu-
tion took over 200 years to ratify.
What we are saying—and I have
joined with Senator MURKOWSKI in a bi-
partisan resolution—is to let us extend
the time for the ratification of the con-
stitutional amendment for the equal
rights of women so we can really do
something meaningful for the gender
gap on pay that we have.
In this Congress, we celebrate the
100th anniversary of women’s suf-
frage—since women have had the right
to vote. Another concrete way to cele-
brate that milestone is for us to pass
the Equal Rights Amendment. How a
nation treats its women economically
and socially is a sign of that nation’s
success. Empowering women is one of
the most important things we can do
for the future of our country. Whether
it occurs on the soccer pitch or in the
factories or offices across the country,
the wage disparity between American
men and women is hurting our Nation.
This morning, the U.S. women’s na-
tional soccer team rolled down Broad-
way in a ticker tape parade befitting a
world championship, and today or to-
morrow, the Senate will likely pass a
resolution that will commend the
team. These are appropriate ways to
celebrate the team. Yet, if we really
want to honor the outstanding women
who have just brought home the World
Cup again, we should join their fight
for equal pay for themselves and for all
women. Pass S.J. Res. 6, and let’s fi-
nally ratify the Equal Rights Amend-
ment.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I
am here to talk about insulin. You
may wonder why someone would talk
about insulin, given all the weighty
and pressing issues we have before us
in this Chamber and even more so in
the world today. I will not begin to re-
cite them, but insulin for millions of
people—in fact, 30 million people in the
United States—is a matter of life and
death.
Many of us are fortunate because we
never have to think about insulin. Our
bodies make enough of it to keep us
healthy, and we go about our lives
without a second thought concerning
blood glucose or how our pancreas is
functioning, but for those 30 million
people—and quite a few of them visited
us this morning in our offices, and they
were present in the Committee on
Aging at our hearing—insulin is a con-
stant worry. It is top of mind. It is al-
ways present as an issue for them, in
fact, on a daily basis. Patients with di-
abetes need to carefully monitor and
adjust their insulin levels along with
managing their physical activities,
their diet, stress, pain, sleep levels.
Many of those young people who
came to the Committee on Aging
today—by the way, I want to thank
Senators COLLINS and CASEY for hold-
ing that hearing and giving them an
opportunity to come to the Nation’s
Capitol and make us more aware—were
wearing monitoring devices, hidden but
a constant concern. They depend on in-
sulin as a matter of life and death. It is
not a luxury for them. It is not like ice
cream or ball games. It is life and
death. They are fortunate, too, because
they have access to insulin, unlike a
lot of people around the world and un-
like the whole world, including Amer-
ica, about 100 years ago when diabetes
was, in fact, a death sentence, not in a
matter of years ahead but right then
and there. Diabetes was lethal.
That changed when two researchers,
Dr. Frederick Banting and Dr. Charles
Best, succeeded in isolating insulin
from an animal pancreas in 1921. By
the next year, they had collected
enough to treat their first patient. He
was a 14-year-old boy with diabetes,
and he lived miraculously for another
year. That was unheard of at the time.
It was a tremendous breakthrough—an
extra year of life because of their dis-
covery.
So Dr. Banting and Dr. Best filed a
patent. They patented their discovery
in 1923, and they stated their goal was
not to make a lot of money, not to
make profit but to make insulin avail-
able to the world, make it available to
everyone who needed it, make it avail-
able to patients, regardless of their
means and circumstance. Do you know
what they did with that patent? They
sold it for $1—just $1.
Dr. Banting said: ‘‘Insulin does not
belong to me, it belongs to the world.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4762 July 10, 2019
He was right. Insulin belongs to the
world of people, whatever their ages,
whatever their circumstances, what-
ever their means, wherever they live.
Certainly, in the greatest country in
the history of the world, where that
patent, about 100 years ago, was sold
for $1, shouldn’t it be affordable and ac-
cessible to everyone?
Well, this story has a really discour-
aging sequel, which is today in real
time. The price of insulin has sky-
rocketed. When I say ‘‘skyrocketed,’’
there are different numbers. It doubled,
according to one authoritative site, be-
tween the years 2012 and 2016. There is
another study that says it has risen 10
times in price over just the last several
years. Beyond question, it has risen
and not just by a little bit but by lit-
erally hundreds of dollars for the aver-
age American who has to afford it, day
in and day out. Those yearly costs are
forcing people to choose, literally, be-
tween putting food on the table and
buying insulin, between paying mort-
gages and buying insulin, between the
kinds of fun that ordinary young peo-
ple would enjoy and buying insulin.
I know we say this about choices
made by Americans, but today in this
very Capitol, just steps away, I listened
to the parents of Logan and Emma talk
to me, along with them, about the real-
life consequences of these exploding in-
sulin costs, and it broke my heart.
Their experiences are truly heart-
breaking and gut-wrenching.
Logan is 12 years old, and he told me
in the reception area right here about
his diagnosis at 18 months. He talked
about the advances in technology
around diabetes treatment with ex-
traordinary technological knowledge—
impressive not just for someone our
age but truly for somebody who is 12
years old. These advances are a tribute
to American science, innovation, and
ingenuity. They are groundbreaking,
but at the end of the day, if his family
cannot afford insulin, even the best,
most groundbreaking technology
means nothing. That is Logan’s re-
ality.
His mom told me about sitting in a
CVS parking lot and crying while she
held a box of pasta because that was all
she could afford—pasta for the rest of
the week for dinner for that family. It
was all she could afford after the insu-
lin costs. For their family, Logan’s in-
sulin has cost as much as $750 a month.
That is their deductible. That is what
they pay even with insurance. So they
have sacrificed not only in terms of
what they eat but how they live. He
was with Emma, and the two of them
are extraordinary ambassadors for the
Junior Diabetes Research Foundation,
the JDRF, which does so much won-
drous work for diabetes patients.
Emma is 15 years old, and her father
told me about a similar struggle to af-
ford insulin. In fact, her own dad was
diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in his
midthirties after Emma’s diagnosis. He
told me that ‘‘the price of insulin is il-
logical.’’
There is no reason why the cost
keeps going up. In fact, Emma and
Logan, both from Connecticut, have be-
come world-wise—not world-weary but
world-wise—about the American drug
industry. They know those costs are
rising without any reason in terms of
the cost to the manufacturer. There
are costs and prices rising for con-
sumers without any justification in the
real cost of producing the insulin they
need.
Last week, I held an event on insulin
with other diabetes patients to discuss
the skyrocketing costs. One of my con-
stituents who spoke was a little bit
older than Logan and Emma. Dr. Kath-
ryn Nagel, a physician and resident at
Yale University, was also diagnosed
with diabetes when she was 18 months
old. She is a resident now, training to
become a pediatrician, among other
specialties. As she put it to me,
‘‘Banting would be ashamed of the
state of things now.’’ Dr. Banting said,
‘‘Insulin does not belong to me, it be-
longs to the world.’’ He would be out-
raged and embarrassed by what is hap-
pening in America today.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that Kathryn Nagel’s full remarks
be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
JULY 10, 2019.
I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when
I was 18 months old. As you can imagine,
this was terrifying for my family. But we
were lucky. We lived in America, where we
had access to the most advanced health care
in the world. I was immediately connected to
a team of doctors who taught my family ev-
erything we needed to know about managing
this disease. I had health insurance. Through
my insurance, I received insulin and all the
other supplies I would need, and my family
was able to devote its attention to mastering
the regimen required to keep a type 1 dia-
betic alive.
I was lucky.
I didn’t have to worry about where my in-
sulin came from. I didn’t have to worry
about having to scramble for a new prescrip-
tion because my insurance company had
switched allegiances to a different insulin
company. I didn’t have to worry about how
much it cost because of a high deductible,
copay, or god forbid, no insurance at all.
This, unfortunately, is not the reality for
many Americans living with diabetes today.
I had this access, not because it is a right
granted to all Americans, but because my
dad was the employee of a University. When
I was in high school, my parents started to
impress upon me a vital truth: I must always
be employed by someone who would give me
good health insurance.
With the help of protections from the Af-
fordable Care Act, and the decision to pursue
the path to medicine, I continued to have
good access to health insurance. The insulin
pricing crisis and healthcare chaos in our
country poked through in subtle, but never
catastrophic ways for me.
I saw it when I went to fill my prescrip-
tion, and was told that because of some back
door deals my insurance company was no
longer covering the type of insulin I had used
for the past 20 years. If I wanted to take that
type of insulin, I would have to pay hundreds
of dollars out of pocket for just one vial. For
reference, when I first started this insulin,
its list price was $26 a vial.
I’ve seen this chaos even more in my prac-
tice as a doctor. In medical school we are
taught how to treat disease. We are taught
which medicines to use and when. In clinical
training, however, we learn that that is the
easy part. The much harder part, is figuring
out how people can get access to the treat-
ments we know they need. We learn to fight
with insurance companies, we spend hours on
the phone with pharmacies making sure that
our patients can actually get the medica-
tions we prescribe.
I want to impress upon you, how vital insu-
lin is for a type 1 diabetic to stay alive. This
is not something we should take to stay
healthy. It is something we must have, every
hour of our lives, to stay alive. It is akin to
oxygen. For me, it takes just hours without
insulin before my body starts developing
ketones. Ketones produce an acid biproduct
that is toxic to the body, creating an envi-
ronment where the other organs can no
longer function. Without sufficient insulin,
it does not take long before a diabetics heart
goes into a fatal arrhythmia, causing an en-
tirely preventable death.
This is what happened to Alec Smith. This
is what happened to Kevin Houdeshell. This
is what has happened to too many diabetics
in this country, many of them quite young,
because they lose access to insulin. It hap-
pens to too many of them at age 26, when
they are left to fend for themselves for
health insurance. This should NEVER hap-
pen.
I want to tell you about a childhood hero
of mine, Frederick Banting. Banting, with
his team, discovered insulin in 1921. It is be-
cause of Banting I am still alive. But
Banting did more than discover insulin.
Knowing that it was the difference between
life and death, he did what he could to en-
sure that no greedy company would ever
deny people access to insulin. He sold his
patent to the University of Toronto for $1 so
that it would remain accessible to everyone.
He stated, ‘‘Insulin belongs to the world, not
to me’’.
Banting would be ashamed of the state of
things now.
It turns out, it’s not always such a lucky
thing to live in America. Today, 1 in 4 Amer-
icans with type 1 diabetes rations insulin due
to the cost. In the time since I was diag-
nosed, the cost of insulin has increased over
1200%. These stats don’t even include the
huge financial sacrifices people with diabetes
are making as copays, deductibles, and pre-
miums rise to meet the sky rocketing costs
of insulin and other medications. It does not
capture the stress and gut-level fear every
one of us holds of not being able to access
our insulin or supplies.
We cannot be fighting on a case by case
basis for access to what we need to stay
alive. We must do better.
Thank you Senator Blumenthal for giving
us the opportunities to share our stories.
Thank you for fighting for us, and working
towards a better future for those of us de-
pendent on insulin to stay alive.
KATHRYN NAGEL, MD.
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President,
Kathryn Nagel—who will be an ex-
traordinary physician because she has
not only a great mind, but she also has
a great heart—is absolutely right. Drug
companies today have moved far from
the outreaching motives of insulin’s
original discovery. Advancements in
biotechnology have allowed manufac-
turers to make slightly more purified
and precise versions of insulin, but it
works the same as Dr. Banting’s origi-
nal insulin from the 1920s because that
is what our body needs to do its work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4763
July 10, 2019
Even incremental changes to an insu-
lin product open up new patent oppor-
tunities for manufacturers and compa-
nies that have been taking advantage
of these loopholes in our patent system
for too long at the expense of patients
and their families.
Let me give one particularly egre-
gious example. Sanofi manufactures
the insulin product Lantus. Sanofi filed
a total of 74 patents on Lantus, with 95
percent of those applications hap-
pening after Lantus was introduced to
the market in the year 2000. That is a
variation of insulin—almost 20 years
old—protected by 74 patents way be-
yond the life of the original patent on
a medicine discovered 100 years ago by
a doctor who said, ‘‘Insulin does not be-
long to me, it belongs to the world.’’
Sanofi has constructed such an elabo-
rate web and tangle of patents sur-
rounding their product that they could
have a competition-free monopoly on
their particular version of insulin for
37 years. They are exploiting it relent-
lessly and tirelessly and inexcusably.
The effect of elaborate patent thick-
ets like Sanofi’s—constructed by com-
panies—are felt by consumers in the
form of higher drug prices. It is that
simple. Create a monopoly without
competition, and the prices can be
raised without real limit. Lantus has
increased in price 24 percent from 2016
to 2018. In 2 years, there was a 24-per-
cent increase unrelated to the cost of
the product. In fact, the overall costs
of insulin have doubled in recent years,
with patients having paid an average of
$2,864 for insulin in 2012 and $5,705 in
2016. That is the average out-of-pocket
for insulin patient. That is the story I
heard from Emma Del Vecchio of Or-
ange and Logan Merwin of Haddam, as
earlier today they shared their life-
and-death struggle with the cost of in-
sulin.
One more story that has resonated
with me over the past few days is from
Kristin Whitney Daniels. She is from
Shelton, CT.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have the remarks of Kristen
Whitney Daniel and Jonathan Chappell
printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
JULY 1, 2019.
Thank you, Senator Blumenthal.
My name is Kristen Whitney Daniels and I
am the chapter leader for Connecticut’s
#insulin4all group, part of the TI Inter-
national organization. We are a patient-led
advocacy group committed to ensuring af-
fordable and equitable access to all diabetes
related supplies, including insulin. Insulin is
critical for every diabetic—before it’s dis-
covery in 1922, type one diabetes was a death
sentence. Today, diabetics can thrive . . . if
they have access to insulin.
I was diagnosed with type one diabetes 13
years ago at the age of 15. Being an advocate
never crossed my mind when I was diagnosed
over a decade ago. Type one diabetes com-
pletely took over my life after I was diag-
nosed. It was like learning a new, complex
language and continues to be a relentless
disease that requires constant vigilance. So
why would I devote any free time to a dis-
ease that has already taken so much?
Why? Because of Alex Smith and Kevin
Houdeshell and Micah Fischer and the count-
less others who lost their lives due to a lack
of affordable access to insulin. Because one
in four type one diabetics have had to ration
insulin, playing a deadly game to survive as
pharmaceutical companies continue to un-
abashedly raise their prices. Because I am
the one in four who have been forced to ra-
tioned their insulin.
My story is a familiar one for the diabetes
community. While pursuing my dream in-
ternship, I turned 26 and lost my health in-
surance. I purchased the only health insur-
ance I could afford—a high-deductible plan
that cost more than my monthly paycheck
and whose monthly payments already con-
sumed 15% of my income. But I had prepared
for this time period. I hoarded supplies and
medications for months, resorting to under-
utilizing my supplies. I hoped this would buy
me time to work off my deductible. It didn’t;
putting any money towards that deductible
was like chipping away at an iceberg with a
toothpick.
By the time I reached the last of my insu-
lin vials, I knew things were becoming crit-
ical. There was no way I could meet my de-
ductible without forgoing housing and food.
And at over $250 a vial, my monthly supply
of insulin far-exceeded even my deductible.
So, I did what seemed like my only choice:
For weeks, I ate significantly less, exercised
more, and dangerously started rationing my
insulin by cutting my dose and letting my
blood sugars rise to unhealthy levels.
Even as those last vials turned to the last
few drops, I refused to panic. Surely this is
what all the patient assistance programs
were meant for. I called my doctor, my phar-
macy, my insurance company, the insulin
manufacturer, 3 different prescription assist-
ance programs and faced the same answer
every time: there was nothing they could do
to help because I had insurance. With every
call I became increasingly more desperate,
finally resorting to begging and pleading.
Didn’t they understand I would be dead in
less than 48 hours if I didn’t get my insulin?
I wasn’t just frustrated at that moment; I
wasn’t just angry . . . I felt insignificant.
Like my survival, my life amounted to abso-
lutely nothing.
At the end of the day, none of those ave-
nues helped me. None of those programs
pharmaceutical companies tout to the media
saved me from death. No, my help came from
a last-ditch visit to a government funded
community health clinic. There, my insulin
was provided to me for $14—$2,386 less than
at the pharmacy.
The insulin crisis is at a critical juncture
in America. We can no longer talk about
hypotheticals—diabetics have been and are
continuing to die from a lack of affordable
access to a drug we need just as much as ox-
ygen. I may not have set out to be an advo-
cate, but I refuse to sit idly by while dia-
betics suffer at the hands of companies that
continue to make exorbitant money off our
bodies. Our community will not stop until
every diabetic has equal access to insulin.
And we will not be silenced when parents,
friends, and family continue to bury their
loved ones.
Thank you, Senator Blumenthal for spon-
soring this bill. This is one bill, of hopefully
many, where America chooses to stand with
those who have suffered greatly at the hands
of pharmaceutical companies.
KRISTEN WHITNEY DANIELS,
CT#insulin4all Chapter Leader.
Hi, my name is Johnathan Chappell and
I’m an attorney at the law firm Feldman,
Perlstein, and Greene in Farmington, Con-
necticut.
As far as background goes, I was diagnosed
as Type I diabetic in 1999 and started used
Humalog insulin in 2001. Just to see what
we’re talking about, this is one vial of insu-
lin, for those who do not know. For me, it’s
about ten days of life.
It being July 1st, we’re getting close to the
Fourth of July—the country’s birthday, if
you will. I’ll show you this, which is three
vials of insulin in a box, with a rubber rand
around them, that says ‘‘One of three, two of
three, three of three.’’ So that’s about a
month of life, for me anyway.
I filled my prescription—I think, smartly—
on June 15th. The key date in my life is July
1st. That’s the reset date of my high-deduct-
ible plan. So this amount of insulin, again,
this being a vial (There are three of them in
these boxes. I trust you will trust me)—if I
got this today, it would be $1,008. I got it on
June 15th for a $25 co-pay. There are a lot of
words that I could choose, but ‘‘insane’’
seems to be pretty fitting if you ask me.
And we’re here to talk about insulin, but
the cost of equipment to put that insulin
into my body is also not cheap.
The good news is that I get a lot of gas
points at the pharmacy. The bad news is I
have to figure out how to feed my family,
which includes my wife and three children,
and continue to do so. And that, even for me,
is quite a task at times.
So what do I do? I try to stockpile as much
insulin as I can grab, while my deductible
has been exhausted. Like a squirrel before
hibernating, I tried to get as much of this as
I could before today. So I have about a
month or two while I’m okay, or very good.
But this is unacceptable. This is not the
point of healthcare reform. It has not been
addressed, in my opinion.
I thank Senator Blumenthal. With my
years of involvement with JDRF I’ve met
him and his wonderful office members a
number of times. I’m a past president of the
JDRF and obviously I can tell you that I’m
not the only Type I in Connecticut who is
worried about this. I’m fortunate that they
still asked me to come and tell my story.
So, again, this was $25 and, if I went back
today, or in two weeks, it would be $1,008.
And it would probably be more expensive, to
tell you the truth, because the price of insu-
lin just keeps going up. The minute you
drive your car off the lot, it depreciates but,
for some reason, insulin has appreciated
every day for the past twenty years I’ve been
using it. In November, it will be twenty
years with Type I diabetes—pretty tightly
controlled, but to do that is not cheap.
So again, if Senator Blumenthal’s bill is
right near a vote, let’s get it voted on and
let’s do what we can to get this issue solved.
Short-term, mid-term and forever. I thank
Senator Blumenthal and everybody out there
for the support.
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President,
Kristen is the chapter leader of Con-
necticut #insulin4all and attended the
event I mentioned. She was inspired to
become an advocate for affordable and
equitable access to insulin after facing
tough barriers in her own medical
treatment. She was forced to become
one of the one in four patients with di-
abetes in the United States who has re-
sorted to insulin-rationing in the face
of high drug costs.
Let’s be clear about insulin-ration-
ing. It means reducing the dosage—ra-
tioning the consumption—to lower the
cost. When we talk about folks who
have to cut pills in half or seniors who
take a pill every other day instead of
every day, that is rationing. That is

what Kristen had to do in the face of
these rising drug prices.
In order to pursue her dream intern-
ship, Kristen had to purchase the only
health insurance she could afford,
which was a high-deductible plan
whose monthly payments consumed 15
percent of her income. To try to pre-
pare for the realities of this kind of
coverage, she had to hoard her insulin
and other diabetes supplies for months
in advance, deliberately starving her
body of the medicine she needed in
order to keep her head above water fi-
nancially.
I have submitted bipartisan legisla-
tion that was recently approved unani-
mously by the Judiciary Committee,
along with my colleague Senator COR-
NYN, that would end these abusive
practices surrounding patents—patent-
thicketing and product-hopping. You
don’t need to know the details of those
abuses or of our legislation to under-
stand the need for protection and the
need for security and safeguards for
these kinds of patients—the 30 million
who suffer from diabetes and who are
paying exploding costs for insulin that
are rising exponentially and astro-
nomically for not only insulin but also
many other drugs, as we know from lis-
tening to our constituents.
All of our colleagues understand the
high cost of prescription drugs that
continue to plague America across all
walks of life. Every day, patients are
forced to choose, in fact, between pay-
ing for the medicines they need and the
needs of their families. Drugs to treat
everything from depression, to arthri-
tis, to cancer, and even basic saline so-
lution for IVs have increased in price
in recent months. They are not new,
wondrous, magic discoveries; they are
workhorse medicines. Insulin has been
around for 100 years. Many of these
other drugs have been around for dec-
ades as well. We owe it to Americans.
As citizens and as patients ourselves,
we know that these rising prescription
prices are ruining families, tearing
apart communities, and destroying the
basic trust we have in our healthcare
system. Nothing is more basic.
Healthcare is a right. Prescription
drugs should not be available just to
the wealthy.
The bill Senator CORNYN and I are
hoping this Chamber will pass is just
one step toward making prescription
drug prices more affordable; making
these cures that are America’s pride—
developed by great researchers and
wonderful minds—available to all of
our citizens.
Logan Merwin, Emma Del Vecchio,
and all of the children in America who
suffer from diabetes understand some-
thing maybe we don’t as well: that in-
sulin is a matter of life and death and
that they are alive because they live in
the greatest country in the history of
the world, where insulin is available to
them even at times when it is difficult
for their families to afford. They know,
too, that with the great advocacy of
Kathryn Nagel, Kristin Whitney Dan-
iels, Jonathan Chappell, and others
who are taking their cause to America,
as well as the JDRF, which is sup-
porting wonderful discoveries, we will
be a better country. We will make
these prescription drugs affordable.
Insulin will be available to all. Insu-
lin does not belong to me or to you; it
belongs to the world. And I hope Amer-
ica will be an example of making insu-
lin belong to the world.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I
wish to discuss Americans’ access to
healthcare and patient protections
that are carelessly being threatened by
President Trump and his administra-
tion, specifically, his decision to not
uphold the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act, ACA, which is the
law of the land.
This week, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the fifth circuit began reviewing
appeals to a December decision in the
case Texas v. U.S., in which the entire
ACA was ruled unconstitutional. Re-
publican attorneys general from 18
States argue that the ACA is unconsti-
tutional because our Republican col-
leagues repealed the individual man-
date as part of their 2017 tax bill. In-
stead of defending the ACA and fight-
ing for Americans with preexisting
health conditions, President Trump
took the unprecedented step of not de-
fending current law, and the Depart-
ment of Justice revised its position to
support full repeal of the ACA, con-
tinuing the administration’s sabotage
of affordable access to healthcare
through all avenues of Executive ac-
tion.
If Republicans successfully overturn
the ACA, hundreds of millions of Amer-
icans will lose access to affordable
healthcare and the monumental con-
sumer protections created through the
ACA. This includes the 133 million
Americans with preexisting conditions,
17 million people who gained insurance
through Medicaid expansion, 12 million
seniors who pay less for prescription
drugs, and over 2 million adult children
who will no longer be able to stay on
their parent’s health insurance.
I am particularly worried about the
2.5 million Marylanders with a pre-
existing condition, 320,000 of whom are
children. Before the ACA, insurers de-
nied health coverage to Americans
with preexisting health conditions.
The most common preexisting condi-
tions are pregnancy, cancer, diabetes,
high blood pressure, behavioral health
disorders, high cholesterol, asthma,
and heart conditions. Patients with
preexisting conditions must know their
health insurance coverage is there for
them when they are healthy, but par-
ticularly when they become sick. The
ACA took the important step to ensure
this, by protecting all patients against
arbitrary, sudden loss of insurance.
This security would, of course, be
eliminated if the ACA is overturned.
In addition to these important con-
sumer protections, the Affordable Care
Act increased access to care for mil-
lions of people who previously were un-
insured or underinsured. Through Med-
icaid expansion, 13 million low-income
Americans now have dependable, com-
prehensive healthcare, including 300,000
Marylanders. We must protect the
Medicaid expansion population and
other uninsured or underinsured popu-
lations from the Trump administra-
tion’s efforts to eliminate their access
to affordable care.
The numerous reckless attempts by
the Trump administration to sabotage
the ACA disregard how much good
healthcare reform has done for all
Americans. Before we passed the Af-
fordable Care Act, too many people fell
through the cracks with inadequate in-
surance coverage, annual and lifetime
coverage caps, or limits to preventive
health services. Too many declared
bankruptcy because of high healthcare
costs or skipped prescribed care or
medications because of the costs.
The ACA ensured that many of those
people now have access to higher-qual-
ity coverage. Core elements of the law
require companies to cover adults and
children with preexisting conditions,
prevent insurance companies from set-
ting annual and lifetime limits, and

allow young adults can stay on a par-
ent’s health plan until the age of 26.
If the Affordable Care Act is struck
down, insurers could bring back annual
and lifetime limits on coverage, adults
covered by Medicaid expansion would
lose vital health services, young people
would be kicked off their parent’s in-
surance, and issuers could sell skimpy
plans that don’t cover essential health
benefits like prescription drugs, emer-
gency room visits, mental health and
substance use, and maternity care.
The unprecedented actions by the
Trump administration to not defend
the ACA jeopardizes the healthcare of
all Americans. I believe that acces-
sible, affordable healthcare is a human
right. Securing this right has always
been a challenge. Democrats will con-
tinue to fight for consumer protections
and increased access to care that have
been guaranteed through the Afford-
able Care Act. As President Trump re-
fuses to defend the Affordable Care
Act, he risks the health and well-being
of millions of Americans.
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President,
today I wish to again express my sup-
port for the Affordable Care Act, ACA.
We must continue fighting to protect
the safeguards that were put in place
by the ACA, which prohibits abusive
practices that previously kept
healthcare out of reach for millions of
Americans, like denying coverage to
people with preexisting conditions.
About half of all Americans have pre-
existing conditions and could be forced
to pay significantly higher premiums
or lose access to coverage altogether if
the ACA is overturned. At least 21 mil-
lion people could lose their health in-
surance if the ACA is struck down. In
my State, Minnesotans would see a loss
of $364 million in premium tax credits,
and roughly 272,000 people would lose
their coverage.
Earlier this year, I came to the Sen-
ate floor to read 100 letters from people
in my State and across the country
who explained what the ACA has
meant to them. These stories are just a
small window into the positive impact
of the ACA and how so many people
would suffer if its protections were
eliminated.
Instead of striking down this land-
mark legislation, we should build on
its strengths, defend the critical con-
sumer protections that it provides for
so many, and make it stronger. We
cannot go back to a time when people
who are sick can be denied health in-
surance coverage. This is not the time
to look back and try to tear things
down; we should look ahead and work
to strengthen our healthcare system
moving forward. It is for this reason
that we must and will continue to fight
against efforts to take away healthcare
protections from millions of Ameri-
cans.

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I
ask unanimous consent that a resolu-

of Texas be printed into the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD. Senate Resolution No.
816 was adopted by the Texas Senate on
May 24, 2019, by a vote of 31–0 and urges
the U.S. Congress to consolidate dis-
aster recovery housing funding for Hur-
ricane Harvey.
There being no objection, the mate-

RECORD, as follows:
SENATE RESOLUTION
Whereas, Hurricane Harvey struck the
Texas coast on August 25, 2017, causing an es-
timated $125 billion in damage; and
Whereas, The second most destructive
storm in American history, the hurricane
impacted approximately 30 percent of the
population of Texas, destroying homes, dam-
aging infrastructure, and displacing thou-
sands of families along the coast; and
Whereas, The Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency received nearly 800,000 applica-
tions from affected Texans for some form of
assistance; as many as 83 percent of the peo-
ple whose homes flooded did not have flood
insurance, creating unprecedented demand
for state and federal disaster recovery assist-
ance; and
Whereas, The FEMA application process is
so duplicative and confusing, and the United
States Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment regulations are so complex, that
many survivors give up trying to navigate
the system and, therefore, receive no assist-
ance; and
Whereas, Consolidating funding for recov-
ery housing programs into a single Disaster
Housing Response and Recovery Block Grant
would increase efficiency, save taxpayer dol-
lars, and speed the recovery process by com-
bining FEMA’s short-term programs and
HUD’s long-term programs; Now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, That the Senate of the State of
Texas, 86th Legislature, hereby respectfully
urge the United States Congress to enact
legislation to consolidate disaster recovery
housing funding into a single Disaster Hous-
ing Response and Recovery Block Grant; and
be it further
Resolved, That the secretary of the senate

States Congress, and to all the members of
the Texas delegation to Congress with the
request that this resolution be entered in the

for veterans on a local and national
level.
Chartered and incorporated by Con-
gress in 1919, the American Legion has
grown to support veterans nationwide.
The American Legion Department of
Connecticut was established in the
same year and is home to some of the
first posts in the country.
Over the past century, the American
Legion has established itself as our Na-
tion’s largest veterans service organi-
zations. As a nonpartisan and not-for-
profit organization, the Legion unique-
ly offers a multitude of local programs
devoted to our servicemembers and
their communities. Through youth
mentorship and athletics, reintegra-
tion assistance for wounded veterans,
and many other critical activities, the
Legion plays an important role in their
communities throughout the United
States.
With around 150 posts across Con-
necticut, the organization helps bring
together and shape the lives of many
veterans, their families, and their
neighborhoods. The Department of
Connecticut follows the four pillars of
the American Legion: supporting
Americanism, national security, advo-
cating for veterans’ affairs and
healthcare, and preparing children
throughout our state for future suc-
cess.
In particular, they generously help
children of all ages in Connecticut ex-
plore their potential with activities
such as State Police Youth Week, an
oratorical contest focused on deep-
ening high school students’ under-
standing of the U.S. Constitution,
American Legion Baseball, and sum-
mer government education programs.
As a member who has regularly at-
tended events for the Legion, including
several of their youth programs, an-
nual conventions, Veterans Day events,
and mid-winter conferences, I can
proudly attest firsthand to the impres-
sive work they accomplish on behalf of
Connecticut veterans and their fami-
lies. As the American Legion and its
Department of Connecticut recognize
and celebrate their rich and productive
100-year history, the dedicated staff
and volunteers continue to look toward
the future and expand the positive im-
pact of their outreach and programs.
Committed to serving veterans and
their communities throughout our
State, the American Legion Depart-
ment of Connecticut provides essential
advocacy and services that help to bet-
ter lives and create new opportunities.
I applaud the accomplishments of the
American Legion’s devoted officers and
volunteers, and I hope my colleagues
will join me in congratulating the
American Legion and the American Le-
gion Department of Connecticut on a
century of excellence.

CHRONIC DISEASE DAY
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize July 10 as Chronic
Disease Day and to call attention to
the unique healthcare needs of patients
from this diverse community. This
date is significant due to the fact that
it represents the 7 out of 10 Americans
who will succumb to some form of
chronic illness. Governors and State
legislatures across the country will be

working with local chronic disease pa-
tient advocates on July 10 to highlight
contemporary challenges and opportu-
nities, and I encourage my colleagues
to join in this effort.
Chronic illness includes cancers, car-
diovascular disease, and many other
conditions, some very rare. Some
chronic illnesses can be preventable,
and Chronic Disease Day is an oppor-
tunity to feature healthy lifestyles, the
importance of regular health
screenings, and proper self-care. In this
regard, awareness and education can go
a long way towards improving patient
outcomes, preventing the progression
of disease, and lowering healthcare
costs.
Many chronic illnesses are unavoid-
able though and have genetic compo-
nents or are simply idiopathic with an
unknown origin. These include rare
and life-threatening conditions that re-
quire near constant access to life-sus-
taining care or therapies. These pa-
tient occasionally rely on voluntary
charitable assistance programs to
maintain this access when they have
no other options.
July 10 is a time to promote the im-
portance of preventing chronic disease
while reflecting on opportunities to
better serve individuals and families
facing serious chronic illness. I call on
my colleagues to please join me in rec-
ognizing Chronic Disease Day.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
RECOGNIZING THE OUTDOOR
INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION
∑ Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish
to recognize the 30th anniversary of
the Outdoor Industry Association, OIA.
Based in Boulder, CO, OIA is the lead-
ing trade organization of the outdoor
recreation gear and apparel industry.
Founded by a group of 14 brands and
specialty retailers, OIA has grown to
include 1,300 companies that are the
backbone of an $887 billion outdoor
recreation economy supporting 7.6 mil-
lion jobs across the United States. For
the past three decades, OIA has rep-
resented American businesses and indi-
viduals whose vocations and avocations
are connected to this Nation’s best
idea: our public lands and waters. OIA
is motivated by a shared commitment
to protecting, maintaining, and ex-
panding outdoor recreation infrastruc-
ture and ensuring every person in the
United States has equitable access to
nature.
From its earliest days, OIA has
partnered with conservation organiza-
tions to advocate for our public land
and water. OIA helped to permanently
reauthorize the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, and they continue to
press for full funding. They have also
supported wildfire funding legislation,
rails-to-trails, and similar transpor-
tation infrastructure programs and
continue to work toward responsible
climate and energy policy. The organi-
zation also produces outdoor recreation
economy report that highlights the in-
fluence of the outdoor recreation sec-
tor on the national economy, including
statistics on consumer spending, tax
revenue, and job creation. This report
is an incredible resource for law-
makers, land managers, and local plan-
ners. As a result, over the past half
decade and following Colorado’s leader-
ship, States have created State offices
of outdoor recreation to ensure that
government leaders and business lead-
ers are working together to grow their
recreation economies.
I am honored to continue to work
with OIA to protect our public land and
water. Earlier this year, OIA an-
nounced their support for the Colorado
Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act,
S. 241/H.R. 823, our bill to protect
400,000 acres of public land in Colorado
while safeguarding existing outdoor
recreation opportunities. OIA stated
that they are ‘‘one hundred percent in
support of the Colorado Outdoor Recre-
ation and Economy Act because it
would protect nearly half a million
acres of public lands across Colorado
and support the state’s $28 billion out-
door recreation economy while hon-
oring its history in protecting Camp
Hale, the origin of the 10th mountain
division during WWII.’’ I appreciate
OIA’s support for conserving public
land in Colorado.
OIA members exemplify the collabo-
rative and altruistic stewardship at the
heart of the outdoor recreation indus-
try. For that, I congratulate OIA on
this 30-year anniversary and thank
them for their contributions to our
American outdoor heritage.∑

TRIBUTE TO ROBERT WILLIAMS
∑ Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today,
I am honored to recognize in the
RECORD Mr. Robert M. Williams, Jr.,
who recently retired after almost half
a century as editor and publisher of the
Blackshear Times in Blackshear, GA.
While he may be a small-town news-
paperman, Robert Williams is known
throughout south Georgia and across
much of our State because of his work
ethic, his devotion to the printed word,
and his dedication to the newspaper
business and what it means to a com-
munity. For more than 48 years, Rob-
ert has worked to be accurate, fair, and
to provide his readers with the news
that affects them and the community
they all cherish. He has personally
written more than 2,000 columns during
his career.
It is worth mentioning that the news-
paper’s motto, printed at the top of the
front page of the printed publication
and online, is one Robert has also
claimed as his own: ‘‘Liked by Many,
Cussed by Some, Read by Them All.’’
With the weekly newspaper also turn-
ing 150 years this year under Robert’s
leadership, both have long been widely
read.
At Just 20 years old, Robert began
his career at the Blackshear Times
after coming down to the community
from the University of Georgia in Ath-
ens, GA. He was brought in by two leg-
endary Georgians themselves, Roy
Chalker, Sr., and Wilkes Williams of
Waynesboro, to turn their investment
around. Turn it around he did, settling
well into the community at the same
time. A short 5 years later, Robert pur-
chased the Blackshear Times. Under
Robert’s leadership during the last 48
years, the newspaper has won hundreds
of awards in a variety of categories.
Robert and his wife Cheryl have both
loyally and successfully served not
only this publication, but the news-
paper industry as a whole. The
Blackshear Times is one of five news-
papers that Robert and Cheryl have
owned as part of their SouthFire News-
papers organization, which also in-
cludes the Alma Times, the Charlton
County Herald, the Telfair Enterprise,
and the Monroe County Reporter in
Georgia. Robert and Cheryl have both
served as president of the Georgia
Press Association, our State’s news-
paper industry advocacy organization.
Robert was also president of the 2,300-
member National Newspaper Associa-
tion in 2014, serving nationally as the
voice of small-town newspapers.
Locally, Robert Williams served two
terms on the Blackshear City Council
and served as executive director of
both the Pierce County Industrial De-
velopment Authority and the Pierce
County Chamber of Commerce. Robert
is also a graduate of the Leadership
Georgia program, an organization we
both hold dear and that has guided our
service to the State. Robert has found
countless ways to give back. Whether
it was as a member of the Georgia Ag-
riculture Exposition Authority that
governs the Georgia National Fair-
grounds in Perry or the local college
foundation board, Robert and Cheryl
have made an impact well beyond
Blackshear both professionally and
personally.
Last week, Robert announced the
sale of the Blackshear Times, bidding
farewell after one of the longest edi-
torial tenures in Georgia. With his
final column as editor and publisher,
Robert was incredibly gracious, thank-
ing his colleagues, employees, mentors,
and the fine bankers who gave him
those first loans.
I speak for all Georgians when I say
thank you to Robert and Cheryl for the
difference you have made in our State.
I count myself lucky to call you a
friend, and Dianne and I wish you both
the very best as you plan your future.∑

REMEMBERING CHRIS CLINE
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I can’t
express enough what Chris Cline meant
to our home State of West Virginia. He
represented the very best of the Moun-
tain State, which is saying a lot. Born
in McDowell County and raised a
stone’s throw from the train tracks in
the coalfields of Beckley, Chris’s fam-
ily was wealthy beyond measure in the

only currency that truly matters: love,
work ethic, and profound strength of
character.
One of my favorite stories about
Chris is, when he was a child, he filled
bags with dirt for his father, Paul, to
use for blasting holes at the mine. His
father paid him a penny per bag. It was
once the front porch caved in that his
father realized he had been getting the
dirt from beneath it. Chris said that
was how he learned the importance of
infrastructure.
He never lost touch with the days he
would come home from a shift in the
mines as a young man of only 15, his
face caked in coal dust. In fact, he kept
his first hard hat, battered from years
of hard labor, in a place of honor at his
home in Beckley. From this founda-
tion, he built an opportunity empire.
From the early days of Pioneer Fuel to
when Chris founded Foresight Energy,
much of the success he gained was re-
turned to the men and women who
keep the lights on. He treated his
workforce as family, knowing very well
what it was like to be in their shoes,
and so he invested in the safest, most
innovative, and efficient tools and
methods.
His coal enterprises took him from
Appalachia to Illinois to Canada. He of-
fered cash incentives to his miners, in-
stalled advanced and safe mining
equipment, and was ahead of his time
in anticipating the market for coal.
Chris believed it was not enough to be
innovative, you need a little luck. At
Foresight, his four mine complexes
were the most productive underground
operations in the Nation. He bought
docks on the Mississippi River and
built rail spurs to haul coal onto ships
bound for India, Europe, and Asia.
Chris understood opponents of burn-
ing coal while defending coal and his
role in supplying the world with it. He
believed that people deserved the
cheapest energy they could get. He had
a curious mind, was eager to learn
about everything, and never stopped
learning. As committed as he was to
coal energy, for his Big Grand Cay
property, he installed solar panels and
batteries. Where renewable energy
sources made sense, he was eager to
embrace them.
There is no greater accomplishment
in the world than to be in a position to
give back to the community you love,
that made you who you are. That is
what made Chris the wonderful, inspir-
ing, and generous person he was.
Through the Cline Family Foundation,
founded in 2009, Chris made a profound
impact on Marshal University and
West Virginia University. His legacy
will remain forever in the hearts of all
who had the privilege of knowing him,
and he will be remembered through the
countless lives he benefited with his
generosity to our academic institu-
tions. Chris believed with all his heart
that West Virginians are the most
hard-working, ethical people in our Na-
tion, and he wanted to ensure they had
every opportunity to utilize their skills
with the best possible resources to
build their lives from the ground up,
just as he did. His mission was for each
of his accomplishments to pave the
way for others to go even further than
he did.
Chris was generous with his philan-
thropy publicly through the Cline
Family Foundation, but most impor-
tantly, he was generous and compas-
sionate privately, almost daily. The
foundation focuses on donations
throughout West Virginia in recogni-
tion of the community’s contribution
to his success. It offers scholarships
and grants, endows universities, and fi-
nancially supports charitable organiza-
tions that make life better for children
and older youth. Chris once said that
everyone in West Virginia contributed
to his success, and he was determined
to repay the favor. He certainly did,
and our statewide community is better
for it.
Among other donations, the Cline
Family Foundation supported Place of
Hope, a foster care and adoption orga-
nization; Peacehaven Community
Farm, a home for disabled adults; or-
phanages in West Virginia and Haiti;
Save the Children; humanitarian aid
organizations in Tanzania; churches;
and the Raleigh County YMCA, among
other organizations, and many needy
individuals over the years. He also sup-
ported the Benjamin School from
which his daughter Kameron graduated
in 2015. Few people beyond the recipi-
ents know details of Mr. Cline’s many
and constant personal acts of private
charity.
Sharing his adventures with his four
children and his lifelong friends was his
absolute favorite way to spend his
time. He would take crowds of friends
and family to the Super Bowl, the Big
East Tournament, countless other
sporting events, and on his frequent
world travels. Chris was an adventure
junkie, always looking forward to the
next time he could drive a fast car or
ride a four-wheeler through the West
Virginia hills.
I can’t speak enough to what a good-
hearted, wonderful person he truly was.
I always thought of him as a man for
all seasons. No matter the cir-
cumstances, he kept a cool head and a
warm demeanor, always able to discern
the most honorable path forward. It
was an honor to call him my friend,
and I miss him dearly.
I join all West Virginians in extend-
ing my deepest condolences to his chil-
dren, Candice and her husband James,
Christopher, and Alex, for the loss of
their loving father and their sister,
Kameron. I also extend my condolences
to Chris’s brothers Greg and Kenneth.
It is my hope the entire Cline family is
able to find peace, strength, and sup-
port in one another.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself
and Mrs. MURRAY):
S. 2083. A bill to amend chapter 2205
of title 36, United States Code, to en-
sure pay equity for amateur athletes,
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise today to introduce the Athletics
Fair Pay Act of 2019 with my colleague
Senator MURRAY.
Women and girls have made great
strides in sports. Before Title IX of the
Civil Rights Act was passed 47 years
ago, athletic programs for girls and
young women were virtually non-
existent. Now, women are world class
athletes and compete in a wide range of
sports including soccer, basketball,
hockey, and tennis.
In the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de
Janeiro, a record 45 percent of the ath-
letes competing at the games were
women, and this year, the U.S. Wom-
en’s National Soccer Team won a his-
toric fourth FIFA Women’s World Cup
title. Despite the incredible advance-
ments made by women in sports, fe-
male athletes are paid significantly
less than their male counterparts and
are given fewer opportunities to suc-
ceed.
Sports organizations in the United
States still do not invest equally in
girls’ and women’s athletics. This lack
of investment means that many female
athletes never reach their full poten-
tial. In addition, studies show that
sports participation has a positive in-
fluence on girls’ academic perform-
ance, employment opportunities, and
their physical and mental health.
The inequities faced by female ath-
letes were highlighted in a wage dis-
crimination lawsuit recently filed by
the U.S. Women’s Soccer Team against
their employer, the U.S. Soccer Fed-
eration.
In addition to winning four FIFA
Women’s World Cup titles, the Wom-
en’s Soccer Team has won four Olym-
pic gold medals and has been ranked
number one by FIFA for 10 of the last
11 years. By contrast, the U.S. Men’s
Soccer Team failed to qualify for last
year’s World Cup and has not won an
Olympic medal since 1904. Yet, accord-
ing to the lawsuit filed by the Women’s
Team, the U.S. Soccer Federation pays
the women an average of 38 cents on
the dollar compared to the male play-
ers.
Unfortunately, the Women’s Soccer
Team is not alone. In 2017, the U.S.
Women’s Hockey Team received a pay
raise from its national governing body,
USA Hockey, only after the team
threatened to boycott a major competi-
tion.
Prior to the boycott, USA Hockey
did not pay female athletes at all in
non-Olympic years and paid each just
$6,000 in the year leading up to an
Olympic games.
It is clear that we must do more to
ensure that female athletes are paid
equally and treated with the respect
and dignity they deserve. This legisla-
tion gets us closer to that goal.
This legislation updates the Ted Ste-
vens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act
to mandate that the national gov-
erning bodies chartered under the Ted

Stevens Act pay female amateur ath-
letes fairly and equally.
This bill also requires national gov-
erning bodies to provide annual reports
to Congress on amateur athlete pay.
This new reporting requirement in-
creases accountability and allows Con-
gress to monitor whether the national
governing bodies are complying with
their equal pay obligations.
I am deeply disappointed that we
still need this kind of legislation in
2019. I am hopeful that the Senate will
take up, and pass, this important legis-
lation and show its support for women
around the country. As a United States
Senator, I will continue fighting for
fair pay and equality of treatment for
all women, including our nation’s ath-
letes.
I thank the president, and I yield the
floor.

CELEBRATING THE 200TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE VILLAGE OF
CALEDONIA
HON. JASON SMITH
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the Village of Caledonia in
Washington County, Mo. Caledonia was es-
tablished in 1819 when Alexander Craighead
named the village after his native Scotland
and built a home there that still stands today.
Caledonia is Latin for Scotland.
Caledonia was officially organized as an in-
corporated village on November 6, 1874 and
the first appointed mayor was Alexander C.
Relfe, son of Congressman James H. Relfe.
The little town was home to history in our
country’s expansion west of the Mississippi.
The first Presbyterian Church, the first Ma-
sonic Lodge, and the second Methodist
Church west of the river are all located in the
village. Its first two businesses were Tom
Sloan’s blacksmith and Fergus Sloan’s brew-
ery. Caledonia was also home to the Bellevue
Collegiate Institute that operated from 1864
until 1902. One of its first presidents, Willard
Duncan Vandiver, went on to become a U.S.
Congressman and is credited with coining the
phrase, ‘‘I’m from Missouri—you’ll have to
show me!’’
The Village of Caledonia was designated in
1984 by the Department of the Interior as a
Place of Historical Designation. Today, Cal-
edonia is a quaint little village of shops,
eateries and places to stay that has kept this
charming community of 130 people thriving in
the 21st century. It is my great pleasure to cel-
ebrate Caledonia today on the occasion of its
bicentennial birthday before the U.S. House of
Representatives.

IN HONOR OF MS. MAGGIE KATIE
BROWN-KIDD
HON. DAVID SCOTT
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of an
extraordinary Georgian, Ms. Maggie Katie
Brown-Kidd.
Ms. Kidd, the youngest of 12 children, was
born on December 8, 1904, to William and
Lucy Brown. While she spent much of her life
living and working on her family’s farm in
Oglethorpe County, Georgia, she was most re-
cently a resident of the city of Riverdale, Geor-
gia, which I have the honor of representing
here in Congress. She was the oldest living
resident of the State of Georgia, the oldest Af-
rican American person in the United States,
and the tenth oldest person in the world.
Ms. Kidd was a lifetime member of the
Frank Bailey Senior Center in Clayton County,
in which the recreation room has been dedi-
cated in her honor. She was deputized as an
honorary sheriff and served as the Grand Mar-
shall in the City of Riverdale’s 2017 Christmas
Parade. In March of this year, the Georgia
House of Representatives held a ceremony in
her honor to recognize and celebrate her 114
years of life.
Ms. Kidd witnessed a dramatic change in
the world over the course of her long life, and
through her selfless service to her family and
local community, she has made Riverdale and
the overall Georgia community a better place.
Ms. Kidd inspired many throughout her life
by sharing her kindness, wisdom, and concern
for her fellow citizens. We have lost an exam-
ple of moral integrity and unending love. It is
fitting and proper to reflect and commemorate
Ms. Kidd’s contribution to our community.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in
offering our sincerest condolences to Ms.
Kidd’s family and friends. She will be greatly
missed.
May God continue to bless the family of Ms.
Maggie Katie Brown-Kidd.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR.
ELOISE KAILIN
HON. DEREK KILMER
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I would like
to take a moment to commemorate the life of
Dr. Eloise Whittlesey Kailin—a champion of
public health, good governance, and environ-
mental issues who recently passed away on
June 1, 2019 at the age of 100.
Dr. Kailin was born in New London, Con-
necticut, but moved frequently during her fa-
ther’s career in the U.S. Coast Guard. From
the age of eleven, she expressed her desire to
become a physician, and that dream was real-
ized when she became one of the few women
accepted into the George Washington Univer-
sity Medical School class of 1943.
She married Harvey Kailin, Sr. in 1942, the
year before her graduation, and began her
distinguished medical career in Washington,
D.C. She became board certified in allergy
and immunology, served for over thirty years
as a writer and editor of medical abstracts for
the Journal of Allergy, and testified on Capitol
Hill for the Clean Air Act. After the family
moved to Maryland, Dr. Kailin developed a
friendship with Rachel Carson, author of the
seminal 1962 work about the impact of pes-
ticides on the food chain, Silent Spring. This
friendship likely strengthened Dr. Kailin’s com-
mitment to addressing environmental issues
both for the health of her patients and for peo-
ple throughout our country.
Dr. Kailin and her husband retired to
Sequim in 1971 based on her recollection of
‘‘Sunny Sequim’’ from high school years in Se-
attle in the 1930s. Living on the North Olympic
Peninsula, she saw the critical need to protect
its pristine beauty and spent nearly fifty years
in service to that cause.
Shortly after their arrival in Sequim, the
Kailins became involved in the fight against a
proposed nuclear power plant on the Miller
Peninsula east of Sequim, which led to the
founding of Protect the Peninsula’s Future
(PPF)—a nonprofit dedicated to the protection
of the North Olympic Peninsula. The opposi-
tion prevailed, and the site once considered
for that power plant is now a part of Miller Pe-
ninsula State Park. Dr. Kailin remained a
board member of the organization she helped
found until her passing.
Through PPF, Dr. Kailin was instrumental in
addressing countless environmental concerns.
Many believe one of their most significant
achievements was the fifteen-year court battle
with the city of Sequim over sewage treat-
ment. In 1998, that fight resulted in the con-
struction of a state-of-the-art water reclamation
facility which was expanded in 2010, nearly
doubling its capacity.
This centenarian was the recipient of many
awards including the Clallam County Commu-
nity Service Award, People for Puget Sound’s
Warren Magnuson Puget Marine Protection
Award, Washington Environmental Council’s
Environmental Heroes Award, and the Eleanor
Stopps Environmental Leadership Award. Be-
fore her passing, she was also recognized by
the City of Sequim.
I am humbled to speak in recognition of Dr.
Eloise Kailin—who is often referred to as the
‘‘matriarch of environmental activism’’ on the
North Olympic Peninsula. I join her children,
Harvey, David, and Janet, and the citizens of
our region’s beautiful peninsula in mourning
her passing, but also in recognizing that her
good work will contribute to the health and
well-being of the citizens in this gem of the
Northwest for generations to come.

RECOGNIZING THE ELLINGTON
WHIPPETS
HON. JASON SMITH

Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the Ellington High School
Whippets who made school history May 31,
2019 when they won the Class 2 Missouri
State Baseball Championship.
The team achieved its year-long goal as
they claimed their final victory of the season,
playing a nearly perfect game to shut out Sey-
mour with a score of 9–0. From a leadoff
ground-rule double to the final out of the
game, all of Ellington was behind the team.
The championship is the first ever for any
Southern Reynolds County High School team
in any sport. I applaud the Whippets for their
winning season record of 29 and 1.

ALZHEIMER’S AND BRAIN
AWARENESS MONTH RECOGNITION
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, we recog-
nize June as Alzheimer’s & Brain Awareness
Month. I rise today to honor Pennsylvania’s
11th Congressional District’s local advocates
with the Alzheimer’s Association with the
Greater Pennsylvania Chapter.
‘‘Never doubt that a small group of thought-
ful, committed citizens can change the world.
Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.’’
Madam Speaker, this quotation, often attrib-
uted to anthropologist Margaret Mead is befit-
ting of the local group of advocates with the
Alzheimer’s Association that my staff and I
have come to know during my time in office.
Mary Read, Linda & Mary Reheard, Sharon
Flory, Sandy Heisey, Joni Schenk, Frances
Gibbons, Candy Yingling, John and LuAnn
Goldfus—these are all dedicated individuals in
the community who advocate effectively on
behalf of nearly 50 million people across the
globe and 5 million Americans who are living
with Alzheimer’s and other dementias.
I’m proud to be a member of the bipartisan
Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer’s, a
co-sponsor of the legislation supported by the
caucus, and was pleased to walk with them to
raise awareness in our community and be-
yond.
I thank them for their service on behalf of
others and together with these individuals, one
day soon, we will hopefully have a world with-
out Alzheimer’s Disease.

HONORING THE AROMAS WATER
DISTRICT
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Aromas Water District as they
celebrate their 60th anniversary. For 60 years,
the Aromas Water District has dedicated itself
to the enrichment of our community on the
central coast of California by serving the water
needs of the greater Aromas area.
The Aromas Water District was established
on July 24, 1959 by a Resolution of the State
of California, Office of the Secretary of State.
It was formed as a County Water District and
ultimately became a California Multi-County
Special District. Originally there was one well,
one storage tank and a small distribution sys-
tem serving less than 150 parcels. In the past
60 years, the District has grown to serve our
expanding community and now serves ap-
proximately 3,000 people on over 900 parcels,
utilizing three wells, 35 miles of distribution
system, and nine storage sites with over
1,200,000 gallons of water storage and fire
protection.
The District is governed by an elected five-
member, at large, board of directors. Commu-
nity members serving on the Board of Direc-
tors of the Aromas Water District have helped
successfully usher in the latest improvements
in their treatment plants, like the removal of
iron and manganese from the water source.
The rigorous water testing is conducted under
the oversight of the State Water Resources
Control board and successfully meets all
health and safety standards.
I am proud to say that the District is contin-
ually striving to educate our community on the
benefits of water conservation and aquifer pro-
tection. One of the ways they accomplish this
goal is by maintaining a drought-tolerant dem-
onstration garden at the District’s office. Visi-
tors from the local community are shown how
drip irrigation reduces water loss and per-
meable gravel paths encourage groundwater
recharge and rain water catchment, all while
achieving this without the use of herbicides or
pesticides. This garden is in downtown Aro-
mas and is open and easily accessible to the
public year-round.
The District is proud to have consistently
served high-quality water to customers in both
Monterey and San Benito counties for the last
60 years, as well as moving forward into the
future. Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to
recognize the Aromas Water District for their
service to the Central Coast on the occasion
of their 60th Anniversary.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF GREENTREE CHRISTIAN
CHURCH
HON. JASON SMITH
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to celebrate the 150th anniversary
of Greentree Christian Church (GCC)—in
Rolla, Missouri. The church has grown from a
few to 2,000 members over the course of its
existence. It is a rare occasion for a church to
reach its sesquicentennial milestone and can
only happen when a church is unfaltering in
carrying out God’s work.
Although it was not yet called GCC, this
church took root in 1869, the same year Presi-
dent Ulysses S. Grant took office, and was lo-
cated on the farmland of Harvey and Charles
Drennon near Blues Lake. These men, along
with ‘‘Aunt Fanny’’ were the first members of
the church. Over the next 132 years, the
church, later known as First Christian Church,
met in several locations, most notably at the
corner of 8th and Main, which housed the
services for the better part of its history. Dur-
ing this time, the building was twice destroyed
by fire and once by tornado. Despite this, the
church persevered, rebuilding after each crisis
and continuing to grow.
In 1991, the church built a facility at 10th
and Greentree Road that housed Greentree
Learning and Childcare Center. A decade
later, construction was completed on a large
expansion of that facility, and the congregation
began meeting in what is now the church
gymnasium. In 2011, after another large ex-
pansion, the church began meeting in the
sanctuary, where it meets today, and was re-
named Greentree Christian Church.
Over the years, this church has seen many
pastors come and go. Current Senior Minister
Tim Cook has been there since 1982 and is
retiring this June. It seems fitting that the
church’s longest-serving minister would get to
witness this rare milestone. Mr. Cook, I con-
gratulate you on your upcoming retirement
and thank you and the members of your con-
gregation for your service to GCC, the Rolla
Community, and the whole church body at
large. It is my honor to acknowledge this his-
toric birthday today before the United States
House of Representatives.

HONORING CAPTAIN GREG
HANSEN
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
on behalf of Captain Greg Hansen, who has
given over four decades of altruistic and indis-
pensable service to the central coast of Cali-
fornia. Working as a firefighter in Aptos, Cali-
fornia from 1980, and acting as Fire Captain
for Aptos since 1990, Mr. Hansen has dem-
onstrated an outstanding commitment to public
safety over the course of his prolific career,
now ending with his retirement from Fire Cap-
tain position.
Since he began his career as a firefighter in
1977, Mr. Hansen has worked tirelessly to en-
sure public safety. Not only has Mr. Hansen
continued to respond to the public’s fire safety
issues with bravery and urgency, he has also
worked to better the community he serves
through education and outreach, such as his
provision of CPR training for middle school
students. Through this ability to combine effi-
cient public protection with significant public
engagement, he has fostered an admirable
commitment to public safety in his community
and effectively utilized his position as Fire
Captain to ensure the wellbeing of his neigh-
bors.
Throughout his career, Mr. Hansen’s out-
standing contributions have earned him many
accolades, including the VFW’s Firefighter of
the Year on three occasions, Man of the Year
from the Santa Cruz County Board of Super-
visors, California State Assembly, and Cali-
fornia State Senate on four occasions, and the
Congressional Award from the United States
Congress. He was also honored with the Na-
tional Gold Medal Award as EMT of the Year
for directly saving the life of an injured young
man.
Now, Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to
recognize the dedication and incredible serv-
ice of Greg Hansen. I ask my distinguished
colleagues to join in me in thanking him and
all that he has done for our community.

RECOGNIZING THE BICENTENNIAL
OF GREENVILLE, MO
HON. JASON SMITH
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the city of Greenville, Mis-
souri as it celebrates its 200th anniversary.
Greenville’s history can be traced as far back
as 1541 when the De Soto Expedition ex-
plored the upper reaches of the St. Francis
River. In 1819, the city was laid out by David
Logan and Elijah Bettis, Jr. in a cornfield in
the area known as Bettis Ford. Greenville is
the seat of Wayne County and was named for
the Ohio town where General Anthony Wayne
signed a treaty with Native Americans.
In the Civil War, the town was the scene of
the ‘‘Surprise on Greenville’’ when Confed-
erate soldiers captured the Union encamp-
ment and took away horses, guns and sup-
plies in 1862. In the decades since, Greenville
has grown as churches, schools and busi-
nesses were established and some of them
are still in operation today.
Floods and fires have forced the city to
band together to rebuild and it is that commu-
nity spirit that keeps Greenville thriving today.
It is my great pleasure to celebrate Green-
ville, Missouri as it begins its second century
today before the United States House of Rep-
resentatives.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE
WRIGHTSTOWN COMMUNITY
SCHOOL DIVISION
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate the Wrightstown Com-
munity School District for receiving recognition
as a Patriotic Employer by the Office of the
Secretary of Defense.
The Patriot Employer Award reflects the ef-
forts made to support deployed employees
through a wide-range of measures including
flexible schedules, family care, and granting
leaves of absence.
Wrightstown Superintendent of Schools,
Carla Buboltz, was recognized for supporting
newly-employed teacher, Logan Gruszynski,
during his deployment to the Middle East with
the National Guard. Community members in
Northeast Wisconsin have an incredible tradi-
tion of looking out for one another, and our
community is fortunate to have employers
such as Ms. Buboltz who recognize the sac-
rifices of service. I am confident that the
Wrightstown Community School District will
continue to thrive under her leadership.
I would also like to thank Logan Gruszynski
for his service with the National Guard. His
service took him away from his work and fam-
ily, he honorably represented his community
and the State of Wisconsin. As a dedicated
service member and teacher, Mr. Gruszynski
is a positive role model to us all.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in commending the efforts of
the Wrightstown Community School District
and thanking Mr. Gruszynski for his service to
our country.

Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Agricultural education plays a vital role in
shaping the future of the farming industry and

tions. Elizabeth, serving as agricultural educa-
tor at Green River High School, has mentored
and guided members of the Future Farmers of
America chapter there. This award recognizes
her hard work to foster leadership skills

late Elizabeth Withers on this national recogni-
tion, and thank her for all that she does to in-
spire the next generation of farmers.

HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL
NICHOLAS HALUPKA ON HIS RE-
TIREMENT FROM THE UNITED
STATES AIR FORCE
HON. MAC THORNBERRY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to thank Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas
Halupka for his outstanding contributions as a
United States Air Force officer for his more
than 22 years of service. In May 1997, he re-
ceived his Bachelor of Science from Auburn
University in Auburn, AL where the Auburn
University ‘‘Flying Tigers’’ Air Force Reserve
Officer Training Corps commissioned him into
the U.S. Air Force as a nuclear and missile
operations officer. He then joined the 10th
Missile Squadron at Malmstrom Air Force
Base leading some of America’s most impor-
tant strategic nuclear deterrence forces as a
missile combat crew commander. After ad-
vanced training in space operations, he
transitioned to a space operations officer and
was assigned as a defensive counterspace
flight commander at NORAD, the North Amer-
ican Air Defense Command, in Cheyenne
Mountain where he was in charge of pro-
tecting America by providing early missile
warning and space object detection.
Branching out, he was selected to deploy to
Afghanistan to set up a new training command
for the Afghan National Army. His efforts yield-
ed clear results with the Afghan Army meeting
their training requirements to fight the Taliban.
Returning to America, he took on the role of
director of operations for missile warning at
Beale Air Force Base, boosting U.S. and Al-
lied awareness of space by tracking nearly
two million space objects. He then took his ac-
cumulated knowledge to work as a space and
counter-space senior advisor and analyst em-
bedded with the State Department, where his
advice and analysis informed some of our na-
tion’s most important strategic foreign policy
decisions.
In his relentless pursuit of excellence, Lieu-
tenant Colonel Halupka dedicated his free
time to pursue additional educational opportu-
nities, earning a Master of Science in Busi-
ness Management in 2006, and a Master of
Arts in International and Security Studies in
2012 from the Naval Postgraduate School.
Lieutenant Colonel Halupka concluded his
career serving as a congressional liaison at
the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was during
this last assignment that I had the opportunity
to get to know Nick. His tireless efforts en-
sured members of the House Armed Services
Committee received timely and critical intel-
ligence that was crucial to informing law-
makers during both moments of crisis and ev-
eryday legislative operations. These efforts
supported the creation of many bills and en-
abled the passage of the National Defense
Authorization Act. I am personally thankful for
the time he has devoted to this task and the
vigor and professionalism with which he exe-
cuted it.
I thank Lieutenant Colonel Halupka for his
dedication in service to the security of our na-
tion. While many pursue careers in military,
Lieutenant Colonel Halupka viewed the mili-
tary not as a job, but a calling to service. He
is in the less than one percent who serve in
the nation’s military, and an even smaller per-
cent who give their full service until retirement.
The United States owe him a great debt of
gratitude.
Madam Speaker, I honor Nicholas A.
Halupka for his lifetime of public service. I ask
my colleagues to join me in wishing him a
happy retirement as we celebrate his legacy of
selfless service to the nation.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E888 July 10, 2019
Morrison is a Cape Cod native whose pas-
sion for giving back and heart for service led
him to an enlistment with the U.S. Marines for
four years before he returned to the Cape to
pursue a career in education. Once back in
Massachusetts, Morrison maintained a close
working relationship with the military, con-
tinuing to serve under the Army National
Guard’s Aviation branch during his tenure as
an assistant principal. In 2005 Morrison was
called to Iraq and Kuwait, where he would
serve nearly 18 months with the 3rd Battalion
126th Aviation Regiment.
While serving his country on a national
scale, Morrison also maintained a personal
connection with the student body of Dennis-
Yarmouth Regional High School, where he
served as assistant principal from 2001 until
his promotion to principal in 2017. A certified
social worker, Morrison’s 18 years with the
school have been defined by his ability to en-
gage freely and openly with his students, a
fact many of them have attested to. In his ten-
ure with the Massachusetts school system,
Morrison has truly gone above and beyond the
role of administrator by fostering a space
where his students can not only learn, but
truly grow.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the
retirement of George ‘‘Tony’’ Morrison and
offer my sincere gratitude for his dedication to
improving the lives of those in our community.
I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking
him for his service and wishing him all the
best in the years to come.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF MR. DAVE BARTHOLOMEW
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND
OF LOUISIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the life and legacy of Mr. Dave Bar-
tholomew, a legendary New Orleans musician,
who passed away on Sunday, June 23, 2019,
at the age of 100.
Mr. Bartholomew was born on December
24, 1918 in Edgard, Louisiana, the seat of St.
John the Baptist Parish. He was the son of a
jazz trumpet player, growing up in a musical
household, this led to Mr. Bartholomew learn-
ing how to play the tuba before moving on to
trumpet.
Mr. Bartholomew wore several hats in his
career including music producer, arranger, and
songwriter. He also served our nation’s Army
and played a key role as one of the architects
of rock ‘n’ roll and the unique soundscape that
defines New Orleans music today. His accom-
plishments throughout his career earned him
recognition from the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame, the Grammys, and the Songwriters Hall
of Fame.
It was Mr. Bartholomew’s work in the 1950’s
and 1960’s with Antoine ‘‘Fats’’ Domino that
served as his most celebrated of accolades.
Mr. Bartholomew’s impactful presence behind
the scenes helped create some of the biggest
records of this era including ‘‘Ain’t That a
Shame’’, ‘‘I’m Walkin’’, and ‘‘Let the Four
Winds Blow.’’
Mr. Bartholomew lived an extradentary life
that cannot be overstated. He was committed
to elevating others, perfecting his craft and
producing quality music. Mr. Bartholomew was
a musical trailblazer and his musical legacy
along with spirit will remain a guiding force for
all future musicians.
Mr. Bartholomew is survived by his wife,
Rhea Bartholomew. He also survived by his
five sons; Dave Jr., Don, Ron, Darrell, and
Alvin in addition to his three daughters; Debo-
rah, Diane, and Jacqueline, and grandchildren
and great-grandchildren.
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and
legacy of Mr. Dave Bartholomew.

IN CELEBRATION OF PASTOR SID-
NEY R. CRAWFORD’S 101ST
BIRTHDAY
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to extend my sincerest congratula-
tions and Happy Birthday wishes to an inspira-
tional leader and true man of God, Pastor Sid-
ney R. Crawford, who celebrated his 101st
birthday on Wednesday, June 6, 2019, with
his family and friends.
Sidney Richard Crawford was born on June
6, 1918, in Bonneau, South Carolina to the
union of the late Mr. William Henry and Mrs.
Mary Elizabeth ‘‘Lizzie’’ Hodge Crawford. He
graduated from Berkeley County High School
in 1937 and went on to attend college in
Spartanburg, South Carolina.
In 1941, he married the love of his life, Ms.
Iva Elizabeth ‘‘Betty’’ Harper, in Heath
Springs, South Carolina. That same year, he
responded to God’s call to preach the Gospel
of Jesus Christ, by becoming an ordained
Baptist Minister at Emanuel Baptist Church in
Summerville, South Carolina. He pastored
several churches in the Charleston and Sum-
merville areas until 1947, when he decided
that he wanted to serve not only his commu-
nity, but his country. That year, he enlisted in
the U.S. Army and honorably served his coun-
try for seven years. In 1954, he was called
back into the ministry to preach in Adamsville,
Alabama. Over the years, Pastor Crawford
successfully balanced the role of Pastor at
several churches in Alabama and Georgia
until 1970, when he decided to return to col-
lege to enhance his studies. His hard work
and dedication paid off in 1972, when he grad-
uated with a degree from Charleston Southern
University. But even with his newfound wealth
of knowledge, he continued pastoring in
churches and teaching at schools in South
Carolina.
George Washington Carver once said, ‘‘How
far you go in life depends on your being ten-
der with the young, compassionate with the
aged, sympathetic with the striving, and toler-
ant of the weak and strong because someday
in your life you will have been all of these.’’
Pastor Crawford has advanced far in life be-
cause he never forgot these lessons and al-
ways kept God first.
The race of life isn’t given to the swift or to
the strong, but to those who endure until the
end. Pastor Crawford has continued to run the
race of life with zeal and dignity and God has
blessed him over his lifetime.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
U.S. House of Representatives to join my wife,
Vivian, and me, along with the almost 730,000
people of Georgia’s Second Congressional
District, in honoring an outstanding citizen and
man of God, Pastor Sidney R. Crawford, for a
lifetime of selfless service to God, the church,
and to humankind. We extend our best wishes

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
BERNARD ‘‘GENE’’ HELMICK
HON. TIM RYAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Bernard ‘‘Gene’’ Helmick, 78,
who passed away on Sunday, June 2, 2019,
at Mercy Health St. Joseph’s Warren Hospital.
Gene was born on November 4, 1940 in
Cowen, West Virginia, and was a 1960 grad-
uate of Niles McKinley High School, where he
played football under Coach Tony Mason,
whom he greatly admired. Gene then went on
to attend and play football at Arizona State
University.
He later returned to the Valley where he
was employed at the General Motors
Lordstown plant as a waste water treatment
technician for 41 years, retiring in December
of 2006. Gene was a member of Our Lady of
Mount Carmel Parish in Niles, where he was
a pizza sale and festival volunteer. He was
also a member of the Niles Jaycees, Niles Re-
bounders and Frontliners.
Gene was known to enjoy yard work, home
repairs, and attending his grandchildren’s
sporting events and theatrical performances.
He was also a dedicated Ohio State and Duke
basketball fan.
Memories of Gene will be carried on by his
wife, Jennie Nardo Helmick, whom he married
Oct. 26, 1963; his son, Kevin T. Helmick and
his wife, Regina of Niles; his daughter, Gina
Price of Girard; his brother, David L. Helmick
and his wife, Joan of Cleveland; and his three
grandchildren, Makenzie and Matthew Price,
and Kasen Helmick.
Gene was a quiet, gentle man who loved
his family with peaceful and unwavering devo-
tion. We were raised in the same small-town
community of Niles, Ohio, and he and his fam-
ily are lifelong friends of mine. We were all
very lucky to have him in our lives and, as
much as he will be missed by us all, Gene will
remain with us every day.

CARVER SENIOR CENTER IN
GARLAND, TX
HON. COLIN Z. ALLRED
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, I congratu-
late the people of Garland on the re-opening
of the Carver Senior Center. This building has
been a pillar of the community for decades,
and I commend the City of Garland and
Carver Alumni Programs and Services for in-
vesting in this facility and keeping its legacy
alive.
This building holds historical significance for
the City of Garland, as it previously served Af-
rican-American students as the George Wash-
ington Carver School for Negroes before Gar-
land schools desegregated. Throughout that
time, the building also served as a cultural
center for Garland’s African American commu-
nity.
I commend the alumni of the Carver School,
the City of Garland, and community leaders
who, through a partnership with the Council of
Governments, the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development, and the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, were able to secure fed-
eral funds to renovate the facility and fight to
keep the center open for the seniors that
needed it.
The center will now be able to provide
recreation, wellness check-ups, nutrition pro-
grams, and companionship for low-income
senior citizens in Garland. l thank everyone
who came together to ensure this building
could continue to serve our community. They
represent the best of Texas.

HONORING TIM FLOYD
HON. JOE WILSON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, during the unrest and riots in Haiti in
June, Tim Floyd, International Peace Artist
from South Carolina, presented a
PeacePainting to the Musée du Panthéon Na-
tional Haı̈tien in Port-au-Prince. Haiti is the
first country in the world to receive a
PeacePainting.
Over the next several years, Floyd will paint
a series of 195 paintings to gift to each coun-
try in the world. The art is called
PeacePaintings195. Each piece is a two foot
by two foot wood panel. The mixed media
work uses acrylics, oil, and encaustics. Each
painting is meditative using only muted colors
with low contrast.
Floyd wants to spread peace with art be-
cause the language of art breaks all barriers.
The goal is to spark conversations about
peace. And through these conversations, ac-
tions. And through those actions, peace.
Bonds of peace create unity between friends.
Bonds of peace have kept communities to-
gether. Bonds of peace have caused countries
to be allies.
Floyd studied art at the University of South
Carolina. His paintings hang in homes and
corporate headquarters across America as
well as Germany, England and Italy. Art is his
way of leaving bread crumbs of the journey of
life to hopefully bring pleasure, encourage-
ment and beauty to fellow travelers who are
also passing through.

HONORING THE FRENCH LAUNDRY
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize The French
Laundry for providing 25 years of exceptional
service and world-class cuisine to residents
and visitors of Napa Valley, California and to
honor the restaurant for its commitment to ex-
cellence for every dish prepared and every
guest served.
Owner and Chef Thomas Keller began ex-
ploring his love of food cooking in restaurants
in Florida and New York. He then honed his
skills and talents at Michelin-starred res-
taurants in France. Chef Keller had dreamed
of opening a destination restaurant special-
izing in French Cuisine in the Napa Valley and
chose the historic two-story cottage in
Yountville to open the French Laundry in
1994. The building dates from 1900 and is in
the National Register of Historic Places, just
one of the reasons the building is known lo-
cally and world-wide. Within several months of
its opening, the restaurant’s delectable cuisine
and exquisite service was being recognized by
publications such as the San Francisco Chron-
icle.
The French Laundry has received numerous
hard-earned and well-deserved honors over
the past 25 years. It was named the ‘‘Best
Restaurant in the World’’ by Restaurant Maga-
zine in both 2003 and 2004, earned the pres-
tigious ‘‘Outstanding Restaurant Award’’ from
the James Beard Foundation in 2007, and has
received three stars, the highest possible rat-
ing, from the Michelin Guide every year since
2007. The French Laundry has also earned
the Wine Spectator’s Grand Award every year
since 2007 and was inducted into the Culinary
Hall of Fame in 2012. The French Laundry
has become a world-renowned culinary des-
tination and its international accolades high-
light Napa Valley’s outstanding culinary com-
munity.
Chef Keller is a revered internationally
known chef and the only American born chef
to earn multiple three-star ratings from the
Michelin Guide. He has also received The Cul-
inary Institute of America’s ‘‘Chef of the Year’’
Award, the James Beard Foundation’s ‘‘Out-
standing Chef’’ and ‘‘Outstanding Res-
taurateur’’ Awards, and has been designated a
Chevalier of The French Legion of Honor. For
his menus he uses the finest fresh ingredients
and wine from our community, bringing atten-
tion to the Napa Valley’s agricultural heritage.
Madam Speaker, The French Laundry is an
important restaurant and institution in our com-
munity that is committed to providing the best
food and service to their guests. It is therefore
fitting and proper that we honor The French
Laundry on its 25th anniversary.

HON. TED BUDD
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Business High Point—Chamber of
Commerce on their 100th year anniversary.
In 1919, a small group of volunteers found-
ed the High Point Chamber of Commerce to
improve the community and foster long-term
economic growth.
As High Point has grown and changed, so
has its Chamber of Commerce. Today, its
membership includes over 950 businesses
representing a plethora of economic industries
across Guilford County and beyond. Addition-
ally, there are now hundreds of volunteers and
nine staff members eager to create positive
change for their community.
Daily, this Chamber works in honor of its
mission to, ‘‘initiate, inspire, and accelerate the
kind of change that propels its members to
success and its community to prominence.’’ I
applaud the Chamber, its members, volun-
teers and staff for working hard to improve our
community and strengthen partnerships.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
honoring the 100th anniversary of Business
High Point—Chamber of Commerce.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF
CAPTAIN THOMAS KENNEY
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the life of Captain Thomas
Kenney, a resident of Hyannis, Massachusetts
and dedicated firefighter of more than 36
years.
Thomas was born in Boston and began a
lifetime of public service working with the Bos-
ton Ambulance Squad, in addition to serving
as an EMT and paramedic with Boston EMS.
Upon graduating from Boston City Hospital, he
moved to the Cape and began his career with
the Hyannis Fire Department.
His commitment to serving and protecting
his community led him to the admirable posi-
tion of rescue team manager for the newly
formed Massachusetts Task Force I, Urban
Search & Rescue. Under this role, Thomas
was deployed to the 1996 Atlanta Summer
Olympics, the 1999 Worcester Cold Storage
fire, and more. On September 11, 2001, he
and his team bravely answered the call to
serve as Ground Zero responders only five
hours after the first attack took place.
Thomas’ deep-seated love of giving back
led him to the field of education, where he
found opportunities to teach the skills that car-
ried him throughout his career. He would go
on to become a nationally recognized instruc-
tor with Heavy Rescue Incorporated, in addi-
tion to teaching EMS and fire rescue both at
home in Hyannis and on the road.
Tragically, Thomas passed away on June 5,
2019. His devotion will live on through both

IN MEMORY OF MR. JAMES A.
‘‘BUD’’ CODY, SR.
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to a
dedicated leader and true champion for the
law enforcement community, Mr. James A.
‘‘Bud’’ Cody, Sr. Sadly, Bud passed away on
Thursday, June 13, 2019. A public memorial
celebrating his life and legacy will be held on
Saturday, July 13, 2019, at 2 p.m. at the
Georgia Public Safety Training Center in
Forsyth, Georgia.
James A. ‘‘Bud’’ Cody, Sr. was born on No-
vember 27, 1938, in Willacoochee, Georgia to
the union of the late Homer and Mellie Cody.
At a young age, he was destined to be a part
of something greater than himself. While at-
tending Valdosta High School, he was a mem-
ber of the school’s famed football program and
state winning 4x4 track relay team. At the age
of 18, he began working full-time at the Boys
Club in Valdosta, and it was then that Bud re-
alized his passion for helping underprivileged
youth reach their full potential. As a full-time
father and husband, Bud attended night class-
es at Valdosta State College and in 1961, he
graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree
in Sociology and Social Work. Upon his grad-
uation, the Boys Club relocated him to Texas
where he was instrumental in the establish-
ment of several Boys Club facilities across
Louisiana, Texas, and New Mexico.
Bud discovered his second passion for serv-
ing the Office of Sheriff through improving law
enforcement and training in 1966 when the
Georgia Sheriffs’ Association {GSA) hired him
to serve as their first Executive Director. That
same year, he began his tenure as the Direc-
tor of the Georgia Sheriffs’ Youth Homes’
Boys Ranch in Hahira, Georgia and as the
Treasurer for the Sheriffs’ Retirement Fund of
Georgia {SRFG). He actively served in all
three roles until his retirement in September of
2012. During his 46-year tenure as the Execu-
tive Director of the Georgia Sheriffs’ Associa-
tion, he was sought after by several Georgia
governors {ranging from Governor Sanders to
Governor Perdue) for his advice and counsel
on matters relating to improving law enforce-
ment throughout the state.
Bud’s impact on the law enforcement com-
munity expanded in 1978, when he joined his
friend and business partner, Claude Grizzard,
to form the company, Computer Fund Raising
{CFR), which provided financial assistance to
millions of officers and youth in over 30 states.
In 1980, in an effort to nationally protect and
preserve the Office of Sheriff, Bud worked with
Bobby Timmons of the Alabama Sheriffs’ As-
sociation to form the National Sheriff’s Asso-
ciation Committee of Presidents and Executive
Directors. In 1982, Bud used his position as
Treasurer of the SRFG to assume control of
the Fund’s $9 million in assets and helped in-
crease it to its current total of $97 million, to
ensure that those who gave their lives to pro-
tect and serve receive retirement funds. Bud
took his passion one step further in 1990
when he worked with state leaders, criminal
justice practitioners, and Sheriffs to establish
the Georgia Public Safety Training Center in
Forsyth, Georgia, a world-class public safety
training facility that trains more than 2,000 stu-
dents daily. He also helped create safe ha-
vens and educational opportunities for thou-
sands of Georgia’s youth by overseeing the
development of youth homes in Cherokee Es-
tate, Pineland, Herrington, Homestead, and
Mountain View, Georgia. Additionally, in 1995,
he and the GSA created the Georgia Sheriffs’
Youth Homes Foundation, which currently
holds $15 million in assets for their on-going
youth homes.
Bud accomplished much in his life; but,
none of it would have been possible without
the Grace of God and the love and support of
his family—including his children, James, Jr.,
Derek, Camille, Amy, and Celena {deceased);
his twelve grandchildren; and his four great-
grandchildren. Maya Angelou once said, ‘‘A
great soul serves everyone all the time. A
great soul never dies.’’ Bud is undoubtedly
great because of his selfless service, devotion
to his work, and the compassion he showed
for his friends and loved ones. Bud’s impres-
sion on this earth extends beyond himself to
the very well-being of the communities in
which he lived and served.
Madam Speaker, my wife, Vivian, and I,
along with the almost 730,000 people in Geor-
gia’s Second Congressional District, salute Mr.
James A. ‘‘Bud’’ Cody, Sr. for an outstanding
career within law enforcement and his lifelong
dedication to serving his community. I ask my
colleagues in the House of Representatives to
join us in extending our deepest sympathies to
Bud’s family, friends, and loved ones during
this difficult time. We pray that they will be
consoled and comforted by an abiding faith
and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and
months ahead.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE AMER-
ICAN LEGION SULLIVAN–WALLEN
POST 11’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor American Legion Sullivan–
Wallen Post 11 as its members celebrate the
100th Anniversary of their charter in Green
Bay, Wisconsin.
Post 11 was founded in July of 1919 as a
patriotic veterans organization dedicated to
supporting America’s service members and
veterans. The Post was named after veterans
Francis Sullivan and Earl Wallen. Francis Sul-
livan, who grew up in Green Bay, died serving
in France during WWI. Earl Wallen of
Pensaukee, Wisconsin served in WWII on the
USS California, during the attack on Pearl
Harbor. Wallen, a Marine private first class,
was killed after he volunteered to climb up to
the battleship’s crow’s nest to fire a machine
gun at attacking Japanese planes. The leg-
acies of Sullivan and Wallen continue to be
taught and honored by Post 11.
Post 11 also has close ties to the Green
Bay Packers. In the 1920s, Post 11 became a
beneficiary of the Packers in the event the
team was relocated or sold. Post 11 is also
the only permanent color guard in the NFL.
The Post presents the colors before every
home Packer game, a tradition dating back to
the 1940s.
Post 11 is one of the largest American Le-
gion posts in the area with over 600 members.
The Post organizes fundraising events to sup-
port veteran programs, such as their annual
Booyah Bash, a community favorite. The Post
hosts youth programs including a marksman-
ship program to learn rifle safety, a Christmas
party, and an Easter egg hunt. The Post also
sponsors high school students to attend Badg-
er Boys State.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in thanking Post 11 for its 100
years of support of service members, vet-
erans, and the Green Bay community.

HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO

Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is my
privilege to rise today to pay tribute to an out-
standing member of our community and a
dear friend as he retires after years of dedi-
cated service to the New Haven Police De-
partment—Assistant Chief Luiz Casanova. As-
sistant Chief Casanova has dedicated a life-
time to public service and his presence at the
Department will most certainly be missed.
In a career that has spanned decades, As-
sistant Chief Casanova has demonstrated a
unique commitment to public service and law
enforcement. He began his career at the State
of Connecticut Department of Corrections and
it was there where he says he first learned
that the prison system was broken. It was also
from his experience with the Department of
Corrections that he found his true calling. He
wanted to make a difference about the way
people in his neighborhood were being treated
by law enforcement, so he chose to try to
make the change from inside the organization.
Upon joining the New Haven Police Depart-
ment, he rose through the ranks, dedicating
himself to the community policing concept and
finishing his career as Assistant Chief.
Too often we take for granted the incredible
work of our law enforcement officials. I have
always held a deep admiration for our commu-
nity’s police officers—each day facing new

challenges and seemingly overwhelming re-

bravery, compassion, and generosity to serve
as a police officer and a great dedication to
serve in the Department leadership. I want to
extend a special note of thanks to Assistant
Chief Casanova for his friendship over the
years and for all of the help and guidance he
has provided to myself and my staff. He has
always been only a phone call away and has
been a tremendous resource to us as we

our children, our families, and our community.

gins this new life chapter, I wish him all the

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, the following thoughtful obituary was
published on July 3, 2019:
Sue Kolakoski Harlow passed away peace-
fully surrounded by her husband, children,
and sisters on July 2, 2019 in Fairfax, Vir-
ginia. She was preceded in death by her
mother Jane Kolakoski and her father
Charles Kolakoski. Sue passed on the tenth
anniversary of her father’s death and joins
both of her parents in heaven.
Sue is survived by her beloved husband;
Bryce (Larry) Harlow, two children, Sandy
Harlow and Bryce Harlow II, four grand-
children, Elizabeth Miller, Josh Harlow,
Katie Harlow and Nate Harlow, one great
grandchild, Lily Chichester and four sisters,
Paula Lassiter, Doris Deering-Kjellevold,
Mary Lewis and Janet Kolakoski.
Born on September 9, 1949 in Washington,
DC, Sue was raised in Arlington, VA. A life-
long teacher, Sue specialized in elementary
aged children with learning disabilities at
Stenwood Elementary in Dunn Loring before
moving on to Freedom Hill Elementary in
Vienna. Earlier, she worked at Tuckahoe El-
ementary in Arlington. A teacher for more
than twenty years, her love of children was
boundless.
Sue and her husband Larry were married
for nearly fifty-two years having been wed
on August 28, 1967 at Saint Agnes Catholic
Church in Arlington, VA. Sue and Larry met
at Yorktown High School. Following their
marriage, they moved to Norfolk, VA while
Larry attended college, but returned to Ar-
lington in 1969 when Sue went to work for
Senator Gurney. In 1971, they moved to Den-
ver, CO before returning to Virginia in 1976.
Sue and Larry raised their two children,
Sandy and Bryce, in Arlington and Vienna
before moving to their current home in
McLean.
Sue loved life and all that came along with
it. She had a deep appreciation for her gar-
den and loved her multitude of flowers sur-
rounding their home. Sue had an extreme
love for Mexican food and a good margarita.
She loved animals, particularly the kittens
she raised over the years. Virginia Beach was
Sue’s second home with her love of the ocean
and the sea air. But in particular, she had a
lasting love for her family and selflessly
sought to enrich their lives on a daily basis.
She tolerated her family’s obsession with
Washington sports and became a fan herself.
She immersed herself in every aspect of life
and the members of her family are better be-
cause of her.
Services will be held on Thursday, July 11
at 10:30 AM at Saint Agnes Church, 2024
North Randolph St. Arlington, VA 22207. In
lieu of flowers the family would like you to
dote on your pets, hug your family, and raise
a glass to Sue.

IN MEMORY OF MR. HILTON R.
SEGLER
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor a dedicated public servant
and dear friend of longstanding, Mr. Hilton R.
Segler. Sadly, Hilton passed away on July 4,
2019, at the age of 82. His passing marks the
close of a long and prolific life, and his depar-
ture leaves a void in the hearts of many Geor-
gians. He leaves behind an impeccable legacy
of service that will never be forgotten. A fu-
neral service was held on Saturday, July 6,
2019, at 11 a.m. at Kimbrell-Stern Funeral Di-
rectors in Albany, Georgia.
Mr. Hilton Ray Segler was born in Ozark,
Alabama, on April 26, 1937, to the union of
the late Mr. William Foy and Mrs. Willie Clyde
(Dunn) Segler. In 1948, his family moved to
Albany, Georgia, where he went on to grad-
uate from Albany High School and pursue
several correspondence degrees in Law and
Business.
In 1957, Hilton started working for South-
eastern Liquid Fertilizer in Albany, Georgia,
before serving as the Assistant to the Presi-
dent of Planters Chemical Company in Vir-
ginia. He then moved back to Albany in 1964
to work for the Thompson/Hayward Chemical
Company and was appointed Regional Man-
ager for the company in 1981. Hilton also has
served as a salesman for the TIDA Farm
Service Center where his sales exceeded $1.5
million in his first year and $3 million in his
second year, thus proving his acuity as a
salesman. In the early 1990s, he purchased a
pecan farm and farmed over 1,900 acres of
pecan trees for almost six years. He later
started a nickel nutrient supplement company,
Nipan, LLC, in 2003. Products from his com-
pany have gained tremendous popularity in
the last few years and are shipped all over the
United States.
In 2002, Hilton, along with Bucky Geer and
James Lee Adams, testified before the Risk
Management Agency on behalf of pecan
growers. His undying efforts helped pecan
growers across the United States attain crop
insurance. Hilton also testified before the
House and Senate Committees on Agriculture
in an effort to obtain larger provisions for the
pecan industry in the 2008 Farm bill. Con-
sequently, pecans were included in the Coun-
try of Origin labeling requirements and also in
the crop insurance program.
Hilton continued to work on expanding
pecan exports to China and other agricultural
economies, by partnering with the United
States Department of Agriculture and Georgia
Department of Agriculture, and pushing for
pecan farmers’ participation in the Market Ac-
cess program, a program that helps finance
promotional activities for U.S. agricultural
products.
In 2004, Hilton championed efforts to obtain
‘‘clean up’’ assistance for pecan farmers who
were hurt by hurricanes that devastated parts
of Georgia and Alabama. In 2010, he testified
before the House Agriculture Committee on
the future of the pecan industry and the impor-
tance of nutrition and trade to this industry, for
the 2010 Farm bill.
Hilton accomplished much throughout his
life, but none of this would have been possible
without his enduring faith in God and the love
and support of his wife, Faye; his children,
Rhonda, Scott, and Jamie; and a host of fam-
ily and friends who will miss him deeply.
On a personal note, Hilton was my friend. I
will miss his sage advice and wise counsel.
He never told me what I wanted to hear; he
always told me what I needed to hear. The
state of Georgia and our Nation have been
truly blessed to benefit from Hilton’s leader-
ship and advocacy.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the almost
730,000 people in Georgia’s Second Congres-
sional District and countless others across
America in paying tribute to Mr. Hilton R.
Segler for a life well lived and in extending our
deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and
loved ones during this difficult time of bereave-
ment. Moreover, we pray that they will be con-
soled and comforted by an abiding faith and
the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months
ahead.

Selinsgrove for the first time as a 16-year-old
high school exchange student from the
Ukraine. Upon his arrival, Alexander knew no
one, had no family to accompany him but in
spirit, and spoke very little English. But as
Alex stood at the beginning of a journey that
would eventually bring him to raising his right
hand today in allegiance to our nation, he held
with him what our nation’s earliest settlers had
established and would take him toward a
brighter and better future: the promise of
America.
Alexander readily adapted to American life
by forging new friendships in Central Pennsyl-
vania and joining several groups in his school:
the soccer and baseball teams, chess club,
and the school band, to name a few. He
worked tirelessly to improve his English, stud-
ied hard, frequently offered a unique perspec-
tive on world events to his classmates, and
was always willing to offer a helping hand to
a friend in need. To this day, he continues his
close friendship with his host father in the
United States, George Kinney.

Upon his graduation from high school, Alex-
ander attended Susquehanna University and
earned a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Fi-
nance and Information Systems in 2005. He
worked full-time after college and attended
Drexel University’s LeBow College of Business
at night. In 2011, he received a Master’s of
Business Administration in Investment Man-
agement and International Business. In July
2015, Alex obtained his green card and mar-
ried his wife, Erin, later that same year in Oc-
tober. They currently reside in Selinsgrove
with their three adopted cats and are currently
restoring one of the town’s historic properties
on Market Street.
Today, Alexander remains a selfless mem-
ber of his community. He previously served as
a volunteer firefighter, takes part in 5k races
and soccer games to raise money for chari-
table causes, and frequently participates in
volunteer opportunities through his employer,
Prudential Financial. He is also an avid fan of
the Philadelphia Eagles, Flyers, and Phillies.
Madam Speaker, if today we were tasked
with finding some living proof that dem-
onstrates how alive and well the promise of
America is today, I would respectfully ref-
erence this invitation to congratulate Alex-
ander V. Mitrenko on becoming a citizen of

RECOGNIZING THE METROPOLITAN
AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL
CHURCH
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing the Metropolitan African
Methodist Episcopal Church for its many con-
tributions to the District of Columbia. Metro-
politan, also known as the National Cathedral
of African Methodism, was founded in 1838
and has been a leading spiritual and commu-
nity resource ever since.
On July 2, 2019, Metropolitan held a well-at-
tended and informative community meeting on
D.C. statehood. This meeting at the church
was an act of leadership in keeping with its
long tradition of deep involvement not only
with its members but also with the District.
Metropolitan began as two separate church-
es, Israel Bethel AME and Union Bethel AME.
In 1838, these two churches came together.
The combined churches received an official
sanction from the Baltimore Conference of the
African Methodist Episcopal Church on July 6,
1838.
The church retained the name Union Bethel
until 1870 when the Baltimore Conference
designated a new church name and the con-
struction of a new ‘‘Metropolitan African Meth-
odist Episcopal Church.’’ Along with the new
designation, the Baltimore Conference at-
tached two key conditions—the first was that
the church needed to be located near the
Capitol and White House, and the second was
that each Annual Conference of AME church-
es was called upon to donate money for the
construction of the Metropolitan African Meth-
odist Episcopal Church. To represent the grati-
tude of the congregation, the church was built
with stained glass windows for each contrib-
uting Annual Conference.
The church has done pathbreaking work
over the years, from hiding enslaved Africans
in the 19th century, to educating community
members about AIDS and voting rights. Metro-
politan is not only a leading place of worship
but also a community resource, promoting in-
tellectual and political achievement through
the Bethel Literary and Historical Society since
1850. Metropolitan has opened its doors to
many prominent visitors such as Barack
Obama, Fredrick Douglass and Eleanor Roo-
sevelt.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing the Metropolitan African
Methodist Episcopal Church for its 180-year
history of contributions to its members and to
the District of Columbia for its leadership and
for encouraging discussion of the Washington,
D.C. Admission Act, which would make D.C.
the 51st state.

HONORING THE WORLD WAR II,
KOREAN WAR, AND VIETNAM
WAR VETERANS OF ILLINOIS
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the World War II, Korean War, and Viet-
nam War veterans who traveled to Wash-
ington, D.C. on June 5, 2019 with Honor Flight
Chicago, a program that provides World War
II, Korean War, and Vietnam War veterans the
opportunity to visit their memorials on The Na-
tional Mall in Washington, D.C. These memo-
rials were built to honor their courage and
service to their country.
The American Veteran is one of our great-
est treasures. The Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors,
Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled
here on July 10th answered our nation’s call
to service during several of its greatest times
of need. Across the world, these brave Ameri-
cans risked life and limb, gave service and
sacrificed much, all while embodying what it is
to be a hero. We owe them more gratitude
than can ever be expressed.
I welcome these brave veterans to Wash-
ington and to their memorials. I am proud to
inclue in the RECORD the names of these men
and women for all to see, hear, and recognize,
and I call on my colleagues to rise and join
me in expressing gratitude:

HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Don Schimmels of Luxemburg,
Wisconsin on celebrating his 100th birthday.
Born on July 10, 1919, Don grew up in Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin and graduated from
Messmer High School in 1938. He enlisted in
the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1940 and special-
ized as a mechanic, repairing aircraft such as
fighter jets, P39s and P40s, and bombers.
During his service, Don was stationed on
Canton Island in the South Pacific Ocean for
nine months. Used by the U.S. military as a
refueling stop for combat aircraft travelling
from Hawaii, the Island played a crucial role in
supporting U.S. air forces during WWII. Don
was on the Island during the pivotal Gilbert
and Marshall Islands campaign that took place
from November 1943 through February 1944.
After serving for five years, Don was dis-
charged in 1945. He used the GI Bill to earn
degrees in literature and history. He later

earned a master’s degree in library science
from Marquette University. Upon graduation
from Marquette in 1951, he taught first at the
Northwestern Military and Naval Academy in
Lake Geneva and then Pius XI High School in
Milwaukee.
In 1954 he began a 30-year career at Lux-
emburg-Casco High School. That same year
he met his wife, Myra. The couple has been
married for over 63 years. Don and Myra have
three children, Joe, Teri, and Peggy. They are
also proud grandparents to many grand-
children and a great-grandchild.
Don continuously gives back to others and
serves his community. He teaches religious
education courses to high school students
every Wednesday at St. Mary Parish in Lux-
emburg. He is also a member of American Le-
gion Post 262 in Luxemburg and VFW Post
3392 in Kewaunee.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in applauding Don Schimmels
for his service and wishing him a happy and
healthy 100th birthday.
f
IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINING OUR
SHIPPING INDUSTRIAL BASE
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 10, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to highlight the ongoing challenges fac-
ing our domestic industrial base, specifically
the shipbuilding industry, and I want to urge
my colleagues to consider the tough realities
facing our nation and its ability to produce
ships for both military missions and commer-
cial applications in the future.
One of the key points of contention between
Republicans and Democrats on the NDAA
concerns the authorization level or topline for
this legislation in Fiscal Year 2020. I want to
highlight the state of the shipbuilding industrial
base as a case study for an increased top-
line.
We currently have 290 deployable battle
force ships in our Navy, with a plan to get us
to 355 ships as soon as possible. This was
codified by the SHIPS Act that I sponsored in
2017 with Sen. WICKER which was included in
that year’s National Defense Authorization Act.
Consider that, over time, our national capac-
ity to build ships has continued to decline and
the remaining shipyards and suppliers are in-
creasingly at risk. We have lost dozens of
shipyards and tens of thousands of suppliers
over the last 15 years, which makes it even
more compelling that we do all we can to sup-
port the shipyards and suppliers that remain.
In 2018, in response to a Presidential Exec-
utive Order, the Department of Defense sub-
mitted a report entitled ‘‘Assessing and
Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense
Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency
of the United States’’.
Quoting from the report, ‘‘The shipbuilding
industrial base is a national asset and abso-
lutely vital to America’s ability to build and
sustain the Naval fleet. The Navy is focused
on improving the health of the industrial base
to meet its requirement of a 355 ship fleet with
a long range plan anchored by industrial sta-
bility. The analysis performed in response to
the Executive Order identified five underlying
risks: dependency on single/sole source sup-
pliers, capacity shortfalls, lack of competition,
lack of workforce skills, and unstable de-
mand.’’
So you can see, Madam Speaker, that there
are clearly significant challenges facing our
Navy and our nation’s ability to produce war-
ships in the future. Single/sole source sup-
pliers, capacity shortfalls, loss of competition,
lack of workforce skills and unpredictable de-
mand are all hampering our nation’s ability to
build its future fleet. This is not a new issue
but I’m afraid that the problems confronting
our industrial base are only getting worse.
So what has Congress done and what
should be done going forward?
We have made significant investments
throughout our Navy’s future fleet, including
funds for our aircraft carrier fleet and a single
contract awarded earlier this year for procure-
ment of both CVN 80 and CVN 81, the 3rd
and 4th Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers.
I’m proud to have led the effort in this House
to provide the necessary authorization for this
contract to be awarded—this contract will save
$4 billion compared to buying these ships indi-
vidually and sends exactly the right message
to all involved that we are serious about build-
ing more ships in this country.
We have provided consistent funding and
support for our nation’s submarine programs,
and 2019 marks the 9th consecutive year that
2 Virginia-class Submarines have been pro-
cured via the annual authorization/appropria-
tions process. The legislation we are consid-
ering today authorizes a 3rd Virginia-class
Submarine to be procured in fiscal year 2020
as we have heard on numerous occasions
about the attack submarine force structure
shortfall facing our Navy. In 2028 for example,
there is a forecast level of 42 attack sub-
marines against a stated requirement for 66
submarines.
On the Columbia ballistic missile submarine
program, Congress has been steadfast in its
support of the Department of Defense’s No. 1
acquisition priority. Partly as a result, next
year when our nation procures the first boat in
the Columbia class it will have the highest per-
centage of design completed for a first of
class ship in recent memory.
Congress has provided multiple years of
Supplier Development funding for our nuclear
shipbuilding programs with additional planned
investment. I look forward to hearing from the
Navy about these investments and how they
will be helping to shore up certain parts of our
nuclear shipbuilding industrial base.
Congress has also been extremely sup-
portive for amphibious warships, with congres-
sional authorization and funding underway
since Fiscal Year 2013 to enable our Navy to
move between the San Antonio Flight I and
the San Antonio Flight II class of LPDs. In
fact, Congress has led the Navy with succes-
sive authorization and appropriation of LPD
28, LPD 29, and LPD 30 since Fiscal Year
2015 alone. In Fiscal Year 2019, both the LHA
program and the LPD Flight II program re-
ceived $350 million in advance procurement
toward the construction of LHA 9 and LPD 31,
respectively. Unfortunately, our amphibious
force remains below the stated requirement of
38 ships and the Pentagon and Navy have not
moved out with the timely execution of these
FY 19 funds, critical for our supplier base.
This bill takes a step in the right direction and
authorizes LPD–31 and the incremental fund-
ing to support this critical asset. Congress has
done its job and now it’s time for the Depart-
ment of Defense and the Department of the
Navy to do their job and get these funds on
contract. Our shipbuilding industrial base is
ready, the shipyards are ready—it’s time to
get going and move out.
On surface combatants, Congress has been
extraordinarily supportive of the Navy’s DDG
51 Arleigh Burke-class Destroyer program with
2 successive Multiyear Procurements exe-
cuted since the program restarted almost a
decade ago. The DDG 51 program, unfortu-
nately, experienced a program lapse of sev-
eral years as Navy stopped, then restarted
production after a several year hiatus—the
supplier base atrophied and went elsewhere,
causing the government to work and reconsti-
tute our nation’s ability to build Arleigh Burke-
class destroyers. The program has returned to
some level of stability today, and these
multiyear procurements have saved taxpayers
billions of dollars when compared to annually
procuring 1–2 ships each year. As a result,
the Navy is now requesting procurement of up
to 3 DDG 51 class ships in a given fiscal
year—these ships are the workhorses of our
fleet and they are needed worldwide.
Next year, the Navy will award a contract for
design and construction of a next-generation
Frigate. This ship is critical to the future fleet
but it is also essential for the health and
sustainment of our fragile domestic industrial
base. I applaud the Navy’s acquisition ap-
proach which included a significant period for
concept design and refinement to be followed
by a robust competition detail design and con-
struction for this next class of warship. I want
the best ship with the best value to be our
next Frigate, but I also want the Pentagon to
recognize that it must take a holistic approach
to shipbuilding and its stewardship of the ship-
building industrial base. We saw the problems
created by Navy stopping and starting DDG
51 production and I am mindful of not making
the same mistake twice with this upcoming ac-
quisition. Our industrial base is fragile—deci-
sions made on one program will have cas-
cading effects on multiple programs underway
within Navy shipbuilding.
In closing, Madam Speaker, Congress con-
tinues to exercise its constitutional mandate to
provide and maintain a Navy. There have
been a series of congressional investments
made over the last several years which dem-
onstrates our commitment to building a robust
future fleet. I call on the Pentagon and Navy
leadership to recognize this commitment and
make future decisions consistent with our goal
of a larger more lethal Navy with a robust and
viable industrial base.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E894 July 10, 2019
Known for his quick wit, diplomatic instinct,
and passion for the job, he has served Ire-
land’s Department of Foreign Affairs honorably
and has been a great resource and friend to
the Irish-American community.
There are few Irish Citizens, and perhaps
even few Americans, who could compete with
his encyclopedic knowledge of United States
politics and history.
Born in Limerick, he studied law at Univer-
sity College Dublin, and joined the Irish For-
eign Service in April 1997. Prior to this posting
in our nation’s capital, he has served as Con-
sul General in Boston, Press Officer for the
Department of Foreign Affairs, Head of Irish
Community Affairs at Ireland’s Embassy in
London, First Secretary for British-Irish Inter-
governmental Secretariat in Belfast, and vice-
consul in Edinburgh, Scotland.
I know that his departure will leave a void to
many in the Irish-American community, where
he has been a strong presence at events and
celebrations throughout the country. We wish
him the best in his future endeavors, as he
continues his service in Ireland’s Department
of Foreign Affairs.
