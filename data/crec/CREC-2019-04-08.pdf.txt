Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, MONDAY, APRIL 8, 2019 No. 60
House of Representatives
The House met at noon and was
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. RASKIN).
f
DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,
April 8, 2019.
I hereby appoint the Honorable JAMIE
RASKIN to act as Speaker pro tempore on
this day.
NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
f
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by
the majority and minority leaders for
morning-hour debate.
The Chair will alternate recognition
between the parties. All time shall be
equally allocated between the parties,
and in no event shall debate continue
beyond 1:50 p.m. Each Member, other
than the majority and minority leaders
and the minority whip, shall be limited
to 5 minutes.
f
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker,
enough. Enough.
I finished my 16th, 17th, and 18th
townhall this weekend, and everywhere
I went across Kansas, my people told
me, ‘‘Enough of this.’’
We have had enough of the Mueller
investigation.
We have had enough on the tax re-
turn issues.
We have had enough Russia mania.
Mr. Speaker, it is time to move on;
we have all had enough.
There are great things that we can
move on to:
We can fix healthcare; we can secure
our southern borders; we can overhaul
our immigration system; we can come
up with a nationwide infrastructure
plan.
Mr. Speaker, this country is doing
good. Our economy is strong, wages are
up, unemployment is down, but we can
go from good to great if you take this
stranglehold off of this Congress and
let us get back to work.
Mr. Speaker, I am embarrassed by
the performance of the Congress this
far.
We came from the most productive
Congress, perhaps in history, to maybe
the least productive.
I have only been here a short while,
but I have learned that this little bub-
ble we live in has a very finite amount
of oxygen. And right now, politics is
taking up all the oxygen.
Mr. Speaker, it is time to move from
politics to policy. We have all had
enough. It is time to move on.
f
RECESS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair
declares the House in recess until 2
p.m. today.
Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 2 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

AFTER RECESS
The recess having expired, the House
was called to order by the Speaker pro
tempore (Mr. RASKIN) at 2 p.m.
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:
Dear Lord, we give You thanks for
giving us another day.
At the beginning of a new workweek,
we use this moment to be reminded of
Your presence and to tap the resources
needed by the Members of this people’s
House to do their work as well as it can
be done.
We ask that You send Your holy spir-
it upon them, giving them the gifts of
patience and diligence. With all the
pressures, concerns, and worry that ac-
company their responsibilities, we pray
that they might know Your peace,
which surpasses all human under-
standing.
May all that is done this day be for
Your greater honor and glory.
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair has examined the Journal of the
last day’s proceedings and announces
to the House his approval thereof.
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule
I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the
Speaker’s approval of the Journal.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the Speaker’s approval
of the Journal.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the
ground that a quorum is not present
and make the point of order that a
quorum is not present.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8, rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.
The point of no quorum is considered
withdrawn.

H3106 April 8, 2019
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the
gentleman from Washington (Mr. KIL-
MER) come forward and lead the House
in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Mr. KILMER led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
f
HONORING THE MEMORY OF KATE
IRWIN
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in memory of a member of my
district staff, Kate Irwin, who passed
away this morning following a long and
courageous battle with cancer.
While she was taken far too soon, I
feel so lucky that she was part of my
team and part of our lives. Kate was
the ultimate public servant.
If she was meeting with the Navy
about issues of national security, she
had a smile on her face.
If she was serving food to folks who
were down on their luck at the Salva-
tion Army, she had a smile on her face.
If she was visiting a local high school
and getting to try out a flight simu-
lator, Kate had a really big smile on
her face.
She looked at every day that she got
to serve the people of Washington’s
Sixth Congressional District as a bless-
ing because she knew that every day on
this Earth was one as well.
When I interviewed Kate for a job on
my team, she memorably said: ‘‘I will
work harder and will care more than
anyone you’ll ever meet.’’ And every
day that she came into work, every
time she staffed an event, every time
she followed up with a constituent in
need, she showed that extraordinary
commitment, even in the face of im-
possible circumstances.
Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my
condolences to Kate’s amazing family,
and I want to thank them for sharing
such an extraordinary young woman
with us.
You are in our prayers.
f
RECOGNIZING APRIL AS INVASIVE
SPECIES MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, April is Invasive Plant
Pest and Disease Awareness Month.
These species, commonly known as
hungry pests, begin to emerge in the
warmer months and can be spread eas-
ily by the public.
They attack trees, plants, and agri-
culture products, and it costs the
United States nearly $40 billion each
year in damages and extermination ef-
forts. The transfer of these invasive
species hurts our American farmers
and contributes to the destruction of
forests and public lands.
In Pennsylvania the spotted
lanternfly is a threat to apples, grapes,
peaches, stone fruits, and various tree
species—specially hardwoods—through-
out the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania.
Pests can be spread by human activi-
ties like moving into a new home, trav-
eling in the U.S. or internationally,
mailing plants and food, and moving
untreated firewood. The USDA offers a
free checklist for those moving into a
new household that would help reduce
the risk of spreading hungry pests into
their new home.
Mr. Speaker, it is important to be
mindful of these risks and utilize the
great resources available to reduce the
spread of invasive species.
f
RECOGNIZING MATTHEW VITAL
FOR HIS WIN AT AUGUSTA
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Matthew Vital, an eighth
grader from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
and his entire family.
Yesterday, Matthew became a na-
tional golf champion, winning the
Drive, Chip & Putt national title for
the boys 12 to 13 age group. He holed a
difficult chip and drained a 30-foot putt
at Augusta’s 18th green, the same
course where PGA professionals will
compete at the Masters in a few days.
The Morning Call, our hometown
newspaper, features a great photo of
Matthew that captures the focus and
determination that he demonstrated in
this tournament and has demonstrated
throughout his already impressive golf-
ing career.
Mr. Speaker, I say to Matthew that
the qualities that led him to this vic-
tory—a powerful work ethic and a com-
mitment to setting goals and seeing
them through—will serve him well not
just on the course, but also in school
and in every aspect of life: Keep work-
ing hard. Your family, your commu-
nity, and your Congresswoman are
proud of you. Congratulations.
f
HONORING MOTORSPORTS LEGEND
TONY STEWART
(Mr. PENCE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise
to honor a motorsports legend and per-
haps the most famous son of my home-
town, Columbus, Indiana.
From the dirt tracks to the high
banks, to the Brickyard, Tony Stewart
amassed a racing career that includes
nearly 50 NASCAR wins, three
NASCAR Cup titles, a USAC Triple
Crown, and an IndyCar Series cham-
pionship.
Tony won his first championship at
the Columbus Fairgrounds when he was
just 8 years old. He is synonymous with
racing, and we are proud to call him a
Hoosier.
On behalf of the people of Columbus,
the Sixth Congressional District, and
race fans across Indiana, I want to con-
gratulate Tony Stewart on his recent
nomination to the NASCAR Hall of
Fame.
I also want to thank Tony for his
work in our community as part of the
Tony Stewart Foundation. Through
December 2017, the foundation has
awarded over $7 million to outstanding
charities serving children with special
needs, endangered animals, and injured
drivers.
We honor his achievements on and off
the track, and we look forward to
cheering him on in years to come.

Honor Guard programs and provide for a bag-

SEC. 3. TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
Minnesota (Mrs. CRAIG) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MEADOWS) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Minnesota.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on H. Con. Res. 16.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota?
There was no objection.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.
Con. Res. 16. H. Con. Res. 16 authorizes
the use of the Capitol Grounds this
May for the annual National Peace Of-
ficers Memorial Service and the Na-
tional Honor Guard and Pipe Band Ex-
hibition.
The use of the Capitol Grounds is a
worthy recognition of the honorable
sacrifice of our Nation’s brave first re-
sponders and their families.
This year, the National Peace Offi-
cers Memorial will honor 228 women
and men, including 158 officers who
were killed in the line of duty last year
and 59 officers who responded to the at-
tacks of September 11 and recently suc-
cumbed to illnesses resulting from
their service on that tragic day. There
are an additional 11 officers, as defined
by the Honoring Hometown Heroes
Act, being memorialized who passed
away between 2014 and 2018.
Unfortunately, this year’s honorees
also include two officers from Min-
nesota: Corrections Officers Joseph
Gomm and Joseph Parise.
Officers Gomm and Parise’s deaths
are a clear reminder of the sacrifices
that law enforcement officers make
every day, putting their lives on the
line to keep our communities safe.
My sincere condolences to the fami-
lies of these fallen officers who have
had to endure the tragedy of their
loved ones’ deaths.
I have a deep appreciation for all of
these fallen officers being honored and
the ultimate sacrifice that they have
made on behalf of their local commu-
nities.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this
resolution and urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting this tribute to
law enforcement officers who died in
the line of duty.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join my
colleague opposite in support of this
particular resolution. I am actually an
original cosponsor of H. Con. Res. 16,
which authorizes the use of the Capitol
Grounds for the annual National Peace
Officers Memorial Service and the Na-
tional Honor Guard Pipe Band Exhi-
bition.
Now, this year we will be honoring
those fallen soldiers, including more
than 150 who died in the line of duty in
2018; and eight, Mr. Speaker, are from
my home State of North Carolina. I
would like to recognize them right
now.
They are: Officer Jason B. Quick of
the Lumberton Police Department; Of-
ficer Jared Franks of the Greensboro
Police Department; Corporal Travis
Wells from the Dallas Police Depart-
ment; Trooper Kevin K. Conner of the
North Carolina Highway Patrol; Troop-
er Samuel N. Bullard of the North
Carolina Highway Patrol; Senior Police
Officer Christopher Driver; Deputy
Sheriff David L. Manning of
Edgecombe County; and Deputy Sheriff
Alexis Locklear.
It is with sadness that I recognize
them, but in honor of their great serv-
ice, Mr. Speaker, this resolution dem-
onstrates our bipartisan support, not
only for the men and women in law en-
forcement who put their lives on the
line each and every day, who leave
their families to serve their commu-
nity, but the broader family of law en-
forcement in general.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this resolution.
Mr. Speaker, seeing that the gentle-
woman has no additional speakers, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I encour-
age all of my colleagues to support this
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.
CRAIG) that the House suspend the
rules and agree to the concurrent reso-
lution, H. Con. Res. 16.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the concur-
rent resolution was agreed to.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I move to

thorizing the use of the Capitol

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
Minnesota (Mrs. CRAIG) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MEADOWS) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Minnesota.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on H. Con. Res. 19.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota?
There was no objection.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.
Con. Res. 19 authorizing the use of the
Capitol Grounds for the 2019 Greater
Washington Soap Box Derby.
This year’s derby marks the 78th run-
ning of this event in the District.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ac-
knowledge the efforts of the gentleman
from Maryland, Mr. STENY HOYER, who
has been such a champion for this
event for his constituents.
The Soap Box Derby allows children
to develop leadership skills and high-
light their creativity, dedication, and
commitment to their communities.
Not only are these youngsters com-
peting for a trophy and the glory of
being the fastest car down the course,
but the winners of each division qualify
to compete in the National Soap Box
Derby at the Derby Downs track in
Akron, Ohio.
As with all events using the Capitol
Grounds, this event is open to the pub-
lic and free of charge. Its organizers
will coordinate with the Capitol Police
and the Architect of the Capitol.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support pas-
sage of this resolution and urge my col-
leagues to do the same.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.
Con. Res. 19 that indeed authorizes the
use of the Capitol Grounds for the an-
nual Greater Washington Soap Box
Derby on June the 15th.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I am being very
clear: had I not risen in support of this,
the gentleman from Maryland would
have given me what for, not today, not
tomorrow, but from now until the end
of time. So I recognize the gentleman
from Maryland’s unyielding support for
this particular effort and I join him in
that. I certainly also recognize his de-
sire to really support the youth that
get involved in this.
I have been one of the few Members
of Congress, other than the gentleman
I just referred to, to actually witness
these races.
We don’t have those, Mr. Speaker, in
North Carolina. I live in the moun-
tains. If you start a soap box derby up
there, we would end up in Atlanta,
Georgia, by the time we were finished.
I can tell you we are very pleased to
help. The mission of the Soap Box
Derby is to build knowledge and char-
acter and to teach fair and honest com-
petition. Indeed, it does exactly that.
As the gentlewoman has expressed, it
has been around since 1934.
Carrying on this time-honored tradi-
tion allows children to demonstrate
their dedication and creativity.
Winners from this local competition
will actually go on to other races and
compete, hopefully, at the world cham-
pionship in Akron, Ohio.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this resolution, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER).
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.
CRAIG) for yielding and I thank my
friend, Mr. MEADOWS, for his com-
ments, for his support of this effort,
which is, as he said and as Congress-
woman CRAIG said, very much about
giving young people a sense of competi-
tion, a sense of accomplishment, a
sense of creating a vehicle through
their own hands and their own work
and their own efforts. So this is a very
good effort for us and for young people.
One of my favorite events of the year
is the Soap Box Derby.
I am speaking, of course, from expe-
rience in terms of our district, which I
am going to talk about.
This resolution that has been called
up today, along with other members of
the region’s Congressional delegation,
Representatives CONNOLLY, BEYER, and
WEXTON from Virginia, and DAVID
TRONE, JOHN SARBANES, and ANTHONY
BROWN from Maryland, and, of course,
the Representative of the District of
Columbia, ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON,
who is a big supporter of this, author-
izes the use of the Capitol Grounds for
the derby.
Now, Mr. Speaker, this is my 28th
year sponsoring the Soap Box Derby
resolution, and I am pleased that it has
passed every year unanimously. This is
the Greater Washington Soap Box
Derby’s 78th year.
It will be held on, as has been said,
June 15, and we will see soap box racers
from ages 8 to 17 compete in three divi-
sions: stock, super stock, and masters.
The winners from each division, as
has been said, will each have a chance
to compete at the National All-Amer-
ican Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio.
Soap box derbies have been called the
greatest amateur racing event in the
world.
In America, we have a long tradition
of families participating, and many
adults carry fond memories with them
throughout their lives of having built
soap box racers with their parents or
other relatives during their childhood.
Soap box derbies are educational,
teaching children about sportsmanship,
engineering, manufacturing, and lead-
ership.
Many of the racers are sponsored by
civic groups, police and fire depart-
ments, and service organizations, with
members coming out to cheer on their
participants.
Several greater Washington soap box
champions, as it will not surprise you,
I am sure, Mr. Speaker, have come
from Maryland’s Fifth District in re-
cent years, including the winners from
2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, and last
year, 2018.
So we are really into this and we
have some very, very talented young
people who are excited about partici-
pating, and obviously do well.
Our racers, Mr. Speaker, even won
the National Championship in both 2007
and 2008. So the Soap Box Derby is a
big deal in the Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict.
Last year, Tyler Jameson from Hol-
lywood, Maryland, won the stock divi-
sion. His brother Ryan Jameson won
‘‘Best Decorated’’ soap box racer in the
super stock division. It was decorated
as a Maryland flag, which we love very,
very much.
Aspen Tomasello from Waldorf,
Maryland, which I represent, won in
super stock and then went on to win
third place at the National All-Amer-
ican Soap Box Derby race in Akron.
Kenny Tomasello, her brother, pre-
vailed in the masters division and took
fifth place in Akron.
I have a lot of confidence in our Fifth
District folks, and, Mr. Speaker, you
can imagine I would be in a lot of trou-
ble if this resolution didn’t pass allow-
ing them to compete in this wonderful
event.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the or-
ganizers of the Greater Washington
Soap Box Derby as well as the cospon-
sors of this resolution, and in par-
ticular, Congresswoman CRAIG and
Congressman MEADOWS for their sup-
port and help in getting this passed.
Mr. Speaker, it is a fun event, but it
is also a great event to teach young
people values and participation and
competition.

b 1700
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I want
to reiterate my support for this par-
ticular resolution.
Mr. Speaker, I was very jovial early
on, but I want to get serious for just a
moment. On this floor, you will see
passionate debate, oftentimes, that is
divided by this center aisle. Yet, on
this particular issue and others like
them, the Boys and Girls Club and
other things that actually minister to
the needs of children in our Nation, the
gentleman from Maryland is not only
an advocate, he is a champion.
I want to recognize that this day and
thank the gentleman from Maryland
for his leadership, not only on this but
on a number of things that affect our
youth in this great country.
Today, we are unanimous in support
of promoting that future generation,
and I thank the gentleman for his lead-
ership.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I urge my
colleagues to support the legislation,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.
CRAIG) that the House suspend the
rules and agree to the concurrent reso-
lution, H. Con. Res. 19.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, on that I

LOCAL WATER PROTECTION ACT
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 1331) to amend the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act to reauthorize
certain programs relating to nonpoint
source management, and for other pur-
poses.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1331
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Local Water
Protection Act’’.
SEC. 2. NONPOINT SOURCE MANAGEMENT PRO-
GRAMS.
Section 319(j) of the Federal Water Pollu-
tion Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1329(j)) is amend-
ed by striking ‘‘subsections (h) and (i) not to
exceed’’ and all that follows through ‘‘fiscal
year 1991’’ and inserting ‘‘subsections (h) and
(i) $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2020
through 2024’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
Minnesota (Mrs. CRAIG) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MEADOWS) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Minnesota.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1331.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota?
There was no objection.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
1331.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1331 is a bipartisan
bill to reauthorize appropriations for
the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency’s nonpoint source management
grants program.
I thank my colleague, the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. MAST), for intro-
ducing this bill with me. I also thank
the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.
NAPOLITANO) for her support in moving
this legislation through committee.
The Clean Water Act was enacted in
1972 to restore and maintain the chem-
ical, physical, and biological integrity
of the Nation’s waters. In 1987, the
Clean Water Act was amended to add
section 319 to create a nonregulatory
program through which EPA admin-
isters annual grants to help States de-
velop and implement their own pro-
grams for managing nonpoint sources
of water pollution.
Under EPA’s 319 program, States re-
tain the primary role for addressing
nonpoint source water pollution caused
by snowmelt and rainfall runoff, which
they do largely through monetary
means and financial incentives. How-
ever, according to the Government Ac-
countability Office, the extent of avail-
able incentives has declined in recent
years, as grants to States under the
section 319 program have declined by
more than 30 percent from a high of
about $240 million annually in fiscal
year 2004.
The section 319 program was initially
authorized at $70 million annually in
fiscal year 1988, and its authorization
level steadily increased to $130 million
in fiscal year 1991, the last year of au-
thorization for this program.
This bill, H.R. 1331, would reauthorize
$200 million annually for the 319 pro-
gram’s grant fund, which gives local
and State governments the flexibility
to make conservation practices im-
provements aimed at decreasing water
pollutants through partnerships within
their local communities.
In Minnesota, we take the quality of
our 10,000 lakes very seriously, and we
all want to preserve the quality of
these important waterways for genera-
tions to come. We also know that local
communities are the experts on the
most effective and innovative ways to
keep these waterways clean.
That is why this bill is so important.
It gives local and State governments
authority to create best voluntary con-
servation programs that work for their
communities.
Here are just a few of the examples of
section 319 grants in action from Min-
nesota’s Second Congressional District.
The Scott County Soil and Water
Conservation District saved native
plants and the shoreline protecting
McMahon Lake. The grant also signifi-
cantly helped reduce pollution
throughout the county by planting fil-
ter strips, building control grade struc-
tures, lining waterways with grass, and
planting native grass.
Dakota County created and imple-
mented projects to validate, dem-
onstrate, and refine best management
practices for nitrogen fertilizer for
corn production that will lower nitrate
levels in Dakota County’s groundwater
and surface water.
The Goodhue County Soil and Water
Conservation District is currently
working to reduce pollutants in the
Mississippi River-Lake Pepin water-
shed by 20 percent.
In Wabasha County, the Whitewater
Watershed Project worked with com-
munities to increase awareness of
water contamination and provided low-
interest loans to improve residential
infrastructure and help farmers come
into compliance with pollution stand-
ards.
The South Washington Watershed
District integrated a storm water reuse
plan that captures roadway storm
water in two existing ponds. This inte-
grates into two golf course irrigation
systems and provides new water amen-
ities with the public golf courses. This
is estimated to reduce potable water
usage by more than 40 million gallons
annually.
Finally, in Rice County, the Cannon
River Watershed Partnership is work-
ing to engage local, regional, and State
programs and organizations to develop
a way for their local community to en-
gage in pollution reduction in a mean-
ingful and long-term way.
Again, I thank the gentleman from
Florida for introducing this bipartisan
bill with me. This legislation passed
out of committee with bipartisan sup-
port. It is a good bill, and I am pleased
to support it. I urge my colleagues to
do so as well.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
1331, the Local Water Protection Act. I
thank my colleague from Minnesota
(Mrs. CRAIG) for her leadership and my
good friend from Florida (Mr. MAST)
for introducing this important bill.
H.R. 1331 reauthorizes the Environ-
mental Protection Agency’s section
319, which is a nonpoint source pollu-
tion control program under the Clean
Water Act. Indeed, the section 319 pro-
gram takes a cooperative, nonregula-
tory approach toward addressing
nonpoint sources.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3110 April 8, 2019
Reauthorizing this program rein-
forces the Federal leadership being pro-
vided to help our State and local part-
ners in their nonpoint source control
efforts. This program has benefited
water bodies all across the country, in-
cluding in my district.
For example, when agricultural run-
off impaired the Mills River, a source
of drinking water for more than 50,000
people in western North Carolina, the
North Carolina Division of Water Qual-
ity used $450,000 of the section 319 grant
to restore the Mills River and remove
it from the State’s impaired list in
2006.
There are hundreds more success sto-
ries from States across the Nation
where the section 319 program has ad-
dressed nonpoint sources and restored
water bodies.
For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I
support this program. I urge all Mem-
bers to support the passage of H.R.
1331, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I include
in the RECORD a letter of support for
H.R. 1331 from Trout Unlimited.
TROUT UNLIMITED,
Arlington, VA, April 8, 2019.
Re Trout Unlimited supports HR 1331, The
Local Water Protection Act.
Hon. ANGIE CRAIG,
House of Representatives.
Hon. BRIAN MAST,
House of Representatives.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES CRAIG AND MAST:
On behalf of Trout Unlimited (TU), I am
writing to strongly support the above ref-
erenced bill, to urge its swift passage
through the House, and to thank you for in-
troducing it. Section 319 of the Clean Water
Act has provided our field staff with valuable
funds which they have leveraged many times
over to accomplish a number of valuable
nonpoint source pollution projects across the
nation. But as you know there is much more
work to be done, and passage of this bill will
be a big step in a positive direction for the
health of the Nation’s watersheds.
Trout Unlimited has over 300,000 conserva-
tion-minded members and supporters, orga-
nized into 380 chapters in 35 state councils.
Our mission is to conserve, protect and re-
store the Nation’s trout and salmon fisheries
and their watersheds. We have 250 staff
spread across America who work with our
members and a wide variety of partners—in-
cluding farmers, ranchers, miners and state
and local agencies—to accomplish our mis-
sion. Section 319 has become an increasingly
important tool for our work.
Working with our partners, we have used
Section 319 funds in a variety of ways to con-
trol nonpoint pollution. Of special note is
our recent use of funds to control abandoned
mine pollution in Pennsylvania and Colo-
rado. Abandoned mine pollution is especially
insidious problems in coal country and in the
mining regions of the Rocky Mountain West,
but we have developed a number of tech-
niques which are restoring formerly dead
streams to healthy streams.
TU and other conservation groups are
pressing Congress to provide more funding
for natural infrastructure funding and
projects. Section 319, and your bill, are deliv-
ering on that request.
Abandoned mine cleanup, sediment con-
trol, and nutrient runoff control, are model
examples of natural infrastructure projects.
Thank you again for introducing this bill.
We urge its speedy passage.
Sincerely,
STEVE MOYER,
Vice President,
Government Affairs.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST),
the sponsor of this particular legisla-
tion.
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
also in support of H.R. 1331, the Local
Water Protection Act. I thank both my
colleagues for their support and their
comments on this legislation.
Let’s talk about what this really
does, how this bill is so important, and
how it makes a difference with
nonpoint source pollution.
Point source pollution is easy to
identify, for most people. They have an
image of it in their head. It is that pipe
coming out of some sort of seawall,
coming out of the ground somewhere,
dripping something that doesn’t look
so fresh into their waterways that they
want to look pristine and beautiful.
That is easy to identify. The
nonpoint stuff is not quite as easy for
everybody to go out there and see.
What this does is it helps us prevent
toxic agricultural runoff that can have
an impact from things like fertilizer
spraying, those things that go out
there and are put onto our crops at dif-
ferent times.
It can help implement best manage-
ment practices. It can install pump
stations where they might be needed.
It can assist with septic to sewer con-
versions for those issues that arise in
our more suburban and residential
areas where we have runoff coming off
yards, leaky septic tanks, things that
we also don’t want in our waterways
coming from those areas.
It can help address legacy pollutants
already in our waterways. It can help
prevent other forms of pollutants from
coming in. This is why it is so impor-
tant.
For us, Mr. Speaker, in Florida, this
is a huge issue because our Florida wa-
terways, we know how irreplaceable a
treasure they are. They are eco-
logically unique. They are central to
our economy. They are central to our
health because our family members are
in and out of the water so often, wheth-
er they are fishing, whether they are
swimming, whether they are boating,
whether they are recreating, whatever
it is, whether it is a part of their liveli-
hood, it is what they are in, so it is a
big deal for our health.
The community that I represent, like
many others, is plagued with toxic
algal blooms that result from algae-
laden discharges, an unnatural infusion
of freshwater into our salt water that
causes this. It creates a real mess for
us.
When this nutrient-loaded freshwater
hits our saltwater estuaries, it wreaks
havoc on our coasts. It kills everything
in the sea life in its path.
This past summer, we had freshwater
that was released into our coastal estu-
aries that was labeled nearly 50 times
too toxic for human contact. Now that
water has tested positive for a number
of toxins in areas that are very heavily
populated. It is a very bad situation for
what we experience each and every
year.
This bill helps to stop this pollution
by increasing the EPA’s successful sec-
tion 319 grant program. It addresses
nonpoint source pollution through
State-run nonpoint source pollution
management, not Washington, D.C.,
one-size-fits-all approaches, but State-
run. The bill reauthorizes this program
and increases funding levels up to $200
million annually through 2024. This is
an amazing bill. I am very proud to
work with everybody else on it.
In short, Mr. Speaker, this is a bill
that can make a real difference for
communities across our country, but
specifically for communities in and
around Florida and our beautiful pe-
ninsula, as well.
Mr. Speaker, I fully support its pas-
sage. I thank Congresswoman CRAIG for
leading this effort with me.
By the way, congratulations to Con-
gresswoman CRAIG on passing her first
piece of legislation, as well. Let’s get
this bill passed.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. NAPOLITANO).
b 1715
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Mrs. CRAIG) for yielding.
I rise in very strong support of H.R.
1331, the bipartisan Local Water Pro-
tection Act, and I wish to thank Rep-
resentatives CRAIG and MAST for their
leadership in introducing this bill that
will help many communities in Min-
nesota, Florida, California, and around
the country manage and treat pollu-
tion in our rivers, lakes, and seas.
The bill authorizes $200 million annu-
ally for EPA to provide grants to
States to address nonpoint source
water pollution. This is pollution that
comes when rain runoff carries toxins,
fertilizers, metals, and other contami-
nants from farms, roads, and forests
into the water bodies.
Today, according to the data pro-
vided by the State of California, my
home State, approximately 89 percent
of my State’s assessed rivers and
streams currently do not meet the
State water quality standards. That is
pretty high. And of that number, some-
where between 30 to 60 percent are im-
paired because of nonpoint sources of
pollution in the State, both urban and
rural sources. The number is stag-
gering and has remained relatively
constant over the past decade.
As Mrs. CRAIG mentioned, States
around the country are experiencing
the same level of unacceptable pollu-
tion entering their waterways, and this
bill will address it.
Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. CRAIG)

bill, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this important legislation, which
will help all of our congressional dis-
tricts.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise

I thank the leadership of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Mrs. CRAIG)
and the gentleman from Florida (Mr.

ance of my time.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time and urge
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 1331, ‘‘The Local Water
Protection Act’’, which provides 200 million an-
nually to support the nonpoint source manage-
ment grants program administered by the En-
vironmental Protection Agency (EPA).
I support this legislation because it is nec-
essary to counteract the current crisis of water
pollution in our country.
As an Energy and Environment Task Force
Co-Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus,
I understand the necessity of this bill and its
funding to managing sources of water pollu-
tion.
It is unsustainable to think we can continue
to allow runoff that carries pollutants, fer-
tilizers, and sediment from fields; toxins from
abandoned mines, and oils and heavy metals
from roads, into lakes, rivers, and other bodies
of water.
As pollutants in our waters increase, human
exposure to toxins will follow in step, toxin ex-
posure is directly linked to cancers and heart
disease.
Before the pollutants reach people they
reach our waterways, adversely affecting a
whole ecosystem, putting 1 to 11 percent of
marine species in to extinction every decade.
The strain on the marine life is not the only
adverse effect to nature, global warming is
also worsened when we turn a cheek to de-
creasing the pollution of our waterways.
Water pollution is not a topic to be taken
lightly and we are reminded of our current
privileges of clean water when we look at cit-
ies that have experienced the unimaginable,
such as Flint, Michigan.
Flint, Michigan has lived in a state of fear,
having to drink from bottles of filtered water in
order to completely avoid lead poisoning and
contamination.
Citizens of Flint, Michigan had to abandon
their homes and the residents had to be com-
pensated for their property and their current
and future health conditions that arise from the
contamination by polluted water.
Water pollution poses a threat in every
state, including my home state of Texas.
It was found just recently that in 938 in-
stances, Texas companies released pollution
that exceeded the levels permitted by federal
clean water laws according to researchers
who examined Texas Commission for Environ-
mental Quality data.
Texas was found in 2018 to have the most
widespread radiated drinking water contamina-
tion affecting more than 3,500 utilities serving
22 million people.
The contamination in Texas included detect-
able levels of radium–226 and radium–228 in
a study conducted by the Environmental
Working Group (EWG).
Currently, it is required by law for states to
submit reports to the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) regarding the current sources
of water pollution within their state, as well as
plans to manage those sources of pollution.
EPA provides grants for states to carry out
their plans to manage water pollution.
Mr. Speaker, we must not wait to take ac-
tion when the health of our marine life, the
state of Global Warming, and the health of our
people are being affected.
H.R. 1331 would allow instrumental pro-
grams to continue serving as a step in the
right direction in protecting and healing our
home.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.
CRAIG) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1331.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the

f
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND NA-
TIONAL URBAN SEARCH AND
RESCUE RESPONSE SYSTEM
TASK FORCES
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 639) to amend section 327 of the
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and
Emergency Assistance Act to clarify
that National Urban Search and Res-
cue Response System task forces may
include Federal employees.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 639
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND NA-
TIONAL URBAN SEARCH AND RES-
CUE RESPONSE SYSTEM TASK
FORCES.
Section 327 of the Robert T. Stafford Dis-
aster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act
(42 U.S.C. 5165f) is amended by adding at the
end the following:
‘‘(p) FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.—Nothing in this
section shall be construed to mean that a
task force may not include Federal employ-
ees. In the case of a Federal employee de-
tailed to a task force, the sponsoring agency
shall enter into an agreement with the rel-
evant employing Federal agency.’’.

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
Minnesota (Mrs. CRAIG) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MEADOWS) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Minnesota.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on H.R. 639.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota?
There was no objection.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
639 introduced by the gentlewoman
from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER).
H.R. 639 is a technical correction bill
which will amend section 327 of the
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and
Emergency Assistance Act to explicitly
clarify that Federal employees are able
to participate in the National Urban
Search and Rescue Response System
task forces coordinated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
FEMA has developed the National
USAR Response System over the last
several decades to act as a force multi-
plier for disaster rescue missions. The
system is comprised of 28 task force
teams from across the country and in-
cludes highly skilled volunteers who
are constantly training for a variety of
hazard scenarios, both man-made and
natural.
Task force teams have proven their
effectiveness time and again across
this Nation.
Following enactment of the National
Urban Search and Rescue Response
System Act at the end of the 114th
Congress, certain Federal agencies that
employ members of some of these task
forces have, unfortunately, been mis-
interpreting language that granted li-
ability protections for non-Federal
task force members equal to Federal
first responders only when their task
force was called into Federal service,
resulting in an impediment to those
Federal employees serving on a task
force.
This bill will simply clarify that
nothing in section 327 of the Stafford
Act shall be interpreted to mean that a
task force cannot include Federal em-
ployees and that, in instances where a
Federal employee is detailed to a Na-
tional USAR Response System task
force, the sponsoring agency shall
enter into an agreement with the rel-
evant employing Federal agency.
The critical emergency services pro-
vided by the National USAR Response
System and these highly skilled opera-
tors are too important for us to delay
this fix any longer. I strongly support
this bill and urge my colleagues to join
me.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER)
for her leadership on this legislation.
Nothing is so valuable as someone who
looks at a problem, sees the problem,
and then endeavors to fix it, and that is
exactly what the gentlewoman has
done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3112 April 8, 2019
H.R. 639 clarifies language that was
passed in the National Urban Search
and Rescue Response System Act of
2016 to ensure, as the gentlewoman was
saying, that the Urban Search and Res-
cue Response Task Force can include
Federal employees.
FEMA’s National Urban Search and
Rescue Response System was estab-
lished in 1989. The system is composed
of some 28 task force teams, and the
teams include members from the Fed-
eral, State, local, and private sector,
all of those personnel responding to-
gether to meet the needs in times of
disaster.
The teams are locally supported but
can be called up by FEMA when a dis-
aster strikes. These men and women
are the ones who head into collapsed
buildings and conduct search and res-
cue missions to save disaster survivors.
For a long time, the committee
worked to clarify protections for these
team members who put their lives lit-
erally on the line to serve their com-
munity; and, in 2016, Congress passed
the National Urban Search and Rescue
Response Systems Act to do just that.
However, there was one technical fix
that needed to happen to make sure
that Federal participants in these
teams can continue to be deployed as
part of these task forces.
I want to thank the gentlewoman
from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER) for her
leadership there because this bill, in-
deed, does clarify this. I would suggest
that it should have tremendous bipar-
tisan support.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the legislation, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I urge all
of my colleagues to support this, and I
reserve the balance of my time as well.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
as much time as she may consume to
the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.
HARTZLER) for her explanation of what
this bill does.
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to urge passage of H.R. 639, the
National Urban Search and Rescue Re-
sponse System Task Forces Act.
I want to thank the gentleman from
the North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS) and
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.
CRAIG) for their kind remarks about
this bill and their support.
I also want to thank Chairman DEFA-
ZIO and Ranking Member GRAVES for
bringing the bill to the floor today, as
well as my colleagues GERRY CONNOLLY
and BLAINE LUETKEMEYER for cospon-
soring this legislation and the Inter-
national Association of Fire Chiefs for
endorsing the bill.
My bill, as has been said, is a com-
monsense technical correction that
makes clear that Federal employees
can serve on FEMA Urban Search and
Rescue teams.
Over the past three decades, FEMA
has developed the National Urban
Search and Rescue Response System,
which consists of a network of task
force teams of dedicated volunteers
who respond quickly when disaster
strikes.
Currently, 28 task force teams across
the country utilize their unique skills
and resources of local volunteers to act
as a force multiplier for disaster rescue
missions. These teams train constantly
for a variety of situations, including
rescuing survivors from collapsed
buildings or giving airlift rescue oper-
ations.
They are ready to deploy within
hours of being called up in response to
floods or tornadoes, and they can be
pre-positioned in advance of covering
disasters, such as hurricanes.
I am proud to represent Missouri
Task Force 1, based out of Columbia,
Missouri. In September, they received
a call to deploy to North Carolina to
pre-position search and rescue re-
sources for Hurricane Florence.
As the team prepared to deploy, one
of their members, who had spent years
training and working as a dog handler
on the team, was forced to stay home
not because of a physical inability or
family conflict, but because he works
out of a regional office for a Federal
agency as his normal day job. Due to a
new interpretation of Federal statute,
a willing, able, and trained volunteer
who could have helped save lives was
forced to stay home.
Unfortunately, FEMA has inter-
preted the National Urban Search and
Rescue Response System Act of 2016 to
mean that Federal employees are not
allowed to serve on Federal task forces,
despite the fact that they did for years.
This goes against congressional in-
tent. The 2016 legislation codified non-
Federal employee benefits and liability
protections, but failed to specifically
list Federal employees. This was not
intended to mean that FEMA should
preclude Federal employees from par-
ticipation.
Since passage, FEMA has issued
mixed guidance on several occasions on
whether Federal employees can serve,
and this has created confusion and
frustration for our dedicated search
and rescue volunteers.
My legislation is a commonsense so-
lution to resolve this problem by sim-
ply clarifying that Federal employees
can serve on these vital task forces.
Congress must resolve this issue swift-
ly so our dedicated volunteers can re-
spond at full strength when the next
disaster strikes.
So once again, I want to thank my
colleagues who have spoken in support
of this, for those who have cosponsored
it, and I urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 639.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I am
prepared to close, and I yield myself
the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the
gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.
HARTZLER) for her leadership.
It is a good testimony for all of
America when we see the efforts of our
first responders coming from Missouri
to North Carolina, coming from North
Carolina to California, and in between.
Mr. Speaker, we need to understand
that they need our support. This is an
important piece of legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from North Carolina
(Mr. MEADOWS), and I encourage all of
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.
CRAIG) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 639.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 2030) to direct the Secretary of
the Interior to execute and carry out
agreements concerning Colorado River
Drought Contingency Management and
Operations, and for other purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2030
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Colorado
River Drought Contingency Plan Authoriza-
tion Act’’.
SEC. 2. COLORADO RIVER BASIN DROUGHT CON-
TINGENCY PLANS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any
other provision of law expressly addressing
the operation of the applicable Colorado
River System reservoirs, immediately upon
execution of the March 19, 2019, versions of
the Agreement Concerning Colorado River

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3113
April 8, 2019
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the
measure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona?
There was no objection.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2030 will direct the
Secretary of the Interior to imme-
diately execute the drought contin-
gency plan agreements.
The drought contingency plan agree-
ments will allow us to immediately re-
spond to the historic drought condi-
tions in the Colorado River Basin.
These conditions pose a threat to the
water supply of 40 million people, and
5.5 million acres of farmland.
This legislation directs the Secretary
of the Interior to immediately execute
the drought contingency plan agree-
ments since the actions to be under-
taken are within the analyses and
range of effects reviewed in existing
environmental documents.
These environmental documents in-
clude: Number 1, a 2007 final EIS on
Colorado River Interim Guidelines for
Lower Basin Shortages and Coordi-
nated Operations for Lakes Powell and
Mead.
Number 2, existing ESA documents
for the Colorado River Storage Project
Act initial storage unit reservoirs.
Additional environmental compli-
ance is only applicable should further
Federal actions be undertaken that are
outside the range of effects analyzed in
the previously mentioned environ-
mental documents.
Mr. Speaker, that essentially means
that the drought contingency plan
agreements fit within the framework of
existing environmental compliance.
This compliance allows the Secretary
of the Interior to immediately sign the
drought contingency plan agreements.
This immediate action is essential to
preserving the water supply for mil-
lions of people in the American South-
west.
Before closing, I would also like to
thank the many people who worked for
years to develop and finalize the DCP.
In particular, I want to highlight the
contributions of the Colorado River In-
dian Tribes, and Gila River Indian
Community. Without their contribu-
tions, DCP simply would not be pos-
sible.
I also want to thank the seven basin
States and others who worked with me
and my staff to finalize DCP and enable
the legislation over the past several
weeks. I am glad that we were able to
work together to develop legislation
that has earned broad, bipartisan sup-
port here in Congress, and with af-
fected stakeholders.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, this is a totally unique
bill. What we have done is allowed the
seven affected States to get together
and work out a solution and bring it to
us and then we, in Congress, didn’t
screw it up too badly.
So what we have done now is, if this
bill can actually go into law, we have
allowed for the system to build the ca-
pacity to store 60 million acre-feet of
water that will help 5.5 million acres of
irrigated lands, 40 million people, and
can also produce over 4,000 megawatts
of clean electricity.
It is rare for Congress, but in this
case, we respected what the States
have done, and we are moving quickly
to try and get this into law.
I appreciate the chairman and the 30
other Members from the affected
States who have joined me as part of
this bill. Now I hope we can expedite
this and send it over to the Senate
where we will ask them to refrain from
their usual practices and to quickly get
this bill on the President’s desk be-
cause, not only is this bill bipartisan,
this bill is that important.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, let me
also thank the ranking member, Mr.
BISHOP, and his staff for helping expe-
dite the process, and for their input
throughout this process.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from California (Mrs.
NAPOLITANO) for her comments.
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Mr. GRIJALVA for yielding.
I also rise in very strong support of
H.R. 2030, the Colorado River Drought
Contingency Plan Authorization Act,
and I thank Mr. GRIJALVA for his lead-
ership on this issue that is so vital to
the seven Colorado River Basin States
including: Arizona, California, Nevada,
Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyo-
ming.
The Colorado River Drought Contin-
gency Plan, known as DCP, is a great
achievement of collaboration, com-
promise, and foresight agreed to by the
seven basin States after 2 years of ne-
gotiations.
As stated by my colleague on the
other side of the aisle, it is quite an
important matter to the States. It re-
flects a realistic appraisal by water
managers in the Colorado River system
of increasing water scarcity with the
watershed in its 19th year of drought.
That is a long time, and I think this
will help prevent it.
Collectively, the basin States devel-
oped a practical, workable approach
that provides for enhanced conserva-
tion and new management tools to ad-
dress shortages on the river system.
This will allow California and other
water users to store water in Lake
Mead for the good of the entire system
and habitat, and increase conservation
measures in the basin, and bank—of all
things—bank excess water supplies for
future use.
The drought contingency plan is sup-
ported by the California Natural Re-
sources Agency, the Colorado River
Board of California, California Native
Tribes, and the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California.
This legislation will authorize the
Secretary of the Interior to implement
what the seven basin States have
agreed upon. The legislation protects
all environmental laws and existing en-
vironmental documents that govern
the river.
Enactment of this authorizing legis-
lation will not only support the inter-
state agreement, but would also imple-
ment Minute 323 of our treaty with
Mexico to address transnational water
cooperation on the Colorado River.
This allows Mexico to bank water in
Lake Mead for the benefit of our coun-
try to prevent shortage conditions and
maximize power production.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from California.
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, we
are blessed that we have a good
snowpack in the Upper Colorado River
watershed this year. The legislation
also provides us the opportunity to
take advantage of this extra water by
beginning implementation imme-
diately of the DCP.
We must also support collaborative
approaches to manage our most pre-
cious natural resource: water. The DCP
creates increased dependability to the
water users in southern California and
the seven basin States.
I urge my colleagues to strongly sup-
port H.R. 2030, and I urge the Senate to
pass this legislation immediately.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Colorado (Mr. TIPTON), a former mem-
ber of our committee and one of the
original cosponsors of this bill.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of H.R. 2030, the Colo-
rado River Drought Contingency Plan
Authorization Act.
Following a historic two-decade long
drought in the Southwest, I am glad to
see an effective strategy produced after
years of collaboration between the
seven States involved and the Federal
Government.
Demand for water has drastically in-
creased over the years due to popu-
lation growth, but prolonged drought
has diminished water supplies. As the
location of the headwaters for the river
that supplies roughly 40 million people,
Colorado plays an especially crucial
role in the management of our most
precious resource.
This past winter brought much-need-
ed snowpack to the region, but there is
no certainty that this trend will con-
tinue in the coming years. It is impor-
tant to have a contingency plan in
place.
Ensuring the Colorado River can
meet the demands of all water users
who rely on it is a shared responsi-
bility among all of the upper and lower

basin States. The drought contingency
plan agreed to by the basin States will
ensure continued hydropower oper-
ations and compact compliance.
Now each State must work to de-
velop a plan for meeting the obliga-
tions of the DCP. Within the State of
Colorado, it will be critical that all of
the stakeholders come together to
shoulder the burden of a voluntary de-
mand management program. The west-
ern slope cannot carry the entire load,
nor can the front range.
I would like to thank the local and
State governments who have worked
on the DCP, and my colleagues in the
House and the Senate for recognizing
the urgency of this issue. I am proud to
cosponsor H.R. 2030, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of the bill.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. O’HALLERAN).
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to express my strong support
of the Colorado River Drought Contin-
gency Plan.
In Arizona and across the Southwest,
communities have struggled through a
19-year-long drought. During my time
in the State legislature, I spent years
working with Republicans and Demo-
crats alike to create Arizona’s first
conservation, drought, and statewide
water management plans. It cannot be
understated how hard Arizona has
worked to implement a drought pro-
gram that ensures our State continues
to have access to the Colorado River
and other instate water sources.
I am pleased to see the resulting plan
was passed earlier this year. Now it is
our turn. This legislation will complete
the process by directing the Secretary
of the Interior to enter into agree-
ments with each of the seven Colorado
River Basin States and it will ensure
that water conservation efforts can
begin quickly.
The sooner we get these agreements
signed, the sooner we can address the
water issues across the region.
I applaud the great work being done
here in Washington and in the seven
States impacted by this drought con-
tingency plan to put forward innova-
tive solutions to protect our precious
water assets.
It is important to remember that we
are not done. We must continue these
conversations and work together to
manage our rivers in ways that allow
cities to grow, ensure farmers and
ranchers are successful, and keep our
obligations to Native American Tribes
and Nations.
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this important
legislation.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from California (Mr. CAL-
VERT), another former member of our
committee and a long-time worker on
water issues in Congress.
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the ranking member for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
2030, the Colorado River Drought Con-
tingency Plan Authorization Act. The
Colorado River is a critical source of
water for approximately 19 million peo-
ple in the southern California region.
After 19 years of drought on the Colo-
rado, Lake Mead is near critical levels.
If no action is taken, it is estimated
that by 2021, Lake Mead could reach
critically low elevations where basic
reservoir operations and water deliv-
eries become impossible.
We are here today because of the tre-
mendous leadership of the seven Colo-
rado River Basin States, the water
users throughout the basin. Tradition-
ally, the shared water resources of the
Colorado River have been managed
through consensus and collaboration,
and the drought contingency plan, or
DCP, is no exception.
Water users throughout the basin
agree to voluntary conservation meas-
ures that protect existing water rights
in order to protect the water supplies
of Lake Powell and Lake Mead for the
foreseeable future.
I want to commend the bill’s sponsor
for working to ensure that the Salton
Sea is protected under this legislation.
DCP was developed with input from
stakeholders throughout the basin, in-
cluding water users, Tribal leaders, and
environmental groups. California holds
the senior water rights in the lower
basin. In the short term, though, Cali-
fornia may have the most water secu-
rity during this historic drought, but
water leaders in my region recognize
the importance of protecting Lake
Mead now to preserve southern Califor-
nia’s long-term water supply reli-
ability.
Mr. Speaker, I want to extend a spe-
cial thanks to Jeff Kightlinger for his
tireless efforts on behalf of the Metro-
politan Water District of Southern
California to get this historic deal
across the finish line. If not for his
work over the last several years, we
would not be here today.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation.
b 1745
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. STANTON).
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank
him for his leadership as chairman of
the Natural Resources Committee and
as a senior member of the Arizona dele-
gation for his leadership on this impor-
tant legislation.
Mr. Speaker, the importance of the
Colorado River to the West and my
State of Arizona cannot be overstated.
Forty million people in seven Western
States get water from the Colorado,
and nearly 40 percent of the water used
in Phoenix comes from the Colorado.
We must absolutely protect it, and we
must do so without delay.
To prepare for the impact of the
changing climate and a drier future,
water users in the seven Colorado
River Basin States reached agreements
to voluntarily conserve water and bet-
ter manage the river to mitigate the
risk of water levels falling to peril-
ously low levels in Lakes Mead and
Powell, the two largest man-made res-
ervoirs in the United States.
A little over a week ago, a Natural
Resources subcommittee heard testi-
mony from representatives from all
seven basin States on the urgency to
authorize the drought contingency
plan as quickly as possible.
This urgency was also expressed by
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commis-
sioner Brenda Burman, who described
the consequences of not advancing the
drought contingency plan. She said:
‘‘This is a dangerous situation, where
we could be reaching critically low ele-
vations that affect the drinking water
of 40 million people; that affect 5.5 mil-
lion acres that could go dry; that affect
species, both endangered and not en-
dangered; that affect entire economies
and the recreation of the Southwest.
Action is needed now.’’
The legislation before us today is
critical because it directs the Sec-
retary of the Interior to immediately
execute the agreements reached so
water conservation efforts can get un-
derway this year.
This is by no means a permanent
long-term solution. We all recognize
that more must be done. But this legis-
lation is an important step, and it
must be advanced without delay.
It is also important to note that this
legislation has strong support from a
wide variety of interests across the
State of Arizona, from our Tribal lead-
ers, including the Gila River Indian
Community and the Colorado River In-
dian Tribes, to cities and municipali-
ties across the State, including the
city of Phoenix. Industrial users sup-
port it, as do environmental organiza-
tions.
I urge my colleagues to join us in
supporting this bill.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself 1 minute.
I would like the RECORD to reflect
that, although they are not noted as
original cosponsors, Congressmen
AMODEI, BUCK, and TIPTON were, in
fact, with us supporting this bill since
the very beginning, and it should be re-
flected as such. Due to an error in the
introduction of the bill, they were ini-
tially left off H.R. 2030, but they should
be original cosponsors.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah
(Mr. MCADAMS).
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of H.R. 2030, the Colorado River
Drought Contingency Plan. My State is
one of the four upper division States,
and Utah gets 22 percent of its total
water supply from the Colorado River.
The water is not only the lifeblood
for farmers and ranchers in eastern
Utah. It also supplies culinary water to
the Wasatch Front, a fast-growing
urban area where most of the State’s
residents live.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3115
April 8, 2019
Since the year 2000, the Colorado
River Basin and the State of Utah have
been in severe drought. We don’t know
whether this drought will continue or,
due to climate change, may perma-
nently alter the river as a source of
water. In the meantime, demand for
water continues to rise.
Both Lake Powell and Lake Mead ap-
pear to be operating as designed, but
both are at uncomfortably low levels.
Congress must act promptly on this
legislation so that the new agreement
can be implemented and water con-
servation efforts can get underway.
The Upper Basin Drought Contin-
gency Plan is aimed at protecting
upper basin water supplies by keeping
Lake Powell from falling below a speci-
fied critical elevation. Taking steps
now to avoid that just makes sense and
helps ensure that hydropower needs,
water delivery, and protections for en-
dangered species continue in compli-
ance with the Colorado River Compact.
I strongly support this bipartisan,
collaborative measure that builds on
past efforts to decrease stress on basin
water supplies and lets States and
water users drive the decision, rather
than have the Federal Government
make unilateral water delivery cut-
backs.
I thank Chairman GRIJALVA and
Ranking Member ROB BISHOP, my Utah
colleague, for bringing this legislation
to the floor promptly. It has the back-
ing of Utah’s four House Members, and
it is supported by the State of Utah.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing
it signed into law.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to another gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT), who is
one of the great members of this com-
mittee and this House.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, the
gentleman said another one from Ari-
zona.
Mr. Speaker, I want to sort of echo
what you have heard, and that is a cer-
tain happiness that we were all able to
move this forward together. I appre-
ciate the chairman, but I also want to
be someone who adds a little bit of a
caveat that we understand the work
isn’t done, particularly for those of us
in Arizona.
I hate to admit how old I am, but in
the early nineties, I was one of those
who worked on what we called our
groundwater recharge district in Mari-
copa County. When we had excess
water, particularly from the Central
Arizona Project in those years, we
stored it. As we look back, now 25-some
years, that was somewhat revolu-
tionary and visionary.
We will have to do things like that to
meet our requirements that are part of
this legislation. This legislation does
not lay out every last step that those
of us in Arizona must do. We are going
to have to step up and meet our obliga-
tions. I think it is important that we
understand there is still much more
work to be done.
As that moves forward, I am going to
ask that all of us, particularly those
who are supporting this drought con-
tingency plan, think creatively. Are
there technologies, and are there en-
couragements of farming techniques,
as we are doing urban construction and
types of plants in our communities?
We need to now go to the next step
and think what this brings our commu-
nities, particularly for those of us in
the Phoenix metropolitan area who
live in the desert Southwest.
I hope we get a resounding vote of ap-
proval a little while from now, and I
also hope that this is the right direc-
tion. We have to keep focused. Just be-
cause we have had a big hydrological
year doesn’t mean that we are not
going to be back having this conversa-
tion a year or 2 years from now.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate everyone
who has spoken on behalf of this par-
ticular bill. It is a significant piece of
legislation.
As Mr. SCHWEIKERT said, hopefully,
we will never have to use it. Even in
April of this year, the flow into Lake
Powell is 133 percent of average. The
snowpack is 138 percent of the 30-year
average. Hopefully, we will never have
to implement it, but at some time, it
may, indeed, happen. Having this in
place now provides for the future ne-
cessity, if and when that negative time
has to take place.
I am proud the States came together.
They have come up with a plan that is
going to be successful, a solution to it,
because if this thing does not pass,
Utah is going to keep all the water and
the rest of you can suck under.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, as an-
other one from Arizona, let me close by
thanking the ranking member and also
noting that 2026 is around the corner.
The work that was being done today
with this drought contingency plan is a
very important door into what needs to
be done in the future, the cooperation,
the collaboration, and the urgency
going forward.
As Mr. SCHWEIKERT said, the job is
not complete yet. There is much still
to do.
I hope that the stakeholders and ev-
eryone involved in getting the plan to
this point continue, with earnestness
and with purpose, to address the issue
of water availability in the Southwest.
As our areas become more and more
arid, understand that this is not an in-
finite resource we have in water. It is a
finite resource, and we need to treat it
that way.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the legislation, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2030.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

SECRETARY NIELSEN’S
RESIGNATION
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, hallelujah.
Yesterday evening, Homeland Secu-
rity Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen re-
signed. Good.
Under the Trump administration and
Secretary Nielsen, both of whom were
empowered by my colleagues across the
aisle, the United States of America
ripped children away from their par-
ents and put them into tent cities.
Ripping children away from their
parents and lying about it to the Amer-
ican people was evil, and it should have
ended Secretary Nielsen’s career a year
ago. Then, in December 2018, two little
children died in the custody of the Fed-
eral Government while under the care
of Secretary Nielsen.
She should have done the honorable
thing at that time and resigned. Those
children did not deserve to die. That
will be Secretary Nielsen’s legacy.
Mr. Speaker, the next Secretary of
Homeland Security must commit to
laying out for the American people a
plan of action that ensures our border
policy respects human life, promotes
safety and dignity, and reins in this ad-
ministration’s horrible policies.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ARTHUR
SEYMOUR, JR.
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, the
city of Knoxville and the people of the
Second Congressional District lost a
distinguished citizen and leader on
March 11 when my good friend, Arthur
Seymour, Jr., died at the age of 74.
Arthur was born in Knoxville and
lived there his entire life, leaving only
to attend the University of the South
at Sewanee and to serve in the U.S.
Army.
He was a leading attorney in east
Tennessee and was an example of what
an attorney should be. He was fair,
well-prepared, honest, objective, and
relentless for his clients.
He was involved in many civic orga-
nizations and was a strong leader at St.
John’s Episcopal Church. He served on
the Knoxville Airport Authority as a
board member and chair of the East
Tennessee Historical Society.
He virtually never missed an election
and took his civic duties very seri-
ously. He and his wife traveled exten-
sively in Europe, and Arthur had a par-
ticular interest in literary matters.
For several years he belonged to a book
club which met regularly, and he was
always reading a book.
His life was enhanced by a 50-year
marriage to his wife, Susan, who was a
longtime teacher in our wonderful city
of Knoxville.
Arthur Seymour, Jr., was truly an
example of what a citizen should aspire
to be.
f
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY SECRETARY
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it
is well known that the Department of
Homeland Security, established after
the heinous and unspeakable acts of 9/
11, is one of America’s most important
departments.
It is tragic that during the tenure of
this administration, it has been in the
midst of confusion and dishevelment.
The Department needs long and strong
leadership. Secret Service, Customs
and Border Protection, Border Patrol,
many other departments that are cru-
cial, those dealing with domestic ter-
rorism, those dealing with transpor-
tation security, it needs someone that
can make an independent decision that
separating children from families is
not the right thing to do; that the bor-
der crisis is a humanitarian crisis; that
the fences that have been built are still
being built through funding that has
come from previous administrations.
I wish well the Acting Secretary that
is now in the position, but I will tell
you that I wish more well to the hard-
working employees every day that
work to keep this Nation safe.
Leave the Department alone, and let
its leadership work its will on behalf of
the security of the American people to
do the right thing and to act accord-
ingly to the decency of the rule of law.
f
HONORING THE LIFE OF FREDDIE
WARMACK
(Mr. YOHO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor the legacy of one of my con-
stituents, Mr. Freddie Warmack, from
Newberry, Florida, a small rural com-
munity of approximately 6,000 in north
central Florida.
Following a lifetime of public serv-
ice, Mr. Warmack passed away on April
1, 2019, at the age of 87. Mr. Warmack
dedicated his life to the betterment of
his community and country.
As a young man, Mr. Warmack
served his country in the Korean War.
Upon his return to Newberry, Florida,
he became a city commissioner and
went on to be elected the first African
American mayor of Newberry, where he
served from 1984 to 1994. During the 10
years that Mr. Warmack served as
mayor, he instituted a great change in
the Newberry community. He helped
start the Meals On Wheels program and
served on the Central Florida Commu-
nity Action Agency.
He helped institute the historic city
hall still used today and renovated the
first African American school in the
city and the adjoining property into a
park named in his honor.
Mr. Warmack’s compassion and re-
spect for others has left an impact on
all those who were lucky enough to
have known him, and I would like to
honor the accomplishments and legacy
of Mr. Warmack and the strides he has
made for his community and commu-
nities across our great Nation.

CONGRATULATING CHRISTENE
MOSS ON 29 YEARS OF SERVICE
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Christene Moss
for 29 years of dedicated service to our
community as a trustee on the Fort
Worth Independent School District
Board of Education.
Christene has dedicated her time on
the board to improving children’s lit-
eracy by working with parents and
teachers to close the achievement gap
and pushing to create a facility for
homeless students.
Christene, who is from Lake Como,
Texas, now living in Carver Heights in
the Stop Six community, spearheaded
projects for the board of education, in-
cluding creating the Fort Worth ISD’s
first community forum and working to
reinstate music and art programs into
the school curriculum.
In 2013, she also made history becom-
ing the board’s first Black president.
For years, Christene has been an active
member of the Texas Caucus of Black
School Board Members where she
served as president and helped to men-
tor the next generation of Black lead-
ers.
Her passion for the community will
be enshrined in our neighborhood
through the children’s library, and ele-
mentary school named in her honor.
We will miss Christene’s service on
the board, but we are very grateful for
her decades of service and the legacy
that she has left behind for students in
Fort Worth.
We wish her the very best as she
moves on to the next chapter in her
life.

CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, recog-
nized each April, Child Abuse Preven-
tion Month has brought awareness to
the needs for families and communities
to work in tandem to prevent child
abuse and neglect, while promoting the
social and emotional wellbeing of both
children and families.
Texas’ Third Congressional District
is incredibly fortunate to have court
appointed special advocates, or CASAs,
of Collin County serve our commu-
nities. These volunteers work tirelessly
on behalf of abused and neglected chil-
dren in our community, and we are in-
credibly grateful for their work.
Mr. Speaker, today and every day, let
us come together as a community to
make a positive difference in the lives
of these children to ensure their fu-
tures are safer, brighter, and healthier.
f
AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE
HEALTHCARE
(Mr. CASE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, most of our
fellow Americans just want us to as-
sure them that the necessities of life
are available and affordable: food, shel-
ter, education, safety. Are they avail-
able and affordable?
Most of our fellow Americans would
add to that available and affordable to
all Americans, because the promise,
opportunities and responsibilities of
citizenship are shared, and are best
shared by all of us. Nowhere is this
more evident than in healthcare.
The question before us all now is how
to ensure that quality healthcare is
available and affordable for all Ameri-
cans.
We can, should, and must continue
the great debate over how best to do
so, for healthcare remains unavailable
to tens of millions of Americans,
unaffordable even when available, and
widely inconsistent on quality.
What we can’t, shouldn’t, and must
not do is take a giant step backward to
strip tens of millions of Americans of
any semblance of available, affordable,
quality healthcare. That is exactly
what we would do if the Affordable
Care Act were repealed by this Con-
gress or our courts.
To those few who don’t agree with
our basic promise to start with, please
get out of the way. To those who do,
but don’t agree that this is the best
way forward, let’s hear your concrete
proposal.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
ALLRED). Members are reminded to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair.
CONGRATULATING INDIAN RIVER
STATE COLLEGE
(Mr. MAST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and congratulate Indian
River State College on being named a
winner of the 2019 Aspen Prize for Com-
munity College Excellence.
IRSC has made it their mission, lit-
erally, to provide the best to every stu-
dent developing academic plans. They
have proven their ability to consist-
ently improve student success rates.
Their effort to create educational op-
portunities beyond the 2-year degree
have produced amazing results worth
recognizing.
I have been on the campus many
times. I have never spoken to a student
there that hasn’t said anything but
praise for IRSC.
So congratulations to Indian River
State College, to Dr. Massey on receiv-
ing this special recognition to help
educate and prepare the next genera-
tion of young professionals for success.
f
DO NOT REPEAL AFFORDABLE
CARE ACT
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to tell Lucia
Huete Suarez’ story. Lucia, an immi-
grant from Nicaragua, lives in Kendall.
Ten years ago, she was healthy, work-
ing at a job she enjoyed, living a nor-
mal life.
Her life changed when she was diag-
nosed with chronic pancreatitis. She
was heartbroken when she had to stop
working due to her illness. Now, she
pays high copays for monthly lab work
and procedures even with insurance.
Every time Trump threatens to re-
peal the Affordable Care Act and rip
away protections for preexisting condi-
tions, it is Lucia and 300,000 others liv-
ing in my district whose lives are on
the line.
I was proud to stand with colleagues
to introduce legislation to protect
Lucia and every other Floridian, every
American living in fear of Trump’s at-
tacks on healthcare.
I stand in opposition to Trump’s
heartless attacks and reiterate that we
must all support the Protecting Pre-ex-
isting Conditions and Making Health
Care More Affordable Act.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

APPRECIATING DESIGNATION OF
SUSQUEHANNA NATIONAL HER-
ITAGE AREA
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, today, I
rise to thank some individuals who
helped in the passage of my bill, the
Susquehanna National Heritage Act,
which designates York and Lancaster
Counties in the district that I rep-
resent as a national heritage area.
I thank Senator BOB CASEY, who has
been working on this in the Senate for
12 years, as well as Representative ROB
BISHOP from Utah, who helped push
this bill through the Natural Resources
Committee when he served as chair
there last year. Representative TOM
MCCLINTOCK was chair of the sub-
committee.
Also, I would like to recognize Mark
Platts and Jonathan Pinkerton of Sus-
quehanna Heritage. They have been
proposing this and working on it in the
district, and they will be helping to
manage this national heritage area.
I also thank Columbia Mayor Leo
Lutz, who testified in support of the
bill last year.
National heritage areas celebrate the
special historic places in our country
and highlight the beauty and natural
resources of our community. They also
provide 148,000 jobs and nearly $13 bil-
lion in economic growth. Our area will
definitely benefit from this designa-
tion.
I am very proud to have worked with
these folks to help this bill become
law. I am also grateful to my col-
leagues who supported the passage of
this bill, and I thank them for their
hard work and help.

RECOGNIZING EAGLE SCOUT
MICHAEL BRYAN
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I am
grateful for the opportunity to honor
an outstanding member of south Jer-
sey. Over the weekend, Michael Bryan
of Dennis Township, New Jersey,
achieved the great honor of being
raised to Eagle Scout. Michael is a
member of the National Honor Society
and, for his Eagle Scout project, ac-
quired the skills to weld a stand for an
American World War II plane propeller
that was pulled out of the Atlantic
Ocean. It honors the 42 servicemembers
who perished during training at NAS
Wildwood.
Michael plans to follow in the foot-
steps of his father and his grandfather
and enroll in the Coast Guard to brave-
ly serve and defend our country.
We are all looking for heroes. Some
look to celebrities. Some look to Wash-
ington, God help them. But I look to
men like Michael Bryan who make a
difference in their community. He is
south Jersey’s hero. He is an American
hero.

RECOGNIZING WORK OF CUSTOMS,
BORDER PATROL AT THE SOUTH-
ERN BORDER
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
tonight to speak about our recent trip,
on Friday, to Calexico, California, on
the southern border between California
and Mexico, with President Trump and
several of my colleagues here from the
House.
What really stood out the most to me
on this visit was the dedicated men and
women who do this important work
along the border from the U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection and the
U.S. Border Patrol. They did make it
very clear to us in the group that they
don’t currently have the personnel, the
funding, the infrastructure, and even
the commitment by Congress to do ev-
erything they need to do to get their
job done well.
This includes the continued need for
a physical barrier along the border,
which they have seen and have dem-
onstrated works very well. They rein-
forced that fences do, indeed, work.
They serve as chokepoints for those
who are trying to come across the bor-
der illegally. We have much to do in
this department if we are going to have
a secure border.
For this time, my hat is off to them
for the great work they do and for
being honest with us about what needs
to be done so they can do their jobs
well instead of watching them go right
on by into our country.
f
RECOGNIZING GRIFF DOYLE
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Griff
Doyle, who retired as the University of
Georgia’s vice president of government
relations on Friday, March 22. Mr.
Doyle dedicated 40 years to good gov-
ernment throughout Georgia, and a
large part of his career has been crucial
to UGA becoming a premier public uni-
versity in this country.
Before he started with the univer-
sity, he worked with the Georgia Pub-
lic Policy Foundation, with former
Governor George Busbee, and as an as-
sistant U.S. attorney in the State.
Experiences like these gave him a
priceless breadth of knowledge that en-
abled him to be one of the most impor-
tant figures at the University of Geor-
gia.
While at the university, he educated
Members of Congress on the latest re-
search projects and secured funding
necessary to move those projects for-
ward, keeping UGA itself, the State of
Georgia, and our entire Nation as glob-
al research leaders.
He also contributed directly to the
students by placing 40 interns annually
in congressional offices and even teach-
ing seminars in government.
Thank you, Griff, for your personal
friendship and for your dedication to
our State and our beloved University of
Georgia. Your work has truly been in-
valuable. Enjoy your retirement.
f
CALLING FOR A BUDGET PLAN
(Mr. STEIL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, where is the
proposed budget plan? We just voted to
approve the use of the Capitol Grounds
for a soapbox derby, but we can’t vote
on the budget?
Article I of the Constitution gives
Congress the primary responsibility of
creating spending priorities for the Na-
tion. The President submitted his
budget weeks ago. Rather than ful-
filling this obligation to govern, House
leadership is asleep at the wheel.
It is irresponsible to not allow us to
vote on a budget resolution. We are
more than $22 trillion in debt. We can’t
continue this broken process. The
American people deserve to see the
Speaker’s spending priorities and know
where taxpayer dollars are going to be
spent.
Mr. Speaker, I say to Speaker
PELOSI, show me your budget. Let’s
vote on a budget. Let’s get to work.

CELEBRATING THE 2019 MASTERS
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, this week
in Augusta, Georgia, we celebrate a
tradition unlike any other: bringing to-
gether the most elite golfers in the
world to take on the prestigious Au-
gusta National Golf Club for the first
major of the year, the 2019 Masters
Tournament.
The first full week of April in my
hometown of Augusta is always filled
with excitement and great competi-
tion, creating one of the most electri-
fying atmospheres in all of sports.
This year, I am thrilled that a new
tradition has unfolded. This past Sat-
urday, the inaugural Augusta National
Women’s Amateur took place at the
famed Augusta National for the first
time.
I congratulate the entire field for
their stellar performance and espe-
cially our women’s amateur champion,
Jennifer Kupcho.
I also thank Chairman Ridley, the
membership of Augusta National, and
all the volunteers for their continued
success in conducting the finest com-
petition in sports and in growing the
game of golf worldwide.
This special week allows the world to
get a glimpse into Georgia’s 12th Dis-
trict and the wonderful people who live
and work there. I am looking forward
to the final round on Sunday and the
2019 champion putting on that coveted
green jacket. The tradition that en-
compasses the Masters is truly special.
f
CLOSING THE IMMIGRATION
LOOPHOLE
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to bring attention to the wors-
ening humanitarian and national secu-
rity crisis on our southern border. In
the past 6 months alone, over 200,000
migrants have been detained by the
Border Patrol, nearly twice as many as
the previous year.
Currently, caravans of migrants are
headed north with little to no opposi-
tion by neighboring governments. The
U.S. must demand regional coopera-
tion. While fleeing their countries to
escape poverty, gang violence, and
crime, they fall victim to coyotes and
criminals on the trek to our border, in-
cluding women and children.
Our immigration facilities are too
full to house, and our court systems
are too burdened to process, these
cases. This results in migrants being
released into America, most never to
be seen again.
We have a moral obligation to Amer-
ican families across this land to close
these immigration loopholes, secure
our borders, and restore the rule of
law.
Congress must fix our broken immi-
gration system, and we must do it now.

RECOGNIZING THE 35TH
ANNIVERSARY OF NCMEC
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I rise to recognize the 35th
anniversary of the founding of the Na-
tional Center for Missing and Exploited
Children, NCMEC.
Every child deserves a safe childhood,
but each year, hundreds of thousands
of children are abducted, abused, and
exploited. NCMEC serves as the na-
tional clearinghouse and coordinated
response center to locate missing chil-
dren, combat sexual exploitation, and
prevent victimization.
NCMEC’s impact cannot be over-
stated. Since its founding in 1984,
NCMEC has assisted law enforcement
and families with more than 25,000
cases of missing children and helped to
identify more than 16,700 children who
were victims of sexual abuse. Thanks
to NCMEC’s efforts, law enforcement
has successfully recovered more than
290,000 missing children.
NCMEC’s dedication to serving vul-
nerable children and their families is
remarkable, and I am proud to honor
NCMEC as it continues its tireless ef-
forts to bring children home.

April 8, 2019
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S
FAILED POLICIES IN THE
NORTHERN TRIANGLE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) is recognized for
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I am
grateful for this opportunity to speak.
I thank Representative CLYBURN for al-
lowing me a few minutes to address a
pressing issue before he assumes con-
trol of this Special Order hour.
Last week, the President of the
United States made politically moti-
vated announcements that he will seek
to cut U.S. aid to Honduras, Guate-
mala, and El Salvador, which together
are commonly known and referred to
as the Northern Triangle countries. In
making his decision, the President
cited asylum seekers—moms, children,
seniors, and young men—who make up
the migration patterns from these na-
tions that reflect themselves at the
southern border.
As it turns out, Mr. Speaker, I was in
the region with some of my colleagues
from both sides of the aisle when the
President articulated his plan to freeze
foreign aid for this part of the world.
This aid has effectively helped curb vi-
olence in El Salvador, forge economic
hope, and furnish essential health and
education programs there as well.
While on this trip with key members
of the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary
Committees, we met with leaders from
the region and El Salvador and dis-
cussed the relationship between the
United States and their respective
countries with great optimism.
I will admit, Mr. Speaker, the man-
ner in which our President views and
discusses our regional partners stands
in stark contrast to the security objec-
tives and economic commonalities we
discussed with his Central American
counterparts.
When our President rambles on about
‘‘evil people’’ pouring into our country
and the millions and millions of dollars
we are just giving these governments,
comments that are not only racist in
scope but patently false, he fails to un-
derstand that this very aid is our best
approach and our best tool in address-
ing the migration patterns to the
southern border.
With our assistance, these countries
can make tangible progress toward
building an environment where their
citizens feel safe, industry prospers,
and people receive the essential serv-
ices they need and deserve.
b 1945
When my colleagues and I were in
Mexico, a country that perhaps has re-
ceived more of the President’s verbal
attacks than any other country in the
world, we discussed budding economic
zones in the country and the sweeping
development initiatives its new Presi-
dent Lopez Obrador has undertaken.
We discussed the fact that less than
12 percent of the folks going back from
the southern border to their countries
of birth are from Mexico.
We discussed the curtains of eco-
nomic development that the Mexican
President plans to put forward—not a
wall, curtains of economic develop-
ment: a rail line in the Mayan coast;
reforestation of the southern border of
Mexico; and infrastructure, very ambi-
tious infrastructure projects close to
the northern border.
Perhaps we should look at that as a
guide to what we should do here in our
Nation.
And having conversations about
shutting down our border as we were
there was not something very positive
for our visit.
In El Salvador, we met with ambi-
tious, 38-year-old President-elect Nayib
Bukele. He detailed his intentions to
work more closely with the United
States, specifically, to review and re-
evaluate Chinese influence and an
agreement with China that he has in-
herited from the previous government.
He also informed us that, because of
our help, Mr. Speaker, homicide has
gone down 50 percent in El Salvador.
At one point, 104 people per 100,000 peo-
ple were being killed, the highest
homicide rate in the world. It is now
down 50 percent—still a war zone, but
down 50 percent. Young people are
being recruited away from the gangs.
What they really need now is a shot
in the arm for economic development
and jobs. That is what will help with
the migration patterns that reflect
themselves at the southern border.
And this young President has cap-
tured the enthusiasm of the young peo-
ple. He campaigned against corruption
and violence; yet, while we were there,
the President threatened to cut the aid
to El Salvador.
In fact, we should take what we did
there to Guatemala and Honduras, be-
cause it is working.
And it is clear, Mr. Speaker, that
this is all summed up that the Presi-
dent fails to share our optimism that
collaboration will lead to a solution in
this region.
He fails to register the miserable mo-
tivations that would prompt somebody
to seek refuge for their families in an
unknown country thousands and thou-
sands of miles away. People just don’t
get up and leave their families and
neighborhoods. They do that because
they are facing violence, because they
are facing abject poverty, because they
are facing natural disasters.
The President fails to understand
that. He fails to understand, Mr.
Speaker, that Chinese and Russian in-
fluence in Central America is growing
and that every step we take backwards
will result in two steps forward for
them and will leave a vacuum of lead-
ership in the region.
Right now, the President is simply
failing—failing the American people
and failing our allies.
I look forward to reviewing this issue
this week when the Foreign Affairs
Committee holds a hearing on the ad-
ministration’s failed policies in Central
America.
We must hold him accountable.
Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank
Whip CLYBURN for allowing me some
time to address this issue on behalf of
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in

HONORING ERNEST ‘‘FRITZ’’
HOLLINGS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN) will control
the remainder of the hour as the des-
ignee of the majority leader.
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, it is
with mixed emotions that I stand in
the well here this evening with my col-
leagues from South Carolina. We are
here because our State and our Nation
has lost a giant of a man, one whom I
call a one-of-a-kind statesman, Ernest
‘‘Fritz’’ Hollings.
A native of Charleston, South Caro-
lina, he graduated from The Citadel in
1947, and the very next year, 1948, he
was elected to the South Carolina Leg-
islature. There, he served until being
elected Lieutenant Governor in 1954.
I am pointing out some years here
because I want to make a statement
about the man Fritz Hollings.
He was elected Governor in 1958.
Now, in 1947, some interesting things
were taking place in South Carolina at
the time Ernest Hollings graduated
college; and, in 1948, when he was elect-
ed to the legislature, a very significant
court decision was handed down.
The court case was Elmore v. Rice,
the 1948 court case that opened up the
South Carolina Democratic primary to
people other than Whites. This was the
atmosphere within which Fritz Hol-
lings was first elected.
And, of course, in 1954, when he was
elected Lieutenant Governor, I need
not tell anybody what Court decision
came down that year. That was the
year that the Supreme Court ruled
that school desegregation had to take
place. That was the atmosphere.
So, 4 years later, Fritz Hollings gets
elected Governor. I was a student on
the campus of South Carolina State
when he was elected, and in 1960 is
when I first met Fritz Hollings.
He was Governor, and I was orga-
nizing sit-ins in Orangeburg, South
Carolina, and he had invited us to the
State house. He gave me a great lesson
that day in politics, so much so, that
what we talked about in his office on
that day I still have not told anybody.
Well, fast-forward. Fritz Hollings,
Governor of a State with tremendous
challenges. So what did he do? Did he
just meander through time, as so many
did in those days? No.

H3122 April 8, 2019
Fritz knew what the challenges were,
and he put forth trailblazing legisla-
tion to create the South Carolina Tech-
nical Education System. That was a
big deal in those days. In fact, it be-
came a national model.
But he didn’t stop there. He blazed
another trail, creating the South Caro-
lina Educational Television Corpora-
tion. That was really a big deal, and it
was viewed as trailblazing innovation,
like no other State had made up until
that time.
But that was not his last test. In
1962, just before he was to finish his
term as Governor, the courts ruled
that Clemson University had to accept
another Charlestonian, Harvey Gantt,
as a student. Of course, there was much
resistance.
Fritz spoke to the legislature and
said to them on that day: We have run
out of courts, and we are going to be a
nation of laws. And he called upon all
South Carolinians to set aside the acri-
mony and accept the fact that it was a
new day in South Carolina and the Na-
tion.
And, of course, Harvey Gantt peace-
fully integrated Clemson University.
All of that was because Fritz dem-
onstrated the kind of leadership that
we would expect any public servant to
give.
Fritz and I became fast friends after
I came here in 1992. Of course, we
interacted quite a bit down in Charles-
ton. Of course, he got elected to the
United States Senate in 1966. We
interacted quite a bit.
Fritz had a tremendous wit, and I re-
member when I first came up here,
1993, there was a reception held because
I had become, with his help, the first
African American to represent my
State in the Congress in 95 years. So
there were somewhat interesting kinds
of interactions taking place.
We go to this reception, Fritz Hol-
lings along with then-Senator Strom
Thurmond, and I was being presented
to the group. One of them made a joke
out of the fact that I had met my wife
in jail when Fritz was Governor.
I guess I brought it upon myself be-
cause I reminded him of our first meet-
ing and the fact that we were not ex-
actly on the same page in those days.
So, when I yielded the mike to him,
he told the group about my meeting
my wife in jail when she brought a
hamburger and shared a hamburger
with me, and he said to the crowd:
‘‘And he has been eating out of her
hand ever since.’’ It brought a great
chuckle in the crowd, and I was re-
minded never to get smart in front of
Fritz Hollings again.
Well, we have lost Fritz. But just be-
fore he really began to fail in health,
Fritz called me and said he wanted me
to do something for him. He said he
wanted me to put in a piece of legisla-
tion to remove his name from the Judi-
cial Center in Charleston.
I asked him: Why do you want me to
do that?
He said, because Judge J. Waties
Waring was the judge who made that
decision in 1948 to open up the Demo-
cratic primary to people of color, he
thought that J. Waties Waring, because
of that decision and others—equalizing
teacher pay between Black and White
teachers, writing a dissenting opinion
in Briggs v. Elliott that became the
foundation for the 1954 United States
Supreme Court decision—he said to me:
J. Waties Waring is the one who is de-
serving of having his name on that
courthouse. That is the courthouse
where the Briggs case was decided.
b 2000
And I said to him: Now, maybe this
would pass in the House, but what
would happen over in the Senate?
And he told me that he had already
talked to Senator GRAHAM, and he
wanted this done. I told him I would
get back to him because it is not some-
thing that I wanted to do.
Well, I called Senator GRAHAM. He
told me that Senator Hollings had
called him. But I still would not do it.
I called Senator Hollings back and I
asked him, in a second conversation,
was I going to be able to depend upon
him to hold when the bill was intro-
duced because I anticipated some reac-
tions that would be unfavorable, and in
his Gullah-throated way, he assured me
that he would stand firm.
I then called the Congressional Re-
search Service and I asked them: Has
anything like this been done before?
Has anyone in the history of this great
country ever asked that his or her
name be removed from a Federal build-
ing in order to accommodate someone
else?
They came back to me several weeks
later and said, no, that had never been
done before.
We put forth the legislation. It
passed the House and the Senate, and I
joined with Senator Hollings and oth-
ers at the ceremony removing his name
from the Judicial Center in Charleston,
South Carolina. Today, the name of J.
Waties Waring is on that building.
Fritz Hollings, a one-of-a-kind states-
man.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON).
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I thank Mr. CLYBURN for in-
viting the delegation to participate in
honoring the late Senator Ernest F.
‘‘Fritz’’ Hollings.
Every day, when I travel across
South Carolina, I am reminded of an
extraordinary achievement of Senator
Hollings, when he served as Governor.
He helped establish the technical col-
lege education system to develop
trained workers in manufacturing.
This enabled South Carolina to recruit
new industry, foreign and domestic.
As Governor, there was no auto pro-
duction, there was no tire production
in our State. Today, because of the
highly skilled, trained workers, South
Carolina is the leading exporter of cars
from any State in America. Two years
ago, this was $10.4 billion of product.
South Carolina is now the largest man-
ufacturer and exporter of tires of any
State. Thousands of jobs have been cre-
ated.
Our citizens will always cherish the
vision of Senator Hollings to help fami-
lies have fulfilling lives. Our thoughts
and prayers are with the Hollings fam-
ily and his many friends.
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Horry County,
South Carolina (Mr. RICE).
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, Fritz Hollings dedicated his
life to service. Whether it was serving
in World War II, as Governor of South
Carolina, or as a United States Sen-
ator, the legacy he leaves behind is
simply amazing. He embodied what it
meant to be a part of the Greatest Gen-
eration. He truly had a servant’s heart.
During his Governorship, he was a
champion of the civil rights movement
and helped ensure the peaceful integra-
tion of South Carolina schools. He is
also credited with creating the State’s
technical college system which, to this
day, helps people connect with jobs and
opportunities. He also helped develop
the Charleston Port, which has turned
South Carolina into a world-class ex-
porter and one of the most competitive
places to do business in the country.
An absolute titan in the United
States Senate, he spent nearly 40 years
advocating for policies that would ben-
efit South Carolinians and Americans.
Though I never had the pleasure of
serving with him, I know that he
brought South Carolina spirit to Wash-
ington with his sharp tongue and quick
wit.
He will be missed, but we can find
comfort that he is reunited in Heaven
with his beloved wife, Peatsy.
I am honored to join my colleagues
and all South Carolinians in cele-
brating his remarkable life.
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from South Carolina
(Mr. DUNCAN).
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I
rise to remember and pay tribute to
the late Senator Fritz Hollings, who
was a true statesman through and
through.
As Governor Henry McMaster said on
Saturday, learning of Senator Hollings’
passing: ‘‘One of South Carolina’s
greatest lions roars no more.’’ Those
are powerful words to describe Senator
Hollings.
His life was dedicated to the service
of South Carolina and the United
States, and the positive impact he
made on our communities will be felt
for years to come.
I heard fine words from Mr. CLYBURN
earlier; he talked about his career. But
Senator Hollings’ career spanned for
many decades, beginning with his grad-
uation from The Citadel to his service
as an artillery officer fighting for free-
dom during World War II. Like many in
the Greatest Generation, he put his life
on the line for our country at a very
young age.
He then moved into service on behalf
of the constituents of South Carolina

in a variety of roles, including Lieuten-
ant Governor, Governor, and, most no-
tably, here in the Halls of Congress,
where he spent decades—36 years, I
think—serving as a United States Sen-
ator.
He became well known as a national
figure, a trailblazer, a respected fighter
and champion for the American people
in so many areas, including commerce
and defense.
I met him in 1987 when I was working
for Senator Strom Thurmond.
He will go down as one of the most
effective Senators on record, and it is
safe to say, there will be no one else
like Senator Hollings.
Beyond his work ethic and advocacy
for South Carolina, he was known as a
genuine person, respected by folks from
all walks of life, from every political
party and from all 50 States.
His decades of work left South Caro-
lina and our Nation better off; for that,
there is no doubt. He was the true em-
bodiment of selflessness and public
service. His legacy will be felt for gen-
erations to come.
My prayers and condolences are with
his loved ones, as well as appreciation
for all he did for the lives of all of us.
God bless his family as they mourn
the loss of a true giant, selfless public
servant, and, definitely, a dedicated
leader.
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from South Carolina
(Mr. CUNNINGHAM).
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I
want to thank Majority Whip CLYBURN
for yielding and for his service to the
rest of the delegation of South Caro-
lina.
This weekend we lost the most trans-
formational leader South Carolina has
ever seen. Fritz Hollings left his mark
on our economic development, our edu-
cation system, civil rights, desegrega-
tion, and countless other areas. There
is no doubt we are all better off be-
cause of his service.
Hollings was once referred to as a
‘‘Senator from central casting,’’ and, in
many ways, he represented the ideals
of public service: service to his country
in uniform during World War II, to the
Lowcountry in the State house, and to
his State as Lieutenant Governor, Gov-
ernor, and U.S. Senator.
He was a true statesman who exem-
plified character, courage, integrity,
and honor. The action he took was
often not easy or politically popular,
but it was always with what was best
for South Carolina in mind.
As we honor his life over the coming
days and weeks, I hope we can all pause
to reflect on how his legacy can guide
us now more than ever. Hollings made
a lifelong career out of fearlessly doing
what was right, working across the
aisle to reach remarkable achieve-
ments, and always putting the people
of South Carolina over politics. We
need that sort of leadership now more
than ever.
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from New York (Mr.
MORELLE).
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to also add my condolences to the
Senator’s family.
I remember, as a young boy growing
up interested in politics, that I was al-
ways struck by his thoughtfulness, the
demeanor in which he held himself in
an era where we were in full-contact
politics all the time. Senator Hollings
was an extraordinary American and a
great patriot, and I join with my col-
leagues in offering condolences to the
family and remembering his extraor-
dinary legacy.
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to close this tribute tonight by ac-
knowledging that this is the 50th year
since Fritz Hollings’ hunger tour.
A lot of people may remember, in
1969, Ernest Hollings embarked upon a
tour—or several tours of South Caro-
lina. The first one was on Charleston’s
East Side, and it was my great honor
to lead him, along with Sister Mary
Anthony, on that tour so that he could
see some of the anxiety, some of the
wanting that was present in his home-
town.
He went from there to other places
throughout the State, most especially,
Beaufort, Jasper County. Many people
may remember, he, after a tour with a
Dr. Gatch in Beaufort County, Fritz
wrote a book called ‘‘The Case Against
Hunger.’’ That book was eye-opening
to a lot of people.
In fact, he made the case for signifi-
cant expansion of community health
centers throughout the South, and he
made the case for what we now call the
WIC program: Women, Infants, and
Children. It was that book and that
tour; and 2 years later, I took a tour
with his classmate from The Citadel,
John Carl West, who was my mentor in
government.
When West became Governor, he then
took a tour. He wanted to retrace some
of Fritz’s steps and redouble the efforts
to eradicate poverty.
Poverty is still with us. Ill health is
still with us. Hunger among children is
still with us.
I am going to be moving, at several
points this year, to memorialize Fritz
by calling upon my colleagues to re-
double our efforts for children, for
women, for infants, for the poor.
b 2015
I would hope that as we think about
Fritz, we will think about that passage
of scripture found in Matthew 25 where
we are told that it is incumbent upon
us to feed the hungry, clothe the
naked, and do right for those who are
less fortunate.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

SOCIAL SECURITY IS THE NA-
TION’S PREMIER INSURANCE
PROGRAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LAR-
SON) for 30 minutes.
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr.
Speaker, I am honored to be on this
floor and to hear the eloquence of JIM
CLYBURN talking about a legend in Sen-
ator Fritz Hollings.
Mr. Speaker, it gives us pause this
evening, and I am honored to be joined
by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, a
young man who has served his Nation
with dignity as well, as we talk about
something equally important and near
and dear to Fritz Hollings’ heart as it
is to all America: Social Security.
We have introduced a bill. On
Wednesday at 2 o’clock we will be hav-
ing our fourth hearing on the subject
matter of Social Security. We are hon-
ored to see that that is going forward,
because there haven’t been hearings for
some time on the matter of expanding
Social Security.
Under the leadership of NANCY
PELOSI and now RICH NEAL on the Ways
and Means Committee and a return to
regular order, we are focusing on the
needs of the American people, and
nothing is more important than Social
Security.
Let me start by underscoring some-
thing that should be intuitively obvi-
ous to everyone, but oftentimes is
overlooked: Social Security is not an
entitlement. Social Security is the in-
surance that people have paid for.
How do we know this? We know it
simply because you only have to look
as far as your pay stub, whether it is
weekly, biweekly, or monthly, under
the definition of FICA.
FICA stands for the Federal Insur-
ance Contributions Act. Whose? Yours.
Citizens all across this Nation under-
stand that they have contributed to
this program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3124 April 8, 2019
I want to give the President of the
United States a shout-out here, be-
cause even under the intense scrutiny
of the campaign, when challenged by 16
other Republicans, President Trump
alone amongst the Republicans said:
No, this is not an entitlement. This is
an earned benefit, and I intend to pro-
tect it.
Not only does Social Security need
protection, as CONOR LAMB under-
stands, but it needs to be expanded. It
needs this, because the last time that
this Congress did anything significant
with respect to Social Security was in
1983.
In 1983, Ronald Reagan was the Presi-
dent of the United States, Tip O’Neill
was the Speaker of the House. And you
know what? A Democrat and Repub-
lican were able to come together and
change Social Security and make sure
that it would be there for future gen-
erations.
However, they didn’t do a number of
things that would have enhanced the
program, and it has been 36 years since
there has been any change to Social
Security, the Nation’s premier insur-
ance program.
Mr. Speaker, I ask the viewing audi-
ence: Have any of your insurance pre-
miums gone up since 1983? And, of
course, everyone knows what the an-
swer is.
It is not the people’s fault at home or
citizens all across this Nation. It is the
responsibility of the United States
Congress to make sure that the Na-
tion’s premier program, a program that
not only provides a pension, but pro-
vides disability and spousal and de-
pendent coverage, is there.
It is the only program out there that
provides the full faith and credit of the
United States Government, and, by the
way, has never missed a payment.
Yet, if we do nothing, if we continue
to kick the can down the road, then by
as soon as 2034, just 15 years from now,
there will be a 21 percent cut in the
program, sending many people on the
program currently into poverty.
That cannot stand. The time for us to
act is now.
That is especially true given the cir-
cumstances that have taken place in
this Nation, especially as recent as
2008.
If you will observe the chart on my
left here, what this demonstrates is es-
sentially from 2007 to 2010, the Great
Recession, what we have witnessed
happen to Americans with respect to
their overall wealth and assets.
What we see is that only 10 percent of
the people of this country, and they
happen to be in the top 10 percent of
wealth, have recovered from the Great
Recession. Just 10 percent.
Imagine if Social Security had been
privatized, as was intended by the Bush
administration in 2005. Thankfully, it
was not, because people depend on So-
cial Security. They depend on Social
Security because they know it is the
only guarantee that is there for them.
I have gone across this country
speaking to people about Social Secu-
rity and our enhancements and what
we do, and I take with me two props:
one is the actuary report of Social Se-
curity 2100, the bill that CONOR LAMB
and 206 other Members of this body are
original cosponsors of; and I also carry
with me this Starbucks coffee. This
happens to be empty, but it is part of
my prop, and I will get to that shortly.
But what we said to the actuary is
that what we wanted to do is make
sure that Social Security not only re-
mains solvent for beyond the 75 years,
as it is required by law, but we needed
to enhance it. The last time it was en-
hanced by this body was 36 years ago.
So that is why CONOR LAMB and my-
self and so many others have stepped
forward to say, let’s add and enhance
this, and let’s do it in four ways.
Number 1, let’s have a 2 percent
across-the-board increase for all Social
Security recipients.
Number 2, let’s not let anyone who
has paid their quarters into Social Se-
curity, who has worked hard all of
their lives, retire into poverty.
Unfortunately for many Americans,
especially women, that is the case.
Why would that be so? It is so because
women have been the caregivers in our
society and had to take time off to
raise families, to take care of children.
Also, unfortunately, women have found
themselves in the workplace earning 77
cents for every dollar their male coun-
terpart was. This change in the law
will correct that.
We also found, and CONOR LAMB
pointed this out several times, that
there were people that he talked to
who were still working, many out of
necessity, some because of the joy that
they find and the fulfillment of their
lives in being active and busy, but
nonetheless, they found that they were
being taxed on their Social Security,
because back in 1983, we did not index
Social Security, so that back then, if
you were single and making more than
$24,000, you were taxed, if you were a
married couple and making more than
$32,000, you were taxed.
So what CONOR and others said is,
let’s raise that to $50,000 for an indi-
vidual and $100,000 for a couple, and im-
mediately 12 million Americans will
get a tax break under this bill.
We also wanted to adopt something
that the AARP has fought for, which is
to have a COLA that actually reflects
the costs that you incur when you are
older, whether that is doctor visits,
whether it is nutritional concerns,
whether it is physical therapy, or
whether it is heating and cooling your
home. These are the things that you
need and are important to you, and
that is what the COLA should reflect,
and that is what we put in the bill.
Most of all, we have to make sure
that the bill is sustainably solvent be-
yond 75 years, as is required by law, so
that no one in any generation could
say that it won’t be there in the future.
In fact, it has always been there. It
has never missed a payment. It has a 99
percent loss ratio.
What does that mean? That means it
is the most efficient government pro-
gram there is. It is the Nation’s insur-
ance program.
I have heard my good friend and col-
league talk about this often, and I
yield the floor to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB).
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr.
LARSON for yielding to me.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here
tonight.
Last year, during a long campaign
season, two campaigns and two elec-
tions, there was no issue in western
Pennsylvania that came to me from
my constituents more often than So-
cial Security, and it was usually with a
heavy heart.
I will never forget one man who came
up to me at an event. He was about 77
years old. He told me how he started
paying into Social Security when he
was 12. They don’t really make them
like that anymore, but in western
Pennsylvania, people started working
at earlier and earlier ages to make
ends meet.
The gentleman had worked in a fac-
tory. He had been laid off. He told me:
We were in the streets, not sure where
to go during the day, but we didn’t
want our kids to know that we were
out of work.
He had five kids.
He became a janitor, got hurt on the
job, needed his union to stick up for
him, but that cut into his prime years
of earning.
So the gentleman becomes 65, he re-
tires, eventually collects Social Secu-
rity, but he still works to this day as a
janitor.
So he is telling me all about his life,
and he pulls out one of those big key
rings that every janitor seems to have,
and he shoves it into my hand. He had
pulled off of it the dog tag that he car-
ried when he served in the U.S. Army
in Korea in the 1950s.
He pressed it into my palm and he
just looked up at me and said: Don’t
you break your promise to us. If you
get a chance to go down to Wash-
ington, D.C., you fight for Social Secu-
rity, you fight for Medicare. You prom-
ised these programs to us and you have
got to keep your promise.
I will tell you, I don’t think a man
his age and his experience wanted to
have to stand there and ask a 33-year-
old young congressional candidate to
stick up for him in that way.
That was a promise that we made,
and it is not an entitlement. It is some-
thing he paid into for over 45, 50 years
of a working life.
Mr. Speaker, I wonder if Mr. LARSON
has met constituents like that back in
Connecticut as well.
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr.
Speaker, no question about it. We were
just at a senior center in Elmwood on
Friday and had the same experience.
I think, really, people find it annoy-
ing when this is called an entitlement,

only had to look at their pay stub to
know that they had made these con-
tributions.
To say that this is an entitlement,
when you look at the investment that
you have made over a lifetime, nothing
could be further from the truth, and
that is why it is so important that we
get the Social Security 2100 Act passed
into law.
b 2030
Mr. LAMB. It is the most important
thing we can work on in this Congress
for many of the people who are af-
fected.
The problem is, as you said, it hasn’t
been adjusted since the 1980s, and a
couple of really important things have
happened since then. When Tip and
President Reagan struck the last deal
on Social Security, there wasn’t the
heroin epidemic that we see today.
One of the problems that we have in
western Pennsylvania is that we are
losing a lot of young parents in their
30s and 40s to heroin, fentanyl, and pre-
scription drug overdoses. Because they
come from good families, their aunts,
their uncles, and their parents are
stepping up and taking care of the kids
who are left behind.
I have run into dozens and dozens of
senior citizens in western PA who are
raising kids on their Social Security
benefits. They are working part time,
too. They can barely make ends meet.
Social Security wasn’t designed for
that.
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr.
Speaker, it is interesting that the gen-
tleman points that out because people,
oftentimes, think of Social Security
only as a pension benefit. As he just
pointed out, one in five recipients are
currently on Social Security who are
not retired, who are spouses, or there
are children because of a death in the
family that took place.
So here it is, the Nation’s single
most important insurance program
taking care of those individuals, even
in cases of calamity, whether it be
through the opioid crisis or whatever
the case may be. That is why Social
Security remains so vitally important
to all generations, at all ages.
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, it is why we
need to make sure that those who do
choose to continue to work, and many
will, see the benefits of that work.
Here we are calling for a tax cut and
promising to account for every penny
of it with a proper adjustment to the
other taxes and the payroll tax. You
would almost think we were Repub-
licans standing up here tonight. But
the Republicans, instead, have chosen a
path through their tax bill to cut taxes
for a very different group of people, the
people who make more than $500,000 a
year, and the people on the boards of
the largest and most powerful corpora-
tions in our country.
I think that is what frustrates so
many people today, that the average
Social Security benefit now, at this
point, is—what?—about $16,000. The
people who benefited from the tax cut
in 2017 make $500,000, $1 million, or
even more than that per year. There
are far more people earning closer to
$16,000 in this country than there are at
the very top.
If we are going to have special breaks
in the Tax Code for anyone, or if we are
going to do anything with our tax laws
to benefit anyone, it should be those
folks who are just trying to get by.
They are not going on vacation with
this money. They are not going to Dis-
ney World. And they are not going on a
cruise. They are paying for prescrip-
tion drugs, and they are paying for gro-
ceries.
Mr. CLYBURN just talked about hun-
ger and how Fritz Hollings was fighting
hunger 40 and 50 years ago. Well, senior
citizens in the United States are going
hungry today. They have a very simple
choice. They have a certain amount of
money, and they can go to the grocery
store or to the drugstore, but they
can’t do both. Usually, they go to the
drugstore to stay alive, and they skimp
on the rest.
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr.
Speaker, the gentleman makes an ex-
cellent point. There is nobody who is
getting wealthy on the Social Security
program, but it is essential to their
very existence and essential to our
economy. Every penny that goes into
Social Security comes right back and
is recirculated through our economy
because these are the things that are
needed to sustain life.
It is such an important point, Mr.
Speaker. I said earlier that I carry this
Starbucks, and you make an apt com-
parison here. In terms of the $2 trillion
tax cut that was passed in the previous
session, 83 percent of that tax cut goes
to the Nation’s wealthiest 1 percent.
When you contrast that to the bill we
are proposing that says that we want
to make sure that people are able to
subsist on a program of insurance that
they have paid into, it seems utterly
cruel that this hasn’t already taken ef-
fect and taken hold. What is even
more, we are not going to do it by pass-
ing on debt to a future generation. It is
paid for.
All those recipients, I know they say
it in Connecticut, and I heard it again
in West Hartford, and I know the gen-
tleman has heard it as well in his com-
munities: We don’t want to be a bur-
den, not to our families or future gen-
erations.
Well, they have never been a burden.
They were the generations that made
this Nation what we are today, so we
paid for this bill. We paid for it in two
ways.
Number one, we lift the cap over
$400,000. So if you are one of the six-
tenths of 1 percent in this Nation who
make over $400,000, we are going to lift
the cap off that Social Security so that
you are paying what the guy making
$50,000 is.
Then we do something else. We do
what Roosevelt intended and what
every American knows because they
consult their bill. We increase the con-
tribution that you make in your pay-
check by 1 percent.
But then we say: No, even 1 percent
is a lot. We are going to phase that in
over 25 years to accomplish what
should have been done in 1983, indexing
it and phasing it in slowly over time.
What does that mean? That means a
person earning $50,000 a year would pay
50 cents a week to make sure that he
gets all the benefits we have described
for Social Security and that it is sol-
vent beyond 75 years. For 50 cents a
week, a disability policy, dependent
coverage, spousal coverage, and a pen-
sion, you could not purchase that in
the private market. It is the full faith
and credit of the United States Govern-
ment that makes it possible because of
the individual contribution.
That is where this Starbucks comes
in. When I am at a public forum and
when I am doing a townhall, I say to
people: How much is this Starbucks?
They will ask if it is a latte. I say
yes. They say $4.50.
I go: You are right. Or 9 weeks of So-
cial Security payments if you are mak-
ing $50,000 a year. Or if you are that in-
dividual making over $400,000 a year, it
costs more to buy this Starbucks latte
than it will to save Social Security.
We can do this together. This is why
we have been going all across the coun-
try. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman, as well, for going out and put-
ting this online and on Facebook, mak-
ing sure that we are getting the mes-
sage out that, no, you are not a burden
to us; you are our fellow Americans.
This isn’t a Democratic or a Repub-
lican or an independent plan; this is
the American plan. In fact, it was
President Reagan who enhanced it, and
it was President Eisenhower who en-
hanced and grew the program of Social
Security. That is why it becomes vi-
tally important that we help out our
fellow citizens, especially with this dis-
parity and, as in the chart we showed
before, with many Americans still not
recovered from the Great Recession of
2008.
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, how many
programs do we really have that are
truly universal, that are truly for
every American, in which we all share
the sacrifice and we all share the ben-
efit? We are all in this together at the
end of the day.
A very wise man said to me once that
one of the problems we have in Amer-
ica today is people think the economy
is like the weather. You might be able
to predict it, and you might be able to
prepare for what is coming, but you
just can’t do anything about it.
Well, that is not true. The economy
is a set of rules written down on pieces
of paper and it is the set of people who
are there to enforce them.
This is a better rule than anything
the other side has. This is a rule that
allows us to keep our promise. This is
a rule that says, if you paid into this
for all your working lives and now all
you are asking for is about $16,000 a

year to be able to live with some dig-
nity in your old age, after you finished
the project of a lifetime of building the
country that we all enjoy, we are going
to make sure that is there for you, and
we are going to make sure we keep our
promise.
We think it is a pretty good bet to
side with the folks who are getting
$16,000 a year over the folks who are
making $16 million a year. We think
that is a pretty good bet, and we are all
going to share the burden together
going forward.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. LARSON for

in history, since 36 of his 38 years in
this body came alongside Senator
Strom Thurmond.
But there was nothing ‘‘junior’’
about Fritz’s career, his impact, or his
larger-than-life personality. By the
time I arrived in the Senate, Fritz had
already built a reputation as a war vet-
eran, State legislator, Governor, Sen-
ator, and as a candidate for the Demo-
cratic Presidential nomination. He had
raised a family between his hometown
of Charleston and the State capital,
Columbia.
At every turn, he was a square-jawed
southern gentleman. In every case, he
was someone who would call things ex-
actly how he saw them. Fritz spoke his
mind with cutting wit and undeniable
sincerity on causes that captured his
attention. As a result of his passion
and skill, his name will be forever
linked with a long list of important
achievements here in the Senate. He
called attention to a growing Federal
budget deficit, advocated for the needs
of our Nation’s men and women in uni-
form, and confronted the tragic pov-
erty in America’s own backyard, espe-
cially child hunger.
So today the Senate mourns not just
a friend and former colleague but a
true example of what it means to live
a life of service. We mourn with Fritz’s
family and the people of South Caro-
lina, and we join them in celebrating a
life so fully lived.
RESIGNATION OF KIRSTJEN NIELSEN
Madam President, on a completely
different matter, Department of Home-
land Security Secretary Kirstjen
Nielsen announced that she is con-
cluding her 2-plus years of service to
the administration and to the Amer-
ican people.
The men and women of DHS keep
America safe on a dizzying array of
fronts. They confront natural disas-
ters, guard our coasts, defend our crit-
ical infrastructure, and maintain many
of our Nation’s cyber security defenses.

S2286 April 8, 2019
Of course, the pressure on the De-
partment has only been heightened as
a result of the ongoing security and hu-
manitarian crisis at the southern bor-
der. The Department has to balance
countless complicated missions, from
defending against criminal gangs and
stopping the inflow of dangerous illegal
drugs to protecting victims of human
trafficking and providing care for the
individuals they detain.
Through all of these challenges, Sec-
retary Nielsen provided experienced
and steady leadership. Her grasp of the
issues and dedication were major assets
for the Department and, as a result, for
our country.
My colleagues and I thank her for her
service, and we wish her well.
NOMINATIONS
Madam President, this week the Sen-
ate will continue its work to move
well-qualified nominees off of the Exec-
utive Calendar and to give the Amer-
ican people the government they elect-
ed. We will do it more sensibly and effi-
ciently thanks to last week’s action to
restore order to the nominations proc-
ess.
As we discussed extensively last
week, the past 2 years have offered a
record-setting display of how com-
prehensively a Senate minority could
prevent a President from putting his
team in place, extending even to thor-
oughly uncontroversial nominations.
Fortunately, last week we took a big
step toward restoring the sort of pro-
ductive nominations process that had
once been the Senate’s routine. Now it
is time to move forward together. This
week the Senate will be able to con-
sider a number of the President’s capa-
ble nominees to positions in the execu-
tive branch and on the Federal bench.
We will begin with Daniel Domenico,
named to serve as U.S. district judge
for the District of Colorado. Mr.
Domenico is a graduate of Georgetown
University and the University of Vir-
ginia School of Law. His well-rounded
legal career includes a clerkship on the
Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, a term
as solicitor general of Colorado, as well
as work in private practice. I would en-
courage each of my colleagues to join
me in supporting Mr. Domenico’s nomi-
nation.
We will follow with the consideration
of Patrick Wyrick, nominated to the
Western District of Oklahoma; then,
Cheryl Stanton, to be Administrator of
the Labor Department’s Wage and
Hour Division; then, General John
Abizaid, to be Ambassador to Saudi
Arabia; and then, Holly Brady and
David Morales, to serve as district
judges in Indiana and Texas, respec-
tively.
These are six more well-qualified
nominees who, among them, have
passed a combined 2,364 days since the
Senate received their nominations. Let
me say that again. These six well-
qualified nominees, among them, have
passed a combined 2,364 days since the
Senate received their nominations.
But, most importantly, they are six of
the many nominees who will receive
now more prompt consideration here
on the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RESIGNATION OF KIRSTJEN NIELSEN
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we
learned yesterday that Secretary
Kirstjen Nielsen was stepping down
from her position as Secretary of the
Department of Homeland Security. I
just got off the phone with her and
thanked her for her service.
When the Department was first es-
tablished more than a decade and a
half ago, we knew that this position
would be a very tough one, especially
in the aftermath of 9/11—the terrible
terrorist attacks. We knew that pro-
tecting the American people from the
growing threat of terrorism was job
No. 1. The truth is that this job has
only gotten tougher as time has gone
by. While counterterrorism remains a
central focus for the DHS, the number
of missions it is responsible for, both
on the ground and in cyber space, has
multiplied to include a myriad of nat-
ural and manmade threats.
Since Secretary Nielsen has taken
this job, she has led the Department’s
response through flooding and
wildfires, foreign attempts to infiltrate
our election infrastructure, and the
growing humanitarian crisis we con-
tinue to see unfold along the southern
border.
Above all, Secretary Nielsen has been
a fierce advocate for the men and
women at the Department who carry
out these diverse missions on a daily
basis. With more than 240,000 DHS em-
ployees around the world—many of
them in Texas—keeping them mission-
ready is one of the most important re-
sponsibilities the Secretary has, and it
is one she has taken very seriously.
I have had the opportunity to work
closely with the Secretary on a number
of issues but in particular on attempt-
ing to find commonsense reforms to se-
cure our border and close loopholes
that are being exploited in our immi-
gration system. I have been consist-
ently impressed by her deep knowledge
of the issues and of her steadfast com-
mitment to finding solutions.
America is better off for her service,
and I hope we will continue to find
good people like the Secretary who will
be willing to contribute their service to
the betterment of our country. I thank
her, and I wish her well in the next
chapter of her life.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Madam President, the Senate Fi-
nance Committee will continue with
hearings tomorrow on the high cost of
prescription drugs. I hear a lot about
this back home in Texas. Whether they
are seniors who struggle to cover the
costs of the prescriptions they have
been taking for years or will be taking
for the rest of their lives or whether
they are parents who face tough finan-
cial decisions to make sure their chil-
dren receive the medications they
need, their stories can be heart-
breaking. I have no doubt that all of
my colleagues here in the Senate and
in Congress hear the same things back
home from their constituents.
A February Kaiser Family Founda-
tion poll found that nearly 80 percent
of Americans believe that the cost of
prescription drugs is too high, and
nearly 30 percent of adults, because of
the cost, report their not taking their
medications as prescribed. In other
words, they are self-rationing, and it
can be dangerous.
Without intervention, I don’t expect
these prices to drop anytime soon. In
fact, the Centers for Medicare & Med-
icaid Services has estimated that be-
tween 2018 and 2027, consumers could
expect to see their prescription drug
costs increase by an average of 6.1 per-
cent each year. That is faster than the
increase in doctors’ visits, hospital
stays, or any other aspect of
healthcare.
What exactly is behind these high
prices? That is exactly what the Senate
Finance Committee is going to find
out. Over the last few months, we have
been looking at every step a drug takes
when it is en route from research and
development to the bottle in your med-
icine cabinet, and we have been asking
a lot of questions along the way. We
have heard from patients, health
economists, and pharmaceutical com-
panies.
We will be talking tomorrow mainly
to pharmacy benefit managers, or
PBMs, who are the intermediaries be-
tween the manufacturers, consumers,
and health plans. They negotiate with
manufacturers to secure rebates, which
should lower the price of the prescrip-
tion drugs for patients, but many times
they do not. The size of a rebate could
mean the difference between a drug’s
being covered by your insurance or not.
There are a lot of financial incen-
tives in healthcare and prescription
drug pricing that we need to peel back,
like one would the layers of an onion,
so that we will know exactly what is
going on. What I find so surprising is
that for as big a role as PBMs play, we
know surprisingly little about how
they operate.
The terms of these rebates, including
dollar amounts and incentives, are
cloaked in secrecy. Since there is no
paper trail or standard procedure on
how these rebates or discounts are de-
termined, it is nearly impossible to fol-
low the money. I have always told peo-
ple that I am not sure why prescription
drug pricing is so complex. I don’t
know whether it is by design or if it is
unintentional, but it certainly exists.
This lack of transparency for the con-
sumer is concerning, as it should not
take an advanced degree to figure out

where your money is going when you
buy your prescription drugs.
I am eager to question these PBMs
tomorrow and to hopefully begin to re-
move the shroud of secrecy sur-
rounding these rebates and prescrip-
tion drug prices. Finding out what has
led to these rising prices is critical to
ensuring that Americans are able to re-
ceive the drugs they need at prices
they can afford.
TICE FAMILY
Madam President, on a final matter,
several families were in Washington
this last week to advocate for the re-
lease of their loved ones by two rogue
regimes. One of the men being held
captive in Syria is Austin Tice.
There are many ways you can de-
scribe Austin. He is a seventh-genera-
tion Texan, a decorated Marine Corps
veteran, an Eagle Scout, and an award-
winning journalist. Yet, to Austin’s
family, he is so much more than his
impressive list of accomplishments. He
is their beloved son, brother, and friend
whom they have not seen or heard from
for 61⁄2 years.
In the summer of 2012, Austin was
getting ready to enter his final year of
law school at Georgetown University.
Instead of spending the summer work-
ing at a law firm, he chose to do some-
thing few were brave enough to do at
the time, which was to report on the
Syrian civil war from the inside. Aus-
tin always had a passion for story-
telling, and he was frustrated by the
lack of reporting on the impact this vi-
cious violence was having on the Syr-
ian people.
In demonstrating his courage and te-
nacity gained during his time in the
Marine Corps, Austin got on a plane
that May to fly to Turkey. Over the
summer, his photos and stories illumi-
nated the human cost of this conflict
until one day in August of 2012 his sto-
ries abruptly stopped. The following
month, a shocking video surfaced that
showed Austin’s having been blind-
folded, bound, and surrounded by un-
identified, armed men. Austin was just
a few days from returning to the
United States when he was abducted,
and to this day, we have no specific in-
formation about his captors or the con-
ditions for his release.
Austin’s family—particularly Marc
and Debra, his parents—has worked
tirelessly over these last 61⁄2 years to
locate Austin and to bring him home. I
have had the privilege of meeting with
them multiple times, and I can only
imagine what an impact this has had
on them and on their entire family. I
have tremendous respect for Marc,
Debra, and their family. I wonder if
others could stand up under this pres-
sure as well as they have, lo these
many years, during their steadfast ad-
vocacy for their son’s safe return. Yet
they do have a sort of serene con-
fidence that comes across when you
talk to them in that one day, Austin
will return home.
Once again, I join the Tice family in
calling on Austin’s captors to release
him immediately. I also continue to
call on the administration to make
sure that Austin is kept in mind when
there are any discussions with the Syr-
ian Government and future decisions to
remove U.S. forces from Syria. I assure
Austin’s family that our resolve has
not weakened; it has only grown
stronger. I will do everything possible
to press for his release, and I will con-
tinue to urge the administration to do
the same.
CITGO 6 FAMILIES
Madam President, sadly, Austin is
not the only American being held cap-
tive by a rogue government regime
today. In fact, he isn’t even the only
Texan.
In November of 2017, days before
Thanksgiving, six Citgo executives
were summoned to Venezuela for meet-
ings with Citgo’s parent company, Ven-
ezuela’s state-owned PDVSA. During
the final meeting, these men were de-
tained by the Venezuelan Government,
and for the past 16 months, they have
been held captive beneath a military
intelligence compound in Caracas.
They have been denied contact with
the State Department. They have been
held without a trial. They have been
unable to receive humanitarian aid. As
the already horrible situation in Ven-
ezuela continues to worsen, their con-
ditions are likely deteriorating even
further.
In February, the children of two of
these men wrote an op-ed in the Hous-
ton Chronicle that detailed the suf-
fering of their fathers and that all six
families have faced. They wrote: ‘‘In
their isolation, our fathers have bonded
together over a shared purpose: to stay
strong in body, mind and spirit in an-
ticipation of their eventual return to
their families.’’
I assure these families that we will
continue to stand alongside them in
this fight. I call on the Maduro regime
to immediately release these Ameri-
cans and to allow them to return home.
I have continued and will continue to
urge the administration to make sure
this remains a top priority.
Just as we have worked closely with
the Tice family over the last 6 years in
advocating for the release of Austin,
their son, we will continue to do the
same for these six men. The heartbreak
felt by these families is unfathomable.
Their spouses, children, and grand-
children are desperate to have their
loved ones returned home. Together,
we should do everything in our power
to make that a reality.
Madam President, I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

REMEMBERING FRITZ HOLLINGS
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
today I wish to start off by just sharing
a few words about our former col-
league, Senator Fritz Hollings—Ernest
F. Hollings, to be precise—of South
Carolina. He passed away this weekend
at his home in Isle of Palms.
With Fritz Hollings, the people of
South Carolina, the Senate, have lost a
giant. Hollings was the longest serving
junior Senator in American history—
behind, of course, Strom Thurmond—
representing his constituents for 38
years in the Senate.
Before that, he was a Governor, State
legislator, and World War II veteran.
Public service was his life’s calling. He
championed education reform, increas-
ing teachers’ pay, a national voice in
the fights against hunger and poverty.
He was brought up in the old Jim
Crow days, with a great deal of seg-
regation, but as he went through South
Carolina, he realized how terrible that
was and began to move in the opposite
direction.
He was an original. You could always
go over to Fritz Hollings. Even when I
was a younger legislator, he would pay
attention, and he would have some-
thing very interesting to say.
Everyone talks about the days of
blow-dried, look-alike Senators. Fritz
Hollings certainly wasn’t one of them.
He was an original, and we were all
much better for it.
So Fritz, we will miss you, and our
thoughts go with your family, as do
our prayers and well wishes.
DISASTER RELIEF FOR PUERTO RICO
Now, on another matter, Puerto
Rico. Last week, Senator LEAHY and I
offered this Chamber a chance to pass a
natural disaster funding package that
would have addressed everyone’s con-
cerns in the Senate.
The ‘‘all of the above’’ solution we
presented contained $16.7 billion in re-
lief for all Americans affected by nat-
ural disasters. I would add, I see my
two friends from Iowa on the floor
today, one in the President’s chair, one
ready to speak. That would have in-
cluded far more money for the Midwest
than the Republican bill because the
Republican bill that was on the floor,
while it added 2019 to disaster relief,
didn’t add in any more money despite
the devastation in Iowa and Missouri
and Nebraska.
Well, our bill added an additional—an
additional—$2.5 billion in funding for
the disasters of 2019, and the vast ma-
jority of that would go to Iowa, to Mis-
souri, and to Nebraska, but it also pro-
vided much needed aid for the people of
Puerto Rico and other territories. They
need the help, too, and they are Ameri-
cans citizens as well.
Let’s face the music, folks. Everyone
knows what is going on here. Demo-
crats and Republicans had agreed, as
we always do, when there is a disaster,
we help. The original bill that was put
together had aid for Puerto Rico, as

S2288 April 8, 2019
well as aid for the other areas of dis-
aster. The original bill was put to-
gether before the Midwest so it didn’t
have that.
What happened? Is it that somehow
our Republican friends from the Mid-
west and elsewhere thought Puerto
Rico didn’t deserve the aid? No; Presi-
dent Trump went to a Tuesday lunch,
banged his fist on the table—figu-
ratively, I suppose—and said: I don’t
think any aid should go to Puerto
Rico.
Did our Republican friends, espe-
cially those from States with disasters
and who needed the aid, say: No, no; we
are not going to do that; we are not
going to let you divide us? No; they
went gamefully along with it, hurting
their States.
We all know that if there is no real
aid for Puerto Rico, the House will not
pass the bill. We in the Senate on the
Democratic side do not want to hold
Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, and the
other States, Florida, Texas, Alabama,
that are getting the aid hostage for
what we want, and our Republican
friends shouldn’t hold Puerto Rico hos-
tage for what they want.
This grand tradition seems to crum-
ble here day by day, minute by minute,
of helping States that need help; that
when one American is hurt in one area,
Americans in every other area come to-
gether and say: We are going to help.
That is why we have disaster aid be-
cause the enormity of a tornado or a
wildfire or a hurricane—the taxpayers
of that State can’t afford to do it all
themselves. So citizens throughout
America have had, in effect, a compact
that says, when one area is hurt, we all
come together.
Look, I suffered a little from that
when New York had Sandy. We had
some of our Senators from the very
States—from the very States—that
now are requesting aid say: Don’t give
aid to New York for Sandy. I have
never done that. I have always been for
aid to States that are far away from
New York and just have Republican
representation. We don’t do that here—
until now. Until now.
So I would say to all of my friends on
the other side of the aisle, there is a
way out of this—provide the aid that
originally Senators SHELBY, a Repub-
lican, LEAHY, a Democrat, agreed on.
Don’t let Donald Trump’s nasty temper
tantrum somehow about Puerto Rico
get in the way. Do the right thing, and
he will sign the bill. We know he will
sign the bill. He is not going to stop aid
for Texas or Florida or Iowa or any
other State because this body and the
House have put in aid for Puerto Rico.
Let me just mention, just as the peo-
ple in the Midwest are suffering, people
in Puerto Rico are suffering. That is-
land has had a slower recovery from a
storm of greater magnitude than any
others we are talking about.
So we need to vote on this legisla-
tion. It is not an either-or situation.
To say you are putting $600 million in
food stamps for Puerto Rico so people
will not starve, when they are not get-
ting the same aid everybody else gets—
CDBG, FEMA—that is not right, that
is not fair, and that figleaf will not
cover up the real motivation of Presi-
dent Trump, which, unfortunately, I
don’t think most of our Republican col-
leagues agree with, but they go along
with. Everyone is afraid on the other
side of anything President Trump
does—right or wrong. Unfortunately,
he is wrong far too often.
Puerto Rico needs aid so they can re-
build. They need the food aid, but they
need more than that. Trump wanted to
cut out all of it. Someone on this side
said: Well, you have to at least do food
aid. He said: Well, I will do that and
nothing more. That is not right.
Should we do food aid just for every
State? Should we do food aid just for
Texas or just for Florida or just for
Iowa? No rebuilding? Let all of those
houses and homes and factories and
stores suffer? No. We wouldn’t do it for
those States. We shouldn’t, and we
shouldn’t do it for Puerto Rico.
So then we decided to compromise
even more. There is $20 billion of aid
already for Puerto Rico that hasn’t
been allocated. The President, in his
nastiness to the people of Puerto
Rico—citizens, they are American citi-
zens—refused to allocate that money.
Well, Senator LEAHY then said: Let’s
just take $8.3 billion of that and free it
up. Our colleagues will not even do
that.
So when the American people want
to know what is holding up this bill,
when the people in the flooded areas
and the areas that have been hit by
wildfires and hurricanes want to know
what is holding it up, it is Donald
Trump picking one part of the country
and saying: ‘‘I don’t want to give aid to
them,’’ and too many—just about every
one of our colleagues, at least thus
far—going along.
Elections have consequences. The
House is now Democratic. It is their
strong view that we ought to give aid
to Puerto Rico. It is a view I share, but
if we don’t do the right thing in this
body, where we have a tradition of
coming together, and you say Presi-
dent Trump will not sign something,
when he originally had nothing to do
with putting together this bill, we are
all going to be stuck for quite a while.
We are all going to be stuck for quite
a while. Let us in the House, in this
body, the Senate, come to a com-
promise that satisfies the Midwest,
that satisfies the hurricane States of
Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, and Ala-
bama, that satisfies Texas, and get
moving. That is what we should be
doing.
This idea that we are holding up this
bill, when the House wouldn’t pass it
anyway; the idea that we are holding
up this bill, when we know the history
that President Trump went into that
lunch and changed everything around
in the nasty way that he can’t even ex-
plain—uh-uh; that is not going to fly.
That is not going to fly.
RESIGNATION OF KIRSTJEN NIELSEN
Madam President, on Secretary
Nielsen, Kirstjen Nielsen submitted her
resignation as the Secretary of Home-
land Security. When we look back at
this moment, I think we are going to
remember Secretary Nielsen’s tenure
as a cruel chapter, in which the Agency
followed through on President Trump’s
worst impulses. Those include advo-
cacy for Trump’s ineffective and expen-
sive wall; her support for the longest
government shutdown in history that
didn’t produce anything for President
Trump; most regrettably, her full em-
brace of the child separation policy,
leading to thousands of children being
ripped away from their families.
Some say Secretary Nielsen argued
inwardly against some of these. Well,
she should have left a long time ago.
She shouldn’t be advocating for poli-
cies that are so, so wrong. Maybe it is
better, maybe it is worse if she knew
they were wrong, but it is not good, no
matter what.
Through it all, in fact, she continu-
ously misled the American public, even
insisting once that ‘‘we do not have a
policy of separating families at the
border. Period.’’
Well, that was just absolutely false,
and Americans from every part of the
country were just appalled by that. In
fact, some people say one of the rea-
sons the House went Democratic is a
lot of suburban Republican women
didn’t like that policy, as they
shouldn’t have. So it wasn’t even po-
litically as smart as maybe President
Trump thought it was.
Despite Secretary Nielsen’s advocacy
for the wall, for her support of the
shutdown, her embrace of the child sep-
aration policy, which she always mis-
led Americans about, she still wasn’t
radical enough for President Trump.
As NBC News reported this morning,
President Trump has urged for months
that his administration reauthorize the
awful practice of separating little, tiny
children and babies from their parents.
This is further proof that the Presi-
dent is kowtowing to the worst in-
stincts of people and to the conserv-
ative, hard-right, and extreme voices in
the Republican Party, with no or little
regard for our national security or the
ability to function efficiently.
What he has done by these constant
firings, the constant change of policy,
has simply created chaos at the border.
Nobody knows what the policy will be
from day to day and week to week and
month to month. He doesn’t tell the
top people in his departments that he
has changed his plans.
He fired, evidently, Mr. Vitiello,
without even Secretary Nielsen know-
ing about it.
This erratic, nasty style of governing
is not solving any problems at the bor-
der, and the more problems and chaos
there is, the more people are going to
see it is President Trump, as President,
can’t solve this problem, despite his
rhetoric, where he appears tough but
doesn’t solve the problem.

April 8, 2019
DISMISSAL OF SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR
RANDOLPH ALLES
Madam President, on the Secret
Service Director’s dismissal, this
brings me to my final point.
Just a few hours ago, the White
House confirmed that it has now also
asked that Secret Service Director
Randolph Alles step aside. His depar-
ture comes in the midst of recent re-
ports about potentially serious secu-
rity vulnerabilities surrounding Presi-
dent Trump, particularly at Mar-a-
Lago. That is why the outgoing Secret
Service Director must testify before
Congress as soon as possible about the
potential security vulnerabilities at
Mar-a-Lago, vulnerabilities that in-
volve a Chinese national arrested with
malware on her person and other
threats.
The public and Congress need to
know the extent to which adversarial
governments like China are attempting
to infiltrate and conduct electronic
surveillance on classified conversations
or other information regarding na-
tional security at President Trump’s
properties. The President and the
White House staff may like to treat
hiring and firing in the administration
as some kind of reality TV show or par-
lor game, but to the American people,
this has real-life consequences.
This is about national security, secu-
rity at our airports, responding to na-
tional disasters, including our efforts
to fight international cargo carrying
drugs like fentanyl. That is why it is
urgent to get to the bottom of this and
why the outgoing Secret Service Direc-
tor must testify as soon as possible.
Now, all three of these comments—
what is happening in Puerto Rico, what
is happening with the Department of
Homeland Security, and now the Se-
cret Service—indicate just the chaos
that seems to be overwhelming this ad-
ministration.
President Trump’s policies, if he has
them, switch from day to day. He is er-
ratic. He seems to get emotional. He
pushes out whatever is on his mind
that day no matter its consequences,
and this country is floundering. There
is a lot of rhetoric and not much else.
All these people leaving in very im-
portant positions—the President un-
dercutting them, not calling them into
the office and having a discussion, but
tweeting and ranting. I have never seen
America governed like this—never.
And I don’t care what your political
affiliation is. I don’t care if you are a
liberal, moderate, or conservative.
What is happening in this White
House—as it fails to lead this country
and does seem something like a TV re-
ality show—is hurting us. It is hurting
us and hurting us badly, and I hope we
can get some bipartisan efforts to do
things about this and to speak up
about it.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
BOOZMAN). The senior Senator from
Iowa.
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE
AGREEMENT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for 1
minute before I speak about what I
came for a longer period of time to the
floor to speak about, I want to address
a trade issue. Congress needs to pass
the United States-Mexico-Canada
agreement this year to give farmers
and businesses the certainty that they
need and the certainty they deserve.
The past year has brought rising
costs, lost markets, and uncertainty
for the farmers and businesses. We need
to focus on creating opportunities in-
stead of erecting barriers. I would like
to see a resolution with Canada and
Mexico on steel and aluminum tariffs,
one that would acknowledge that we
need our allies to help us deal with the
source of the overcapacity problems,
and that source of the problem is
China.
I urge President Trump to lift the 232
tariffs so that we can forge ahead with
the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement and
eliminate the uncertainty that is
present in the American market.
MUELLER REPORT
Mr. President, now for the main pur-
pose of my coming to the floor: After
years of hearing Democrats falsely pro-
claim that the Trump campaign
colluded with Russia, Special Counsel
Mueller found no collusion existed.
The fact that there was no collusion
is a very positive development, not just
for this administration, but for the en-
tire country. However, it does seem
that the real collusion occurred with
Democrats, and I will explain.
It was the Clinton campaign and
Democratic National Committee that
hired Fusion GPS to do opposition re-
search against Candidate Trump. Fu-
sion GPS then hired Christopher
Steele, a former British intelligence of-
ficer, to compile the Steele dossier
that reportedly used Russian Govern-
ment sources for information.
You see, it was the Clinton campaign
and the Democratic National Com-
mittee that funded the document that
largely created the collusion narrative,
a narrative that has been deemed false,
and of course, that is the irony here.
The Democrats paid for a document
created by a foreign national with re-
ported Russian Government sources,
not Trump. President Trump did not do
that. The Democrats did. But appar-
ently, it is not over yet, or so the
Democrats tell us every day. Their
next step is to subpoena the entire
Mueller report.
Well, I agree that Congress and the
public should see that information, and
it sounds to me like President Trump
agrees as well. The Attorney General
has already said, on multiple occa-
sions, that he is going to release as
much information as the law allows
and as soon as he can, and it looks like
Congress—and likely the public—will
get the Mueller report this month of
April sometime.
But Democrats have requested more
than just the report. They have asked
the Justice Department to also produce
the Mueller report’s underlying evi-
dence, including all intelligence-re-
lated information.
I agree with the need to see as much
information as possible. In fact, I have
cosponsored a bipartisan bill that
would do just that, but the Democrats’
fury over Mueller’s findings and their
inconsistent positions makes me think
all of this is more about politics than
principle.
After all, the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee opposed the re-
lease of this type of information in the
1990s. To guard against that political
gamesmanship, there is only one legiti-
mate way to do this: Let’s see all the
documents.
But by all—I don’t mean just those
related to the Mueller investigation—
we should see every piece of evidence,
including evidence connected to how
the Russia investigation started.
Now that should be a very easy ask,
and do you know why? I have already
requested that information. For exam-
ple, I have asked documents related to
Steele, his dossier, and campaign-re-
lated FISA applications.
These documents relate to actions
taken by James Comey, Peter Strzok,
and Bruce Ohr and are critical to Con-
gress fully understanding the creation
of the Russia investigation. If Congress
is going to review the Mueller report
and all underlying information, it
should be able to review information
relating to how the Russia investiga-
tion started.
So will the Democrats join me in
that effort and support my request?
Further, to be consistent, we
shouldn’t stop at the Russia investiga-
tion. The Democrats want all the
Mueller information, but seem to be
turning a blind eye to other investiga-
tions where Congress and the public
have yet to see every bit of informa-
tion that is out there.
Again, that leads me to believe their
request for Mueller-related documents
is a political ploy. Take, for example,
the Clinton investigation. Will Demo-
crats ask the Justice Department for
all the underlying information relating
to the Hillary Clinton investigation?
As I have written about publicly be-
fore, the Justice Department inspector
general produced to Congress a highly
classified document relating to the
Clinton investigation. That document
makes clear the Justice Department
and the FBI still ought to produce in-
formation to Congress and answer
more questions.
For example, the unclassified version
of the inspector general’s report pro-
vides important context about the clas-
sified report, and I have a long quote
here:
The FBI had considered obtaining permis-
sion from the Department to review certain
classified materials that may have included
information potentially relevant to the Mid-
year investigation. Although the Midyear
team drafted a memorandum to the Deputy
Attorney General in late May 2016 stating
that review of the highly classified material

was necessary to complete the investigation
and requesting permission to access them,
the FBI never sent this request to the De-
partment.
So the inspector general found four
important things, according to the un-
classified report. No. 1, the FBI appar-
ently had highly classified information
potentially relevant to the Clinton in-
vestigation in its possession. Two, the
FBI drafted a memo to get access to
the information. Three, that memo
said review of the information was nec-
essary to complete the investigation.
And then, four, ironically, that memo
was never sent.
Years later, when the inspector gen-
eral interviewed the FBI agents, they
said they didn’t seek access to the in-
formation because they didn’t think it
would materially impact the conclu-
sion. Now, how could they conclude
that point if they never got access to
the information?
In May of 2016, the memo was nec-
essary to complete the investigation,
and then years later, somehow, it
wasn’t. That is materially inconsistent
and obviously makes no sense. More-
over, look at the month the memo was
drafted: May 2016.
That is the same month that James
Comey began writing his statement ex-
onerating Hillary Clinton, which was
months before the FBI interviewed her.
Did Comey’s actions have a trickle-
down effect on his subordinates, caus-
ing him to kill the memo and pull their
punches? It seems to me that we ought
to find out.
To my colleagues, it sounds like the
FBI left a potential mountain of evi-
dence unreviewed. How can you com-
plete an investigation without review-
ing all the evidence relative to the in-
vestigation? The American people have
every right to question how this inves-
tigation was handled, and they deserve
answers.
Assuming President Trump has read
the classified inspector general report,
he would understand the importance of
the Justice Department responding to
my inquiries about it. I have written to
the Justice Department and other
agencies seeking those answers.
I would like to know, since the
Democrats want to investigate every-
thing dealing with collusion and the
Mueller report, would they join me in
that request?
I want to give you another example:
Uranium One. I have been pushing for
years for more answers about the
transaction that allowed the Russian
Government to acquire U.S. uranium
assets.
I have received classified and unclas-
sified briefings about it from multiple
Agencies, and I have identified some
FBI intelligence reports that may shed
more light on the transaction.
Just last week, my staff were told
that the Attorney General has refused
to provide access to those documents.
Well, if the Democrats demand intel-
ligence-related information from the
Justice Department regarding the
Mueller report, there is no reason they
shouldn’t do the same for Uranium
One. And if the Justice Department
provides that information about the
Mueller report, well, then, there is no
reason they should hold the Uranium
One material.
It kind of gets down to this point: If
the Democrats want to be consistent,
they will have to treat Clinton, Ura-
nium One, and Russia-related inves-
tigations the same. Anything less than
that reeks of political gamesmanship
and sets a clear double standard, and
that double standard also extends to
the position the Democrats have taken
with respect to obstruction.
We know Mueller did not conclude
that the President committed a crime,
and neither did the Attorney General.
Still, Democrats want to make the
case that Trump obstructed justice,
even though the Justice Department
said otherwise.
With no evidence, the Democrats
have accused the Attorney General of
bias, but Mr. Barr evaluated this mat-
ter in close consultation with Deputy
Attorney General Rosenstein—the per-
son who appointed Mueller in the first
place.
The Democrats are looking for abso-
lutely anything they can to make a
case when there is no case. But these
same Democrats and the Obama Jus-
tice Department didn’t bat an eye
when Clinton’s associates deleted
records subject to congressional sub-
poena and preservation orders.
In March of 2015, Secretary Clinton’s
attorneys had a conference call with
Paul Combetta, the man who helped
manage Clinton’s nongovernment serv-
er. After that call, he deleted Clinton’s
emails with BleachBit, a software pro-
gram designed to prevent forensic re-
covery.
I have seen no evidence that anyone
has even speculated that the President
ever did that or instructed anyone to
go that far. What also troubles me
about one aspect of the Clinton inves-
tigation is that the FBI agreed to limit
the scope of review to her time as Sec-
retary of State. That eliminated poten-
tially highly relevant emails before
and after her tenure that could have
shed light on why she operated a non-
government server. It also eliminated
emails around the time of that con-
ference call that could have shown ex-
actly what was intended in deleting
those emails.
Why did the DOJ and FBI pull their
punches? Mueller sure didn’t pull his
punches. He extended his scope of in-
vestigation well beyond allegations of
collusion, which turned out to be false.
Lastly, the FBI agreed to destroy
records and laptops of Clinton’s associ-
ates after reviewing them. That hap-
pens to be an astonishing agreement in
light of the fact that those records
could have been relevant to ongoing
congressional inquiries that the FBI
knew about.
Where were the Democrats when all
of that stuff happened? Where was
their outrage at the potential obstruc-
tion of justice and obstruction of con-
gressional oversight? It seems to me
that if the Democrats want to be con-
sistent, they will have to address what
was done—and what was totally ig-
nored—in the Clinton investigation.
Let’s also not forget about the pros-
ecutorial double standard. Secretary
Clinton and her associates mishandled
highly classified information. The law
makes ‘‘grossly negligent’’ mis-
handling of classified information a
criminal offense. Comey did not rec-
ommend prosecution because it was
not historically done under the law un-
less ‘‘intent’’ was present. So not only
did he and the Justice Department read
‘‘intent’’ into the statute, they made a
judgment call based upon how many
times someone had been charged under
the law.
The same thing could be said of the
Foreign Agents Registration Act and
lying to Congress. Each has had mini-
mal prosecutions.
Between 1966 and 2015, the Justice
Department brought only seven crimi-
nal Foreign Agents Registration Act
cases. One resulted in a conviction, two
pled guilty, and the rest pled to other
charges or they were dismissed. All of
that changed with Mueller. So we have
a double standard again.
Unlike Comey, Mueller didn’t seem
to think historical precedent was all
that important. Some have said that
Mueller has made FARA a law to pay
attention to—the same with 18 U.S.C.
1001, which covers lying to Federal
agents and Congress.
Recently, the Justice Department
has said that it is transitioning ‘‘from
treating FARA as an administrative
obligation and regulatory obligation to
one that is increasingly an enforce-
ment priority.’’ Well, it may be about
time that the laws are enforced, and
that is a very good and necessary shift.
I have engaged in FARA oversight
since April 2015. I also held a FARA
oversight hearing in July 2017 and in-
troduced the Disclosing Foreign Influ-
ence Act to shore up that law of the
1930s. I want to see FARA properly en-
forced, and I am glad that the Justice
Department suddenly seems to care
whether somebody lied to Congress. I
want to see equal enforcement, not just
with FARA but with all laws.
I have said many times before that
the law must be applied equally with-
out regard to power, party, or privi-
lege. That approach prevents incon-
sistent application and avoids double
standards. So when the Democrats ask
for material relating to the Russian in-
vestigation, I say: Fine, let’s do it.
However, that means they ought to be
consistent with other investigations,
and the Justice Department has to be
as well. Anything less is a double
standard.
I will tell you right now, the Demo-
crats’ obsession with bringing Trump
down is nothing but a double standard
if they are going to ignore other inves-
tigations of national importance. If

HONORING THE MEMORY OF
JEREIMA ‘‘JERI’’ BUSTAMANTE
ON THE 1-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
OF HER PASSING
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
I rise today to honor the life of one of
Florida’s brightest lights—a light that
was extinguished far too soon.
One year ago today, we lost Jeri
Bustamante in a tragic accident. She
was my press secretary, but she was so
much more. She was my Spanish tutor.
She was my travel partner. She was so
kind to everyone that you couldn’t
help but love her.
Everyone thought Jeri was their best
friend because she was so loving to ev-
eryone. She brightened every room
that she walked into and made every-
one around her better. There is not
much that brings the Florida political
world together, but Republicans,
Democrats, and even her friends in the
press loved and respected Jeri.
She lived the American dream. As a
small child, Jeri moved from Panama
to the United States with her family,
speaking only Spanish. She grew up in
Miami, where she attended Miami
Beach High, Miami-Dade Community
College, and Florida International Uni-
versity.
She had a passion for communica-
tions. She started out at a local Miami
TV station and eventually worked for
the Miami-Dade property appraiser
under Carlos Lopez-Cantera, who be-
came my Lieutenant Governor.
She joined my reelection campaign
for Governor in 2014, and she was with
me for 4 years. She was determined.
She was courageous. She had big goals.
She wanted to be the Press Secretary
for the President of the United States,
and I have no doubt she would have
been. That is the kind of person she
was. She never stopped working to
meet her goals in life, but she always
did it with a smile, with a joke, and
with a kind word.
In Jeri’s memory, my wife Ann and I
established the Jeri Bustamante Me-
morial Scholarship to support a grad-
uate of Miami Beach Senior High
School, who, like Jeri, is trying to be-
come the first in their family to go to
college.
Today Senator MARCO RUBIO and I
are introducing a resolution to honor
Jeri’s memory. We will never forget
her, and we will never forget the ways
she made all of us better.
Now I would like to honor Jeri in the
best way I know how, speaking the
Spanish she taught me.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to address the Senate in Spanish.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection.
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I have pro-
vided a translation to the Senate for
the RECORD.
(English translation of statement
made in Spanish is as follows:)
Jeri lived the American dream. She
was determined. She was brave. She
had great goals. She wanted to be the
Press Secretary of the President of the
United States. I have no doubt that she
would have achieved it. That is the
kind of person she was. She never
stopped struggling to fulfill her goals
in life and always did so with a smile,
a joke, and a kind word.
Senator RUBIO and I today present a
resolution to honor Jeri’s memory. We
will never forget her.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the
consideration of S. Res. 147, submitted
earlier today.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the resolution by
title.
The legislative clerk read as follows:
A resolution (S. Res. 147) honoring the
memory of Jereima ‘‘Jeri’’ Bustamante on

Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
I ask unanimous consent that the reso-
lution be agreed to, the preamble be

sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate.

COLORADO RIVER DROUGHT CON-
TINGENCY PLAN AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona.
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, the
Colorado River is the lifeblood of the
Southwestern United States. The river
provides drinking water to 40 million
Americans, irrigation to 5.5 million
acres of farmland, and more than 4,000
megawatts of carbon-free hydropower
to communities across the West in
seven States.
Unfortunately, the last 19 years have
been the Colorado Basin’s driest on
record. This long and intense drought
has left the combined water stored be-
hind Lake Powell and Lake Mead near
critically low levels, putting the water
supply for some of the Nation’s largest
cities in danger.
The Colorado River Drought Contin-
gency Plan—otherwise known as the
DCP—was negotiated among the seven
Colorado River Basin States to respond
to this prolonged drought. It is de-
signed to protect Lakes Mead and Pow-
ell from reaching certain critical water
elevations that would trigger severe
water supply and hydropower impacts,
including the risk of reaching crisis
levels where operational control of the
Colorado River system would be lost.
These States put in a lot of hard
work and sacrifice for the good of all
who rely on the river. By doing this,
they avoided having the Department of
Interior directing draconian measures
and cuts from the Federal Government.
But the plan must be codified in law. It
literally takes an act of Congress to
approve the DCP, and it is urgent. That
is why I am on the floor today.
I am proud of the bipartisan nature
of this legislation. As the Water and
Power Subcommittee chair, I am lead-
ing this legislation with my Demo-
cratic ranking member from Nevada,
Senator CORTEZ MASTO. We have all 14
Senators from all 7 States—8 Demo-
crats and 6 Republicans spanning a
wide ideological spectrum—as original
cosponsors. This bill is about an im-
pending water crisis impacting Western
States like Arizona. The effort to get
this bill to this point is an example of
bipartisanship that Arizonans and
Americans are calling for. This is
about the livelihood and the safety of
40 million Americans.
The Colorado River DCP Authoriza-
tion Act puts sound water policy over
partisan politics. People thought that
never happened in Washington, DC.
Today, they should be celebrating
about this bill. I ask all my colleagues
to join the 14 bipartisan Senators from
the Colorado River Basin and support
this bill.
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 1057. I further ask con-
sent that the bill be considered read a
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Colorado

SEC. 2. COLORADO RIVER BASIN DROUGHT CON-
TINGENCY PLANS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any
other provision of law expressly addressing
the operation of the applicable Colorado
River System reservoirs, immediately upon
execution of the March 19, 2019, versions of
the Agreement Concerning Colorado River
Drought Contingency Management and Oper-
ations and the agreements attached thereto
as Attachments A1, A2, and B, by all of the
non-Federal parties thereto, the Secretary of
the Interior shall, without delay, execute
such agreements, and is directed and author-
ized to carry out the provisions of such
agreements and operate applicable Colorado
River System reservoirs accordingly.
(b) EFFECT.—Nothing in this section
shall—
(1) be construed or interpreted as precedent
for the litigation of, or as altering, affecting,
or being deemed as a congressional deter-
mination regarding, the water rights of the
United States, any Indian Tribe, band, or
community, any State or political subdivi-
sion or district of a State, or any person; or
(2) exempt the implementation of such
agreements and the operation of applicable
Colorado River System reservoirs from any
requirements of applicable Federal environ-
mental laws.
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, I want
to thank you, and I want to thank Sen-
ator CORTEZ MASTO and all of our col-
leagues for supporting this critical leg-
islation. It is now going to allow imme-
diate action to increase the water secu-
rity for Arizona and all of the seven
Colorado River Basin States.
We just introduced this legislation
last Tuesday. By acting so quickly, the
Lower Basin States will be able to im-
mediately begin saving hundreds of
thousands of acre-feet of water behind
Hoover Dam, and this will dramati-
cally reduce the risk of reaching criti-
cally low reservoir levels and ensure
that Mexico’s water contribution to
Lake Mead will be made beginning
next year.
We worked hand in hand with Chair-
man GRIJALVA to develop this legisla-
tion. As I said, we have identical bills
passing now in the House and the Sen-
ate on the same day. I want to thank
our House colleagues, Chairman GRI-
JALVA, Ranking Member BISHOP, and I
want to thank all the staff on both
sides of the House and the Senate. This
bipartisan, bicameral effort only came
into fruition because of their hard
work over these last years and days to
make this happen. Thanks again to ev-
erybody.
This is a really great day for the Col-
orado River Basin and for Arizonans.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO MARY SKEENS
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I wish
to recognize a friend and colleague,
Mary Skeens, who has been a tireless
advocate for affordable housing for
West Virginians. Mary is retiring as
the executive director of Community
Works where she has spent the last 12
of her 40-year housing career.
A native of Kentucky, Mary realized
at an early age that not every family
in a warm, secure home. Her pressing
concern for the living conditions of her
classmates and peers led her into a ca-
reer in housing. In 1990, her husband,
Jim, had a desire to return to his fam-
ily farm in Roane County, WV. This al-
lowed Jim to return to his Moun-
taineer roots, and Mary embraced her
new adopted home State and entered
the housing profession.
Mary started her housing career as
manager at a senior living high-rise
apartment complex in Dunbar. She was
later offered a position at the West Vir-
ginia Housing Development Fund as
the head of the community develop-
ment office overseeing the newly-cre-
ated HOME Program during President
Clinton’s Administration. Mary worked
with nonprofit housing agencies all
over West Virginia in an effort to qual-
ify as them as community Housing De-
velopment Organizations, also known
as a CHDOs. Over the next 10 years,
Mary worked with numerous housing
providers to develop many worthwhile
projects that serve West Virginians to
this day, creating domestic violence
shelters, affordable multifamily rental
complexes, and affordable housing sub-
divisions in underserved areas of our
State. Mary is well known throughout
West Virginia for her housing finance
skills and her ability to provide much-
needed technical assistance.
In 2007, Mary became executive direc-
tor of Community Works in West Vir-
ginia. This agency was newly created
and in its early years of operation.
Community Works is a licensed mort-
gage lender providing home ownership
loans, owner occupied rehabilitation
loans, and a commercial loan program
to its nonprofit housing member orga-
nizations. Mary stepped in and grew
the agency by expanding its reach.
This agency’s work can be seen in most
every housing development in the
State through its loan programs and
outreach. In addition to providing af-
fordable financing opportunities, Mary
has overseen many initiatives to im-
prove housing policy and awareness
that will affect this industry for years
to come. She has also dedicated much
time serving on many housing related
boards of directors, and, as a result of
her work, was inducted into the West
Virginia Affordable Housing Hall of
Fame in 2012.
Mary has accomplished so much in
her years of service to West Virginia’s
housing community. I would like to
thank Mary for aiding our State and
its residents by providing safe, decent,
and affordable housing to so many citi-
zens who could not have afforded it
otherwise.
Thank you for working with me and
my staff over the years to serve as a re-
source on housing policy. I wish you
well in your retirement. It is truly an
honor to call you a friend and fellow
West Virginian.∑

RECOGNIZING THE EMPORIUM
SENIOR CENTER AND THE
CLEARFIELD SENIOR CENTER
∑ Mr. CASEY. Mr. President. I recently
visited two senior centers in Pennsyl-
vania, the Emporium Senior Center in
Cameron County and the Clearfield
Senior Center in Clearfield County, to
discuss issues on the minds of older
Pennsylvanians and those who serve
them. We spoke about the need to pro-
tect Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Se-
curity; the importance of bringing
down the high cost of prescription
drugs; and how to prevent con artists
from scamming older adults out of
their hard-earned savings.
We must continue to support senior
centers and other gathering places for
older adults. For many, senior centers
are a hub for services and a place where
older Americans find a sense of com-
munity and belonging. They are the

TRIBUTE TO JOHN BARTHELMES
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I
would like to recognize Mr. John
Barthelmes of Hopkinton, NH, and cel-
ebrate his well-deserved retirement
after years of service to New Hamp-
shire and America.
In 1976, John began his career in pub-
lic service as a State trooper in New
Hampshire’s North Country, where he
fell in love with his wonderful wife,
Jadean. He then rose through the ranks
to become colonel of New Hampshire
State Police, a position he held from
1996 to 1999. After retiring from the
State police, John served as the direc-
tor of the New England High-Intensity
Drug Trafficking Area agency, until
2007 when Governor Lynch appointed
him to serve as commissioner of the de-
partment of safety. I am proud and
honored that, as Governor, I had the
opportunity to reappoint this excep-
tional public servant to lead our de-
partment of safety.
As commissioner, John has focused
on maintaining New Hampshire’s sta-
tus as one of the safest States in the
Nation and on improving services for
our citizens. Under his leadership, the
department has effectively managed
severe weather events and other emer-
gencies. He also oversaw the merger of
the State police and highway patrol
and the overhaul of the State police of-
ficer recruitment process.
Additionally, under John’s leader-
ship, the department has dramatically
reduced wait times at the Division of
Motor Vehicles, given citizens the op-
tion to renew their drivers’ licenses on-
line, and undertaken a number of other
improvements.
Underscoring his commitment to
helping the people of New Hampshire,
John is an outspoken advocate for
treatment options for behavioral
health and has served on the board of
Riverbend Community Mental Health.
John also serves on the New Hampshire
Advisory Council on Emergency Pre-
paredness and Security and the Gov-
ernor’s Commission on Alcohol and
Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment,
and Recovery.
But as impressive as John
Barthelmes’ service, effectiveness, and
achievements are, it is his insight,
even-keeled demeanor, and extraor-
dinary kindness that distinguishes him
the most. A man of impeccable char-
acter and deep understanding of the
human condition, John Barthelmes
broadened the outlook of everyone he
worked with and gave hope to all he
served.
Ensuring the safety of our people and
communities is the most important
role of government. Doing it with the
skill, professionalism, and wisdom that
John Barthelmes exhibited throughout
his career is extraordinary.
I thank John for his dedication to
keeping our people and communities
safe, and I thank John’s family for
their willingness to share him with the
people of New Hampshire.
I hope you will join me in honoring a
dedicated Granite Stater, John
Barthelmes.∑

SEVENTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF
THE INDIAN AMERICAN CUL-
TURAL CENTER OF NWIHRC
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is my
distinct pleasure to recognize the Indian Amer-
ican Cultural Center of NWIHRC, which will be
celebrating its 17th anniversary by hosting a
gala dinner and banquet on Saturday, April
13, 2019, at the Halls of Saint George in
Schererville, Indiana.
The Indian American Cultural Center, which
opened on March 9, 2002, was established
with the following goal in mind: to foster peace
and harmony amongst the people of North-
west Indiana by showcasing their cultural her-
itage and creating spiritual awareness in both
youth and adults, as well as to engage in var-
ious charitable endeavors, both nationally and
locally. Since its inception, the Indian Amer-
ican Cultural Center has been instrumental in
educating Northwest Indiana’s citizens on the
traditions and customs of the Indian heritage.
The members of the Indian American Cul-
tural Center of NWIHRC are to be honored,
not only for their commitment to preserving
tradition, but also for their dedication to mak-
ing improvements that benefit all mankind.
Proceeds from this year’s gala, which through-
out the years has demonstrated the immense
generosity of its attendees and organizers, will
go to support the Nazareth Home in East Chi-
cago and Veterans Life Changing Services in
Gary. In the past, proceeds from the gala
have gone to such noble causes as cancer re-
search, educational scholarships, the Amer-
ican Red Cross, tsunami and hurricane relief
funds, the Carmelite Home for Girls, Arc
Bridges of Hobart, Campagna Academy, and
many more. For their significant contributions
to the community of Northwest Indiana and
beyond, the members and leaders of the
NWIHRC are worthy of the highest praise.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my
other distinguished colleagues join me in con-
gratulating the Indian American Cultural Cen-
ter of NWIHRC on its 17th anniversary. The
members and leaders of this outstanding orga-
nization have dedicated themselves to serving
others, and continue to improve the quality of
life for the people of Northwest Indiana and
throughout the world. They serve as an inspi-
ration to us all.

OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Katherine
Cisneros for receiving the Adams County May-
ors and Commissioners Youth Award.
The Youth Award focuses on teenagers who
have overcome personal adversity and cre-
ated positive changes in their lives and their
community. The program provides businesses,
the community and civic leaders an oppor-
tunity to support young people in their commu-
nities and recognize their accomplishments.
Katherine is the perfect recipient for this award
because despite adversities and challenges,
she has become an inspiration and role model
for her peers.
The dedication and leadership demonstrated
by Katherine is exemplary of the type of
achievement that can be attained with hard
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of
their education and develop a work ethic
which will guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Katherine Cisneros for this well-deserved rec-
ognition. I have no doubt she will exhibit the
same dedication and character in all of her fu-
ture accomplishments.

Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Buchanan Partners and Nancy
Hersch Ingram who have demonstrated in-
credible dedication and service to the Hylton
Performing Arts Center. Their many contribu-
tions have helped grow the arts in our commu-
nity and at the Hylton Performing Arts Center.
The Hylton Performing Arts Center serves to
enrich, entertain, and celebrate the community
through arts and educational programs. The
Hylton Performing Arts Center provides a vari-
ety of cultural experiences for all ages, and we
are thankful to have this Center in our commu-
nity.
The Buchanan Partners have played a key
role in establishing the Hylton Performing Arts
Center’s vision by sponsoring the Buchanan
Partners Art Gallery. This gallery features local
and regional artists and serves to enrich the
community through various visual art experi-
ences. They continue to reach out to the com-
munity and live out their mission of ‘‘Devel-
oping Values. Building relationships.’’ It is my
pleasure to honor the Buchanan Partners for
their contributions and efforts.
We are also very fortunate to have an ex-
ceptional visual artist, philanthropist, and
founding supporter of the Hylton Performing
Arts Center, Nancy Hersch Ingram. She
earned her Masters of Fine Arts degree from
American University and now serves on the
George Mason University Science and Tech-
nology campus advisory board. Nancy con-
tinues to help other members of our commu-
nity by providing visionary artistic influence
and philanthropic support. Her art work is held
in permanent collections of the Smithsonian
National Portrait Gallery, the National Museum
of Women in the Arts, and other art institu-
tions. She has been a pillar for artistic enrich-
ment in our community, and demonstrates the
values we seek in our community leaders. It is
my pleasure to honor Nancy Hersch Ingram.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing the Buchanan Partners and
Nancy Hersch Ingram for their many contribu-
tions to the Hylton Performing Arts Center.

HON. JAMES R. BAIRD
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
congratulate two outstanding high school bas-
ketball teams from the Fourth District of Indi-
ana. I’m proud to say that the Fourth District
is home to not only the runner up for the Indi-
ana High School Athletic Association’s Girls
Basketball State Tournament, but also the
2019 State Champions.
At the State Championship on February 23,
in Indianapolis, Northwestern Senior High
School, from Kokomo, Indiana achieved their
second-straight state title with a sixty-one to
thirty-nine victory over Benton Central, from
Oxford, Indiana.
Both teams played with the passion and
dedication they have shown all season. North-
western junior Kendall Bostic led the night with
twenty-five points and set Class 3A State
records for both rebounds and steals. Her
teammate, Madison Layden, tied a state
record as well, making ten out of twelve free
throw attempts. Allison Miller from North-
western was named the winner of the Patricia
L. Roy Mental Attitude Award in Class 3A
Girls Basketball.
From Benton Central, leaders like Audrey
Strawsma contributed eleven points, Tressa
Senesac with nine, and senior Emma Fisher
had seven. In addition to the strong showing
from all the players on the court, it is notable

were from the same conference.
It is an honor to represent hardworking stu-
dent athletes across the Fourth District, espe-
cially the young women of Northwestern and
Benton Central. Their coaches, Kathie Layden
from Northwestern and David Baxter from
Benton Central, should also be commended
on their leadership and commitment.

Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today

tioner and a Certified Child Forensic Interview
Trainer who has done remarkable work.
Johanna Hager, a member of First Lutheran

dren, and families dealing with grief, trauma
and recovery from child sexual abuse and se-
vere physical abuse. In addition, Ms Hager

HONORING PETER CAMERON
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the significant career and
accomplishments of Peter Cameron, a United
States Army veteran who has dedicated more
than 47 years to serving his fellow veterans in
Sonoma County, on the occasion of his retire-
ment.
Mr. Cameron entered military service in
1965 and served his country with distinction in
Vietnam in 1966 and 1967. He was awarded
the National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam
Service Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign
Medal.
Following his Army service, Mr Cameron be-
came the founder, President, and Chief Exec-
utive Officer of Veterans Resource Centers of
America, a community-based nonprofit organi-
zation in Sonoma County that provides em-
ployment training, housing, rehabilitation and
case management as well as small business,
legal, and advocacy services to veterans. The
organization also supports a clinic and con-
struction of three elementary schools in Luong
Son, in the Republic of Vietnam.
As a prominent leader and active voice for
veterans, Mr. Cameron has, over the past 47
years, been a consultant to the White House,
Department of Labor, Department of Veterans
Affairs, and Agent Orange Class Assistance
Program as well as numerous state and local
agencies. Mr. Cameron collected materials for
the first archival collection of Vietnam vet-
erans’ memorabilia which is now held at Cor-
nell University. He also organized the first
Vietnam veterans symposium held at Sonoma
State University in 1979 and coordinated dele-
gations of Vietnam veterans to travel to the
Soviet Union and Kazakhstan to meet Soviet
veterans of the war in Afghanistan in 1989
and 1990. In more recent years, he served as
Secretary and Board Member of the National
Coalition for Homeless Veterans.
Madam Speaker, Peter Cameron’s career is
a sterling example of service and dedication to
our country’s veteran population. Mr. Cam-
eron’s tireless advocacy on behalf of his fellow
veterans raised awareness and improved lives
in Sonoma County and across the United
States. Please join me in honoring Peter Cam-
eron on the occasion of his retirement, and in
wishing him the best of luck in his future en-
deavors.
RECOGNIZING THE 50TH
ANNIVERSARY OF LEIDOS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Chairman/CEO Roger Krone and
the 32,000 employees of Leidos on the occa-
sion of the company’s 50th anniversary.
Founded in 1969 by Dr. J. Robert Beyster
as Science Applications Incorporated (SAI),
the company that would become Leidos was a
result of Dr. Beyster’s lifelong commitment to
innovation. Born in Detroit, Michigan in 1924
and raised in the midst of the Great Depres-
sion, Dr. Beyster watched as his family strug-
gled through incredible hardships to provide
for themselves. He joined the Navy after grad-
uating from high school and served on a de-
stroyer during World War II. With the help of
the GI Bill, he attended the University of Michi-
gan after his naval career and earned several
degrees, including his Ph.D. in nuclear physics
in 1950.
After earning his doctorate, Dr. Beyster
spent five years working at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory before spending a dozen
years with General Atomics in San Diego. His
time there came to an end shortly after Gulf
Oil acquired General Atomics. Dr. Beyster felt
that senior management had little interest in
the research his department was performing.
He resolved to create a company where that
would never be the case and which nurtured
a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.
That vision led to the creation of SAI, which
changed its name to SAIC in 1984.
I served as Director of Community Relations
for SAIC from 2002 to 2008 and will always
remember fondly my time with the company. I
was pleased to be present in Congress in
2009 when SAIC made the decision to relo-
cate its headquarters from San Diego to my
district in Tysons. I’m not sure anyone, includ-
ing Dr. Beyster, could have foreseen the
growth that this company would experience.
What began as a $50,000 loan with Dr.
Beyster’s house as collateral has evolved into
a $7 billion Fortune 500 powerhouse. In 2013,
SAIC bifurcated its company into two entities;
Leidos, the solutions-focused parent company
and a services business spin-off which carried
on the SAIC name. I am confident that both of
these companies will continue the fine legacy
that has been left by Dr. Beyster, Roger Krone
and so many others over the last 50 years.
The impact of Leidos and SAIC is not solely
confined to a profit margin or a balance sheet.
Both companies have received numerous ac-
colades for their work in their communities, in-
cluding being named one of the Best Places
to Work by the Human Rights Campaign in
2017, receiving an Annual Corporate Equality
Index Score of 100 percent and being named
one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by
the Ethisphere Institute just last year. When I
served as Director of Community Relations, I
saw firsthand the engagement in and care for
the community that SAIC/Leidos exhibited.
The community was not merely where their fa-
cilities were located; it was their home and
they treated it accordingly. We could all stand
to learn from their example.

FOURTH ANNUAL WORLD CIVILITY
DAY
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great honor and respect that I recognize the
Community Civility Counts Initiative as the or-
ganization celebrates its fourth annual World
Civility Day on April 11, 2019, along with the
Gary Chamber of Commerce, the entire com-
munity of Northwest Indiana, and beyond.
World Civility Day is a day in which we are
asked to become aware of our behavior to-
wards others and to become mindful of our
thoughts, words, and actions. It is a day to re-
member that we can be better people in every
area of life, and to remember that our actions
serve as an example for generations to come.
In observance of this special event, a day of
civility-themed activities will be held at the In-
diana Welcome Center in Hammond, and an
awards banquet will follow in the evening at
the Avalon Manor in Merrillville.
In 2015, Chuck Hughes, Executive Director
of the Gary Chamber of Commerce, and Dr.
Gordon E. Bradshaw, Chairman of the Public
Policy Committee, worked together through
the Gary Chamber to create the Civility
Counts Initiative. The organization’s mission is
to build public awareness of civility and to help
transform communities through positive pro-
grams and relationships. The Initiative works
to raise the consciousness level of individuals
and groups of people, as so many of us face
incidents of disrespect, intolerance, bullying, or
violence. For striving to make a difference in
our communities, the organization and its sup-
porters are worthy of the highest praise.
This year, the organization welcomes and
honors Dr. Clyde Rivers, President and
Founder of IChange Nations. Dr. Rivers is
also an Ambassador-at-Large for the Republic
of Burundi, Africa. Dr. Rivers plans to incor-
porate the Community Civility Counts mes-
sage into his own organization and his work
for peace and civility throughout the world.
Showing her support for this powerful mes-
sage, Ms. Melba Moore, Grammy nominee
and Tony Award winner, will be performing at
the International Awards Dinner. Mr. Michael
Turner, saxophonist for the Ohio Players, and
Mr. Reginald Thornton, original dancer from
the iconic Soul Train television show, will cele-
brate civility through their performances, as
well.
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other
colleagues to join me in honoring and con-
gratulating the Community Civility Counts Ini-
tiative and in celebrating World Civility Day.
The significance of this movement will have a
positive impact on generation after generation.
For their influence, passion, and dedication to
the community of Northwest Indiana and be-
yond, the leaders and supporters of the Com-
munity Civility Counts Initiative are to be com-
mended.

HONORING MR. RICHARD FIMBRES
AND MRS. MARY FIMBRES
HON. ANN KIRKPATRICK
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise
before you today to recognize two special indi-
viduals, Mr. Richard Fimbres and Mrs. Mary
Fimbres, for their three decades of work and
commitment to bettering the lives of local
youth. In response to their concerns about the
state of education in their community, Richard
and Mary Fimbres helped to found the LULAC
Youth Leadership Conference, a program that
promotes and develops leadership in middle
and high school students.
With the cooperation and involvement of
local public, private, and charter schools, as
well as institutions of higher learning, the
LULAC Youth Leadership Conference has be-
come a nationally recognized program that as-
sists students with resources, mentoring, and
leadership skills, thereby equipping them with
the necessary tools to help them remain in
school, graduate, and further their education.
For 29 years, Richard and Mary Fimbres
have worked to build and grow the con-
ference, and to date, it has hosted over
118,000 participants. Over the years, these
participants have gained invaluable experience
thanks to the conference, including attending a
Resource Fair where they can discover high-
paying careers that will enable them to make
a difference by creating the social and techno-
logical advancements that will define the fu-
ture of our world. The fair also gives them ac-
cess to health, educational, and life resources
and features a strong public safety component
with law enforcement, fire, and medical emer-
gency professionals who display the latest ve-
hicles, technologies and equipment in their
fields. Additionally, the fair offers 30 interactive
workshops that focus on leadership, health,
culture, issues affecting teens, student re-
sources, and technology. Professionals from
various fields are present to provide informa-
tion about community resources and ways to
access them, as well as offering information
about their career paths. It should also be
noted that, thanks to Richard and Mary
Fimbres and local school systems, students
are provided secure transportation to and from
the conference.
The LULAC Youth Leadership Conference
has been nationally recognized by former First
Ladies Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton, as
well as Louis Caldera, former Secretary of the
Army, and Lauro Cavazos, former Secretary of
Education. In tandem with the Youth Leader-
ship Conference, Richard and Mary Fimbres
also formed the LULAC Educator’s Awards
and Scholarship Banquet, which honors edu-
cators, community leaders, and elected offi-
cials for their work on improving the lives of
youth and the community, as well as raises
funds to go toward educational scholarships.
Mr. and Mrs. Fimbres’ standing as commu-
nity leaders is evident in their commitment and
countless hours of work throughout the com-
munity over the past three decades. Madam
Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing
these outstanding citizens and exemplary
leaders for their work and dedication to im-
proving the lives of our young people.

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, April 3, 2019
The House in Committee of the
Whole House on the state of the Union
had under consideration the bill (H.R.
1585) to reauthorize the Violence
Against Women Act of 1994, and for
other purposes:
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chair, the Violence
Against Women Act is an important law that
authorizes funding to protect women from vio-
lent crimes and supports victims. Let me be
clear: the Violence Against Women Act needs
to be reauthorized. In 2013, I was proud to
vote to reauthorize this legislation. Last fall, I
joined a letter urging Speaker Ryan to pass a
clean extension of the Violence Against
Women Act before it expired. Finally, I will
vote to support a clean one-year extension of
the Violence Against Women Act.
Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues let
politics stand in the way of funding to help vic-
tims of violent crimes. They have included pro-
visions in H.R. 1585, the Violence Against
Women Reauthorization Act of 2019, to deny
citizens of their constitutional Second Amend-
ment rights without due process. Our requests
for a clean reauthorization, without such politi-
cized provisions, have gone unanswered.
Victims of domestic violence and sexual as-
sault deserve better. This is why I opposed

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF WILLOW SPRINGS, MIS-
SOURI
HON. JASON SMITH
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the sesquicentennial birth-
day of Willow Springs, Missouri. Located in
Howell County, Willow Springs sits at the
intersections of U.S. Hwy 63 and U.S. Hwy
60, making it the hub of the Ozarks.
On March 29, 1869, the Willow Springs Post
Office was established. The post office was lo-
cated at the general store of Mr. James Har-
ris, a Union veteran of the Civil War. The town
remained small until the development of the
Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis railroads
in the 1880s. The railroad stimulated com-
merce and brought new businesses and peo-
ple to the area who were interested in taking
part in the expansion.
It is my privilege to acknowledge this his-
toric birthday before the United States House
of Representatives and to honor the people of
Willow Springs, Missouri as they partake in
this yearlong celebration.

Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Brittney Cum-
mings for receiving the Adams County Mayors
and Commissioners Youth Award.
The Youth Award focuses on teenagers who
have overcome personal adversity and cre-
ated positive changes in their lives and their
community. The program provides businesses,
the community and civic leaders an oppor-
tunity to support young people in their commu-
nities and recognize their accomplishments.
Brittney is the perfect recipient for this award
because despite adversities and challenges,
she has become an inspiration and role model
for her peers.
The dedication and leadership demonstrated
by Brittney is exemplary of the type of
achievement that can be attained with hard
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of
their education and develop a work ethic
which will guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Brittney Cummings for this well-deserved rec-
ognition. I have no doubt she will exhibit the

IN HONOR OF THE WOODLANDS
CHRISTIAN ACADEMY 25TH ANNI-
VERSARY
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise in
celebration of the 25th Anniversary of The
Woodlands Christian Academy.
Established in 1993, The Woodlands Chris-
tian Academy (TWCA) is one of our commu-
nity’s most impressive academic institutions. A
nondenominational college preparatory school
located in The Woodlands, Texas, TWCA
aims to integrate classroom learning with Bib-
lical faith. TWCA provides programs for over
600 students PreK–12th grade, and pushes
them to reach their highest spiritual, academic,
and social potential. The caliber of their stu-
dents is matched only by the quality of their
faculty, whose dedicated commitment to
teaching has shaped countless students and
inspired thousands of young learners.
TWCA has a strong history of preparing its
students for success after graduation, with stu-
dent ACT and SAT scores continuing to rise
above the local, state, and national average.
Students of TWCA often go on to receive
prized competitive scholarships—with an aver-
age of $103,000 per student being awarded in
merit-based college scholarships in 2017
alone.
Students at TWCA are notable not only for
their academic achievements, but also for their
proven ability to be remarkable leaders in their
respective industries and communities.
Through service opportunities and edu-
cational experiences in and outside of the
classroom, TWCA encourages its students to
engage in responsible citizenship and critical
thinking, and to develop a life-long apprecia-
tion for learning. TWCA understands the im-
portance of investing in our students, and
therefore investing in our future.
TWCA would not be where it is today with-
out their fearless leader, Julie Ambler. Julie
has been a hardworking member of the faculty
since 2006, and now serves as Head of
School. Under her outstanding leadership and
direction, TWCA was named the corporate
Hometown Hero of The Woodlands by Inter-
faith in 2017—a well-deserved award for
someone whose vision and guidance has im-
pacted this community so much.
This year, we celebrate TWCA’s quarter-of-
a-century mark. I thank them for the out-
standing impact that the faculty and adminis-
tration have made on young people of our
community, and I am proud to join those
across The Woodlands in celebration of their
Anniversary. Congratulations on 25 years, I
know that the next 25 will be just as success-
ful.

HONORING ALBERT STRAUS
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Albert Straus, the
founder and CEO of Straus Family Creamery.
Under Albert Straus’ leadership the Straus
Family Creamery became the first creamery in
the country to become one hundred percent
certified organic. Twenty-five years later, the
business is not only thriving, but has created
a model for sustainable family dairy farming
that has been replicated to great success.
The oldest of four children, Albert Straus
grew up on his family’s dairy farm in northern
California. The son of William and Ellen
Straus, his father founded the dairy in 1941,
after fleeing to the United States as a refugee
from Nazi Germany. Albert left his family’s
dairy to go to college, but returned in 1977,
after earning a bachelor’s degree in Dairy
Science from California Polytechnic State Uni-
versity, San Luis Obispo. Albert took over
management of the dairy alongside his father,
but realized that changes would need to be
made if family-run dairy farms were going to
survive the growth of larger industrial competi-
tors.
Over the course of the nearly two decades
that followed, Albert Straus implemented inno-
vative solutions at his family dairy that im-
proved both the stewardship of the land and
the farm’s economic vitality. These solutions
included the cessation of herbicides and
chemical fertilizers, the use of planting meth-
ods that reduced soil erosion, and the use of
food waste for cow feed, among many others.
Finally, in 1994, Straus opened the first cer-
tified organic dairy and creamery west of the
Mississippi River and the first 100 percent cer-
tified organic creamery in the U.S.
Today, the Straus Family Creamery has had
great success, both economically, and in its
mission to create a farming community that is
committed to stewardship of the land. Albert
Straus has been a model and mentor for
many other family dairy farms. Now nearly
ninety percent of all dairy farms in the region
are certified organic, and as a result, family
farms are continuing to thrive. Still a leader in
innovation, the Straus Family Dairy Farm uses
a methane digester to turn the 4,000 gallons
of manure that it produces daily into compost
and renewable energy. This energy not only
powers the 500-acre farm, but also Albert
Straus’ harvester truck.
Madam Speaker, Albert Straus’ leadership
and vision has proven that environmentally-
sustainable farming can both turn a profit and
support a larger community of family farms
and distributors. And at a time when the public
has grown increasingly more concerned by the
means and consolidation of food production,
his example is that much more significant.
Therefore, please join me in recognizing Albert
Straus and the success of the Straus Family
Creamery, on the occasion of its 25th anniver-
sary.

Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the incoming 2019 officers of the
Occoquan-Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer Fire
Department. OWLVFD is located in Prince
William County, Virginia, 25 miles from our
Nation’s Capital. The OWLVFD goes on an
average of 20,000 runs per year, aiding
80,000 residents in a 27 square mile area.
Incorporated in the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia in 1938, the OWLVFD is comprised of
committed community members who volunteer
their time, energy, and financial resources to
ensure the safety of the families and property
in and around Woodbridge. During its 80 year
history, the Department has continued to ex-
pand and there are now three stations staffed
by approximately 250 volunteers who serve
and protect an ever-growing local population.
From their bravery in action to their presence
with the youth in the community, OWLVFD is
readily available for the families of
Woodbridge.
It is with great honor that I include in the
RECORD the names of the following Occoquan-
Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer Fire Department
Officers:
Department President—Dave Williams.
Department Chief—James McAllister.
Executive Vice President—George Smith.
Membership Secretary—Scott Shaw.

selves in harm’s way for the benefit of the
residents of the area and have educated and
mentored the youth in Woodbridge, not only
teaching fire safety education, but also
strengthening community relations.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in recognizing the men and women of
the Occoquan-Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer
Fire Department for their service to our coun-
try and steadfast commitment to their commu-

HONORING THE LIFE OF

OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I ask that my
colleagues join me in honoring the life and
legacy of former Essex County Freeholder
Pearl Beatty. Freeholder Beatty passed away
on April 2, 2019, leaving behind a trail of suc-
cess as a community servant.
Freeholder Beatty’s interest in politics began
in her early twenties, when she worked a voter
registration table for the NAACP. It continued
through 1960, when she sang at a rally for
presidential candidate John F. Kennedy.
Freeholder Beatty went on to work for the
Kennedy campaign in New Jersey, helping put
Kennedy over the top in the state. Three years
later, Freeholder Beatty attended the 1963
March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
She helped Newark residents picket Wool-
worth’s for racial equality. And Freeholder
Beatty was a key player in getting Newark’s
first Black mayor, Kenneth Gibson, elected in
1970.
Over the years, Freeholder Beatty was a
constant presence in Essex County politics
and communities. She was scheduler for
Jimmy Carter’s 1976 New Jersey campaign,
then ran for Essex County Freeholder in 1977.
She served three terms as District 2
Freeholder, always fighting for her constitu-
ents. Freeholder Beatty worked tirelessly to
get people of color registered to vote.
I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring
the life of Essex County Freeholder Pearl
Beatty.

HONORING FRANK BARBARO
HON. MIKE LEVIN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise to honor lawyer and friend Frank Barbaro
for his many years of service to Orange Coun-
ty.
Frank was born in Detroit, Michigan and
moved to Orange County at the age of 11. He
was raised by a single mother who taught him
the importance of hard work and dedication to
fighting for justice. At the age of 14, Frank
hosted his own radio show to help young peo-
ple find employment opportunities.
After attending University of Southern Cali-
fornia for his undergraduate and law degrees,
Frank started his career as an insurance de-
fense attorney at Rodiger, Graf, Dewberry,
and Spriggs. However, he soon discovered his
true passion for personal injury, medical mal-
practice and public entity liability.
Frank has tried over 100 personal injury
cases and has argued in front of appellate and
supreme courts. In his landmark case Soule
vs. General Motors Corporation, Frank argued
in front of the California Supreme Court and
won $1.65 million for his client Terri Soule in
an automobile defect case against General
Motors. Law schools across the country teach
this case to discuss the consumer-expectation
test for products liability. In 2018, Frank was
inducted into the Orange County Trial Lawyers
Association Hall of Fame.
Frank has also been a leader in our com-
munity outside of the courtroom. He has
fought for judicial independence through his
work with the bipartisan Committee to Pre-
serve a Responsible Judiciary. He has served
on both the Governor’s Judicial Selection Ad-
visory Committee for Orange County and the
Orange County Fair Board. Frank was also
Chair of the Democratic Party of Orange
County and Orange County Campaign Chair
for several presidential campaigns, including
President Jimmy Carter, President Barack
Obama, and Secretary Hillary Clinton.
Frank is a true inspiration to our community.
I am honored to pay tribute to Frank and his
work on behalf of Orange County.

Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-

women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference
in my Congressional District. I would like to
recognize a remarkable woman, Jeanne
Broberg of La Ca-ñada Flintridge, California.
Born and raised in Glendale, California,
Jeanne attended Glendale public schools,
graduating from Herbert Hoover High School
as Valedictorian prior to attending Brigham
Young University and Glendale Community
College. In 1970, Jeanne and her late hus-
band, Dr. Charles Broberg, an obstetrics and
gynecology specialist, settled in La Ca-ñada

RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NORTHERN VIR-
GINIA CONSERVATION TRUST
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Northern Virginia Conservation
Trust on the occasion of its 25th anniversary.
Founded in 1994, NVCT undertook a mission
to sustain abundant, thriving and natural
places in local neighborhoods and commu-
nities. Over the last 25 years, their efforts
have led to the protection of over 7,000 acres
of land, comprising parks, streams, forests
and farms in both rural and urban settings. In
a region of over 3 million people and growing,
that is an incredible accomplishment that de-
serves high praise.
In Northern Virginia, we have always made
an effort to preserve our parkland and green
spaces. This is one of the reasons why our re-
gion continues to enjoy such a high quality of
life. I was proud during my tenure as Chair-
man of the Fairfax County Board of Super-
visors to make environmental conservation
one of my top priorities. We set a goal of pre-
serving 10 percent of our open space as park-
land. We are currently at 9.7 percent and I am
confident that the future will see us reach that
goal of 10 percent.
I also saw firsthand the commitment of the
membership of NVCT to the goal of conserva-
tion. The late Jean Packard, who served as
Chairman of the Board of NVCT, was an in-
strumental figure in the downzoning of the
Occoquan watershed.
That decision was arguably one of the most
consequential environmental decisions made
by the Board of Supervisors. It is no coinci-
dence that the healthiest streams in Fairfax
County and the most scenic, ecologically in-
tact open space are found within the bound-
aries of the Occoquan watershed.
The existence of organizations like NVCT is
a testament to the high level of civic engage-
ment and citizen activism that we are blessed
with not only in Fairfax County, but in Northern
Virginia as a whole. The actions of govern-
ments, while important, will never be sufficient
by themselves. Organizations like NVCT pro-
vide an invaluable supplement, which ensures
that we will continue to prioritize preservation
and conservation of our natural resources for
future generations.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating the Northern Virginia
Conservation Trust on 25 years of preserving
nature. I commend them for their service to
our community and our region and ask my col-
leagues to join me in wishing them great suc-
cess in all their future endeavors.

CORY HENRY
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Cory Henry
for receiving the Adams County Mayors and
Commissioners Youth Award.
The Youth Award focuses on teenagers who
have overcome personal adversity and cre-
ated positive changes in their lives and their
community. The program provides businesses,
the community and civic leaders an oppor-
tunity to support young people in their commu-
nities and recognize their accomplishments.
Cory is the perfect recipient for this award be-
cause despite adversities and challenges, he
has become an inspiration and role model for
his peers.
The dedication and leadership demonstrated
by Cory is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and
perseverance. It is essential students at all
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will
guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to Cory
Henry for this well-deserved recognition. I
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

HONORING LONGTIME CIVIL
RIGHTS ACTIVIST NATIVO VIR-
GIL LOPEZ
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I would like
to take some time today to honor Nativo Virgil
Lopez, a longtime civil rights activist and a
powerful voice and advocate for the immigrant
community. A sixth-generation Mexican-Amer-
ican, Nativo Virgil Lopez was born in Los An-
geles and raised in Norwalk. As a high school
student, he was inspired to grassroots immi-
grant rights activism by the national movement
against the Vietnam War, due to the high
numbers of deaths and wounded of Latinos
and African Americans.
In 1982 he founded the Orange County
chapter of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional
(HMN) based in Santa Ana, an organization
dedicated to improving the social and political
conditions of Latinos in the United States. He
was involved in successful efforts to win a
large-scale amnesty for undocumented immi-
grants in 1986, and the years-long campaign
to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain
drivers’ licenses in the 1990s.
In 1996 Lopez and Hermandad was instru-
mental on a Latino get-out-the-vote drive that
helped Loretta Sanchez win California’s 46th
District seat in the U.S. Congress.
In 1996 Nativo was elected as a trustee of
the Santa Ana Unified School District and
served through 2003. Backed by the
MALDEF—Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund—he claimed that the
practice of printing initiative and recall petitions
in English-only was a violation of the 1965
Voting Rights Act. This led to the state requir-
ing Spanish-language petitions statewide in
2002, and local jurisdictions also providing
multilingual election materials.
Nativo was a key co-organizer of the 2006
United States immigration reform protests.
Over 500,000 people marched for comprehen-
sive immigration reform in those marches in
Los Angeles and Santa Ana. Nativo was lead-
er in making this a reality.
Nativo has been a previous member of
LULAC and has renewed his 2019 member-
ship with Santa Ana LULAC Council No. 147.
He has worked closely with LULAC National
President Domingo Garcia to stop the building
of the border wall and continuing his struggle
for the adoption of a comprehensive immigra-
tion reform that has a smooth pathway to-
wards citizenship.
Nativo Lopez is truly a fighter for the immi-
grant community, and I am proud to honor his
commitment to the community.

Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, today I rec-
ognize and celebrate Mr. D. Scott Karns, a
dedicated husband, father, grandfather, men-
tor, business owner and community leader
from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.
After graduating from Messiah College with
a B.S. in Business Administration, Mr. Karns
joined his father, David, at the family grocery
business, Karns Quality Foods, in 1977. Upon
joining the company, Scott began learning
every facet of the business, and in 1989, he
succeeded his father as Chief Executive Offi-
cer.
Mr. Karns takes great pride in operating
Karns Quality Foods with his family, which has
grown to eight stores in Central Pennsylvania
that total over 370,000 square feet, employs
over 1,200 associates, and serves 100,000
customers each week. Mr. Karns and his team
have capitalized on the advantages of a lo-
cally-owned and -operated business by cater-
ing directly to their customers’ needs and re-
quests. Their hard work and dedication has re-
sulted in Karns Quality Foods recognition as
the premier meat and seafood store in the
greater Harrisburg area.
In addition to his business leadership, Mr.
Karns recently was honored by the Boy
Scouts of America New Birth of Freedom

RECOGNIZING THE 2019 TYSONS
REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COM-
MERCE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Tysons Regional Chamber of
Commerce and to congratulate the incoming
2019 board members.
Tysons has drastically transformed during
the past 56 years from a sleepy, rural area to
one of the most vibrant regions in the country.
This change began when the Fairfax County
Board of Supervisors approved plans for the
Tysons Corner Shopping Center in 1962.
When the mall opened in 1968, it was hailed
as the largest enclosed mall in the world.
Since then, there has been a dramatic influx
of technology companies, government con-
tracting firms, and other corporations. Tysons
has become the premier business district of
the Washington Metropolitan Area and is one
of the largest employment centers in the
United States. With the opening of Metro’s Sil-
ver Line and ongoing redevelopment, the re-
gion is expected to continue adding not only
businesses but also high-density residential
housing. 45 million square feet of transit-ori-
ented development is already present in
Tysons and more is on the way.
The mission of the Tysons Regional Cham-
ber of Commerce is to be the unified voice of
the business community while ensuring that its
ties and commitment to the community are
strengthened.
The Chamber actively promotes local non-
profits and community organizations as well as
youth educational programs, and it sponsors
multiple events each year in support of these
activities. The growth of the Chamber has
been the result of the diversity of its members
and the leadership of its Board. I am pleased
to include in the RECORD the names of the in-
coming 2019 board members:
Chairman of the Board: Tucker Gladhill
At-Large Members: Alex Levy, Andrew
Clark, Anthony Anikeeff, Audrey Lustre, Chris
Tomseth, David MacGillivray, Diana Villareal,
Dr. Michelle Walker, Frederick Keown, Gina

Tadross, Rod Loges, Rodney Lusk, Samim
Ardeishar, Sanjay Srikantiah, Suzan Zimmer-
man, Timothy Klinkner, Uppasna Chand, Vir-
ginia Case, and Walter Kim.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in congratulating the incoming board
members and in commending the Tysons Re-
gional Chamber of Commerce for its commit-
ment to promoting the business community
while encouraging social responsibility and
civic engagement. I wish the Chamber the
very best for its continued growth and suc-

DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference
in my Congressional District. I would like to
recognize a remarkable woman, Dr. Diane L.
Evans of La Crescenta, California.
Dr. Evans has been the Director for Earth
Science and Technology Directorate at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion’s (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
for the last fifteen years, and is the first
woman to lead the Earth Science activities at
JPL. During her tenure, the Directorate has
grown substantially in annual funding and the
number of spaceborne missions in develop-
ment has increased as well.
Dr. Evans holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Ge-
ology from Occidental College in Los Angeles
and both a Master of Science and a Ph.D. de-
gree in Geological Sciences from the Univer-
sity of Washington in Seattle. A member of
many international science teams, Diane has
been a principal investigator on several re-
search activities sponsored by NASA.
Diane is responsible for the implementation,
development and operations of JPL’s Earth
Science flight experiments and missions. One
such mission was entitled ‘‘Grace’’ and ac-
complished its main goal of measuring the
Earth’s gravity field and measuring water loss
from major aquifers and ice loss from Green-
land. The Grace mission represents one mis-
sion whose science results have expended
beyond its original objectives to include other
crucial measurements, thus making key con-
tributions to understanding our world. Dr.
Evans has been instrumental in defining the
missions, which often include domestic and
foreign partnerships.
Earth Science research at JPL, which is
also under Diane’s direction, include research
areas of oceanography, geophysics, climate,
atmospheric composition and combines a wide
spectrum of advanced technologies. Dr. Evans
has chaired many planning committees for
NASA and other academic institutions, has au-
thored more than one hundred research publi-
cations and conference presentations in the
areas of geologic and radar remote sensing
and has presented many courses on these
topics globally. For her outstanding leadership
and accomplishments in the development of
Earth science missions, Diane has received
many awards including the NASA Outstanding
Leadership Medal.
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Dr. Diane L.
Evans.

IN RECOGNITION OF CAROLINE
SERRATO
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Caroline Serrato upon her retirement
from the Hillsborough Police Department after
23 years of service to the residents of
Hillsborough, California, and after 31 years in
law enforcement. Caroline Serrato has en-
joyed a long career in law enforcement dating
back to May 20, 1988 when she was first
sworn in as a peace officer and park ranger
for the City of Escondido.
The City of Brisbane benefited from Caro-
line’s leadership where she served starting in
1993. For a brief time, she was also a peace
officer for the University of San Francisco
where she attained the rank of Inspector and
then Sergeant.
The Town of Hillsborough recruited Caroline
in 1996 and she quickly proved to be an ex-
emplary addition to its police force. She was
the first school liaison officer and was pro-
moted to Inspector in 1998 and to Corporal in
2001. Hillsborough’s policing environment is
specialized. In addition to the town’s rolling
hills and leafy streets, both deceptively serene
yet creating a complex web to patrol, you can
add the challenge of protecting visiting lumi-
naries and leadership from around the globe.
Caroline met the challenge by being profes-
sional and polite, firm but fair. She was quickly

identified as a leader by the department’s
managers and became a Sergeant in 2002.
In 2007 she was promoted to the rank of
Lieutenant and assumed even greater man-
agement duties, and in 2011 she became a
Captain. During her years of service, Caroline
Serrato gained the trust of residents and town
leadership by becoming the project manager
for large scale projects that benefitted resi-
dents. Communicating as a police department
in the modern era requires that key informa-
tion systems and social media platforms either
be created or updated regularly. With no fan-
fare but profound impact, she either led or as-
sisted in these projects.
During her service, Caroline Serrato was re-
sponsible for investigating and obtaining the
conviction of countless criminals. Residents
could be confident that when Caroline Serrato
was investigating their case, the job was being
performed by a true professional. She also
mentored others so that she could be a force
multiplier for the police department, and she
provided training to both the public and the
staff to ensure that both were able to protect
themselves. In short, this small police depart-
ment was able to handle much larger respon-
sibilities because Caroline’s willingness to
teach others how to become outstanding offi-
cers.
Caroline Serrato holds a Bachelor’s Degree
in Management from St. Mary’s College where
she graduated with honors, and she attended
the Delinquency Control Institute at the Uni-
versity of Southern California. When cities
throughout our county decided to exchange
talented individuals from other communities,
and to expend the funds needed to provide
training, city management sent Caroline to the
city manager’s office to learn about city man-
agement from Daly City.
Madam Speaker, Caroline Serrato’s commit-
ment to Hillsborough could never be doubted,
nor could her commitment to the highest
standards of law enforcement. We celebrate
her retirement after 31 years in law enforce-
ment. Her career proves the point that if law
enforcement is performed with an even hand
and with justice close to the heart, then body-
worn cameras throughout our nation will
record that democracy is safe in America.

HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill that would exempt from federal
government shutdowns the federal and inde-
pendent civil and criminal justice system law
enforcement agencies that are exclusively or
primarily federally funded but have exclusive
jurisdiction over District of Columbia matters.
This bill is modeled on a provision I have been
able to get enacted each year since the 2013
shutdown to exempt the D.C. government
from shutdowns.
This bill would exempt the following agen-
cies from federal government shutdowns:
Court Services and Offender Supervision
Agency, D.C. Courts, D.C. Public Defender
Service, D.C. Commission on Judicial Disabil-
ities and Tenure, D.C. Judicial Nomination
Commission, and D.C. Criminal Justice Co-
ordinating Council. These agencies are not
under the District’s control and are funded ex-
clusively by the federal government, with one
exception, the D.C. Criminal Justice Coordi-
nating Council, which is an independent agen-
cy within the D.C. government with federal
members primarily, but not exclusively, funded
by the federal government. However, these
agencies provide critical local services to the
District, including law enforcement, and should
continue to function during a shutdown.
Each of these agencies was adversely af-
fected by the recent 35-day shutdown, includ-
ing canceled services and furloughed employ-
ees. My bill would allow these agencies to
continue to function during a shutdown, in
much the same way that the D.C. government
itself is now exempt from shutting down during
a federal shutdown. I urge my colleagues to
support this important bill.

Born in Levittown, New York, Karen’s family
moved to California when she was five years
old. She lived in Northern California until 1976
when she moved to Hollywood, California to
work in the movie industry. Karen’s acting
roles included the ‘‘Voice of the Devil’’ in the
sequel movie to ‘‘The Exorcist,’’ a small part in
‘‘The Incredible Shrinking Woman’’ movie,
roles on the stage and voice-over jobs, while
working at various jobs as a restaurant man-
ager, driving instructor and waitress to support
herself. Karen then worked at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Publications
Department as the Graphics Manager for four-
teen years and after UCLA closed the depart-
ment, began working for the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art as the Graphics Man-
ager in their Graphic Design Department.
A homeowner in Atwater Village since 2004,
after Ms. Knapp retired, she became involved
in national and local politics, and began volun-
teering for various organizations, such as the
Sustainability Alliance and the Alliance of
River Communities. In 2012, she was elected
to the Atwater Village Neighborhood Council,
where she is currently serving her third term.
As a councilmember, Karen participates in a
variety of committees, attends Los Angeles
City Council meetings and organizes activities.
In addition to her service on the Atwater Vil-
lage Neighborhood Council, Karen has been a
dedicated, hardworking volunteer for the
Friends of the Los Angeles River’s Great Los
Angeles River Cleanup, which is known as the
largest urban river cleanup in the nation.
Ms. Knapp enjoys helping out her friends

IN RECOGNITION OF CHARLES S.
TEMEL
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a
distinguished leader and dedicated advocate
of the New York Jewish community, Mr.
Charles S. Temel.
Mr. Temel has served for nearly three years
as President of the Jewish Community Rela-
tions Council of New York (JCRC–NY). During
that time he has led JCRC–NY in advocating
for and ensuring the rights, interests, and val-
ues of the New York Jewish community.
Mr. Temel is being honored on April 9th, at
the JCRC–NY’s 2019 Gala Dinner for his ex-
traordinary leadership and contributions to this
organization that he has led for the past three
years.
Under Mr. Temel’s leadership, not only has
JCRC–NY helped strengthen the Jewish com-
munity in New York, it has also operated at
the local community level to form partnerships
with other ethnic and religious communities to
solve issues that are of collective concern.
These cross-organizational coalitions serve to
promote understanding and cultural apprecia-
tion across diverse communities while improv-
ing local resources such as health services,
nonprofit operations and governance, and the
special needs of the aging, émigrés, and
youth.
In addition to his exemplary leadership of
JCRC–NY, Mr. Temel has served many other
worthy nonprofit organizations over the years
including the American Friends of Ben-Gurion
University’s executive and investment commit-
tees, the latter of which he chaired. Addition-
ally, he is an active member of the Cornell
University Library Advisory, the Cornell Univer-
sity Council, and the Cornell Friends of Jewish
Studies through his alma mater, Cornell Uni-
versity.
Mr. Temel has also led a successful profes-
sional career as an accomplished consultant
in the financial services industry. He currently
works as Managing Director at UBS Financial
Services, Inc., focusing on portfolio construc-
tion and investment returns. He has been
named as one of the ‘‘Top 400 Financial Advi-
sors in the United States’’ by the Financial
Times from 2014 2019. He has been recog-
nized in Barron’s Best-in-States Advisors List
for 2019. Additionally, he was named to the
Forbes Best-In-State Wealth Advisors List in
2018 and 2019.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating Charles S. Temel for the
honor he is receiving tomorrow night and to
recognize all he has done to strengthen New
York’s Jewish community, help unify New
York’s diverse ethnic and religious commu-
nities, and create a better New York for all.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF
MAJOR ALLEN SANDERSON, JR.
HON. LARRY BUCSHON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the service of Major Allen Sanderson
Jr., and to thank him for his dedication to edu-
cating young Hoosiers and ensuring the pres-
ervation of the history of the United States of
America.
Born in Roanoke, Virginia on November 17,
1922, Allen Sanderson enlisted in the United
States Army Air Corps as a Lieutenant in
1942. Over the course of his service in World
War II, Major Sanderson took part in more
than 118 flight missions in his P–47 Thunder-
bolt ‘‘Lady Jane’’ as a member of the 64th
Fighter Squadron, including two missions over
the beaches of Normandy on D-Day in 1944.
After being honorably discharged after the
war, Major Sanderson pursued a career in fi-
nance as a credit manager.
However, Major Sanderson’s service to his
community did not stop when he left the mili-
tary. After moving to Evansville, IN, Allen
began volunteering with the Evansville War-
time Museum, eventually becoming a board
member of the museum and serving as its
World War II veteran liaison.
In this capacity, Allen has passed on his
stories and experiences from the war to thou-
sands of students who visited the museum, or
whose classes he visited from across South-
western Indiana over the last seven years. Mr.
Sanderson’s firsthand experiences allow him
to bring the events and history of WWII to life
in a way that a textbook never could, and is
an invaluable asset to the Evansville commu-
nity. Even today at the age of 96, Major
Sanderson continues his efforts, educating
young Hoosiers and telling his incredible story.
I join Major Sanderson’s friends, family, and
community in thanking him for his service and
sacrifice to our country, and for his continued
dedication to preserving our history and edu-
cating young Hoosiers.

RECOGNIZING FATHER ANDREW
GREEN ON THE OCCASION OF HIS
RETIREMENT
HON. RAUL RUIZ
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate Father Andrew Green on his retire-
ment after 30 years of leading the St. Paul in
the Desert Episcopal Church.
Father Green joined St. Paul in the Desert
in December 1988. From his earliest days in
our Valley, Father Green has been a generous
and compassionate leader.
Father Green was a trailblazer who advo-
cated for the Coachella Valley’s LGBTQI com-
munity at a time when few religious leaders
would. He was one of the first religious lead-
ers to bury AIDS sufferers and many same-
sex couples. Through his words and actions,
he lives a gospel that recognizes the equality
of all people and the fundamental dignity of
humanity.
Outside of his parish, Father Green brought
his leadership to the Desert AIDS Project’s
board of directors, where he served as a
member of the board for 18 years. He also
helped empower young people with a quality
education through his work with the Palm
Springs Unified School District. A generation
of tomorrow’s leaders owe him their gratitude.
From feeding the hungry to advocating for
the LGBTQI community, Father Green’s com-
mitment to serving others knew no bounds. By
doing good, he brings out the best in others.
His life demonstrates that love always wins.
Father Green has touched the lives of so
many people, spreading love to every corner
of our Desert. I have no doubt that his legacy
of faith and grace will continue to uplift our
Valley for years to come. I wish him a long,
healthy, and happy retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE 2018–2019 PRINCE
WILLIAM COUNTY PUBLIC
SCHOOLS DIVISION ON OBTAIN-
ING CERTIFICATION OR RECER-
TIFICATION BY THE NATIONAL
BOARD FOR PROFESSIONAL
TEACHING STANDARDS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 8, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
congratulate the educators serving in the
Prince William County Public Schools Division
on obtaining certification or recertification by
the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards.
Founded in 1987, the National Board was
established by teachers for teachers as the
premier vehicle for defining and recognizing
accomplished educators. Today, this inde-
pendent nonprofit organization remains dedi-
cated to supporting excellence in education
and is governed by classroom teachers,
school administrators, school board leaders,
governors, state legislators, higher education
officials, teacher union leaders, and business
and community leaders.
A National Board Certification denotes the
most respected professional certification avail-
able in the education field. Obtaining certifi-
cation and completing the renewal process is
a personal and public statement of one’s com-
mitment to the evolution of effective instruction
methods. In order to obtain the distinction,
teachers must display a mastering of the
standards established by the National Board
by successfully completing a rigorous multi-
component assessment that demonstrates that
he or she has acquired the knowledge, skills,
and practices required of an accomplished ed-
ucator. Certified educators support a vision of
teaching based on the following five core
propositions:
Teachers are committed to students and
their learning;
Teachers know the subjects they teach and
how to teach those subjects to students;
Teachers are responsible for managing and
monitoring student learning;
Teachers think systematically about their
practice and learn from experience; and
Teachers are members of learning commu-
nities.
I extend my personal congratulations and
appreciation to the following 2018 National
Board Certified Teachers for receiving their re-
spective certifications and renewals:
Amber Tiernan, Patriot High School.
Amanda Proch, Gifted Education.
Amy Ivory, Colgan High School.
Christina Sherman, Marumsco Hills Elemen-
tary School.
Julie Faith, Stonewall Jackson High School.
Carolyn Ciminelli, Old Bridge Elementary

the tireless efforts of teachers who make ex-
cellence the standard and I thank them for

ticipation in the Sierra Club, Angeles Chapter,

In addition to her outstanding work in the
community, Ms. Kramer is passionate about
animal rescue work, and has been working to
try to initiate the City of Los Angeles Depart-
ment of Animal Service’s Volunteer Animal Of-
ficer program and supports other worthwhile
animal rescue organizations.

setts, Pat credits her grandparents, immigrants
from the Ukraine, with teaching her good val-
ues, installing in her the importance of hard

Pat’s full life includes hiking, gardening and
