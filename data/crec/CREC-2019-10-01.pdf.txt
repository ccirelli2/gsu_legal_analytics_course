RECOGNIZING ALLEN AND LINDA
ERICKSON OF KALISPELL
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Allen and Linda Erickson of
Kalispell for their commitment to local vet-
erans, and their families, through the North
West Montana Veterans Service Center.
The nonprofit organization was born from
Allen’s vision to serve Montana veterans. He
organized and executed a two-day event,
Stand Down, to provide supplies and services
to homeless veterans. The now annual Stand
Down event led to the creation of the Veterans
Service Center, which Allen founded and
leads as president. The service center in-
cludes a food pantry, a thrift store, and med-
ical equipment loans—all tailored to serve vet-
erans.
Allen and Linda opened the Food Pantry in
2002 and have helped organize the commu-
nity to provide over 156,000 pounds of food to
those in need. They have helped provide food
to over 2,000 veteran households and over
500 children.
The Veterans Thrift Store provides services
such as ‘‘move in’’ assistance, basic furniture,
and seasonal clothing. The service center also
includes access to shower and laundry facili-
ties for homeless veterans in the community.
In addition to the Stand Downs and the
North West Montana Veterans Service Center,
the Ericksons have been working on creating
Camp Ponderosa Veterans Retreat. The live-
in treatment facility will provide veterans with
counseling and group therapy. Similar to the
Stand Downs, the facility will offer a commu-
nity for veterans battling homelessness to
learn job skills and apply for jobs.
The Ericksons have spent so much of their
time dedicated to making this vision become a
reality. With the help of countless volunteers
and a generous anonymous donor, the camp
will become a place for veterans to heal, re-
cover, and rebuild.
Madam Speaker, for their selfless work to
provide greater opportunity for our veterans, I
recognize Allen and Linda Erickson of Kali-
spell for their spirit of Montana.

WELCOME GRACE MARGUERITE
MARTIN
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I am
happy to congratulate Amanda Martin and
James Martin of Royal Oak, Michigan, on the
birth of their new baby girl, Grace Marguerite
Martin. Grace Marguerite Martin was born on
September 16, 2019, at Ascension St. John
Hospital in Detroit, Michigan at 10:54 a.m.
Grace weighed eight pounds and six ounces
and measured 20 and 8/10 inches long.
I would also like to congratulate Grace’s
grandparents, Kathryn and Mark Higgins of
Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan, Heather and
Matthew Martin of Wilmington, North Carolina,
Barbara Kortas of Warren, Michigan, and John
Ponczocha of Wyandotte, Michigan, as well as
her great grandmother, Marguerite Gore, of
Grosse Point Woods, Michigan. Congratula-
tions to the entire family as they welcome their
newest addition of pure pride and joy.

HONORING MARIAH COLLINS AND
HANNAH MCJESSY FOR THEIR
LIFE-SAVING EFFORTS
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor and thank University of Cincinnati nurs-
ing students Mariah Collins and Hannah
McJessy for their life-saving assistance to the
victim of a tragic drive-by shooting on Short
Vine Street in April.
Mariah and Hannah were walking on Short
Vine Street when the shooting occurred. After
witnessing a man fall to the ground, they leapt
into action and used a belt from a bystander
as a tourniquet to slow the victim’s bleeding
until he was able to be transported to UC
Medical Center for care.
Mariah and Hannah are heroes. I am proud
to see them recognized for their extraordinary
courage and actions. I can think of no two re-
cipients more deserving of the certificate of
merit from the American Red Cross than these
two outstanding women and future nurses.
I wish them both the best of luck in their
medical careers.

HONORING HARRIS COUNTY SHER-
IFF’S DEPUTY SANDEEP SINGH
DHALIWAL
HON. DAN CRENSHAW
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Harris County Sheriff
Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal, who was
tragically and senselessly murdered in the line
of duty while serving the Houston community.
Deputy Dhaliwal’s life was devoted to serv-
ice—to his family, his community, and the resi-
dents of Harris County.
Deputy Dhaliwal helped coordinate disaster
relief efforts after Hurricane Harvey. He
worked with at-risk youth to improve their
lives. He recently expressed a desire to start
a free food bus to help feed the homeless, be-
cause he could not imagine people in his com-
munity going hungry. In the days before his
passing, he expressed his dream of creating a
fund for first responders and fallen heroes,
which UNITED SIKHS will carry on in his
name.
Deputy Dhaliwal’s service extended beyond
his own community. He recently returned from
volunteering in Puerto Rico, where he assisted
in the recovery efforts after Hurricane Maria.
He also recently visited his ancestral village in
Punjab to deliver water and other necessities
to farmers during a drought.
Deputy Dhaliwal was the first Sikh deputy in
the Harris County Sheriff’s Department’s his-
tory to wear the Sikh articles of faith, including
his dastaar (turban), kesh (unshorn hair), and
kara (steel bracelet) on duty, breaking down
the barrier between religious observance and
uniformed service. He was proud—and his
community was proud of him—for receiving
his historic religious accommodation to serve.
He was a role model for Sikh Americans na-
tionwide who are interested in a career of
service to our nation.
Deputy Dhaliwal was known for his warm
and welcoming personality. He was always
willing to go out of his way to make the person
with whom he was speaking feel respected.
Deputy Dhaliwal was especially warm with
children. Since the day of his final patrol,
many parents have posted videos of Deputy
Dhaliwal interacting with their children. They
all ended with a warm hug.
As a Houstonian, I am heartbroken over the
loss of Deputy Dhaliwal, but as with every
tragedy in my hometown, I am proud to see
the community come together in the face of
adversity. While this display of compassion
does not come close to replacing the hus-
band, father, and son his family lost, it is a
small way of showing how much Houston ap-
preciates Deputy Dhaliwal and his contribu-
tions to our community and the inspiration he
created for Sikhs who want to serve our na-
tion. He was a trailblazer and a hero.
I urge all who hear and read this to take a
moment to remember the life of Deputy
Dhaliwal. The world would be a better place if
we all lived by the example Deputy Dhaliwal
set.

IN RECOGNITION OF COLONEL
SCOTT MCFARLANE’S DEDICATED
SERVICE IN THE U.S. ARMY
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the career and dedicated serv-
ice of Door County Veteran Service Officer,
Colonel Scott A. McFarlane.
Colonel McFarlane spent 30 years in the
U.S. Army in both active and reserve service.
While enlisted, he attended numerous special-
ized military schools, expanding his ability to

further serve our nation. His first deployment
was in support of Operation Desert Storm as
the Commander of Eagle Troop, 3rd Armored
Cavalry Regiment. Colonel McFarlane was
later deployed as a reservist to Iraq in 2005.
In addition to his deployments abroad, he
served as Brigade Commander of Future
Combat Systems at Fort Knox, Kentucky and
as Deputy Commander for Mobilization at Fort
McCoy. Colonel McFarlane’s service earned
him the Bronze Star with ‘‘V’’ device, the Meri-
torious Service Medal with three oak leaf clus-
ters, the Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Kuwait
Liberation Medal.
In 2006, Colonel McFarlane was named the
Door County Veteran Service Officer (CVSO).
Prior to being named CVSO, Colonel McFar-
lane assisted veterans as the Regional Coor-
dinator for the State of Wisconsin Department
of Veteran Affairs and at King Veterans Home.
His dedication to country, service, and his fel-
low veterans consistently shows throughout
his career. During his 30-year career in the
U.S. Army, Colonel McFarlane served as
CVSO for 13 years, serving 6 of those years
during multiple deployments.
As we pause to look back on the impact
Colonel McFarlane left on the those he
served, it is without a doubt that his commit-
ment to those he served, his devotion to his
fellow veterans, and his love for his country
left a lasting impression. Upon retiring as
CVSO, he will enjoy spending more time with
his wife Cori, his children, and his grand-
children.
Colonel Scott McFarlane’s service to this
country and to his fellow veterans is unparal-
leled. Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to join me in thanking Colonel McFar-
lane for his service to this great nation and his
commitment to supporting countless veterans
in Wisconsin’s 8th Congressional District.

Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I would like
to take this opportunity to include in the

FACES AND VOICES OF RECOVERY
For 30 years, National Recovery Month has

Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Augustus
Burns Elkins II, an Administrative Law judge in
my district, who on September 30, 2019 re-
tired after 35 years of public service.
Judge Elkins’ service is one of dedication to
his home state of North Carolina and the na-

North Carolina, achieving the rank of Lt. Colo-
nel. He also served as the Deputy Director of
the North Carolina Department of Administra-

His retirement from the Office of Administra-

commitment to ensuring accessibility to serv-
ices and support for people with disabilities.
He is regarded as a leading expert in North

ities Act and Individuals with Disability Act.
Recently, he was honored with the 2018 Dis-
tinguished Service Award by the Exceptional

Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I rise

Roots Reunion. This reunion, which originally
started as a decennial reunion of the Douglass

portunity for participants to share stories, ex-
plore the growth of El Paso’s African American

As a native El Pasoan, it is an honor to rec-
ognize the Return to our El Paso Roots Re-

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF
ABEY KAPPAMAMMOOTTIL
VARUGHESE
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the remarkable life of Abey
Kappamammoottil Varughese.
Abey was born on July 29, 1962 to K.T. and
Chinnamma Varughese in Kerala, India. He
was the youngest of four siblings and was
greatly loved by his immediate and extended
family. Abey loved to learn and excelled
throughout his grade school years. He went
on to receive a Bachelor of Science in Chem-
istry from the University of Kerala. After immi-
grating to America, he proudly worked as a re-
search and development chemist for much of
his career.
Abey and his wife Lishba were married on
July 29, 1987. He and Lishba resided in Wa-
terford, Michigan and celebrated over 30 years
of marriage together.
Abey passed away on June 30, 2019 sur-
rounded by his family. He is survived by his
wife Lishba, his son and daughter-in-law Jere-
miah and Jincy Varughese, his daughter and
son-in-law Hannah and Nathan Gyani, and his
newest granddaughter, Ranni Varughese.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in reflecting on the life of Abey
Kappamammoottil Varughese and his many
contributions to his community in Southeast
Michigan.
IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONOR-
ABLE JUDGE HOWARD F. SACHS
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Honorable Judge Howard
F. Sachs’ service and commitment to justice
throughout his forty years on the bench. Judge
Sachs has spent his entire career advancing
the cause of justice in his hometown of Kan-
sas City, Missouri and throughout Missouri’s
Fifth Congressional District.
A lifelong Kansas Citian, Judge Sachs was
born in 1925 to Alex and Rose Sachs. Judge
Sachs attended Southwest High School in
Kansas City’s Brookside neighborhood before
serving the country in the Pacific Theatre as a
Naval Electrical Technician’s Mate aboard the
U.S.S. South Dakota. While he was anchored
in Tokyo Bay on Fleet Admiral Chester Nim-
itz’s Flag Ship, the Japanese signed the terms
of surrender, ending World War II. Judge
Sachs was there, serving his country, during
this significant moment in history. Upon dis-
charge from the military, Judge Sachs at-
tended Williams College in Williamstown, Mas-
sachusetts, where he received his bachelor’s
degree and graduated valedictorian of his
class in 1947. In 1950, Judge Sachs received
his Juris Doctor with honors from Harvard Law
School.
After completing law school, Judge Sachs
returned to his hometown of Kansas City and
was a law clerk for the Honorable Albert A.
Ridge of the U.S. District Court for the West-
ern District of Missouri from 1950 to 1951.
While clerking for Judge Ridge, Judge Sachs
was assigned the well-known Swope Park
Swimming Pool case, which challenged the
constitutionality of segregated municipal pools
in Kansas City. He contributed to the opinion
siding with the argument made by the
NAACP’s chief attorney at the time, Thurgood
Marshall, that segregated public swimming
pools violated the constitution of the United
States. Though this case was profoundly sig-
nificant, the work of Judge Sachs was only be-
ginning. During his private practice in the
1950s, a tumultuous time for race relations in
America, Judge Sachs served as Chairman of
the Board of the Urban League of Greater
Kansas City and helped orchestrate the ad-
mission of women and African American law-
yers into the Kansas City Bar Association. In
1962, Judge Sachs drafted the ordinance that
finally ended segregated public accommoda-
tions in Kansas City, Missouri. Judge Sachs
also was a force for change via the significant
leadership positions he held within the com-
munity, serving as a member of the Kansas
City Commission on Human Relations and as
President of the Jewish Community Relations
Bureau.
After thirty years in private practice, Judge
Sachs was nominated for his position on the
recommendation of Senator Thomas F. Eagle-
ton, appointed by President Jimmy Carter, and
took office in October 1979, making him the
first native-born Kansas Citian to serve in the
Western District of Missouri. When Judge
Sachs was confirmed, he was the first Jewish
district judge to sit within the Eighth Circuit in
nearly one hundred years. In 1990, Judge
Sachs served as chief judge of the court and
took senior status in 1992. While on the
bench, Judge Sachs has overseen numerous
noteworthy cases, from ruling that inmates
had a right to marriage in 1984—a case which
eventually reached the Supreme Court—to the
writing of a lower court ruling in Mistretta that
challenged the constitutionality of the Sen-
tencing Commission and produced federal
sentencing guidelines. Even in his fortieth year
on the bench, Judge Howard F. Sachs con-
tinues to maintain a significant docket.
Throughout his career, Judge Sachs has re-
ceived noteworthy public recognition including
numerous awards from the Lawyers Associa-
tion of Kansas City, the Kansas City Metropoli-
tan Bar Association, the Truman Award for
Public Service, the Difference-Maker Award
from the Urban League of Greater Kansas
City, and the designation of ‘‘Judge Howard F.
Sachs Day’’ on September 26, 2019 by the
city of Kansas City, Missouri, in recognition of
forty years of distinguished service on the
Federal Judiciary.
Judge Howard F. Sachs’ reputation equals
impressive his legal career. He is widely-
known for his unparalleled devotion to the
legal profession and his well-analyzed, clearly
expressed opinions rooted in the bedrock of
justice. Distinguished by his intellectual inter-
est, faithfulness to precedent, and reserved
demeanor, Judge Sachs has established an
inspirational legacy steeped in justice, fair-
ness, and due process. To this day, at ninety-
four years old, he remains as veracious and
committed to his duties as his first day on the
bench.
Madam Speaker, please join me and all of
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District in cele-
brating Judge Howard F. Sachs’ forty years
serving as a U.S. District Judge of the United
States District Court for the Western District of
Missouri. Let us honor his unremitting commit-
ment to the American people, and the rule of
law.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF GUY

HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the service of long-time law
enforcement officer and community advocate,
Guy Swanger.
In January 2011, Chief Swanger was sworn
in as the Concord Police Chief, taking com-
mand of a 154-member department in a city of

and children, Chief Swanger played a crucial
part in bringing the Central County Family Jus-
tice Center to Concord to provide support to
domestic violence victims.
Prior to joining the Concord Police Depart-
ment, Chief Swanger spent 26-years with the
San Diego Police Department. In that role, he
served as Executive Director of the San Diego
Family Justice Center under the Office of the
Mayor. He also co-authored Managing Innova-
tion in Policing: The Untapped Potential of the

INTRODUCTION OF PROTECTING
FEDERAL AGENCIES AND EM-
PLOYEES FROM POLITICAL IN-
TERFERENCE ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I
rise to introduce the Protecting Federal Agen-
cies and Employees from Political Interference
Act, which would require an act of Congress
before any federal agency headquarters may
be moved out of the National Capital Region
(NCR). My bill would require that the head-
quarters of any agency located in the NCR on
the date of the introduction of this bill remain
in the NCR absent subsequent legislation.
This bill is cosponsored by Representatives
ANTHONY BROWN and JAMIE RASKIN.
The Trump administration has already
begun moving agencies out of the NCR to the
detriment of federal employees, their families
and the work of these agencies. Employees
who work in agency headquarters fulfill the in-
dispensable role of keeping Congress and the
president informed of agency activities. Con-
gress cannot do its work to write laws and en-
gage in vital oversight without the unvarnished
facts that nonpartisan agencies provide. In
fact, we have already seen the negative im-
pacts of these relocation efforts. The Bureau
of Land Management (BLM) has announced
that it will be moving its headquarters staff to
Grand Junction, Colorado, where agency staff
will share office space with a Chevron cor-
porate office, a state oil and gas association
and an independent natural gas exploration
company.
As for the Department of Agriculture’s relo-
cation efforts, two-thirds of impacted highly
specialized employees will not relocate to
Kansas City, retiring early or quitting instead.
Preliminary reports suggest similarly low reten-
tion rates for BLM staffers asked to relocate
west. While agency leadership touts these
moves as cost effective, the work of the agen-
cy suffers when experienced personnel leave
and relocation efforts appear to favor special
interests.
Unless measures like the Protecting Federal
Agencies and Employees from Political Inter-
ference Act are taken to stop agencies from
relocating, the federal government will lose
more employees and agencies will be unable
to perform critical tasks, like assisting Con-
gress in vital oversight.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
bill.

HONORING THE BRAVE MEN AND
WOMEN OF THE SPRING FIRE
DEPARTMENT
HON. DAN CRENSHAW
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the brave men and women of
the Spring Fire Department, a public safety
agency that has come a long way in its 66-
year history, but never so much as in the past
decade.
For the first few decades, local residents
and businesses passed the hat, and volun-
teers manned the donated and frequently pre-
owned, equipment.
As Spring has evolved from a rural railroad
stop into a Houston suburb, the fire depart-
ment has grown alongside the community. In
1997, Spring Fire began employing profes-
sional firefighters to supplement their volun-
teers during the daytime hours.
Meeting the expectations of a rapidly grow-
ing population is a challenge they meet every
day. Six of Spring’s nine fire stations were
built this decade. Station 74 is the last of the
new stations to open for service.
Every day, the men and women of the
Spring Fire Department provide fire suppres-
sion, emergency medical response, and more
to over 152,000 people in 62 square miles of
northern Harris County.
From a fire department where volunteers
heard the siren and rushed to a station to pick
up a fire engine, Spring has evolved into a
combination department that staffs all its nine
stations 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Today, the department has a mix of full-time,
part-time and volunteer firefighters to answer
the calls. With a fleet of over two dozen
pieces of fire and rescue apparatus, along
with more than a dozen support vehicles,
Spring firefighters respond to fires, medical
emergencies, vehicle accidents, and highwater
rescues.
Built to withstand strong hurricane-force
winds, the new Station 74 is already home to
an engine and a tanker. Designed with the fu-
ture in mind, Station 74 will be able to house
more fire equipment, an additional crew, and
a District Chief in the years to come.
The new Spring Fire Station 74 is a testa-
ment to the commitment of the department,
their command staff, and the board of Harris
County Emergency Services District Number 7
to serve Spring today and in the future.
It is my honor to be part of the Spring Fire
Station 74 Grand Opening Celebration on Oc-
tober 5. May God bless these crews putting
their lives on the line for this community every
day, and may God continue to bless Texas
and the United States of America.

the Pastorate with a vision to build a Luke 14
church where people could find help, hope,
and a family. On Easter Sunday 1998, Faith
Family Church dedicated a new sanctuary and
ministry campus with a vision to be: ‘‘A
Church with a heart for all people’’ that would
‘‘Not see through people but help see people
through.’’
Faith Family Church has provided Christ-
centered education to equip people for a bet-
ter life through Faith Academy, Destiny Bible
Institute, Celebrate Recovery and hundreds of
classes, workshops, and community small
groups weekly. Their vision to encourage, em-
power, and equip overlooked churches in
overlooked places has led to the development
of the Significant Church Network. Their heart
to further the reach of the Gospel led them to
open campuses in Hallettsville and Gonzales,
Texas.
The people of Faith Family provide help and
assistance to the surrounding community
through efforts including: Passion Week
projects, Backpack outreach, Toys for Tots,
Sidewalk Sunday School, Adopt-a-block, and
Prison Ministry. Faith Family served as a tem-
porary shelter in 2005 for those fleeing Hurri-
cane Katrina and, in 2017, was a central point
to coordinate relief efforts following Hurricane
Harvey.
Their commitment to underserved and
unreached populations across the world has
built 19 Bible Schools, planted 526 churches,
supported orphanages in Guatemala, and de-
livered aid to other parts of the world. Con-
structed in India, The House of Psalms 1 & 2
rescues girls from sex-trafficking, giving them
an education and a new way of life.
President George Washington acknowl-
edged that ‘‘religion and morality are indispen-
sable supports’’ of our nation. For 30 years,
Pastor Jim has committed himself to the study
and sharing of Scripture, the building up of be-
lievers, and the leadership, guidance, and
ministry to the staff and people of Faith Family
Church. The fruit of his labor has strengthened
the moral fabric here in our community and in
communities around the world.
I would like to personally congratulate Pas-
tors Jim and Tamara Graff and the people of
Faith Family Church for 30 years of faithful
ministry together sharing the love of Christ
with their community, our nation, and the
world.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF
JEFFREY JEWELL
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today with Congressmen MIKE THOMPSON,
JERRY MCNERNEY, JOHN GARAMENDI, and ERIC
SWALWELL to recognize the service of long-
time community advocate and veteran, Jeffrey
Jewell.
Jeffs commitment to service was apparent
throughout his life and career. Upon grad-
uating high school, Jeff enlisted in the Air
Force. While stationed in Japan, he taught
English to Japanese businessmen and volun-
teered for Big Brothers, Scouting Leadership,
and the Suicide Hotline. After his service, Jeff
earned his bachelor’s degree in human rela-
tions and Master’s in Public Administration
from Golden Gate University in San Francisco.
He also later received a Master’s in Psy-
chology from Chapman University.
Jeff applied his education and experience in
the armed services to aid veterans in the Bay
Area. In 1991, he started as a volunteer with
veteran organizations in Contra Costa and So-
lano Counties. Jeff was the past commander
in Vacaville of the Disabled American Vet-
erans, American Legion, United Veterans Me-
morial Association, and past chairman of the
Vacaville Veterans Building Association.
In 2001, Jeff began working for the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Concord Veterans
Center as a therapist for combat veterans and
for families that lost loved ones in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. Jeff also served on the Department
of Veterans Affairs National Homeless Vet-
erans Working Group and helped veterans
find housing and integrate back into society.
Jeff became the Director of the Sacramento
Veterans Center in March 2010 and returned
to the Concord Vet Center a few years later to
serve as Director.
Jeff has given so much back to veterans
across the country and in Contra Costa Coun-
ty—something our community is incredibly
grateful for. I join with Congressman MIKE
THOMPSON, JERRY MCNERNEY, JOHN

Jeff for his sacrifices for our nation and wish-

This historic church has been a cornerstone
of the Quaker Springs community for genera-
tions. While the exact date that the original
church was constructed is unknown, the incor-
poration of the Methodist Church in Quaker
Springs occurred in November of 1843. The
trustees of the church began constructing a
new church shortly thereafter, nearby the origi-
nal, on land purchased in 1842 for fifty dollars.
Even today, the great, great grandchildren of
some of the original congregation still worship
there regularly. The deeply historic and tightly
woven fabric of our communities is what
makes the North Country so unique and spe-
cial.
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional
District, I want to congratulate the trustees and
congregation of Quaker Springs Methodist
Church for reaching another historic milestone.
I wish them well and look forward to their con-
tinued success.

HONORING THE PASSING OF
PATRICIA GEIB
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
with a heavy heart to honor the life of Patricia
Geib of Palmyra, Pennsylvania who sadly
passed away this week after her third battle
with cancer.
Patricia was an incredible spirit whose life
touched countless others. She was a devoted
employee of the H.B. Reese Candy Co. for
many years and would keep working at the
Hotel Hershey even after her retirement. She
was a dedicated community member whose
spirit could never be broken. Patricia faced
three bouts with cancer with her characteristic
courage and optimism. She never stopped in-
spiring and caring for the people she loved.
Her life was filled with joy from family,
friends, and faith and she will surely be
missed by all who knew her. Patricia is sur-
vived by a loving family including her husband,
Daniel W. Geib of Palmyra; daughter, Danielle
Geib, brother, David Burke, stepsons, Andrew
(Amy) and Geoff Geib; her grandchildren,
Alyssa, Alexis, Aiden and Ashton Geib and
her nephew Michael Barley. I ask that the
House of Representatives, on behalf of the
citizens of Pennsylvania’s Ninth District, join
me and her family in remembering the life of
Patricia Geib.

HON. RICHARD E. NEAL
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to
take this opportunity to recognize Ms. Debbie
Jones as she ends her thirty-four-year term of
having served as a Financial Counselor with
the House Chief Administrative office. She
began her career in the House in May 1985,
and over the years has done a remarkable job
of ensuring the integrity of House payment
transactions. She proved herself to be a
strong and thoughtful leader for the Chief Ad-
ministrative office.
Debbie graduated from the University of
Massachusetts Amherst in 1979 and retires as
a Financial Counselor, where she was respon-
sible for reconciling and processing often com-
plex equipment and supply payments for
House offices. Debbie had a fine record of
public service as she previously served House
Clerk Benjamin Guthrie then transitioned to be
a Lead Vendor Management Counselor and
later Assistant Manager.
I would like to recognize Debbie for being
an invaluable asset to the CAO organization,
providing excellent customer service to House
offices. Her good work ethic, eye for detail,
and sense of humor have endeared her to
many colleagues and friends.
Once again, Madam Speaker, I am proud of
Debbie Jones and all she has accomplished
for Massachusetts and beyond. I wish her well
in all her future endeavors, following her suc-
cessful career with the Chief Administrative

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF MARK MORRIS
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and legacy of long-
time justice advocate and community leader,
Mark Morris, PhD.
After receiving his bachelor’s degree from
Oberlin College in 1964, Mark went on to re-
ceive his master’s and doctorate degrees from
the University of California, Berkeley in 1965
and 1972, respectively. Dr. Morris focused
much of his research and studies on the U.S.
justice system and social welfare.
In 1986, Mark founded Mark Morris Associ-
ates (MMA) with the goal of developing and
reforming the justice system. MMA created
projects and programs throughout California,
including projects here in the Bay Area and
Contra Costa County. These programs typi-
cally include analyses of offender populations,
corrections interventions, and justice/behav-
ioral health interactions.
Under Mark’s leadership, MMA has sup-
ported many people within Contra Costa
County. His efforts have brought probation of-
ficers into schools with system-involved youth,
built a volunteer mentorship network, and es-
tablished a treatment program based on a
partnership of various county agencies such
as Probation, Mental Health, and Education.
Dr. Morris was a dedicated advocate for so-
cial change and justice reform. Please join me
in honoring Dr. Mark Morris for a life of service
and his contributions to the Bay Area.

HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise
to celebrate the retirement of Augustus Burns
Elkins, II, an Administrative law Judge, who
retired on September 30, 2019, from the Of-
fice of Administrative Hearings after 35 years
of service to the State of North Carolina.
Judge Elkins received his Bachelor of Arts
from the University of North Carolina at Chap-
el Hill, where he was a member of Phi Beta
Kappa Society, and his Juris Doctorate from
Wake Forest University School of Law.
He is a certified Judge Advocate from the
Air Force Management and Leadership School
and served as an Assistant Staff Judge Advo-
cate in the United States Air Force from 1979
to l984. From 1984 to 2001, he served as a
Staff Judge Advocate with the United States
Air Force Reserves, having achieved the rank
of Lieutenant Colonel. The last 11 years of his
Air Force service was spent with the 916 Air
Refueling Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force
Base in Goldsboro, North Carolina.
For the State of North Carolina, he has held
the positions of Deputy Director of the North
Carolina Department of Administration—Motor
Fleet Management from 1984 to l990, and
General Counsel and Senior Managing Attor-
ney for North Carolina Governor’s Council for
Persons with Disabilities (GACPD) from 1990
to 2001. At GACPD, he was recognized as
one of the State’s leading experts on the
Americans with disabilities Act and the Individ-
uals with Disabilities Education Act.
In 2001, he was appointed as an Adminis-
trative Law Judge for the State of North Caro-
lina and had served in this capacity until his
retirement on September 30, 2019. He is a
member of the North Carolina Bar Association
and has served as Chairman of the Adminis-
trative Law Section. Judge Elkins was honored
with the 2018 Distinguished Service Award by
the North Carolina Department of Public In-
struction, Exceptional Children Division.

that my colleagues join me in congratulating
Judge Elkins on his retirement and wish him
many years of enjoyment with his family.

HONORING CALFIRE FIREFIGHTER
ANDREW MALONEY
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, October 1, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor CalFire Firefighter Andrew Maloney. Mr.
Maloney served the State of California during
his distinguished career with CalFire until he
was tragically killed by an intoxicated driver on
June 12, 2016. In remembrance of his service,
a section of State Route 165 in Los Banos is
being dedicated to him.
Mr. Maloney began his career in 2000 as a
paid call firefighter in Los Banos for the
Merced County Fire Department and in the
summer of 2001, worked as a firefighter for
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In 2003, he
started his career with CalFire, where he
worked with the Los Banos, Santa Nella, and
Hornitos Stations.
Throughout his life and career, Mr. Maloney
always sought to serve others and make peo-
ple smile. He participated in multiple efforts to
train and educate the public about fire safety
programs throughout Merced and Mariposa
Counties and worked tirelessly to serve which-
ever community he was assigned to. His col-
leagues noted that even when working in 115-
degree heat, he would always find a way to
make others smile.
In both his personal and professional life,
Mr. Maloney was a lover of the outdoors. He
hiked both the Pacific Crest and Appalachian
trails, loved animals, and was an avid scuba
diver. Mr. Maloney’s adventurous spirit is re-
membered by all who had the pleasure of
knowing and working with him.
On June 9, 2016, Mr. Maloney was riding
his motorcycle on State Route 165 when he
got into a collision with a driver who was dis-
tracted and under the influence. Three days
later, he lost his life due to the injuries he sus-
tained.
The loss of this longtime Los Banos resident
and local hero hit close to home with the
Merced County fire community. In honor of Mr.
Maloney’s lifetime of selfless service, the Cali-
fornia legislature has chosen to dedicate State
Route 165 between Berkeley Drive and Pio-
neer Road as the CalFire Firefighter Andrew
Maloney Memorial Highway. This will ensure
that his memory and lifetime of selfless serv-
ice will be remembered for future generations.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in honoring the life of CalFire Fire-
fighter Andrew Maloney. It is both fitting and
appropriate that we honor him as the CalFire
Firefighter Andrew Maloney Memorial Highway
is dedicated. I wish his family, friends, and all
Merced County first responders the best as
this section of State Route 165 is dedicated in
his honor.

Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-
er, I include in the RECORD a letter endorsing
H.R. 3106 from the Leadership Conference on
Civil and Human Rights.
THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
ON CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS,
Washington, DC, September 26, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of The
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human
Rights, a coalition of more than 200 national
organizations committed to promoting and
protecting the civil and human rights of all
persons in the United States, we urge you to
support the Domestic and International Ter-
rorism Act (DATA Act) (H.R.3106).
Congress should use its oversight and ap-
propriations power to demand that federal
agencies make public how it is using its re-
sources to fight white supremacist violence.
Congress must pass pertinent legislation like
the DATA Act to strengthen laws related to
hate violence in this country.The DATA Act
will provide Congress information about the
federal government’s approach to counter-
terrorism, including data on investigations
and prosecutions.
We support the DATA Act because it pro-
motes increased oversight of federal counter-
terrorism activities without creating en-
hanced authorities or resources like new of-
fices.
The most recent data from FBI docu-
mented that hate crimes against African
Americans, Latinos, the LGBTQ community,
Native Americans, Jews, and Muslims all in-
creased in 2017. Through the DATA Act, Con-
gress has devised ways to improve federal
and state responses to hate violence, includ-
ing how to address FBI Hate Crime Statis-
tics Act underreporting. The DATA Act
comes at a crucial time, when too many peo-
ple in this country feel unwelcome, unsafe,
and marginalized due to acts of terror. There
is little question that violence committed
against individuals because of their race, re-
ligion, ethnicity, national origin, gender,
gender identity, disability, or sexual orienta-
tion remains a serious problem in America.
The DATA Act will study these current
trends with the intention of combatting
hate.
The Leadership Conference applauds Chair-
man Thompson for placing this key legisla-
tion on the suspension calendar for a House
vote. The DATA Act will assist Congress in
its efforts to elevate the fight against white
supremacy and end a climate in which indi-
vidual perpetrators feel emboldened to act.

SECURE AND FAIR ENFORCEMENT
BANKING ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 25, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following letters of
endorsement for H.R. 1595, the SAFE Bank-
ing Act.
September 24, 2019.
DEAR CONGRESSMAN PERLMUTTER: We, the
undersigned U.S. trade associations, write to
express support for the passage of H.R. 1595,
the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, as amended,
on the House Floor. Collectively, we rep-
resent a majority of the companies, agents,
and brokers offering property-casualty, title,
and reinsurance (collectively, ‘‘insurers’’) in
the U.S. We appreciate your leadership in
seeking needed clarity for insurance trans-
actions related to cannabis that are other-
wise permissible under state law.
The insurance industry is potentially ex-
posed to liability arising from the dif-
ferences of the legal treatment of cannabis
and cannabis products under federal and
state law and regulation at the state level.
However, with the addition of key language
from H.R. 4074, Clarifying Law Around Insur-
ance Marijuana Act, sponsored by Represent-
ative Nydia Velázquez and Representative
Steve Stivers, H.R. 1595’s safe harbor provi-
sions would prevent federal criminal pros-
ecution of and civil liability for agents, bro-
kers, and insurers, their officers, directors or
employees when engaging in the business of
insurance in states that have legalized can-
nabis in some form.
By resolving the legal uncertainty pre-
sented by the dueling state and federal treat-
ment of cannabis, the insurance industry can
serve both cannabis-related legitimate busi-
nesses (CRLBs) and other commercial and
personal lines consumers who may have a di-
rect or indirect relationship to state-legal-
ized cannabis, and still be in compliance
with the law. Insurers must also continue to
satisfy all applicable state statutory or regu-
latory requirements, such as those per-
taining to consumer protections and claims
payments.
While the industry still needs additional
clarifications to fully resolve the challenges
presented by conflicting state and federal
cannabis laws, H.R. 1595 is a significant and
important step toward legal certainty for
our industry.
Again, we greatly appreciate your leader-
ship, and we look forward to continuing to
work with you and Congress to ensure our
industry is not caught between additional
conflicting obligations under federal and
state law.

THE COUNCIL OF INSURANCE
AGENTS & BROKERS,
September 23, 2019.
Re Support for the SAFE Banking Act.
Hon. ED PERLMUTTER,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CONGRESSMAN PERLMUTTER: On be-
half of The Council of Insurance Agents and
Brokers (‘‘The Council’’), I write to express
our strong support for the SAFE Banking
Act. This bipartisan legislation, we believe,
addresses long-standing obstacles to insurer
and broker participation in the cannabis
market. We urge Congress to pass this im-
portant legislation as soon as possible.
By way of background, The Council rep-
resents the largest and most successful em-
ployee benefits and property/casualty agen-
cies and brokerage firms. Council member
firms annually place more than $300 billion
in commercial insurance business in the
United States and abroad. Council members
conduct business in some 30,000 locations and
employ upwards of 350,000 people worldwide.
In addition, Council members specialize in a
wide range of insurance products and risk
management services for business, industry,
government, and the public.
The need for legal cannabis insurance
(spanning many lines of insurance and the
entire cannabis supply chain) is only grow-
ing and many insurance businesses, includ-
ing brokers, are anxious to enter the market.
The primary obstacle to their entry has been
and continues to be the threat of felonious
liability under federal law. The Council
therefore appreciates your efforts to address
federal-law barriers.
The SAFE Banking Act will protect per-
sons engaged in the business of insurance
who offer insurance products and services to
state-legalized cannabis businesses from li-
ability under federal law. The bill, as amend-
ed to include insurance businesses, recog-
nizes that insurance is as essential as bank-
ing—if not more so—to security, safety and
transparency in the cannabis industry. Lack
of insurance for the industry adds layers of
unnecessary risk and exposure for busi-
nesses, their employees, and their customers.
Again, we very much appreciate your lead-
ership on the SAFE Banking Act. We strong-
ly support the bill and look forward to its
passage as soon as possible.
Respectfully submitted,
KEN A. CRERAR,
President/CEO.

Re Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking
Act of 2019—SUPPORT.
Hon. ED PERLMUTTER,
Member, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE PERLMUTTER: On be-
half of the Rural County Representatives of
California (RCRC), I write to express our
support for your ‘‘Secure and Fair Enforce-
ment Banking Act of 2019,’’ (Safe Banking
Act) which would liberalize our federal bank-
ing laws to allow cannabis-related businesses
access to financial services. RCRC is an asso-
ciation of California’s rural counties, and the
RCRC Board of Directors is comprised of
elected supervisors from our thirty-six mem-
ber counties.
California has enacted laws allowing for
both medical-use and adult-use of cannabis.
In light of the actions of California and other
states, it has become apparent there is a
need to align federal and state laws when it
comes to accessing the banking system. Un-
fortunately, there is a significant barrier to
financial institutions who provide banking
services to state- and locally-licensed can-
nabis businesses as they are subject to crimi-
nal prosecution for ‘‘aiding and abetting’’ a
federal crime as well as money laundering.
Because current law restricts cannabis
businesses from accessing banking services,
businesses must operate in an ‘‘all cash’’
scheme, which poses a serious public safety
risk. In addition to the Controlled Sub-
stances Act, there are a variety of federal
banking laws (i.e. the Bank Secrecy Act)
which impact the ability of banks to accept
monies derived from activities involving
cannabis. In February 2014, the Obama Ad-
ministration issued guidance to financial in-
stitutions and the cannabis industry on how
the Department of Justice would enforce
banking laws related to cannabis. Despite

these guidance memos, most financial insti-
tutions refuse to bank cannabis activities
and suggest that Congress enact statutes to
liberalize the banking laws.
Access to banking remains one of the most
significant hurdles facing the cannabis in-
dustry and state and local regulatory au-
thorities. In essence, all cannabis-related fi-
nancial activities are conducted in cash
which translates into counties receiving
property tax payments in cash, as well as
any local regulatory fees and taxes. The cur-
rent all-cash business also makes it ex-
tremely difficult to audit cannabis opera-
tors, as well as ensure compliance with var-
ious rules and regulations. Most impor-
tantly, the all-cash status presents enor-
mous security challenges to all parties in-
volved in the cannabis industry.
For these reasons, we are pleased to sup-
port your SAFE Banking Act. If you should
have any questions, please contact me.

Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY,
Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Serv-
ices, House of Representatives, Washington,
DC.
DEAR CHAIR WATERS AND RANKING MEMBER
MCHENRY: On behalf of Brink’s Incorporated,
I wanted to share our strong support for H.R.
1595, the ‘‘Secure and Fair Enforcement
Banking Act of 2019.’’ We believe this legisla-
tion addresses much of the uncertainty in
the financial services sector about banking
and handling of funds sourced from state-
regulated cannabis businesses in those states
that have legalized cannabis, and helps move
toward safer and more secure transport of
the cash from those businesses and ulti-
mately the banking of those funds. We wish
to thank Representatives Perlmutter, Heck,
Stivers and Davidson for their leadership on
this issue.
As you may be aware, Brink’s is the
world’s largest cash management company
and the global leader in total cash manage-
ment, secure route-based logistics and pay-
ment solutions including cash-in-transit,
ATM services, cash management services
(including vault outsourcing, money proc-
essing and intelligent safe services), and
international transportation of valuables.
The company has a legacy of 160 years in the
business of safely and securely transporting
valuables and cash—getting them where they
need to be m the safest and most secure
manner possible. We are also a vital partner
to our customers like banks, helping with
the logistics of transporting and processing
cash.
Brink’s does not take a position in favor or
opposed to legalization of cannabis or mari-
juana. Like our bank customers, Brink’s
must also ensure that it follows federal laws
such as requirements on anti-money laun-
dering, and work with our customers subject
to federal bank charters and laws and related
statutes. These current ambiguity of these
federal laws creates a significant barrier to
safe handling of the cash generated by state-
sanctioned cannabis businesses, because
many banks believe they cannot accept
funds from cannabis-related businesses in
states that have legalized cannabis in some
form, and because there are barriers to safe-
ly processing and delivering these funds. The
public safety issue in states with legalized
cannabis businesses is immediately apparent
when thousands and even millions of dollars
in cash are being stored and transported
without adequate safeguards.
Brink’s knows well that storage and trans-
port of cash is a very serious issue, and safe-
ty and security are both paramount con-
cerns. If H.R. 1595 were enacted, we believe
the law would allow companies like Brink’s
to safely and securely transport cash to the
bank customers in states that have legalized
and regulated cannabis. It would ensure that
the funds are deposited, traced and any sus-
picious activity reported to authorities.
Thank you for considering these com-
ments, and for taking steps to address a safe-
ty and security issue in those states that
have chosen to legalize and regulate can-
nabis for medical or recreational purposes.
We look forward to working with the Com-
mittee on these issues and appreciate your
consideration of Brink’s view on this issue.
Sincerely,
MICHAEL F. BEECH,
Executive Vice President,

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADERS MCCAR-
THY, MCCONNELL, AND SCHUMER, CHAIRMAN
CRAPO AND RANKING MEMBER BROWN: On be-
half of the International Council of Shopping
Centers (ICSC), I express strong support for
H.R. 1595, the Secure and Fair Enforcement
(SAFE) Banking Act, which would allow can-
nabis-related businesses (including retail
tenants and their landlords) in states with
existing regulatory structures to access the
financial services system. The SAFE Bank-
ing Act’s protections for ancillary businesses
are critical for retail landlords considering
leasing space to tenants operating in compli-
ance with federal and state laws governing
the emerging legalized cannabis and
cannabidiol (CBD) market.
ICSC serves the global retail real estate in-
dustry. We provide our 70,000+ member net-
work in over 100 countries with invaluable
resources, connections and industry insights,
and actively work together to shape public
policy. ICSC does not have an official posi-
tion on the legalization, decriminalization,
or prosecution related to the use of cannabis
products or illicit drugs. Our support of H.R.
1595 reflects growth in the marketplace asso-
ciated with numerous states’ efforts to legal-
ize cannabis, both recreationally and medi-
cally, and the avoidable challenges associ-
ated with the unresolved liability to finan-
cial institutions and other ancillary busi-
nesses related to the broad authority of the
Controlled Substances Act.
A total of 34 states, District of Columbia,
Guam, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands
have sanctioned comprehensive, publicly
available medical marijuana/cannabis pro-
grams. Approved efforts in 12 states allow
use of ‘‘low THC, high cannabidiol (CBD)’’
products for medical reasons in limited situ-
ations or as a legal defense. Meanwhile, hun-
dreds of licensed and regulated businesses do
not have access to the banking or insurance
services and are unable to accept credit
cards, deposit revenues, or make use of bank
checks to pay rent, payroll, or taxes.
H.R. 1595 would prevent federal banking
regulators from punishing banks for working
with cannabis-related businesses that are
obeying state laws, taking legal action on
loans made to those businesses and related
businesses, or limiting a depository institu-
tion’s access to the Deposit Insurance Fund.
The bill would also require the Financial In-
stitution Examination Council to develop
guidance to help credit unions and banks un-
derstand how to lawfully serve cannabis
businesses. If enacted, banks would no longer
face the threat of federal sanction for work-
ing with cannabis-related businesses, includ-
ing tenants of retail real estate spaces.
Importantly, H.R. 1595 would also protect
ancillary businesses, such as commercial
landlords and brokers that lease space to
cannabis retailers, from being charged with
money laundering and other financial
crimes. Protections under Section 3 of the
bill specifically extend to landlords who may
rent or lease to cannabis-related businesses
operating within state law. While challenges
will remain, this legislation will address the
growing legal and financial liabilities for
those who accept these businesses as tenants
in retail real estate properties.
We look forward to working with you and
your colleagues on this narrowly-tailored
bill that balances public safety with the
needs of the emerging legalized cannabis
product market. We look forward to working
with you on this very important matter.

BETSY LAIRD,
Senior Vice President,
Global Public Policy.

Re Minority Business Leaders Call for Sup-
port of the SAFE Banking Act of 2019.
Majority Leader STENY HOYER,
Washington, DC.
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER HOYER: I am writ-
ing on behalf of the Minority Cannabis Busi-
ness Association (MCBA) in support of the
SAFE Banking Act of 2019 which provides a
critical first step towards developing an eq-
uitable federal cannabis framework. MCBA
represents more than 200 minority-owned
businesses, entrepreneurs and community
leaders from across the United States seek-
ing to create an equitable and responsible
cannabis industry. We are the only national
trade association dedicated to serving the
needs of the minority cannabis businesses
and communities disproportionately affected
by the lack of access to banking products
and services.
Minority-owned businesses make up less
than one-fifth of all cannabis businesses. The
lack of access to capital is cited as the pri-
mary reason for this disparity. Despite bene-
fiting from the aura of diversity surrounding
cannabis and the political will of people of
color, the industry is overwhelmingly white.
The generations long War on Drugs and
systemic economic suppression have made it
difficult for minority entrepreneurs to accu-
mulate and access the inter-generational
wealth that provides a significant portion of
the financing necessary to enter legal can-
nabis markets. The prohibitive cost of start-
ing a cannabis business, combined with the
lack of access to traditional small business
financial services, forces entrepreneurs to
partner with investors who tend to favor
high yield investments and majority-owner-
ship.
Some states and municipalities have cre-
ated equity programs aimed to facilitate in-
dustry participation by those most impacted

by the failed War on Drugs. Unfortunately,
these programs are undermined, if not ren-
dered moot, by the lack of access to capital.
Traditional funding sources are unavailable
to cover the extraordinary start-up costs in-
cluding license application fees commonly
exceeding tens of thousands of dollars and
some states require millions in cash escrow
or bond. This leaves state equity licensees
vulnerable to predatory lending and business
practices. Equity applicants and owners give
up the rights and benefits of ownership for
access to much needed funds and a chance at
success. The SAFE Banking Act addresses
how current banking laws codify the dis-
proportionately high cost of financing paid
by minorities and create inequitable barriers
to entry and success.
Furthermore, the large cash transactions,
necessary without access to banks, create
dangerous burdens for consumers, patients,
employees, business owners and their com-
munities. Patients and consumers must
carry cash for purchases. Employees and
business-owners both bear the risk of
transacting in, storing, and transporting
staggering sums of cash. Communities then
share the risk created by this cash economy.
These risks are amplified in communities
with higher crime rates, limited resources,
and inconsistent law enforcement. Com-
monly, these communities have higher con-
centrations of dispensaries. The number of
dispensaries places an undue burden on vul-
nerable communities and business owners
seeking to provide revenue, income, and in-
vestment in communities where it is most
needed.
MCBA asks you to join us in support of the
SAFE Banking Act which addresses the
unique business challenges of the cannabis
industry that disproportionately impact mi-
nority business-owners and our commu-
nities. In addition to providing access to cap-
ital, the SAFE Banking Act includes addi-
tional equity study and data requirements.
Federal regulators would be required to pro-
vide annual reports to Congress on the avail-
ability of access to financial services for mi-
nority-owned cannabis businesses and Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO) would
be required to carry out a study on the bar-
riers to marketplace entry for minority-
owned cannabis businesses. These provisions
would provide information to help build an
equitable legal cannabis framework.
MCBA urges swift action for the minority
entrepreneurs who cannot wait for banking,
as market-share is divided among the thirty-
percent of well-capitalized big cannabis busi-
nesses with access to non-traditional financ-
ing. As we work toward legalization and our
greater equity goals, we must ensure that
generational financial inequities do not con-
tinue to shape and color the face of the can-
nabis industry.
We welcome the opportunity to engage
with your office on these issues. Please feel
free to contact us for more information or if
we may be of any assistance on these mat-
ters.
Sincerely,
SHANITA PENNY,
President,
Minority Cannabis Business Association.
