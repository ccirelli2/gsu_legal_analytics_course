HONORING ELIJAH CUMMINGS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. HOYER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have the
sad task of announcing what probably
most of you already know. We have
lost a great American, a decent Amer-
ican, a wonderful Member of this body,
ELIJAH CUMMINGS, who died early this
morning of illnesses he had been suf-
fering from for a significant period of
time.
Members of the House, the people of
Maryland, and the people of the United
States of America woke up to this sad
and shocking news that we had lost
this dear friend, a devoted public serv-
ant, and a dedicated patriot, who re-
flected courtesy and respect for all.
At a time of confrontation, disagree-
ment, anger, and, yes, sometimes hate,
he was a beacon of civility, of fairness,
and of justice. He was chairman of the
Oversight and Reform Committee. He
passed away too early at 68 years of
age.
All of us who served with him knew
his passion for justice; his sharp intel-
lect, having graduated Phi Beta Kappa
from Howard University, where he was
president of the student government
association; his wit; and his devotion
to the cause of making government
work for the people.
It will be surely said of ELIJAH that
he worked hard until the very end. He
was on a telephone call with all of us
on Sunday talking about how we ought
to proceed with the heavy duties that
confronted him, his committee, and the
Congress.
He never wavered in his dedication to
the causes he made the hallmarks of
his career, even in recent days when, as
I said, his health was waning.
Those causes were equality and op-
portunity for all, the son of a share-
cropper who rose to be a great leader in
this country. He was concerned about
voting rights, civil rights, alleviating
poverty, establishing justice, and en-
suring that those entrusted with high
office are held accountable and carry
out their responsibilities lawfully and
ethically.
ELIJAH CUMMINGS was, of course, a
true son of Baltimore, a city of grit
and hope, a city of dreams and hard
work. He was loved in the city of Balti-
more. At a time of great distress in the
city of Baltimore, it was ELIJAH CUM-
MINGS in the streets bringing calm and
peace to that city.
His life will forever be an example to
all of us of striving to better one’s
community and one’s country, a pas-
sion and service to one’s fellow man
and woman, and a perseverance in the
face of adversity while in pursuit of
making this country and the world a
better place.
Whenever he believed we were falling
short of the vision of our Founders—
and many of you will hear this reso-
nate in your ears—he would say to all
of us in a loving way, as he said
throughout our State at a time of trou-
ble and difference: ‘‘We are better than
this.’’
As we see conflict, as we see people
disparaging one another, we want to
think to ourselves, ‘‘we are better than
this,’’ and think of ELIJAH CUMMINGS, a
man of great faith, of great humility,
of great humanity, and of great serv-
ice.
We will miss ELIJAH CUMMINGS. We
are a lesser place for losing him. Like
the prophet for whom he was named, he
was taken from us too young, too soon,
too suddenly. We can say, with Shake-
speare: He should have died hereafter.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomor-
row.
ELIJAH will not have those tomor-
rows, and we will not have them with
him. We will miss him dearly.
My thoughts are with his wife, Maya,
and his three children.
I offer my condolences to the people
of Maryland’s Seventh Congressional
District, who loved their Congressman.
They had confidence in their Congress-
man, and they knew that he was, in
fact, better, and they were better for
his service.
May God bless ELIJAH CUMMINGS, his
family, all of us, and this great coun-
try.

IMPEACHMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) for 5 min-
utes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8204 October 17, 2019
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.
Speaker, since I joined this body in
January, I have done my darnedest to
steer clear of the political circus that
we see on a daily basis in Washington.
Instead, I have worked with so many
Members to pass legislation preventing
child abuse and legislation that makes
it easier for Americans to save for
school and for their retirement. We
have made progress, and I have been a
key part of that progress in USMCA, in
welfare reform, and in implementing
the farm bill.
But, Mr. Speaker, the impeachment
proceedings going on in this Chamber
in the last few weeks have given me
pause, and they should give pause to
every Member of this Chamber and to
all American people.
I know—we all know—that some
Members are for impeachment and oth-
ers of us are opposed. But we should all
admit that, by its very nature, im-
peachment is emotional, it is taxing,
and it is divisive.
You are talking about removing our
President from office. This is no small
thing. This is changing the trajectory
of this country.
Given how contentious and given how
important that proceeding is, we have
an obligation to play by the rules and
to have a process that is open, that is
sound, and that is fair. Mr. Speaker, we
are failing at that special obligation.
First, the Speaker has launched im-
peachment without a vote by this
body, and that is unprecedented. Mem-
bers have been denied their authority,
their voice, their opportunity to be on
the RECORD in that matter.
Let us be clear: Under the Constitu-
tion, the authority to launch impeach-
ment rests with the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, not with the Speaker and
not with the chair of House intel-
ligence.
Second, this proceeding has not been
open and transparent. Instead, Mem-
bers have been denied access to witness
testimony and kicked out of commit-
tees. There is no live streaming and
there is no TV coverage as we have
seen in past impeachments. The result
is that Americans don’t have access to
important facts because they can’t get
them.
Finally, this proceeding has not been
fair. In the past, Presidents have had
an opportunity to have counsel
present. Counsel has had an oppor-
tunity to cross-examine witnesses, and
they have been given an opportunity to
review the evidence and to prepare a
defense instead of battling secondhand
accounts of closed-door testimony se-
lectively leaked to the media.
228 Members of this body have al-
ready announced that they are for im-
peachment even though the evidence is
not fully gathered yet, and, in any
case, they have not reviewed it. How is
that fair?
Mr. Speaker, elections matter; trans-
parency matters; due process matters;
and faith in this Constitution, in our
Constitution, and in institutions mat-
ter.
As I said, it is time that this body
lives up to its special obligation. Our
country deserves nothing less.

CHARLESTON C–17 CREW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) for 5
minutes.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the heroic actions
of Captain Forrest Lampela, Captain
Ken Dickenscheidt, Senior Airman
Chris Bowers, Airman First Class Tim-
othy Henn, and Technical Sergeant
Nick Scarmeas, who broke diplomatic
protocol and fought near-zero visibility
to save the life of a U.S. Navy sailor
who was wounded in combat.
The Joint Base Charleston crew was
flying a critically injured sailor to
Walter Reed from Ramstein Air Base in
Germany. Halfway through their mis-
sion, the sailor took a turn for the
worse and needed immediate surgery.
The commander, Captain Lampela,
made the decision to turn around and
make an emergency landing in Shan-
non, Ireland, in dense fog and without
diplomatic clearance.
In an incredibly stressful situation,
the team fell back on their training
and made a life-and-death decision that
ultimately saved the life of their fellow
servicemember. I am honored to com-
mend them.
f
WARREN COUNTY BICENTENNIAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
Warren County, Pennsylvania’s recent
bicentennial.
In March of 1819, the Pennsylvania
General Assembly approved legislation
to establish Warren County. On Octo-
ber 1, later that year, the legislation
became official, and Warren County be-
came a part of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
This occasion was celebrated earlier
this month at the Warren County
Courthouse, with local leaders and live
entertainment, including the Youngs-
ville High School band. In addition to
the remarks and performances, a time
capsule was buried on the grounds.
As an avid outdoorsman, I am proud
to call Warren County a part of my dis-
trict, particularly for its beautiful nat-
ural landscapes. Home to a portion of
the Allegheny National Forest, Warren
County has beautiful outdoor spaces
that rival much of the Commonwealth.
This bicentennial is an exciting occa-
sion, and I would like to congratulate
Warren County on this milestone. I
wish them continued success in the
next 200 years.

COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Connecticut (Mrs. HAYES) for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to commend the chairman of the
Committee on Education and Labor for
his steadfast leadership of the reau-
thorization of the Higher Education
Act, and introduction of the College
Affordability Act.
But I cannot do that without further
recognizing my colleague and my
friend, Chairman ELIJAH CUMMINGS,
whose family was from South Carolina,
Clarendon County, to be exact, which
is the home of the Briggs v. Elliott
case, one of the first cases challenging
school segregation. He understood the
power of a high-quality education, and
I know that he would be so incredibly
proud of this remarkable piece of legis-
lation that is being introduced this
week.
This is an achievement that reflects
the priorities of the entire Democratic
Caucus to expand opportunities and
make college affordable and accessible
for all students.
I am proud that this bill embraces
and reflects my priorities in Congress,
including the Pell Grant Restoration
Act, the Teacher Debt Relief Act, the
Teacher Diversity and Retention Act,
and the Jumpstart on College Act.
These bills would respectively pro-
tect student aid of vulnerable students
who have been defrauded; provide edu-
cators with much-needed student debt
relief so that they can stay in the
classroom; reinforce critical programs
that help develop a diverse educator
workforce; and provide a robust invest-
ment in dual-enrollment classes that
will lower the cost of a degree for stu-
dents who need it most.
This bill is a year’s-long effort to
level the playing field for every demo-
graphic of students across the country,
from veteran students, to working par-
ents; and from small family farmers, to
public servants. It is for students hop-
ing to become the first in their family
to go to college and afford it.
This bill is for families who struggle
to put enough in the bank for their
children’s education. This bill is for
students who struggle to fill out the
overly complicated FAFSA; who strug-
gle to earn degrees and keep the lights
on while working and raising children;
who utilize the Pell grant and other
Federal aid to make it through, and
still find themselves in debt.
My own journey reflects the chal-
lenges of navigating a system that sim-
ply is not built for everyone, of jump-
ing through untenable hurdles to com-
plete a degree. So it is deeply grati-
fying today to be part of the change
that I so desperately needed as a stu-
dent, to give a new, more diverse gen-
eration of students the supports they
need to succeed.
The College Affordability Act would
immediately lower the cost of college

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8205
October 17, 2019
for students and families across the
country by expanding Pell grants,
incentivizing free community colleges,
and driving States to substantially re-
invest in their public institutions.
The bill invests in teachers by fixing
a broken Public Service Loan Forgive-
ness program and TEACH Grant sys-
tem, and permanently funding histori-
cally Black colleges and universities
and minority-serving institutions, all
proven incubators of diverse educators.
The bill raises the quality of higher
education by holding accreditors and
schools accountable and weeding out
bad actors. The bill also improves the
completion rate for underserved com-
munities through more robust and
flexible student support.
This bill tackles the growing student
default crisis by making student loans
cheaper to take out, simpler to under-
stand, and easier to pay off.
With the passage of the College Af-
fordability Act, for-profit colleges will
no longer be able to look at students as
mere profit centers to swindle out of
their Pell or GI dollars.
The bill closes loopholes to prevent
veterans and low-income students from
predatory for-profit institutions and
creates more guardrails to ensure that
every student can have the peace of
mind that the degree they are invest-
ing in has value upon graduation.
That is all Americans want—the op-
portunity to get an education that
opens the doors to a life of achieve-
ment, fulfillment, and economic power,
and to be self-sufficient.
The College Affordability Act is a
downpayment on the success and finan-
cial stability of students in my district
and across the country. I am proud to
have contributed to it and I support it
here today.

HONORING RONALD K. GREENLEAF
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New York (Mr. KATKO) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Village of Hannibal
Mayor Ronald K. Greenleaf who was re-
cently named Veteran of the Year by
the Oswego County Veterans Service
Agency.
Ron Greenleaf has spent the vast ma-
jority of his life in public service, dem-
onstrating an unwavering commitment
to his country and community.
In 1967, he entered the United States
Navy, serving in Vietnam on the USS
Harnett County. An electrician by
trade, Mr. Greenleaf assisted with
maintenance, while contributing to the
ship’s overall mission of providing tac-
tical assistance to American and Viet-
namese forces. In recognition of his
service, Mr. Greenleaf was rec-
ommended to receive the Combat Ac-
tion Ribbon.
Following his deployment, Mr.
Greenleaf returned to central New
York to pursue a career as an elec-
trician, to raise a family, and to con-
tinue his service in the Navy Reserves.
Ron Greenleaf has been married to
his wife, Dawn, for 47 years, and to-
gether, they have two daughters. He is
known for his commitment to his fam-
ily, attending countless practices,
games, dance recitals, and plays of his
grandchildren.
Following his retirement, Mr. Green-
leaf ran for the Hannibal Village board,
a position he was elected to in 1994, and
served in for 10 years. He then ran for
the position of town supervisor where
he served seven terms. Leaving this po-
sition in 2017, Mr. Greenleaf went on to
be elected as the mayor of Hannibal, a
role he still holds today.
Of his many accomplishments as an
elected official, Mr. Greenleaf has most
notably worked to improve infrastruc-
ture and promote recreation in Han-
nibal. He has been praised as a driving
force behind the popular Hannibal
ramp park, a multiuse park for bikes,
skateboards, and Rollerblades.
Aside from his work in public service,
Mr. Greenleaf has found many other
ways to serve his community. As a
member of the VFW, Hannibal Amer-
ican Legion, and chairman of the 2013
Wounded Warrior Benefit, he has
worked to assist and support his fellow
veterans through adversity and hard-
ship. A deeply patriotic man, Mr.
Greenleaf has given several speeches at
Memorial Day and Veterans Day cere-
monies in and around Hannibal.
On several occasion, Mr. Greenleaf
donated his skills as an electrician to
assist with repairs for in-need neigh-
bors. Devoted to his faith, for many
years Mr. Greenleaf has been an active
participant in the Hannibal United
Methodist Church, serving as a trustee
and youth group leader.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in
the House to join me in honoring Ron-
ald K. Greenleaf. Serving in the mili-
tary, contributing as an elected offi-
cial, and volunteering in central New
York, Mr. Greenleaf has spent the ma-
jority of his life serving others.
Our Nation and community need
more people like Mr. Greenleaf, and we
are inspired by and thankful for his
commitment to public service.
HONORING THE LIFE OF ELIJAH CUMMINGS
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and passing of
my friend, ELIJAH CUMMINGS.
When I first came to Congress a few
terms ago, I teamed up with Mr. CUM-
MINGS to introduce a bill honoring the
life and legacy of Harriet Tubman.
When I approached Mr. CUMMINGS
about this bill, he didn’t ask me what
party I was in. He didn’t ask me what
my political philosophies were. He
didn’t care about partisanship. What he
cared about is the fact that we had a
common interest; that being, Harriet
Tubman.
I always appreciated that and in the
years that have passed since then, we
continued to cosponsor that bill and
continued to push it.
I am sad to hear of his passing, and I
offer my prayers to his wife and family,
and I pray that he is united with God
right now. And I think going forward,
we can all be happy and proud of the
legacy he set for us here in Congress.
f
SECOND CHANCES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to discuss second chances.
Across our Nation, one in three
adults have an arrest or conviction
that makes it difficult to find a job.
Take Kevin Miller, for example, who
was incarcerated for 8 months in 1992
after a minor altercation with police
officers.
Kevin was only 19 at the time, but
more than a quarter century later,
Kevin hasn’t been able to get a steady
job because he must disclose his arrest
on every job application.
Michael Mirsky faced similar hard-
ships. He lost his job as a Verizon tech-
nician in 2012 after he pled guilty to re-
sisting arrest during a disagreement
over child support payments. In the
years following the incident, he faced
foreclosure of his home, and even as
the economy improved and more and
more jobs became available, Mr.
Mirsky was unable to find a permanent
job and start rebuilding his life.
Mr. Speaker, stories like Kevin’s and
Michael’s are all too common. In fact,
more than 70 million Americans have
minor criminal records that they must
disclose on job applications. As a re-
sult, millions of Americans have been
turned down from countless jobs for
mistakes made decades ago.
The reluctance of employers to hire
people with criminal records, combined
with job applications that contain
check-the-box measures, has detri-
mental effects on the economy and pre-
vents millions of Americans from be-
coming productive members of society.
In addition, excluding people with
minor criminal records from the work-
force, often results in their return to
crime and to drugs.
That is why I am proud to cosponsor
the Fair Chance Act, which prohibits
the Federal Government and Federal
contractors from asking about a job
applicant’s prior criminal record before
a conditional offer of employment.
This process humanizes applicants and
gives them a chance to meet employers
face to face and explain their past be-
fore employers make a sweeping judg-
ment based on one checked box.
Mr. Speaker, America is a land of
second chances. Barriers to employ-
ment should not follow a person long
after they have served time, paid their
debt to society, and started a new life.
People deserve the freedom to redeem
themselves.
As my colleagues go to conference
over the NDAA, I urge them to include
this legislation as part of any final
deal.

HONORING SENATOR RICHARD
LUGAR
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
celebrate legislation the House passed
this week to name the post office in In-
dianapolis after the late Senator Rich-
ard Lugar.
Senator Lugar was a true statesman
who served his country and the State
of Indiana with pride. He will be re-
membered as one of America’s greatest
Senators, leaving his mark on domestic
and global affairs throughout his six
terms.
Senator Lugar was an essential part
of American diplomacy and strived for
peace throughout the globe. In 2013,
Lugar’s lasting contributions and dec-
ades of service to this great country
earned him the Presidential Medal of
Freedom.
Our Nation is stronger and safer be-
cause of Senator Lugar, and I thank
my colleagues for supporting legisla-
tion to honor his legacy.
POSITIVE IMPACT OF U.S.-JAPAN TRADE DEAL
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
highlight the positive impact the new
U.S.-Japan trade deal will have on our
Nation and on the Hoosier State.
Japan is an important ally of the
United States and a critical trading
partner that benefits the Hoosier econ-
omy. Japan is heavily invested in the
Hoosier State and in Indiana’s Sixth
Congressional District.
Of the 19 counties in the Sixth Dis-
trict, Japan is currently invested in 14
of them. This trade deal will help in-
crease those investments in our local
communities, creating opportunities
and jobs for many Hoosiers. In Con-
gress, we must build upon this success-
ful trade agreement President Trump
has struck with the American people.
We can and we must pass the
USMCA, which will increase opportuni-
ties for workers and farmers across
this country. I urge my colleagues to
continue to support these trade deals.
CONGRATULATING THE WINCHESTER NEWS-
GAZETTE ON SERVING HOOSIERS FOR 175 YEARS
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
congratulate the Winchester News-Ga-
zette on celebrating their 175th year as
a newspaper.
Previously called the Winchester Pa-
triot, Hoosiers in Randolph County
have relied on the News-Gazette for
local news since 1844.
Local press is essential to a thriving
community and is a prime example of
the First Amendment in action.
Congratulations to the Winchester
News-Gazette on serving Hoosiers for
175 years.
CONGRATULATING MUNCIE-DELAWARE CHAMBER
OF COMMERCE ON 125 YEARS
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Muncie-Delaware Cham-
ber of Commerce for celebrating their
125th anniversary.
The chamber has been an integral
part of the greater Muncie community
since 1894. Their strategy for engaging
large, medium, and small businesses
has been the driving factor behind the
thriving economy in the city of Muncie
and Delaware County.
Congratulations to the Muncie-Dela-
ware County Chamber of Commerce.
RECOGNIZING ROLLS-ROYCE
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize Rolls-Royce for the tremen-
dous work they are doing in my Hoo-
sier State. I recently visited both the
Rolls-Royce Indianapolis headquarters
and the Rolls-Royce LibertyWorks
plant, which produces more Rolls-
Royce products than anywhere else in
the world.
Rolls-Royce employs 4,000 Hoosiers,
and in recent years, invested hundreds
of millions of dollars to create world-
class engines and products that are on
the cutting edge of our national de-
fense.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rolls-
Royce for the great work they are
doing for Indiana and the United
States.

MOURNING THE DEATH OF THE
HONORABLE ELIJAH CUMMINGS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker,
there are many things that we come to
this floor to do. In the midst of our du-
ties, we stand in this well as armor and
advocates for democracy. There are
moments of joy, and there are mo-
ments of high debate, but I come this
morning partly for a moment of sad-
ness.
I am looking at my iPhone at a pic-
ture of myself and the late Congress-
man ELIJAH CUMMINGS so many years
ago. It tells the story of the breadth
and depth of his life, when he invited
Members of Congress to come to his
district to challenge the scourge of HIV
and to stand against the proliferation
of addiction.
He was always standing in the gap for
his constituents, his beloved Balti-
more, and his beloved family. He al-
ways considered himself as someone
who would find a cure for the ailments
of society.
That is why, this morning, we have
heard some of his words: ‘‘Come on,
people, we are better than this.’’
The wonderment of his words that
really came from his strong spiritual
connection—I want everybody to know
that he was able to say all of this and
remain that steady figure in the eye of
the storm because he was a man of
faith who had no shame in his love of
God and the teachings of his parents,
who he reminded us all the time, as
they rest in peace themselves, that
they were sharecroppers.
Look at him now. He ascended to
greatness. As chairman of the Over-
sight and Reform Committee, his focus
was not only on this recent impeach-
ment inquiry. He looked at all aspects
of wrongness that afflicted the Amer-
ican people, certainly one being the
overuse of prescription drugs causing
people to either lose their lives or not
be able to take care of themselves.
He was also a man of justice who
wanted criminal justice reform and
wanted to work to ensure that our po-
lice persons and law enforcement could
have the kind of training and under-
standing of culturally diverse commu-
nities.
He served us in many ways. He cer-
tainly was an icon amongst the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, but he was
not ours alone. He belonged to this
Congress—Republicans and Demo-
crats—and he belonged to the Nation.
But, Baltimore, I cannot leave you
out. He belonged to his beloved Balti-
more and also the heritage of his par-
ents.
I stand here today to give comfort to
those who are mourning, to try to ease
the pain that I am experiencing, and to
be able to call upon a Nation that has
the beauty of allowing us to pray to
any God that we worship in any faith
that we may have, that we call upon
that faith today to be reminded of a
giant like ELIJAH CUMMINGS.
I conclude with just a moment to say
that I pray for the families in Syria,
the fleeing Kurds. I pray that this un-
mistakable disaster that has occurred,
that we can put it right-side up with
the Congress working to secure a no-fly
zone and to have a cease-fire in north-
ern Syria to be able to stop the blood-
letting of women and children and the
fleeing that is going on.
As my good friend would want, we
want to fix government. In fixing gov-
ernment, we want to protect the Amer-
ican people. This threat to national se-
curity that has now been unleashed
with the escaping of ISIS supporters
and family members along with ISIS
persons, we must come together to find
a way to bring about peace.
In his name, I am grateful to have
this opportunity to honor him and to
also speak to peace. That is what I be-
lieve his life legacy will be, that he al-
ways wanted the best for America. He
would always say to all of us, no mat-
ter what walk of life we were in, what
background we came from, and what
diverse part of America we represented,
he would always say, ‘‘We are better
than this.’’
His faith in a higher power was with-
out question, and that will be the
strength that I have today, faith in a
higher power.
May God bless him. May he rest and
have a soul that is rested. May God
bless his family, may God bless all
those who loved him and his constitu-
ents, and may God bless the United
States of America.

Pastor Phil Waldrep, Phil Waldrep

the following prayer:
Our Eternal God, today, we pause to
thank You for Your blessings and to
ask that You remind us that with these
blessings come responsibilities.
So, we ask that You will quieten our
hearts that we might find time to lis-
ten to the dreams of a child or the
memories of an older adult.
Help us to find time to thank a
teacher, or a veteran, or someone who
puts their life at risk every day that
we might be free.
Help us to find time to assist the
families of military personnel and time
to pray for the safety of their loved
one.
Help us to find time to see the needs,
and the gifts, and the worth of others.
O Lord, help us to find time to be
Your hands and Your feet in a world
that desperately needs love.
In Jesus’ name, amen.

WELCOMING REVEREND PHIL
WALDREP
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. BROOKS) is recognized for 1
minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, it is a great privilege to welcome
Reverend Phil Waldrep to the House of
Representatives to serve as today’s
guest chaplain.
Reverend Waldrep was born in Mor-
gan County, Alabama, near Decatur,
and began preaching when he was 14
years old.
He earned his bachelor of science de-
gree from the University of Alabama
and completed seminary at Luther
Rice Theological Seminary in Georgia.
Through his ministries, Reverend
Waldrep connects with audiences of all
ages and sizes with his sense of humor,
powerful illustrations, and Scriptural
insight.
He is a frequent speaker at some of
America’s largest churches and con-
ferences and has been a vocational
evangelist since 1975.
Reverend Waldrep is also an author,
having published ‘‘Beyond Betrayal:
Overcome Past Hurts and Begin to
Trust Again,’’ ‘‘Reaching Your Prodi-
gal: What Did I Do Wrong? What Do I
Do Now?’’ and ‘‘The Grandparent Fac-
tor: Five Principles to Help You Make
a Difference in the Life of Your Grand-
child.’’
Phil and his wife, Debbie, live in De-
catur, Alabama, and have two daugh-
ters who, with their husbands, actively
serve in the ministry.

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of individuals across New
Hampshire and the country who are
struggling to afford the skyrocketing
cost of prescription drugs.
Across my district, I hear from indi-
viduals each and every day about the
significant burden and anxiety caused
by the exorbitant costs of these pre-
scriptions. That is why I introduced
H.R. 4661, the Advancing Enrollment
and Reducing Drug Costs Act, along
with Representative TONKO.
This is an important addition to H.R.
3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of
2019, to expand seniors’ access to pre-
scription drugs under Medicare part D.
This legislation will automatically en-
roll individuals in part D’s subsidy pro-
gram, known as Extra Help, when they
have aged out of Medicaid Expansion.
We must continue to ensure that sen-
iors receive access to this earned ben-
efit without having to navigate what
can be a complicated process.
When seniors arrive at the pharmacy
counter, they shouldn’t have to worry
whether they can afford the medica-
tions they need to live with health and
with dignity. This legislation is a step
toward addressing this injustice, and I
urge my colleagues to continue to sup-
port efforts to reduce the cost of pre-
scription drugs in a bipartisan fashion
and pass this legislation.
f
NATIONAL FARM TO SCHOOL
MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
October as National Farm to School
Month.
The National Farm to School Net-
work is an organization that strives to
strengthen the relationship our Na-
tion’s schools have with fresh, healthy
foods from local farms.
The farm to school movement focuses
on agriculture education in our schools
and even encourages learning opportu-
nities through school gardens, cooking
lessons, and farm field trips to better
connect students with where their food
comes from. It also spurs market op-
portunities for local farmers and
ranchers.
Healthy and nutritious food is impor-
tant in all stages of life, but particu-
larly for our Nation’s young people. In
some unfortunate cases, the meals that
students receive at school may be the
only time they eat during the day. It is
important that we do what we can to
ensure schools have the resources they
need to provide students with delicious
and nutritious options.
f
LOWERING DRUG COSTS
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I
rise to say this: Americans are suf-
fering from extortionate, skyrocketing
drug prices, and this is unacceptable.
Between 2013 and 2016, 67 percent of
Americans who had to file for bank-
ruptcy did so because of enormous
medical expenses. That is unaccept-
able.
Last year, in my home State of Penn-
sylvania alone, one in four individuals
had to forgo medical care so they could
pay their rent or put food on the table.
That is not a choice we can, in good
conscience, allow them to have to
make. It is unacceptable.
I am, therefore, proud to announce
my support of the Lower Drug Costs
Now Act, H.R. 3, landmark legislation
which takes bold strides to lower pre-
scription drug prices for all Americans.
On behalf of the families who demand
and deserve drug pricing reform, I urge
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle
to ensure swift passage of this land-
mark, critical legislation.

HONORING THE LIFE OF WYMAN
COPASS
(Mr. COMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to pay tribute to the remarkable
life led by my friend and former pastor,
Dr. Wyman Copass.
Wyman passed away on Friday, Octo-
ber 4, having lived an extraordinary
life of 80 years. Wyman will live on in
the memories of all who have had the
privilege to know him.
For me, his influence lives on in the
memory of his role in my salvation. As
a graduate of Campbellsville Univer-
sity and Luther Rice Seminary, Dr.
Copass oversaw a ministry spanning
not only the Commonwealth of Ken-
tucky, but also the breadth of the Na-
tion.
While he enjoyed golfing, cooking,
and gardening, his greatest passion was
his family, whose love and devotion he
cherished and returned in kind. His
wife of 62 years, Glenda; his daughter,
Susan; and his son, Chris; as well as his
five grandchildren undoubtedly con-
sider themselves lucky to have had
such an emblematic figure in their
lives, just as I do.
Dr. Wyman Copass was a force for
good in the First Congressional Dis-
trict of Kentucky, and his example and
vision will be missed.

MEASURING REAL INCOME
GROWTH
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute
and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, for years, our coun-
try’s prosperity was broadly shared.
The difference between rich and poor
wasn’t too big. When the economy
grew, most Americans benefited. The
saying was that ‘‘a rising tide lifts all
boats.’’
But today, income inequality is at its
highest level in nearly a century. The
top 1 percent take home about 20 per-
cent of all income.
But this story is not being told by
economic indicators like GDP. GDP
tells us how fast or slow our economy
is growing, but not how that growth is
spread across income levels.
I am working to change that. The
Joint Economic Committee, where I
serve as vice chair, held a hearing this
week to examine proposed measures to
track inequality. These new measures
are included in my legislation, the
Measuring Real Income Growth Act.
Under my bill, GDP growth will be
analyzed by income level. It will tell us
who the economy is working for and
who is left behind, and it will help us
craft policies to start reducing inequal-
ity so a rising tide really does lift all
boats.
REMEMBERING WES BARR
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, this is a tough one today. I
rise to remember Sheriff Wes Barr, who
passed away on October 1. Wes was a
beloved member of the Springfield
community, who impacted many
through his law enforcement career
and charity work.
Wes’ story is one of true American
spirit. He lived in the former John Jay
housing project in Springfield until he
was 13. After graduating from South-
east High School, Wes enlisted in the
United States Marine Corps.
Afterwards, he served as a correc-
tional officer before he began his ca-
reer in law enforcement. He served as
an officer in Loami, Illiopolis, and
Chatham before joining the Sangamon
County Sheriff’s Office in 1991, eventu-
ally serving his one term, where I got
to serve with him, as sheriff from 2014
to 2018.
Wes and his wife, Sherry, are well
known for their generous hearts and
extensive charity work with several or-
ganizations. For years, and where I
first met Wes, Wes led the local Toys
for Tots drive, collecting thousands of
toys for children in need.
In every aspect of his life, Wes put
others before himself. He lived to serve
others and, for so many, he was a role
model and a mentor. Wes had a com-
passion for people and a determination
to give back to his community. Words
cannot describe how much he will be
missed.
The thoughts and prayers of Shannon
and me are with the entire central Illi-
nois community and especially his
wife, Sherry, during this difficult time.

HONORING ED DIAZ
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
honor a great American, World War II
veteran Seaman First Class Ed Diaz.
Mr. Diaz, a native of New York, en-
listed in the Navy in 1944 and was sub-
sequently assigned to the USS Colum-
bus heavy cruiser. During World War II,
he served in the South Pacific and par-
ticipated in Operation Road’s End, a
campaign in which 24 Japanese sub-
marines were sunk and which led to
the final destruction of Japan’s sub-
marine fleet.
Mr. Diaz was discharged after the
war but continued to serve in the
Naval Reserve for another decade. He
later worked as a machinist in Penn-
sylvania until a promotion relocated
him to the heart of Florida District 15.
In total, he served with Hazleton
Pumps for 42 years.
Like many from the Greatest Gen-
eration, Seaman First Class Ed Diaz
humbly and sacrificially served this
country in one of its darkest hours. He
looked evil in the eye and stood up to
it in the name of democracy and free-
dom.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Diaz for his
service and his dedication. He showed
us how to live and gave our State and
Nation a better future. Today I salute
him.

RECOGNIZING 13 PLANO ISD
PARENT TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-

Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate 13 Plano ISD
schools on receiving the National PTA
School of Excellence designation. This
recognition program, accredited by the
National Parent Teacher Association,
works to support and celebrate the
partnership between PTAs and schools
across this great land.
Plano ISD is setting an incredible ex-
ample with a current PTA membership
of more than 16,000 parents. With the
help of their PTAs, Plano ISD is culti-
vating crucial relationships between
parents, teachers, and the surrounding
community. Their dedication to im-
proving the learning environment for
students in and outside the classroom
serves as a crucial reminder of the vol-
unteerism and its role in shaping a
community.
I ask my colleagues to join me in
congratulating these 13 Plano PTAs on
their success of putting students first
and championing a quality education.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to shed light on
House Democrats’ impeachment in-
quiry, a scheme that has been devised
in the dark.
From day one of this Congress, my
colleagues have sought to use their
new majority to undermine President
Trump every step of the way. The ma-
jority has chosen to break precedent
and deprive Republicans of the ability
to do our job.
Today, I went down to the SCIF to
read the classified Volker testimony
for myself, and, sadly, I was turned
away. It is remarkable that elected of-
ficials have been blocked from reading
material, parts of which have already
been leaked to the press in selective
and incomplete pieces. Simply, this is
wrong.
The House of Representatives has
been reduced to obsessing over a per-
petual Ground Hog Day cycle of reliti-
gating the 2016 election.
For the sake of our Nation, it is time
to remove what the obstacles we face

GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks on H.R. 1815, and to
insert extraneous material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

request of the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 629 and rule
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in

ation of the bill, H.R. 1815.
The Chair appoints the gentleman

Whole.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 1815) to
require the Securities and Exchange
Commission, when developing rules and
regulations about disclosures to retail
investors, to conduct investor testing,
including a survey and interviews of re-
tail investors, and for other purposes,
with Mr. LANGEVIN in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall be confined to
the bill and amendments specified in
the first section of House Resolution
629 and shall not exceed 1 hour equally
divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Financial Services.
The gentlewoman from California
(Ms. WATERS) and the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA) each will con-
trol 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of
H.R. 1815, the SEC Disclosure Effective-
ness Testing Act crafted by Represent-
ative CASTEN from Illinois, a new Mem-
ber of Congress and member of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee.
H.R. 1815 requires the Securities and
Exchange Commission to test its dis-
closure documents with retail inves-
tors through one-on-one interviews and
surveys to ensure that these docu-
ments are actually understood by their
target audience.
The SEC’s approach to protecting re-
tail investors from conflicts of interest
and other risks has been based on in-
forming them through disclosure. This
is a problem when those disclosures are
written in a way that retail investors
don’t understand.
Since at least 2012, when the SEC
conducted a financial literacy study,
we have known that many of the dis-
closures intended for retail investors
are not well-understood by those inves-
tors.
While the public has the opportunity
to comment on most rulemakings or
new disclosures, these comments are
largely from well-funded industry rep-
resentatives, rather than the mom-and-
pop investors who will be receiving
these new disclosures.
H.R. 1815 ensures that the SEC gets
the input it needs from retail investors
on disclosure forms by requiring the
SEC to test those forms and engage in
qualitative one-on-one interviews and
nationwide surveys.
Investor testing has been embraced
by both Democratic and Republican
commissioners at the SEC. In addition,
the SEC itself has been engaged in in-
vestor testing in several instances, in-
cluding most recently in 2018, when it
tested a proposed disclosure for brokers
and investment advisers to provide to
retail investors known as Form Client
Relationship Summary, that is, CRS.
This proposed five-page disclosure
was intended to help retail investors
understand the obligations owed and
services provided by investment profes-
sionals, as well as the fees and costs
that could affect their investment ac-
counts.
To ensure that retail investors are
able to use Form CRS as intended, the
SEC conducted a nationwide online
survey of 1,800 individuals and 31 quali-
tative, in-depth interviews in Denver
and Pittsburgh. The mixed results of
the SEC’s testing of Form CRS showed
that changes and possibly more testing
were necessary.
Unfortunately, in that instance, the
SEC did not engage in the robust,
iterative investor testing that H.R.
1815 would require, and finalized a
vague disclosure.
H.R. 1815 would require the SEC to go
back and review and test existing dis-
closures like Form CRS and determine
whether changes should be made. This
review of existing documents is par-
ticularly important as the capital mar-
kets, investor behaviors, and investing
trends change.
In addition to the SEC, other regu-
lators like the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and the Federal
Trade Commission also engage in
usability testing of their disclosures.
H.R. 1815 builds on the efforts of the
SEC by requiring the Commission to
engage in a similar iterative process
for all existing or future disclosure, in-
tended to help retail investors make
informed investment decisions.
I thank Representative CASTEN for
putting forth this commonsense piece
of legislation that will help investors
make better informed financial deci-
sions regarding their hard-earned earn-
ings.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
b 1230
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R.
1815, the SEC Disclosure Effectiveness
Testing Act of 2019.
Mr. Chair, Democrats claim that this
bill would ‘‘build on efforts to engage
in investor testing by requiring the
SEC to conduct usability testing of any
new disclosure.’’
If my friends on the other side really
wanted to build on efforts to engage in
investor testing, I believe they would
have worked with Republicans on the
committee and the Securities and Ex-
change Commission to craft a bill that
would actually be signed into law. Un-
fortunately, this bill is a deliberate ef-
fort to not only delay the SEC’s rule-
making on Regulation Best Interest
and Form CRS, but it is also an effort
to tie the SEC’s hands with regard to
future disclosure rulemakings and may
have an effect even on past
rulemakings.
In fact, what the bill’s author won’t
tell you is that the SEC already con-
ducted investor testing on the very dis-
closure regulation Democrats are tar-
geting with this particular bill. With
Reg BI, 1,800 Main Street investors na-
tionwide were surveyed about the regu-
lation. There were 31 one-on-one, in-
depth interviews with retail investors.
Seven roundtables were held that the
SEC gained input from. Finally, more
than 6,000 comment letters were re-
ceived by the SEC before they actually
put together the Reg BI.
The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission collected all this, analyzed the
information from all of those sources,
and very carefully crafted what had
been very contentious and, frankly,
outside the bounds of what had nor-
mally been accepted with Regulation
Best Interest by having the Depart-
ment of Labor try to drive this rather
than the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission. I believe that they have a
good product.
The SEC used this information to
adopt a workable regulation all with-
out the help—or the so-called help—of
H.R. 1815. So what does the final rule-
making package on Reg BI and Form
CRS accomplish?
It raises the standard of care owed by
broker-dealers to retail investors, and
that, at the end of the day, is what this
is all about. It is a standard that we
agree needed to be addressed.
But why make the SEC do it again
and further delay a rulemaking that
makes significant improvements for
Main Street investors? It is a rule that
is in place. I can only surmise it is be-
cause my friends on the other side
didn’t like the outcome and didn’t like
what they heard in that investor test-
ing.
Not only did they not like the cur-
rent outcome for Reg BI and Form
CRS, but my friends on the other side
of the aisle want to tie the SEC’s hands
in future disclosure rulemaking. They
accomplish this by requiring investor

testing for documents and information
that are relied on or ‘‘substantially
likely to be materially relied upon by
retail investors.’’
Now, I don’t know what that phrase
means. Here is why I don’t know what
that phrase means: It is because it
wasn’t in the version of the bill re-
ported out of the committee. That is a
phrase thrown in at the last minute by
my friends on the other side of the
aisle.
If that weren’t enough, the bill tar-
gets the SEC’s previous disclosure rule-
making. H.R. 1815 requires the SEC to
retroactively conduct investor testing
on similar disclosure rulemakings that
were finalized before enactment of this
bill. This means disclosure rules final-
ized 5, 10, 15, maybe even 20 years ago
could be captured and will be captured
by this bill.
Finally, if subjecting past and future
disclosure rulemakings to investor
testing weren’t enough, the bill cap-
tures present rulemaking. H.R. 1815
creates a bureaucratic loop by requir-
ing the SEC to conduct investor test-
ing if substantive changes are made to
a proposed rulemaking, and those
changes are untested before the rules
are finalized.
What does this bill mean for every-
day investors? It means more bureauc-
racy. It means less certainty. Cer-
tainly, it does not speed up what all
agree is an issue that needs to be ad-
dressed. There is no doubt that inves-
tor testing is an effective tool for de-
signing smart, workable regulatory
frameworks to benefit the Main Street
investor. It can help craft disclosures
and information that everyday inves-
tors can actually understand and use.
It does not have to come in the form of
a mandate.
This bill is not only a delay tactic,
but it will drastically undermine the
ability of the SEC to do its primary job
of protecting investors.
Under the last administration, that
is all we heard about on the com-
mittee. I have been on the sub-
committee that handles this, and all
we heard was how Congress was under-
cutting the Securities and Exchange
Commission, that it wasn’t supporting
it enough and wasn’t allowing it to do
its job.
What are my friends now doing? The
exact thing that they were com-
plaining about.
By delaying it or in some cases pre-
venting the SEC from finalizing rules
intended to protect investors and di-
verting resources from cybersecurity
and enforcement actions, Main Street
investors that this bill claims to serve
will only be harmed.
I am confident the SEC can and will
devote the utmost attention and con-
sideration to help everyday American
investors without this particular bill.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. CASTEN), who will correct all the
misstatements that were just made by
the gentleman from Michigan. Rep-
resentative CASTEN is the sponsor of
the bill.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I
rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1815, the
SEC Disclosure Effectiveness Testing
Act. I thank Chairwoman WATERS and
Subcommittee Chair MALONEY for their
leadership on the Financial Services
Committee and their unwavering dedi-
cation to protecting investors.
That is exactly what this bill does. It
is a pro-investor bill that has one goal:
that the SEC ensures disclosures made
to retail investors are clear and concise
so that Americans can make informed
investment decisions.
We are not here to relitigate the
proper duty that brokers owe to inves-
tors. Instead, this bill is about making
sure that disclosure documents convey
information to investors effectively.
We would never let companies post
warning labels in ancient Greek, yet
we too often allow disclosure docu-
ments—say, for conflicts of interest—
to be written in jargon that is unintel-
ligible to anyone without a law degree.
Merely providing information to inves-
tors is not enough. We have also to
make sure that information is under-
stood.
Whether it is buying a house, sending
your kids to college, investing in your
retirement, or just saving for a rainy
day, the American Dream depends on
our ability to invest in our future. This
bill protects Americans by doing pretty
basic market research to ensure that
legally required disclosures can be un-
derstood by the average investor. Dis-
closures are already legally mandated
to disclose information about fees,
comparisons of investment advisory
services, conflicts of interest, and
much more, but just because those
forms are provided to investors doesn’t
mean that investors understand them.
As we all know, the biggest lie on the
internet is that ‘‘I have read and un-
derstand the terms and conditions.’’ So
we should not assume that just because
an investor has been provided a disclo-
sure agreement means that they under-
stand it.
Now, in point of fact, the RAND Cor-
poration—this was what my colleague
referred to—conducted this investor
testing—we agree—with 1,800 individ-
uals, 31 qualitative, in-depth inter-
views. This is what they concluded:
‘‘Nearly 90 percent of respondents
opined that the relationship summary
would help them make more informed
decisions about investment accounts
and services . . . but interview discus-
sions revealed that there were areas of
confusion for participants, including
differences between types of accounts
or financial professionals.’’
There were no changes made after
that. Yes, they did the surveys, but
many did not know and still do not
know the difference between account
types or financial professions. Others
didn’t appear to have synthesized the
information in ways that they could
apply it.
In other words, consumers want these
disclosures. Qualitative testing shows
that what they are getting is not in-
forming them properly, and that is why
this bill is so important.
The SEC Disclosure Effectiveness
Testing Act would build on SEC’s in-
vestor testing efforts and require the
agency to engage in a robust iterative
process for any existing or future dis-
closures intended to help retail inves-
tors make investment decisions.
Specifically, the bill anticipates that
the SEC will test those documents used
by retail investors when selecting an
investment professional to work with,
assessing an investment recommenda-
tion, or deciding to purchase or sell a
security. This would include testing of,
for example, brokers’ trade confirma-
tion statements and investment advis-
ers’ brochures that detail business
practices, fees, conflicts of interest,
and disciplinary information.
In short, if we are going to rely on
disclosures, we need to make sure the
disclosures work.
We use market research to convey
simple and important messages. Take
an example: We don’t put warnings on
a box of cigarettes that says that in
multiple peer-reviewed papers, sci-
entists have found that prolonged expo-
sure to cigarette smoke increases your
risk to certain types of cancers, and
those results are less than 5 percent
likely to have been the result of sam-
pling error.
Nobody would understand that. We
say, ‘‘Smoking kills,’’ because our job
is to communicate. We would be delin-
quent if we weren’t equally clear in
this case.
We are talking about disclosures like
Form CRS that would require financial
professionals to deliver to their retail
customers a short and simple disclo-
sure form to clarify the scope of their
customers’ relationship and companies
who offer them financial services.
A consumer disclosure has to do
more than just protect the discloser. If
an investor doesn’t understand what is
being disclosed, then we cannot say
that anything was truly disclosed. We
must make sure that investors know
what is being disclosed, and that is
what the bill does.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield the
gentleman an additional 1 minute.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. This isn’t a
mandate on high to dictate to the SEC
what the disclosures should say but
rather says that it must do qualitative
interviews to confirm that investors
understand the disclosure. That is why
the AARP has endorsed the bill, as well
as the Financial Planning Coalition,
the Consumer Federation of America,
and the Certified Financial Planner
Board of Standards.
This is a narrowly tailored bill that
applies to a number of disclosure state-
ments that Main Street retail inves-
tors rely on. It does not apply to dis-
closures that are relied on primarily by
sophisticated institutional investors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8211
October 17, 2019
When I was growing up, there was an
ad on television for a discount
menswear store called Syms. At the
end of every commercial, their presi-
dent, Sy Syms, would say, ‘‘An edu-
cated consumer is our best customer.’’
We owe nothing less to the American
people, and I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana
(Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH), who is the vice
ranking member of the subcommittee.
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Chair, I
rise in opposition to the bill being dis-
cussed today. While I appreciate my
good friend Mr. CASTEN’s effort on the
bill, the problem is in the details.
While he clearly stated that this is a
narrowly tailored bill, the reality is
that a casual counting of SEC-promul-
gated rules yields over 600 rules that
this would apply to. At 6 months of
testing each, that is over 300 years’
worth of testing—300 years. Our Repub-
lic hasn’t been in existence for 300
years.
What I hear from Hoosiers back home
is they are tired of our regulators being
distracted and going back and looking
at the history, and what they want to
be focused on is how they protect in-
vestors going forward.
As Mr. CASTEN and I have discussed
before, I think we share those laudable
aims about ensuring that disclosures
truly convey the information we want
them to convey, but this bill doesn’t do
that.
This bill distracts the SEC from the
necessary work on regulating our mar-
kets and protecting our investors by
going back and doing hundreds of in-
vestor tests on over 600 different SEC-
promulgated rules. Because of that, I
will oppose the bill.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from New
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY), who
is the chairwoman for the Sub-
committee on Investor Protection, En-
trepreneurship, and Capital Markets.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Chair, I thank the chair-
woman for yielding and for her leader-
ship on the committee.
Mr. Chair, I strongly support H.R.
1815, which is just plain common sense,
and I congratulate my colleague and
friend for his leadership and hard work
on this bill.
We want investors to understand the
disclosures that companies, brokers,
and advisers are required to give them.
What would be the point of requiring
disclosures that the vast majority of
investors don’t even understand? If
they don’t understand the disclosures—
or worse, if they haven’t even read the
disclosures—then they are not making
their investment decisions with all the
information that they need.
The best way to ensure that investors
understand the disclosures is actually
to engage in investor testing of pro-
posed disclosure forms.
b 1245
Disclosures that a sophisticated in-
stitutional investor might understand
or that the experts on the SEC staff
might understand might not be clear
and understandable to the average re-
tail investor.
This isn’t surprising. The SEC staff
who designed these disclosures are
typically lawyers and not disclosure
design experts. That is why it is impor-
tant to require the SEC to engage in
investor testing of these disclosures.
That way, they don’t end up requiring
a disclosure that simply does not work.
Quite frankly, I don’t understand
why anyone would oppose this bill, be-
cause that would be the equivalent of
saying that you don’t want investors to
understand the disclosures. And if you
think the SEC has the authority to do
investor testing, then why would you
oppose simply codifying that author-
ity? Other agencies have done effective
usability testing for disclosures.
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield an
additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from New York.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. The Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau, under Director Cordray,
engaged in extensive consumer testing
of new disclosure forms that it was pro-
posing for prepaid cards. It came up
with two different proposed disclosure
forms and then field-tested the two
forms for months before finalizing the
prepaid card rule. That is the kind of
data-driven regulation that helps con-
sumers, investors, and, ultimately, all
market participants because it im-
proves trust in the entire financial
markets.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER), who has
had extensive history and experience
with this particular issue at the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
HUIZENGA) for yielding his time. He has
been a terrific leader on capital mar-
kets and has been serving in his capac-
ity as we try and work hard for that
low- and middle-income investor, that
Main Street investor who is so impor-
tant that we finally get some regula-
tion and some guidance in place that is
going to make sure that they are get-
ting the information that is going to
help them make good investment and
savings decisions that are truly in the
best interest of that consumer. The
gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
HUIZENGA), the ranking member of the
Subcommittee on Investor Protection,
Entrepreneurship, and Capital Mar-
kets, is absolutely right.
Since my very first year in Congress
7 years ago, I have been fighting for
that Main Street investor. I have been
fighting to make sure that the best in-
terest of that investor is in place.
This is not about Wall Street; it is
about Main Street. It is about taking
care of the low- and middle-income
consumer. And the SEC has been deal-
ing with this fiduciary rule and with
the best interest standard for years and
years and years.
Mr. Chairman, we have studied it. We
have had countless comment periods. It
has been litigated. The investor testing
has been done. Years and years have
gone into this moment where the SEC
is finally ready and has, in fact, moved
forward with the best interest stand-
ard.
The difficulty with this piece of leg-
islation, H.R. 1815, is it is, frankly, just
a political ploy, Mr. Chairman, a polit-
ical ploy that is an attempt to stop the
rule in its tracks, one that is going to
take care of those that need the kind of
support from their broker-dealer the
most.
It is important that we finally have
this issue back in the jurisdiction of
the SEC where it belongs. It is time
that this rule move forward and that
we look out—all of us—for the best in-
terest of our retail investors. Let’s let
this go forward and stop the political
ploys.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. FOSTER).
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
WATERS), the chairwoman, for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R.
1815, which would simply require the
SEC to conduct investor testing when
developing rules and regulations about
disclosures to retail investors.
Creating effective disclosures is often
a difficult task and requires develop-
mental testing with consumers. It is a
complex and technical task in its na-
ture. These disclosures are meant to be
clear and concise so that retail inves-
tors understand the scope of their rela-
tionships with brokers and investment
advisers and important decisions re-
garding their investments.
The SEC has had evidence since at
least 2012, when it conducted a finan-
cial literacy study, that many of the
disclosure documents that we cur-
rently rely on are not well understood
by those investors. This includes cost
disclosures that don’t clearly convey
costs, risk disclosures that don’t clear-
ly convey risks, and conflict disclo-
sures that do not clearly convey the
nature and the impact of these con-
flicts.
Effective disclosure testing is imper-
ative for facilitating informed deci-
sionmaking on the part of consumers
who are trying to save and invest their
hard-earned money, and that is why
the AARP and many other groups have
endorsed H.R. 1815.
By requiring qualitative testing in
the form of one-on-one cognitive inter-
views of investors, it provides a deeper
look into how typical retail investors
synthesize information. If investors un-
derstand key differences in firms’ con-
flicts, obligations, and revenue
streams, then more retail investors
will receive and interpret correctly the
professional guidance that is right for
them.

The framework laid out here will in-
crease transparency and access to crit-
ical and understandable information,
as well as facilitate informed decision-
making for Americans making invest-
ment decisions and saving for their re-
tirement. This should be accomplished
without delay.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
H.R. 1815.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following let-
ters:
An October 16, 2019, letter from the
SIFMA expressing support for both of
my amendments that exempt Regula-
tion Best Interest and Form CRS from
the bill’s requirements, and the gentle-
woman from Missouri, Mrs. WAGNER’s
amendment, which would make the bill
effective beginning on January 21, 2021,
and apply only to future rulemaking;
an October 16, 2019, letter from SIFMA
opposing H.R. 1815; and also, an Octo-
ber 16, 2019, letter to the Speaker of the
House and Leader MCCARTHY from
ACLI, FSI, IPA, IRI, ICI, NAIFA,
SIFMA, and the Chamber of Commerce
expressing concern with H.R. 1815 and
the negative impact it would have on
retail investors.
As we are starting to have discussion
on these particular amendments, I look
forward to my friends across the aisle
who are saying that the bill does not
change any of the current situation, I
look forward to them potentially sup-

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: The Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association (SIFMA) appreciates
the opportunity to comment on two of the
amendments made in order by the Rules
Committee to H.R. 1815, the ‘‘SEC Disclosure
Effectiveness Testing Act.’’ This legislation
would impose on the Securities and Ex-
change Commission (‘‘SEC’’) an investor
testing requirement for all past and future
regulations, with some exceptions, about dis-
closure to retail investors.
The amendment offered by Representative
Huizenga would exempt Form CRS from the
bill’s retroactive investor testing require-
ments. In the development of the Regulation
Best Interest rulemaking package (com-
monly referred to as ‘‘Reg BI’’), the SEC con-
ducted extensive investor testing of Form
CRS. The SEC’s testing involved both a com-
prehensive national survey to collect infor-
mation on the opinions, preferences, atti-
tudes, and level of self-assessed comprehen-
sion of the Form CRS, as well as qualitative
interviews to obtain further insight into in-
dividuals’ attitudes toward the Form CRS.
We support Rep. Huizenga’s amendment, as
further testing of Form CRS would unduly
interfere with and delay the implementation
process which is already well underway.
Representative Wagner’s amendment
would apply the bill’s investor testing re-
quirements only to applicable disclosure doc-
uments developed after January 21, 2021.
Based on our firm belief in the heightened
strength of the new Reg BI conduct stand-
ards and their value to everyday investors,
which have been fully effective since Sep-
tember 10, 2019 with a compliance date of
June 30, 2020, SIFMA supports the Wagner
amendment. We believe the underlying legis-
lation would unnecessarily delay the imple-
mentation of a new set of sweeping regula-
tions that would provide strong investor and
consumer protections for 43 million house-
holds. SIFMA has long supported enhancing
the standard of conduct applicable to broker-
dealers when providing personalized invest-
ment advice about securities to retail inves-
tors and we believe the SEC has successfully
accomplished this important goal through
Reg BI.
SIFMA appreciates and shares the interest
of Representative Casten and the Committee
on Financial Services in advocating for ro-
bust investor testing of retail investor dis-
closures. We agree that in many cases, inves-
tor testing is appropriate and makes sense.
We believe disclosures are designed to give
the investing public the information they
need to make informed financial decisions
but could be held up in an endless loop of re-
peated testing if the underlying bill is en-
acted. SIFMA therefore supports the pro-
posed amendments made by Representatives
Huizenga and Wagner, which improve the
legislation and offer a better approach to in-
vestor testing.
We appreciate the opportunity to comment
and we appreciate your consideration of our
views. If you have any questions or require
any additional information, please feel free
to contact us.

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: The Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association (SIFMA) appreciates
the opportunity to comment on H.R. 1815,
the ‘‘SEC Disclosure Effectiveness Testing
Act.’’ H.R. 1815 would impose on the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’) an
investor testing requirement for all past and
future broker-dealer regulations, with some
exceptions, about disclosure to retail inves-
tors.
SIFMA appreciates and shares the interest
of Representative Casten and the Committee
on Financial Services in advocating for ro-
bust investor testing of retail investor dis-
closures. We agree that in many cases, inves-
tor testing is appropriate and makes good
common sense. In fact, the SEC conducted
extensive investor testing of the proposed
Form CRS, an important component of the
Regulation Best Interest rulemaking pack-
age (collectively, ‘‘Reg BI’’)—the most com-
prehensive enhancement of standard of con-
duct rules governing broker-dealers since the
enactment of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The SEC’s testing involved both a com-
prehensive national survey to collect infor-
mation on the opinions, preferences, atti-
tudes, and level of self-assessed comprehen-
sion of the Form CRS, as well as qualitative
interviews to obtain further insights related
to the reasoning and beliefs behind individ-
uals’ attitudes toward the Form CRS.
Reg BI has been fully effective since Sep-
tember 10, 2019 and has a compliance date of
June 30, 2020. Further testing of Reg BI
would unduly interfere with and delay the
implementation process which is already
well underway. Ultimately, the bill would di-
vert valuable and limited regulatory re-
sources and thereby undermine the roll-out
of a significantly strengthened best interest
standard of conduct designed to better pro-
tect and serve retail investors.
Over the past several months, the SEC and
FINRA have been working diligently to as-
sist financial services firms in answering Reg
BI interpretive questions and developing Reg
BI compliance programs. Late last month,
the SEC published a small entity compliance
guide to Reg BI. Just last week, FINRA pub-
lished a Reg BI compliance checklist and an-
nounced additional resources to aid firms in
compliance.
Based on our firm belief in the heightened
strength of the new Reg BI conduct stand-
ards and their value to everyday investors,
SIFMA respectfully opposes H.R. 1815. We be-
lieve the bill would likely unnecessarily
delay the implementation of historically
new set of regulations that would provide
strong investor and consumer protections for
forty-three million households. SIFMA has
long supported enhancing the standard of
conduct applicable to broker-dealers when
providing personalized investment advice
about securities to retail investors and we
believe the SEC has succeed in accom-
plishing this important goal through Reg BI.
Further, enactment of the bill as written,
despite the carve outs listed in the man-
ager’s amendment, will subject other rules
that apply to broker dealers under the fed-
eral securities laws to retroactive review and
testing, including Form ABD, Investment
Company Act disclosures, Trust Indenture
Act disclosures, order routing, order execu-
tion, penny stock disclosures and others.
These disclosures are designed to give the in-
vesting public the information they need to
make informed financial decisions, but could
be held up in an endless loop of repeated
testing under the bill. While we understand
and appreciate that this was likely not the
Committee’s intent or purpose, we believe
that imposing such a requirement would
likely result in an unprecedented, costly, re-
source intensive undertaking by the SEC.
We appreciate the opportunity to comment
and we appreciate your consideration of our
views. If you have any questions or require
any additional information, please feel free
to contact us.

makes good common sense. However, we are
concerned that this legislation will have an
immediate negative impact on retail con-
sumers as it would interfere with the imple-
mentation of the Regulation Best Interest
rulemaking package (collectively, ‘‘Reg
BI’’)—the most comprehensive enhancement
of standard of conduct rules governing
broker-dealers since the enactment of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This result
is nonsensical—as investor testing was part
of SEC’s Reg. BI rulemaking promulgation.
Specifically, the SEC conducted extensive
investor testing of the proposed Form CRS,
an important component of the Regulation
Best Interest rulemaking package. The
SEC’s testing involved both a comprehensive
national survey as well as qualitative inter-
views with investors.
Reg BI has been fully effective since Sep-
tember 10, 2019 and has a compliance date of
June 30, 2020. Financial services firms have
spent months developing Reg BI compliance
programs, and further testing of Reg BI
would unduly interfere with and delay this
ongoing implementation process. Based on
our firm belief in the heightened strength of
the Reg BI conduct standards that will bet-
ter protect forty-three million households,
we respectfully oppose H.R. 1815.
Further, despite the carve outs in the man-
ager’s amendment, enactment of the bill as
written will subject other rules regarding
disclosure to retail investors to retroactive
review and testing. These rules include,
among others, retail disclosure requirements
that are designed to give consumers the in-
formation they need to make informed in-
vesting decisions. Under H.R. 1815, however,
these existing rules could be held up in an
endlessly iterative loop of repeated testing.
In addition, with respect to future
rulemakings, the SEC is well-positioned to
determine the most efficient way to test and
support their disclosure related
rulemakings. The SEC conducting investor
testing may or may not be appropriate, de-
pending on the rulemaking. For each rule-
making, however, the SEC already is re-
quired to seek public comment; the comment
period is intended to get public input, includ-
ing from investors and entities that rep-
resent investors and entities that regularly
engage with investors. In this way, the SEC
is able to get real insights into what may or
may not work well for investors. H.R. 1815
may impede rulemakings intended to provide
valuable information to investors, a cost
that exceeds its possible benefits.
We appreciate the opportunity to comment
and your consideration of our views. If you

Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1815 is a com-
monsense bill that is supported by our
Nation’s seniors, investment advisers,
and investor advocates. Here is what
they have said about the bill:
According to AARP, they wrote:
‘‘AARP, on behalf of our nearly 38 mil-
lion members and all older Americans
nationwide, is pleased to endorse H.R.
1815, which would require the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission to con-
duct investor testing when developing
rules and regulations about disclosures
to retail investors. Robust investor
testing of retail investor disclosures
will assist investors in getting the in-
formation they need to make informed
choices about their hard-earned sav-
ings.’’
According to the Financial Planning
Coalition: ‘‘The coalition believes that
H.R. 1815 would provide the statutory
framework necessary for the SEC to
ensure to Congress and Main Street in-
vestors that disclosures required under
SEC rules have been thoroughly and
adequately tested by the SEC and are
reasonably effective in achieving their
intended purpose.’’
According to the Consumer Federa-
tion of America: ‘‘Disclosure is both an
important investor protection tool and
a regulatory requirement that imposes
significant cost on industry. We, there-
fore, have an obligation to make those
disclosures as effective as possible.
H.R. 1815 would help to achieve that
goal by updating the SEC’s approach to
disclosure development. Anyone who
supports commonsense, evidence-based
regulation should support this legisla-
tion.’’
Mr. Chair, before reserving the bal-
ance of my time, I include in the
RECORD correspondence from the Fi-
nancial Planning Coalition, the AARP,
and the CFA, that is the Consumer
Federation of America.
FINANCIAL PLANNING COALITION,
October 11, 2019.
Re Support for H.R. 1815, the ‘‘SEC Disclo-
sure Effectiveness Testing Act’’.
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: On behalf of
the Financial Planning Coalition (Coalition),
we are writing to express our strong support
for H.R. 1815, the ‘‘SEC Disclosure Effective-
ness Testing Act.’’ We encourage you to sup-
port the legislation when it is considered on
the House floor in the coming week.
A fundamental public policy goal of the
federal securities laws is to ensure full and
adequate disclosure of ‘‘material’’ informa-
tion to American investors. The expectation
is that the disclosure will assist investors in
making an informed investment decision.
Given this, we appreciate the work the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC)
Office of the Investor Advocate has done to
identify and confront the challenges to im-
prove investor disclosure.
Research conducted on behalf of AARP,
Consumer Federation of America and the Co-
alition organizations, as well as separate re-
search conducted by the SEC, all highlight
the challenges and difficulties in developing
clear, understandable investor disclosures.
Information about financial issues and in-
vestments is often complex and technical in
nature, and investor comprehension of this
information typically is poor. All too often,
mandated disclosures contain technical lan-
guage and concepts that, as research con-
firms, are confusing to or misunderstood by
investors. Indeed, research studies prove
time and again how difficult it is to convey
even the most basic financial and investment
concepts in a way that typical Main Street
investors understand.
To determine whether proposed investor
disclosures would be effective at achieving
their regulatory purpose of informing inves-
tor decision-making, it is not enough simply
to survey investors generally on their likes
or preferences. Thorough and adequate inves-
tor testing must go beyond that and, more
importantly, must assess investors’ ability
to integrate information and synthesize it
into a rational evaluation. This involves a
more complex and higher-level cognitive
skill. Conducting thorough one-on-one cog-
nitive testing is the only proven way to de-
termine whether a proposed disclosure docu-
ment will achieve its intended purpose.
For these reasons, we are particularly
pleased that the proposed legislation in-
cludes a requirement for qualitative testing
in the form of one-on-one cognitive inter-
views of investors. A deeper look into the
way investors analyze and synthesize infor-
mation is necessary to determine the useful-
ness and effectiveness of any disclosure doc-
ument in an investor’s decision-making
process.
The Coalition believes that H.R. 1815 will
provide the statutory framework necessary
for the SEC to ensure to Congress and Main
Street investors that disclosures required
under SEC rules have been thoroughly and
adequately tested by the SEC and are rea-
sonably effective in achieving their intended
purpose. The legislation to be considered on
the House floor appropriately clarifies that
the scope of testing is limited to those dis-
closures that are intended to be used by re-
tail investors in choosing a financial profes-
sional or investment product. The modified
legislation to be considered on the House
floor makes additional important clarifica-
tions that the Coalition supports.
We urge a ‘‘Yes’’ vote when the legislation
comes up for a vote on the House floor.

DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS: AARP, on be-
half of our nearly 38 million members and all
older Americans nationwide, is pleased to
endorse H.R. 1815, which would require the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
to conduct investor testing when developing
rules and regulations about disclosures to re-
tail investors. Robust investor testing of re-
tail investor disclosures will assist investors
in getting the information they need to
make informed choices about their hard-
earned savings.
AARP has a long history of fighting for in-
vestor protections and is especially eager to
provide clarity and transparency to the often
confusing and overly complicated invest-
ment world. AARP has experienced firsthand
the value of investor testing to provide indi-
viduals with meaningful information needed
for financial decision-making. In response to
the SEC’s proposed Client Relationship Sum-
mary (CRS) disclosure forms, AARP commis-
sioned two, independent rounds of research

and testing to gauge retail investor under-
standing. The findings provided valuable in-
formation that helped guide our rec-
ommendations for design and content modi-
fications to improve consumer under-
standing. AARP believes that such retail
testing should be utilized extensively by the
SEC for the development of effective, con-
sumer facing disclosures.
AARP appreciates that creating effective
disclosure is often a difficult and daunting
task. We also understand that the price of
ineffective disclosures can be poor invest-
ment decisions and inadequate levels of re-
tirement savings. We believe testing is im-
perative for facilitating informed decision-
making on the part of consumers trying to
save and invest their hard-earned money.
We look forward to working with you and
your colleagues to increase transparency and
access to critical and understandable infor-
mation, as well as facilitate informed deci-
sionmaking for older Americans making in-
vestment decisions and saving for their re-
tirement. If you have any questions, please
feel free to contact me.
Sincerely,
BILL SWEENEY,
Senior Vice President, Government
Affairs.
CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We understand
that H.R. 1815, the SEC Disclosure Effective-
ness Testing Act, will soon be brought to the
House floor for a vote. We are writing to
urge you to vote yes on this pro-investor
bill, which would help to ensure that the dis-
closures retail investors rely on convey as ef-
fectively as possible the key information
needed to make an informed choice about de-
cisions that are critical to their financial
wellbeing.
The sad reality is that the disclosures in-
vestors receive when choosing investment
professionals or evaluating investment op-
tions often do a poor job of conveying criti-
cally important information in a way that
typical retail investors can understand. This
includes cost disclosures that don’t clearly
convey costs, risk disclosures that don’t
clearly convey risks, and conflict of interest
disclosure that do not clearly convey the na-
ture or impact of those conflicts. Evidence of
this can be found, for example, in a 2018 SEC
proposal to create a summary prospectus for
variable products that, while sound in con-
cept, is long, dense, poorly organized, and
full of technical jargon.
As a result, retail investors, and particu-
larly the least sophisticated retail investors,
are too often flying blind when making in-
vestment decisions that will affect their
ability to afford a secure and independent re-
tirement or fund other long-term financial
goals. There are several reasons for this. One
is the inherent difficulty of the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s task of devel-
oping clear disclosures of complex topics for
a non-expert retail audience. But the other is
the SEC’s failure to adopt best practices
widely used by industry and some other gov-
ernment agencies to develop more effective
disclosures, including incorporating quali-
tative testing of disclosure effectiveness
early in the development process.
This bill would help to correct the second
of these two problems. It would do so, first,
by requiring the SEC to incorporate quali-
tative disclosure effectiveness testing in the
development of new disclosures designed for
retail investors. Importantly findings of the
testing would have to be made available for
public comment. This would both hold the
SEC accountable for addressing those find-
ings in any rulemaking subject to the test-
ing requirement and provide all stakeholders
with an opportunity to weigh in.
Second, the bill would require the SEC,
with input from the Office of Investor Advo-
cate, to develop a plan for testing existing
retail disclosures, without imposing a rigid
timeframe for completing that review. Ap-
propriately, disclosures primarily relied on
by institutional investors, analysts, and
other sophisticated market participants
would not be subject to the testing require-
ment. This, along with the involvement of
the Office of Investor Advocate in deter-
mining which existing disclosures are prior-
ities for testing, would help to ensure re-
sources are devoted to testing the disclo-
sures most important for retail investors.
Disclosure is both an important investor
protection tool and a regulatory requirement
that imposes significant costs on industry.
We, therefore, have an obligation to make
those disclosures as effective as possible.
H.R. 1815 would help to achieve that goal by
updating the SEC’s approach to disclosure
development. Anyone who supports common
sense, evidence-based regulation should sup-
port this legislation.
Respectfully submitted,
BARBARA ROPER,
Director of Investor
Protection.
MICAH HAUPTMAN,
Financial Services
Counsel.
Ms. WATERS. I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining on
each side and whether the gentle-
woman is prepared to close at this
time.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Michigan has 211⁄2 minutes remaining.
The gentlewoman from California has
14 minutes remaining.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I am pre-
pared to close.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chair, I do want to point out that
as the gentlewoman from Missouri and
I were chatting a little bit about this,
it is amazing, when this issue came to
a head at the end of the Obama admin-
istration, there was a massive move
away from the Securities and Exchange
Commission where this Reg Best Inter-
est traditionally has been the domain
of such regulation and was moved over
to the Department of Labor.
Why? Because the administration be-
lieved they needed to move so quickly
and they couldn’t get the Securities
and Exchange Commission to act and
agree—parenthetically, agree—with
them as to what it should look like,
they kicked it over to the Department
of Labor, which has a small little silver
of oversight of this area because of pen-
sions. But, nonetheless, they came up
with a wholly unsatisfactory rule that
caused a tremendous amount of confu-
sion. The Securities and Exchange
Commission put itself forward and
said: No, we need to get this done.
That is what kicked off all of the
roundtables and the interviews and the
1,800 surveys and the 6,000 comment
letters. We are now at this point where
we can deliver on much-needed reform,
and my colleagues across the aisle
want to kick it backwards.
Now, Mr. Chairman, you heard the
author say that they are not interested
in relitigating current rulemaking, so I
look forward to them all supporting
my amendment that we are going to be
talking about. And let’s exempt Form
CRS and the Reg BI. But I am afraid,
Mr. Chair, that is not their goal and in-
tent. I am afraid that they don’t like
the policy; therefore, they want to go
back in and delay.
When the gentleman was talking
about how there was no changes be-
cause of this, that is simply not true.
The Form CRS went from four pages
down to two pages, with significant,
simplified changes that were inserted
into that.
And so that is the goal and objective
at the end of the day, Mr. Chairman: to
protect investors, to give them cer-
tainty and clarity; to give those who
provide the advice to them certainty
and clarity; and, frankly, to move for-
ward.
I am afraid that H.R. 1815 here does
the exact opposite. It is going to delay
it. It is going to make it even more
murky than what it had been pre-
viously.
I just want to urge my colleagues to
think this through, what they are pro-
posing to do to the Securities and Ex-
change Commission, the power of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
And again, my first term was spent
listening to how the Republicans ‘‘were
trying to destroy the Securities Ex-
change Commission’’ by not funding
them enough, by not allowing them to
do their job, by not having the ap-
pointees do what their backgrounds
and expertise would allow them to do.
I never bought that charge, Mr. Chair-
man, because it simply wasn’t true.
But we can see clearly, right now,
this is a delaying tactic by the opposi-
tion; and how we would put not just
current rulemaking, not just future
rulemaking, but even past rulemaking
back into this system would simply be
a huge mistake.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
b 1300
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I must admit that I
am a bit surprised at this opposition. I
am a bit surprised at this opposition
because, first of all, everyone must un-
derstand that the SEC is our cop on the
block. This agency has, as its basic
mission, to protect investors.
Who best to be protected than the
small, retail investors? We have so
many schemes, so much fraud that we
witness every day that is being brought
forth to basically take advantage of
the most vulnerable people in our soci-
ety, many of them who don’t have a lot
of resources, who don’t have money
that they could lose. So, we believe
that they must understand in what
they are investing.
This is not about the big, institu-
tional investors. This is about your re-
tail investors. This is about the little

guy. This is about those people who are
depending on the information that
they get and their investment advisers
to help guide them so they can have
enough money in retirement, for exam-
ple.
Why is it we would have any elected
official coming to represent the people
from their districts who would be op-
posed to making sure that these small
investors are represented, that they
are protected, that they are cared
about?
So, I am surprised at this opposition,
and I don’t know why there would be so
much time spent saying that the SEC
does not need to do additional kinds of
testing, that they don’t need to be con-
cerned about these disclosures.
What is it you need to protect about
the SEC from doing its basic job? I
don’t understand that.
But, however, let me just say that
H.R. 1815 is a commonsense bill that
benefits mom-and-pop investors by put-
ting a process in place to ensure that
the SEC’s disclosures are clear and
comprehensible for those investors.
A disclosure is only useful if it can be
understood by its audience, and this
legislation ensures that disclosures are
tested in a robust way so that they are
clear.
This bill is supported, again, by
groups such as the AARP, our seniors;
the Financial Planning Coalition; and
the Consumer Federation of America,
looking out for consumers.
I, again, commend Representative
CASTEN for putting forth this impor-
tant legislation, and I thank him for
his work. But, more than that, I thank
him as a new Member of Congress who
understands that his job, his responsi-
bility, is to look out for his constitu-
ents and for the small investors, the
little people, those people who need
some protection, those people who
don’t need to be ripped off, those people
who need to have clear information and
disclosure about what they are getting
into.
I thank Representative CASTEN for
his vision, for his foresight, and for un-
derstanding the responsibility of the
SEC.
Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to vote
‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The CHAIR. All time for general de-
bate has expired.
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be
considered for amendment under the 5-
minute rule.
In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by
the Committee on Financial Services,
printed in the bill, an amendment in
the nature of a substitute consisting of
the text of Rules Committee Print 116–
34 modified by the amendment printed
in part A of House Report 116–237, shall
be considered as adopted. The bill, as
amended, shall be considered as the
original bill and shall be considered as
read.
The text of the bill, as amended, is as
follows:
H.R. 1815
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘SEC Disclosure
Effectiveness Testing Act’’.
SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE TESTING.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 23(a) of the Securi-
ties Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78w(a)) is
amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(4) INVESTOR TESTING.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The Commission shall en-
gage in investor testing prior to issuing any rule
or regulation which designates documents or in-
formation to be disclosed under the securities
laws, if such documents or information are re-
quired to be delivered to, and are intended or
substantially likely to be materially relied upon
by, a retail investor when—
‘‘(i) selecting a broker-dealer or investment
adviser, evaluating their services and fees, or
materially altering a brokerage or advisory rela-
tionship;
‘‘(ii) assessing a securities recommendation or
investment advice provided by a broker- dealer
or investment adviser;
‘‘(iii) making a decision to purchase or sell a
security; or
‘‘(iv) such other circumstances as the Commis-
sion may, with input from the Investor Advo-
cate, determine appropriate for the protection of
retail investors.
‘‘(B) EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN DISCLOSURES.—
This section shall not apply to—
‘‘(i) disclosures made pursuant to Regulations
S-K and S-X (including Industry Guides), Regu-
lation 14A, Form N-PX, Form 10-K, Form 10-Q,
Form 8-K, Form SD, Form N-PORT, Form PF,
Regulation SBSR, disclosures mandated by or
jointly with the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve System or the Financial Stability
Oversight Council, or successors thereto; or
‘‘(ii) any other documents or information that
the Commission, with input from the Investor
Advocate, determines are outside the intended
scope and purposes of this Act.
‘‘(C) COMMISSION AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT AD-
DITIONAL TESTING.—This section shall not be
construed to limit the Commission’s ability to
conduct any investor testing on any other docu-
ments or information not subject to this section
23(a), provided that any such investor testing
shall not be subject to the requirements of this
section 23(a).
‘‘(D) CONTENTS.—Investor testing conducted
pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall include the
following:
‘‘(i) Qualitative testing in the form of one-on-
one cognitive interviews of retail investors about
documents or information, or samples of such
documents or information, to be provided.
‘‘(ii) Such other forms of testing that the Com-
mission, with input from the Investor Advocate,
deems appropriate for evaluating the effective-
ness of retail disclosures.
‘‘(iii) Analysis and publication in the Federal
Register of the results of the testing.
‘‘(iv) An opportunity for the public to com-
ment on such results published in the Federal
Register.
‘‘(E) SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES.—If the Commis-
sion, in the period between engaging in investor
testing and publishing a final rule, makes sub-
stantive changes to such rule that the Commis-
sion determines would have a significant impact
on retail investors, and such changes were not
already investor tested, the Commission shall
again engage in investor testing related to such
changes.
‘‘(F) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF RETAIL TESTING
RESULTS.—The Commission shall make the data
and results of any investor testing performed
pursuant to this paragraph available to the
public.
‘‘(G) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.—
‘‘(i) The determination that some or all of a
document or information is deemed to be subject
to this paragraph shall not forestall the deter-
mination that such document or information
may also be used or relied upon by the public,
market participants other than retail investors,
or government agencies.
‘‘(ii) The Commission may, in consultation
with the Investor Advocate, determine which, if
any, components of such document or informa-
tion are substantially likely to be relied on by
retail investors for the purposes outlined in
paragraph (4)(A) above and focus testing under
this paragraph on those components of the dis-
closure.
‘‘(iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii) above, where
any information subject to testing under this
paragraph may be used or relied upon by the
public, market participants other than retail in-
vestors, or government agencies, the results of
testing made pursuant to this paragraph shall
not provide grounds for reducing or eliminating
(including any undermining of reliability of and
accountability for) the information that existing
or proposed regulation requires or would require
be made available to the public, market partici-
pants other than retail investors, and govern-
ment agencies, whether or not such information
is delivered to retail investors.’’.
(b) PARTICIPATION OF INVESTOR ADVOCATE.—
Section 4(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78d(g)) is amended—
(1) in paragraph (4)—
(A) in subparagraph (D)(ii), by striking
‘‘and’’ at the end;
(B) by redesignating subparagraph (E) as sub-
paragraph (F); and
(C) by inserting after subparagraph (D) the
following: ″(E) engage in investor testing—
‘‘(i) to carry out the functions of the Office;
and
‘‘(ii) pursuant to section 23(a)(4), as appro-
priate; and’’;
(2) by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(9) PUBLICATION OF DATA AND RESULTS OF IN-
VESTOR TESTING.—With respect to any investor
testing carried out by the Investor Advocate
pursuant to paragraph (4)(E), the Investor Ad-
vocate may make the data and results of such
investor testing available to the public, without
further review or editing by the Commission.
‘‘(10) PERSONNEL.—If the Investor Advocate
decides, within its sole discretion, to conduct
testing under this Section, the Investor Advo-
cate may do so and the Commission shall pro-
vide the Office of the Investor Advocate with
sufficient personnel and funding necessary to
carry out such testing. Such testing may qualify
as the testing covered by this section, provided
that all requirements of the section are met.’’.
(c) PRIOR RULES.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—For any final rule or regula-
tion issued by the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (in this subsection referred to as the
‘‘Commission’’) before the date of the enactment
of this Act that would be subject to investor test-
ing under section 23(a)(4) of the Securities Ex-
change Act of 1934, had such rule been issued
on or after the date of enactment of this Act, the
Commission shall perform investor testing with
respect to such rule or regulation that includes
the contents described in such section 23(a)(4).
(2) SCHEDULE.—The Commission shall, not
later than 6 months after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, with input from the Investor
Advocate, establish a schedule for completing
any investor testing required under paragraph
(1) that prioritizes testing of any final rules and
regulations that designate documents or infor-
mation central to retail investor decision mak-
ing, and in particular prioritize the testing of
documents or information required to be deliv-
ered to retail investors in the form of summary
documents or summary sections of documents
including for the purpose of determining wheth-
er and how such summary documents can
achieve the goals of informed investor decision-
making in the circumstances set forth in Section
23(a)(4) of the Securities 6 Exchange Act of 1934

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. HUIZENGA
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 1 printed in part
B of House Report 116–237.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 2, line 17, after ‘‘Guides),’’ insert the
following: ‘‘Form CRS’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 629, the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. HUIZENGA) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Michigan.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment is very simple. It would
add Form CRS to the list of exempted
disclosures that would not require SEC
investor testing. They have gone
through it.
Now, you just heard one of my col-
leagues talk about why somebody
would oppose this. I can tell you why
somebody would oppose this: Because
we have been doing it for 7 years.
For 7 years Reg BI has been debated.
It has been litigated. It has been con-
fusing. And it is time to move forward.
The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission has done that.
So, again, the author of the bill ear-
lier had said, Mr. Chair, that he was
not interested in relitigating current
rulemaking. Now is the time to show
that. Now is the time to prove that.
Support my amendment.
So, Form CRS was part of the Regu-
lation Best Interest rulemaking pack-
age. The form is a short, plain-lan-
guage description of an investor-ad-
viser or a broker-dealer’s relationship
summary.
It is designed to help retail investors
select or determine to remain with an
advisory or brokerage firm. They are
trying to figure it out.
Importantly, Form CRS was the re-
sult of an extensive deliberative proc-
ess at the SEC. Beyond the typical
comment process—and the SEC did
consider 6,000 comments for the Reg BI
rulemaking package—the SEC also en-
gaged in substantial investor outreach,
including in-person meetings across
the country; surveys—1,800 of those
surveys—and, importantly, engaged
the RAND Corporation to perform one-
on-one, in-depth investor testing of the
proposed Form CRS.
Now, earlier it was claimed, Mr.
Chair, that the initial form was un-
changed. That is not true. The SEC did
figure out that four pages was too long,
too confusing. They streamlined that
down to two.
So, that is, the SEC did its work—
again, for the last 7 years. And we are
now at a critical juncture. We can
choose to take this road, or we can
choose to turn around and head back-
ward. I, for one, do not want to turn
around and head backward. I want to
provide that protection to my Main
Street investors and my constituents
back in my district.
So, the SEC did its job. It did testing
that was substantially similar to what
was proposed by this bill on Form CRS
already. It has been 7 years that we
have been going through this process.
We could not get, under the last admin-
istration and in the beginning of this
administration, the Department of
Labor and the Securities and Exchange
Commission to agree on how to move
forward.
And when in the Trump administra-
tion, this current administration, the
Department of Labor was trying to as-
sert itself, the Securities and Exchange
Commission did its job and stepped in,
which it didn’t do under the last ad-
ministration, and said: Nope. We got it.
We are the lead agency. We will take
this, and we will come up with a final
product.
And the reason why I oppose this bill,
certainly without my amendment, is
all this does is it reverts back to what
we had before this rulemaking was
done by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Confusion, muddiness,
and uncertainty will be the rule of law,
and we are trying to clear that up. The
Securities and Exchange Commission
is trying to clear that up.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from
California is recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, this amend-
ment is unnecessary and could under-
mine the investor understanding of
how retail investors relate to brokers.
H.R. 1815, the SEC Disclosure Effec-
tiveness Testing Act, simply requires
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion to test its documents with retail
investors through one-on-one inter-
views and surveys to ensure that dis-
closure documents intended for retail
investors are actually understood by
their target audience.
H.R. 1815 is in no way intended to re-
peal Regulation Best Interest, a rule
adopted by the SEC in June to change
the standard of conduct for brokers
when providing retail investors with
personalized investment advice.
And, to be clear, the bill does not re-
quire testing of the standard imposed
by the SEC under Regulation Best In-
terest. Instead, it requires testing of
how well retail investors understand
the standard and how it impacts the
advice they receive, along with any
other disclosures.
In addition, the bill contemplates
that the SEC, in consultation with the
investor advocate, would develop a
schedule of disclosures that it intends
to test and report to Congress. There is
nothing in the bill that requires inves-
tor testing of disclosures related to
Regulation Best Interest on day one of
enactment.
But this amendment would say that
the SEC should never test these disclo-
sures, regardless of changes to the mar-
kets, investment product offerings, in-
vestor behaviors, and investment
trends. This makes little sense, par-
ticularly considering the rise of riskier
products like cryptocurrencies that are
being targeted to retail investors.
I would also point out that, to the ex-
tent that the SEC, in consultation with
the investor advocate, determines that
it should make substantial changes to
the disclosures that would have a sig-
nificant impact on retail investors,
H.R. 1815 would simply require the SEC
to test new and existing disclosure
forms to ensure that they are actually
understood by the intended audience.
Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment,
I ask all of my colleagues to do so, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, just
to address a couple of things: This bill
clearly says it will add Form CRS to
the list of exempted disclosures that
would not require SEC investor test-
ing. It has nothing to do with
cryptocurrencies unless, somehow,
magically, a crypto broker appears.
There is no such thing. It has no ap-
plication. This amendment is only
going to be narrow. It is going to ex-
empt Form CRS from having to go
through this again.
The author of the bill had said that
he had no interest in relitigating cur-
rent rulemaking. Here is the oppor-
tunity to prove it because, I would
hope, Mr. Chairman, that we would all
agree that Form CRS does not need to
be subject to further testing.

CORRECTION
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8217
October 17, 2019
It has been 7 years. I don’t want it to
be another 7 years. As my colleague
from Indiana earlier was saying, 600
rules at 6 months per rule is 300 years.
We don’t have that time.
Mr. Chair, I hope that my colleagues
would support my amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I would
like to inquire how much time I have
remaining.
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from
California has 21⁄2 minutes remaining.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield the
balance of my time to the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. CASTEN), the sponsor
of this important legislation.
b 1315
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to the
Huizenga amendment, and I want to
clarify a couple of points.
The bill gives the SEC Office of the
Investor Advocate a larger role to
prioritize which disclosures to test.
The bill also says that once testing is
completed and is found to be clear,
there is no need to do further testing
unless there are substantive changes.
To argue that every single bill is
going to have to be reviewed every sin-
gle time is not an argument that is
made in good faith. The question here
on the amendment is simply: Should
we exempt one single form from the
broad discretion given to the SEC in
this rule? It is not clear to me why you
would exempt Form CRS from investor
testing, unless you don’t want inves-
tors to understand the fees, costs, or
conflicts of interest of investment pro-
fessionals.
We know, through the testing that
was done, that Form CRS appeared to
be helpful for investors who had al-
ready read similar documents and who
had more investing experience. And we
know from the testing that was done
that Form CRS, as currently written,
is not that helpful for investors who
haven’t otherwise read similar docu-
ments.
We can’t tie the SEC’s hands in de-
termining which disclosure documents
need further investor testing. But if we
are sitting here and believe that we
have an obligation to look out for the
best interests of the American people,
for investors, for Main Street inves-
tors, then the only choice before us is
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment, and I
encourage all of my colleagues to do
so.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA).
The question was taken; and the
Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of
rule XVIII, further proceedings on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Michigan will be postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. GOTTHEIMER
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 2 printed in part
B of House Report 116–237.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 4, insert after line 8 the following:
(v) A consideration of unique challenges
faced by retail investors age 65 or older.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 629, the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman,
my amendment is straightforward. It
simply requires the SEC to specifically
consider the unique challenges senior
investors face as part of its overall in-
vestor testing.
Since I took office, I have been com-
mitted to helping seniors save their
hard-earned money for retirement so
they can afford to stay in New Jersey
and enjoy their lives with their kids
and grandkids.
Unfortunately, there are millions of
senior investors across the country
who have been the victims of financial
scammers, hucksters, and snake oil
salesmen who have cheated them out of
their rightful retirement.
That is why, earlier this year, I in-
troduced the Senior Security Act, bi-
partisan legislation that overwhelm-
ingly passed out of the House to help
the SEC protect vulnerable seniors
from predatory scams and financial
abuse.
This amendment is another critical
step in making sure that the SEC con-
tinues to do right by our seniors, by
making sure there is explicit consider-
ation of senior investors as they pro-
ceed with investor testing.
New Jersey seniors have given us so
much. I will always have their backs to
ensure they have the help they need to
stay in Jersey and to protect them
from those who would seek to take ad-
vantage of them.
I thank my colleague and friend, Mr.
CASTEN, for introducing this bill and
for his commitment to protecting sen-
iors. I thank the chairwoman also for
her excellent leadership. And I urge my
colleagues to support this common-
sense amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the proposed amend-
ment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I
share my colleague’s concerns about
the challenges that senior investors
face. I have had that with my own par-
ents, who, unfortunately, are no longer
with us. But I was a part of those in-
vestment discussions and decisions,
and I had a brother who was very, very
involved in that and a sister who also.
We all worked together as a family,
trying to figure this all out. This is a
concern that all of us had.
The author of the amendment was
also the author of the Senior Security
Act, which I supported, and massive bi-
partisan support came out of this
House. Many people would be surprised
about that, I would bet.
But I am opposed, however, to adding
to the already significant requirements
of this investor testing bill. I will note
that the bill, as drafted, would already
require that the SEC do whatever test-
ing it, in consultation with the Office
of the Investor Advocate, determines is
‘‘appropriate for evaluating the effec-
tiveness of retail disclosures.’’
It doesn’t say for young people. It
doesn’t say middle-income people. It
doesn’t say for old people. It says for
everyone. This is already covered.
Earlier, you heard my amendment,
that I was going to add to an exemp-
tion. Well, there is already a list of ex-
emptions, that forms are exempted.
Mine would have been in addition to
that.
The purpose of my amendment and
my opposition to this amendment is to
simplify, not to make it duplicative,
not to make it more complicated, not
to make it more cumbersome, bur-
dened, and bureaucratic.
As I read it, for the amendment to
have any type of meaning, the amend-
ment suggests that testing is either: A,
flawed as it currently is; or, B,
wouldn’t consider seniors.
I am assuming that is not what the
author is intending to do, to question
that.
I just see this as unnecessary, dupli-
cative testing that would add to the
bill’s cost and expand another layer of
bureaucracy that doesn’t ultimately
help those retail investors. John and
Jane 401(k), those mom-and-pop inves-
tors, whatever title you want to put to
them, they need to be our focus.
Now, there is a cottage industry of
now-congressionally mandated investor
testers. I am not really interested in
continuing to give them jobs. I want to
make sure that we protect those inves-
tors, but also give them that protec-
tion in a timely manner because time-
liness is part of that protection.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman, I
would like to add one thing. Given the
gravity of the situation with seniors in
this country getting scammed out of
billions of dollars or more every year, I
don’t think we can do enough.
The only thing I would urge my
friend here is, anything we can do to
actually protect our seniors, we should
be doing because what we are doing
now is not working.
When I go anywhere, I hear from sen-
iors about these awful instances and
stories of what is happening to them on
these calls and getting defrauded. I
think anything that we can do to help
protect our seniors and go the extra

mile to help them is critically impor-
tant. This is a way to do it that I think
is effective, efficient, and will get the
backs of our seniors, which, to me, is
the least we can do for our seniors who
have given so much to us.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. CASTEN),
the sponsor of the bill.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in support of the
Gottheimer amendment. I would like
to thank my friend, Representative
GOTTHEIMER, for his amendment and
for his longtime support for seniors and
their financial health.
This amendment rightfully high-
lights that the SEC should take into
account the unique circumstances that
seniors face in making investment de-
cisions when they do their investor
testing.
The financial health of seniors is
critically important, and I am de-
lighted that this bill has the support of
the AARP and the 38 million seniors
who they represent across our country.
I stand with them in making clear that
effective disclosure testing is impera-
tive for facilitating informed decision-
making for Americans trying to save
and invest their hard-earned money.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’
on the Gottheimer amendment.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I am pre-
pared to close. I am curious on the re-
maining balance of time on both sides.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Michigan has 2 minutes remaining. The
gentleman from New Jersey has 2 min-
utes remaining.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman, I
would like to add, just one more time,
to the critical importance, please.
There is a reason why I think Mr.
CASTEN and so many others have been
driving this bipartisan legislation, and
why the Senior Security Act was bipar-
tisan is for a pretty simple reason.
We all recognize that we have to do
whatever possible to keep these
fraudsters, these hucksters, these
snake oil salesmen from scamming our
seniors. It is beyond upsetting when
you hear these stories of what has hap-
pened to our moms, our dads, and so
many people in our community who
have been, frankly, ripped off by these
scam artists.
This legislation—not just this
amendment, but the legislation—will
help protect our seniors; will help pro-
tect investors; and with my amend-
ment, will make sure that when people
are ready to retire, they have the nest
egg they need to not just take care of
themselves and have the medicine they
need but, of course, buy a gift for their
grandkid and make sure they are able
to have those resources that they spent
their whole lives saving for.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman,
again, my opposition to the amend-
ment has nothing to do with putting
seniors in danger. In fact, that is why
I supported a litany of bills and a pack-
age of bills that included the author’s
Senior Security Act this last April.
The House is unified in supporting sen-
iors. What we are not unified in is sup-
porting bureaucracy.
By the way, the aforementioned that
I had talked about, the Office of the In-
vestor Advocate, would you like to
know where that came from? The
Dodd-Frank Act.
What this amendment is saying is
the Dodd-Frank Act failed in pro-
tecting seniors. The Dodd-Frank Act
must have failed in protecting inves-
tors because we now need to have a
specific, senior-worded sort of category
that needs to be looked out after.
The law is supposed to be blind,
whether you are young, old, middle in-
come, rich, poor, whatever it is. That
protection also goes there.
My opposition, again, is not about
who has been affected but what is
going to slow down that protection
that those people deserve.
Reasonable cost equals access. If we
continue to increase costs, it limits the
ability for people to access that protec-
tion, that advice. That is why I rise in
opposition to my friend’s amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER).
The question was taken; and the
Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman, I

AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MRS. WAGNER
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 3 printed in part
B of House Report 116–237.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 1, line 11, insert after ‘‘regulation’’
the following ‘‘after January 21, 2021’’.
Page 7, strike line 12 and all that follows
through the end.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 629, the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Mrs. WAGNER) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Missouri.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in support of my amendment to H.R.
1815, which would apply the bill’s addi-
tional investor testing requirements
only to disclosure documents developed
after January 21, 2021.
If enacted, this legislation would
hinder the implementation of impor-
tant rules designed to better protect
Main Street investors, particularly,
the SEC’s Regulation Best Interest
rule. This rule has been in effect since
September 10, 2019, but it has a compli-
ance date of June 30, 2020.
If further and ongoing testing were
required, it would onerously roll back
and delay further—after 7 years of test-
ing, debate, deliberation, comment pe-
riods, litigation, it would only roll
back and further delay, Mr. Chairman,
all of the SEC’s efforts to better pro-
tect those retail investors.
b 1330
The bottom line is that this legisla-
tion is duplicative for rules already
under consideration. The SEC has al-
ready conducted extensive investor
testing of the proposed Form CRS, a
component of the Regulation Best In-
terest rule. This is nothing, Mr. Chair-
man, but a political ploy, rope-a-dope,
more neglect in not doing the work of
the people. It does not serve those low-
and middle-income investors, those
constituents of mine in Missouri’s Sec-
ond Congressional District.
It makes no sense to go back and
conduct repetitive investor testing,
leaving broker dealers and their cli-
ents—again, there are low- and middle-
income investors—without a uniform
best interest standard.
That is why I ask all of my col-
leagues to support this commonsense
amendment, and if it is not agreed to,
to oppose the underlying bill, H.R. 1815,
that does nothing but delay and dis-
serve the people that we should be
working hard to protect, those low-
and middle-income retail investors
that are a part of our beautiful and
wonderful Main Street districts.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from
California is recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
First, let me just say, no matter how
many amendments the opposite side
can come up with, no matter how many
ways they try to explain why they are
not speaking for the retail investors,
the small folks, the people with not a
lot of resources, the people who depend
on good information to be disclosed to
them, they can come up with all the
amendments they want, but no one
thinking clearly about this will under-
stand why they are trying to protect
the SEC, our cop on the block, from
doing everything they possibly can do
to protect our seniors and our most
vulnerable people.
So H.R. 1815 seeks, again, to ensure
that disclosures specifically designed
for the most vulnerable investors, in-
cluding mom-and-pop retail investors,
can actually be used and understood by
their intended audiences. Isn’t that a
simple request in this bill, that our
most vulnerable retail investors under-
stand what they are investing in, that
that information should be disclosed to
them? I don’t get the arguments
against it.
This amendment, however, directly
conflicts with the scope of the bill,

which covers new as well as existing
disclosures. Requiring existing disclo-
sures to be subjected to investor test-
ing makes good sense. Evidence has
shown many existing disclosures are
not understood. The evidence is there
that tells you that we have discovered
that the disclosures are not understood
by these vulnerable people. We have in-
formation that documents that, that
the investors, the small investors,
these seniors, don’t understand. This
bill is about helping them to under-
stand what they are signing on the dot-
ted line for.
Mandatory disclosures that are un-
used or not understood impose unnec-
essary costs on the companies making
those disclosures, and importantly, fail
to inform retail investors of key risks
that they should know when making
investment decisions.
However, this amendment that is be-
fore you would treat disclosures that
are put forth before the next Presi-
dential election as perfect, without
need for further investor input through
testing. Such an exemption is incon-
sistent with the object and purpose of
this bill.
This undermines H.R. 1815 and its
value to retail investors. So I could say
this another 100 ways, they can come
up with all the amendments they want
to come up with; the fact of the matter
is, this bill that is put forward by Mr.
CASTEN is to protect the citizens who
need the information the most, because
they are vulnerable. And so having said
that, I would urge my colleagues to
join me in opposing this amendment.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire how much time is remaining?
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from
Missouri has 2 minutes remaining. The
gentlewoman from California has 11⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
HUIZENGA), the ranking member of the
Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship,
and Capital Markets Subcommittee,
my friend, to speak in support of the
amendment and in opposition to the
underlying bill.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I
thank my colleague and friend for
yielding.
Nobody is opposed to the idea of in-
vestor testing of SEC disclosure docu-
ments. By the way, neither is the SEC.
They just proved that, as we know,
from their testing of Form CRS.
What I am opposed to, and I believe
the gentlewoman is opposed to, is a
testing loop. You test and refine, test-
refine, test-refine. What is happening
in between those time periods? What
does it revert back to? And we can get
into a death spiral or paralysis by anal-
ysis sometimes. Not that we don’t have
the best intentions and have the SEC
move forward, we just need closure.
Again, cost is a part of the access,
but timeliness is part of access for ev-
erybody as well, and I am just afraid
that with what we could get into we
are going to be in this testing loop.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chairman, let me
just say, I have been working on this
issue and fighting for the retail inves-
tors for all 7 of my years here in Con-
gress with several pieces of legislation
to bring this to fruition and to always,
always hold that retail investor in the
best interest to make sure that we are
taking care of them and giving them
the best advice, the best access, the
best cost, but most of all that we se-
cure their savings and their retirement
investment and do everything we can
to serve in their best interests. And
that is why we must bring this after 7
long years to a close.
It is time that we stop playing rope-
a-dope with duplicative rules that have
already been under consideration and
by conducting extensive investor test-
ing that has already been done. The
SEC is the absolute body of jurisdic-
tion. They must harmonize with the
Department of Labor, and have, and
now we have got a short, two-form
page. We have got disclosures and ti-
tles that are clear that is serving the
best interests of our constituents.
I would ask everyone to consider my
amendment to H.R. 1815, and if it is not
agreed to, to oppose the underlying
bill.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. CASTEN),
the author of this bill, to continue to
tell the public why we must protect the
most vulnerable in our society.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in strong opposition to the
Wagner amendment. The wealth that
Americans hold in their retirement ac-
counts, in their 401(k)s, in their IRAs,
all the places that they hold their
wealth, the fees they pay on that
wealth, the returns they earn on that
wealth do not care when the law was
written, or the form was processed.
We know, we have evidence, that
many of the existing disclosure docu-
ments intended for retail investors are
not well understood by their target au-
dience. So I would ask you: What is the
cost to your wealth of another percent
a year in asset management fees? What
is the cost to you, to your wealth, of
another percent a year compounding in
the growth of your wealth? Multiply
that by all the Americans who make
their investments. Billions, trillions of
dollars.
This amendment was offered as a way
to protect people. It is protecting peo-
ple, but it isn’t protecting investors. I
strongly urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘no’’ on this amendment.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.

woman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER).

B of House Report 116–237.

man, I rise as the designee for the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. SEAN PAT-
RICK MALONEY) to offer amendment No.
4.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 6, insert after line 5 the following:
‘‘(H) RETAIL INVESTOR DEFINED.—For the
purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘retail
investor’ means any investor that is not an
institutional investor.’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 629, the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. CASTEN) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair,
H.R. 1815 was drafted specifically for
SEC disclosures that are required to be
delivered to or intended or substan-
tially likely to be materially relied on
by retail investors, but not by sophisti-
cated institutional investors like mu-
tual funds or hedge funds.
Representative SEAN MALONEY’s
amendment clarifies that this bill is
intended to protect retail investors.
That is a commonsense amendment,
which allows the bill to achieve our
goal, which is to ensure that mom-and-
pop investors are able to use the disclo-
sures intended specifically for them.
I thank Representative MALONEY for
this amendment, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment simply attempts to define
an unclear and undefined term by mak-
ing reference to another unclear and
undefined term.
For context, let me be clear on where
this comes from. The Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 does not define ei-
ther the term ‘‘retail investor’’ or ‘‘in-
stitutional investor.’’ This amendment
pretends to add clarity, but arguably
further muddies an already confusing
bill by adding a second new undefined
term.
In fact, there are some who believe
that the amendment might actually
expand the bill’s reach, because the
bill, as amended, could be interpreted
to apply to any document designed to
reach anybody other than that ‘‘insti-
tutional investor.’’

We have muddied, not clear goals and
objectives here, and so, I would rhetori-
cally ask, what is an institutional in-
vestor? Is it a small-town investment
manager who is a sole practitioner, but
has set up their own business and now
is, thus, an institution? Does the busi-
ness require multiple employees? Does
it require a large number of employees?
I, for one, am not sure. Does it have a
dollar amount attached to it? It could
be one person, a very wealthy person
investing millions or a whole bunch of
smaller investors, who don’t have mil-
lions, banding together and now they
are suddenly institutional investors.
So let’s just not make H.R. 1815 more
confusing than it already is. I urge my
colleagues to oppose this amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
b 1345
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I
encourage my colleagues to vote for
the amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has
been a living, breathing document; but
in those subsequent years from 1934,
there has never been a definition of ei-
ther ‘‘retail investor’’ or ‘‘institutional
investor,’’ and to hang an amendment
on those terms which are undefined le-
gally is simply a mistake.
So, Mr. Chair, I do not support this
unnecessarily confusing amendment,
and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. CASTEN).
The amendment was agreed to.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIR
The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of
rule XVIII, proceedings will now re-
sume on those amendments printed in
part B of House Report 116–237 on
which further proceedings were post-
poned, in the following order:
Amendment No. 1 by Mr. HUIZENGA of
Michigan.
Amendment No. 2 by Mr. GOTTHEIMER
of New Jersey.
Amendment No. 3 by Mrs. WAGNER of
Missouri.
The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes
the minimum time for any electronic
vote after the first vote in this series.
AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. HUIZENGA
The CHAIR. The unfinished business
is the demand for a recorded vote on
the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA)
on which further proceedings were
postponed and on which the noes pre-
vailed by voice vote.
The Clerk will redesignate the
amendment.
The Clerk redesignated the amend-
ment.

The CHAIR. A recorded vote has been
demanded.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—ayes 188, noes 229,

Mr. BUCHANAN changed his vote
from ‘‘no’’ to ‘‘aye.’’
So the amendment was rejected.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. RICHMOND).
There being no further amendments
under the rule, the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. PIN-
GREE) having assumed the chair, Mr.
RICHMOND, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration
the bill (H.R. 1815) to require the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission, when
developing rules and regulations about
disclosures to retail investors, to con-
duct investor testing, including a sur-
vey and interviews of retail investors,
and for other purposes, and, pursuant
to House Resolution 629, he reported
the bill, as amended by that resolution,
back to the House with sundry further
amendments adopted in the Committee
of the Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
Is a separate vote demanded on any
amendment reported from the Com-
mittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair
will put them en gros.
The amendments were agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
(By unanimous consent, Mr. HOYER
was allowed to speak out of order.)
MOURNING THE PASSING OF THE HONORABLE
ELIJAH CUMMINGS
Mr. HOYER. Today, Mr. Speaker, is a
sad day. It is a sad day for us; it is a
sad day for this institution; and it is a
sad day for America. We have lost a
wonderful human being, a good and de-
cent human being, a human being who
made a difference for this institution,
for all of us who knew him and were his
friend, for his constituents, and for all
Americans. All of us in this House lost
a respected colleague. Many of us lost
a dear, longtime, and good friend.
He came in 1996 to this body, and
every time I ran for a leadership posi-
tion, my friend ELIJAH CUMMINGS nomi-
nated me. The passing this morning of
Chairman ELIJAH CUMMINGS of the
Committee on Oversight and Reform
was a painful shock to all who have
served with him, more, of course, to his
family, Dr. Rockeymoore Cummings,
his wife, and his three children.
Elijah was a prophet of God whose
name means ‘‘my God is the Lord.’’
ELIJAH CUMMINGS was true to his name.
He was a leader for our country and
for our State of Maryland, and we have
the Members, including our favorite
daughter. He was a leader for our
State. He was a leader, like our brother
JOHN LEWIS, for principle, for comity,
and for civility.
He was a quiet man who did not seek
the limelight, but he was not afraid to
step out into the arena and fight hard
for the causes in which he believed
strongly. As all of us know, those
causes were justice, equality, oppor-
tunity, civil rights, education, and
children. He liked to say that children
are the message we send to a future
that we will never see. His parents sent
ELIJAH into the future, and how much
better the future was.
He was beloved by his constituents,
both those in the city of Baltimore and
those in its suburbs. Indeed, ELIJAH
was probably better loved in my dis-
trict than I am. Most of my colleagues
will understand that, of course.
He worked hard, even in his final
days. The Speaker is going to speak,
and I am sure she will say something
about the telephone call she had with
him just days ago, doing the people’s
business. As his health faltered, his
passion for his work did not.
In the days ahead, we will have many
opportunities, of course, to speak
about our friend, ELIJAH, about his pas-
sion for service, his many contribu-
tions to Maryland and our Nation, and
his deep convictions as a moral leader
and a man of decency and love for his
neighbor.
Some of you recall ELIJAH at the
time of great distress in Baltimore—
anger, outbursts. ELIJAH walked among
them as a man of peace and, like no
other person in our State, brought
peace where there was no peace. We
will have opportunities to remember
that. And we have a chance to reflect
on the love he had for his wife, Maya,
and his three children.
Today, in remembering ELIJAH CUM-
MINGS, we have a chance to promote
the vision he held of the people’s House
coming together in a spirit of unity
and purpose. Sadly, today, that pur-
pose is to mourn his passing and re-
member a dear friend who will no
longer be with us as we continue his
work to which he gave his all. But,
hopefully, his example will be with us.
ELIJAH used to say, when he saw con-
flict and confrontation, when he saw
things he thought were not up to the
standards we had set for our country
and for ourselves because of our faith,
our Constitution, and our Declaration,
he would say, ‘‘We are better than
that.’’
As we human beings do things, from
time to time, that are not kind to one
another, not thoughtful, and not re-
spectful to one another, let us say to
ourselves: We are better than that.
That is what ELIJAH said to himself.
Mr. Speaker, in that spirit of unity, I
will be yielding shortly to the Repub-
lican leader to share his reflections.
But first, as I referred to her as Mary-
land’s favorite daughter, I am honored
to yield to the Speaker of the House,
NANCY PELOSI D’ALESANDRO. Now she
would say NANCY D’ALESANDRO PELOSI.
I understand that. We are so proud of
our Speaker.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI).
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, it is a
very disconcerting day for so many of
us here.
I thank Mr. HOYER for bringing us to-
gether to mourn the loss of our dear
friend and colleague, ELIJAH CUMMINGS.
I thank my friend for his beautiful
statement calling forth so many of the
beautiful attributes of ELIJAH CUM-
MINGS.
As the gentleman spoke, I was re-
minded of how he always was a calmer
of the waters. No matter how rough
and tumble things would be, he would
always just calm the waters and reach
out, whether it was across the aisle,
across the issue, across the Capitol, or
down Pennsylvania Avenue.
I know that the people of Baltimore,
the U.S. Congress, and America have
lost the voice of the unsurpassed moral
clarity and truth of our beloved Mr.
Chairman, ELIJAH CUMMINGS. I am per-
sonally devastated by his passing, as I
know many of us are.
We have flowers in his place where he
sat, where we all sought counsel,
learned more, or calmed down and were
lifted up by the wisdom, the gracious-
ness, and the goodness of ELIJAH CUM-
MINGS.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8223
October 17, 2019
In the House, ELIJAH was the North
Star. He was a leader of towering char-
acter and integrity whose stirring
voice and steadfast values pushed the
Congress and the country to give rise
to a higher purpose of why we are here.
His principled leadership as the chair
of the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form was a perfect testament to his
commitment to restoring honesty and
honor to government, and he leaves a
powerful legacy for years to come.
People think of him as that chairman
but meaning so much to him was his
role as a senior member of the Trans-
portation and Infrastructure Com-
mittee. He was always fighting for his
district, for his State of Maryland, and
for the country. He was a powerful
voice for building the infrastructure of
America and for creating good-paying
jobs. He was a working-class guy in
terms of whom he was here to serve.
I was very proud of him as a member
of the U.S. Naval Academy Board of
Visitors. He took great pride in the
Naval Academy, his role on the board,
and Maryland’s role in our national se-
curity. I know we have some Naval
Academy graduates here, and that was
a source of great pride. He said that
you have taken me to a new level of de-
cisionmaking, in terms of national se-
curity.
Chairman CUMMINGS’ story was the
story of America. He was a share-
cropper’s son who dedicated his life to
advancing justice, respecting human
dignity, and—as the gentleman from
Maryland said—ending discrimination.
He believed in the promise of Amer-
ica because he had lived it. He dedi-
cated his life to advancing those values
that safeguard our Republic: justice,
equality, liberty, and fairness.
As our distinguished leader, Mr.
HOYER, said earlier, we were always lis-
tening to ELIJAH. These flowers remind
me of it because of the growth and re-
newal that are there. He said, ‘‘Our
children are the living messages we
send to a future we will never see.’’
He also wanted to build a future that
was worthy of the aspirations of our
children. He always wanted to make
sure that they took with them the val-
ues that nurtured him and that he was
promoting in his public service.
Earlier this year, Chairman CUM-
MINGS asked us: ‘‘When we are dancing
with the angels, the question will be
asked: In 2019, what did we do to make
sure we kept our democracy intact?’’
He is now with the angels, out of
pain.
And Maya said this morning, he
fought the fight right up until the end.
And those of us who communicated
with him—I didn’t know he was this
close. I thought he was coming back in
a few weeks.
But our Members, as I stated to our
Republican colleagues, we had a con-
ference call on Friday, this past Fri-
day, not a full week ago, in which ELI-
JAH, as always, was passionate about
what he believed in, dispassionate
about how he conveyed a plan for how
we would go forward with fairness,
with justice, with dignity, worthy of
the oath of office that we take to the
Constitution, worthy of the vision of
our Founders establishing this institu-
tion, and worthy, again, of the aspira-
tions of our children, his words: mes-
sengers to a future we will never see.
His leadership made a difference in
strengthening our democracy. Again,
during difficult times, let us draw
strength from his righteous words that
the leader has been reminding us of all
day: ‘‘We are better than this. We are
better than this.’’
In the Congress, we will miss his wis-
dom, his dignity, the brilliance of his
mind, the kindness of his heart, the
friendship that meant so much to us
and that we could all call upon.
In Baltimore, we will miss him as a
champion.
May it be a comfort to his wife,
Maya, to whom I conveyed the good
wishes of the Congress this morning,
may it be a comfort to Maya, to his
three children and Chairman CUM-
MINGS’ entire family and, I want to add
to that, his dedicated and devoted
staff, in every capacity—as a Member,
as a chairman, as a member of the
committee, whom he just treated with
such fairness and respect, his staff—
may it be a comfort to them all that so
many mourn their loss and are praying
for them at this sad time and that he
will always be inside of our hearts as
we make decisions about our respon-
sibilities and how we will be account-
able when we are dancing with the an-
gels.
God bless you, darling ELIJAH. We all
love you. We miss you, but we will
never forget you, and your legacy will
live in the Congress of the United
States in this House of Representa-
tives.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
PELOSI), Speaker of the House, for her
remarks.
I know ELIJAH felt very strongly
about her and his support of her and
her leadership and how proud he was
that she was from the city of Balti-
more that he loved so greatly.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from California (Mr. MCCARTHY), my
friend, the minority leader, and an-
other good friend of ELIJAH’s.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my friend for yielding. I thank
him for his words, and I thank the
Speaker.
We lost more than just a Member of
Congress when we lost ELIJAH CUM-
MINGS. As the Speaker spoke of his life,
she talked about him bringing calm-
ness. I want you to reflect for one mo-
ment, when have you ever served in
this body that we have been this calm
and this quiet and this reflective? ELI-
JAH’s work is still good with us right
now.
Chairman CUMMINGS had enormous
presence. As many times he would be
an adversary, he was a respected adver-
sary because he was tough. He had such
a presence on this side of the aisle and
an impression that, when we would sit
inside our steering committee—and
maybe I am breaking the rule; we are
never supposed to talk about what we
say in there. When we would select a
chair or a ranking member, this is the
one committee we weighed who we
went against.
And every time we spoke of selecting
an individual who can rise to the occa-
sion, to be in debate with him, we
would look for somebody who was
strong. And every time someone was
selected, they would come back to be a
very best friend of ELIJAH CUMMINGS.
It is a tough committee. It is a com-
mittee of accountability. It is a com-
mittee of debate. I can’t tell you how
many friends would call me and be in
fear because they got a letter from
CUMMINGS. But he was a man of fair-
ness.
You will know this because, in com-
mittees, at times, you have these de-
bates. But when you are sitting as a
chair and ranking member, what we
would talk about is ELIJAH would share
with us the life lessons, you know what
he would say privately to the chair or
the ranking member on the other side,
what he would say to JIM JORDAN, what
he would say to Trey Gowdy.
Trey shared with me today, he never
stopped talking, even though he left
Congress.
JIM JORDAN shared with me today
that he was talking to ELIJAH just last
week about committee business.
Trey talked about a story.
Trey was pretty tough on one person.
And Trey is good; that prosecutor in
him can get to the point. ELIJAH
turned to him and said: She is not a
government employee. She has a fam-
ily, and she has children. You can be a
little softer next time.
And that hit on his heart.
And what I fear in the world today,
that when they look at us, they get
this persona through cameras and so-
cial media, but it doesn’t show our
character. We are the only ones who
get the window into one another’s
character of how we act. We are the
ones who should share the message.
Because he was so strong in his be-
liefs, I am afraid some people in Amer-
ica won’t know what type of character
he actually had, not as a Member of
Congress and not as a political figure,
but as a person, because that is how I
knew ELIJAH. He was a fighter. So
many times in his life people told him
no, and he would say, yes, he could.
He was a leader, but not in the sense
that America probably thinks as a
Member of Congress. His entire life he
wanted to overturn racial injustice.
A Member shared with me the first
time he got to know him was on a
codel down in Mexico. Most of the peo-
ple on the bus were asleep because it
was one of those long trips, and ELIJAH
sat and talked to him. This Member
was from the South, and he talked
about how his grandparents were there,
but his grandparents moved him away

because they felt he would have a bet-
ter chance just because of the color of
his skin, that he would get a better
education.
ELIJAH was not upset by that. He felt
this country gave him the opportunity.
That is why he wanted to serve.
So, all those who are here, it was an
honor, a fortune, and a privilege to
know him. If you are a freshman, I
hope you took a few moments with
him, because it didn’t matter if you
were a chair or a ranking member or if
you were a Republican or a Democrat,
he would spend that time with you.
I feel I am better for having known
him, and I want you to know, from this
side of the aisle, no matter how hard of
a debate we were in, I have only heard
respect for how he carried out the busi-
ness. We respected him because he was
good. We respected him because he
beat us many times. We respected him
because of what he fought for, he be-
lieved in.
Our deepest prayers go to Maya, be-
cause in those life lessons and in that
window that we get to see, it is not the
easiest to have a family in these jobs.
We have a lot of things pulled on us,
but we knew where his heart stood,
where his family mattered, and what
he continued to believe in.
So, yes, today we lost more than just
a Member, but I hope as the days
progress, as the times change and our
debate gets heated again, that we re-
flect on this moment of calmness, re-
flect on this moment of thinking of one
another, and we reflect on the idea
that, yes, television may give us a dif-
ferent persona of who we are, but, yes,
you and I get to see the window of the
character within each and every one of
us. I think that is what ELIJAH would
want us to do.
So in his honor, let’s find that tomor-
row will be better than today and that
this calmness will last longer than the
next vote.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for his remarks.
Mr. Speaker, in that spirit, I will ask
for a moment of silence. But before I do
that, let me mirror the remarks of the
leader on the other side of the aisle.
A moment of silence will not be
enough to respect the life of ELIJAH
CUMMINGS. What will be enough is we
follow his example for a lifetime—not
for a moment, but for a lifetime—if we
give one another the respect that he
would give to us, if we give one another
the consideration that the leader indi-
cated that he gave to him.
So, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we stand
for a moment of silence and a lifetime
of following an example.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CLY-
BURN). The Chair asks that all Mem-
bers please rise for a moment of silence
in remembrance of our good friend and
colleague, the Honorable Chairman
ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. PIN-
GREE). The question is on the passage
of the bill.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, on that
I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a
5-minute vote.

f
PRAYER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today’s
opening prayer will be offered by Dr.
Robert Lewis, of Fellowship Bible
Church, Little Rock, AR.
The guest Chaplain offered the fol-
lowing prayer:
Let us pray.
Heavenly Father, we give thanks for
this new day and the hope that lies
within it. We have been a blessed na-
tion, not by accident but by this: In
You, God, we trust. Thank You for the
men and women of this distinguished
body, who will again rise to face the
immense challenge that will mark this
day along with the special opportuni-
ties that it holds for good. I pray You
will make this body ready for both.
In these turbulent times, empower
their work with Your Spirit. Give them
a difference making wisdom only You
possess. Protect them from small ambi-
tions. Call each heart here up to the
higher ways of humility, under-
standing, and much needed unity. Help
these leaders seek what is right and
best for all in this Nation: the weak
and the strong, the rich and the want-
ing, the great and the small; and let
their work here today end tonight as a
credit, not a deficit, to our Nation’s
life-giving legacy of liberty and justice
for all.
Bless this Chamber, Father. Make us
better through them, and lead us all
forward in the ways of righteousness
for Your greater glory.
We pray this in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge
of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING

tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).

U.S. SENATE,
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE,
Washington, DC, October 17, 2019.
To the Senate:
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3,
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby
appoint the Honorable JOHN BOOZMAN, a Sen-
ator from the State of Arkansas, to perform
the duties of the Chair.
CHUCK GRASSLEY,
President pro tempore.
Mr. BOOZMAN thereupon assumed
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Arkan-
sas.
f
WELCOMING DR. ROBERT LEWIS
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I
would like to take a moment, first of
all, to thank Chaplain Black for all
that he does here. The Senate is a
much better place as a result of having
him around.
I would also like to take a moment
to thank Dr. Robert Lewis for deliv-
ering the opening prayer in the Senate
today.
Robert and I had the opportunity to
play football together at the Univer-
sity of Arkansas. He was a very good
football player and had the gift of
smack. He would hit you. He had a tre-
mendous work ethic and character, and
we all knew that he would do well in
whatever he decided to do.
Robert is, today, a renowned pastor,
a best-selling author, a passionate
speaker, and a Christian visionary. He
has developed a curriculum that has
reached over 1 million men worldwide
in churches, on college campuses, in
corporate boardrooms, and in correc-
tional facilities.
Robert’s program, the Men’s Frater-
nity, provides men with an encour-
aging process of teaching them how to
live lives of authentic manhood, as
modeled by Jesus Christ and directed
by the Word of God. The program was
designed to help men come together
and strengthen each other through
weekly sessions that combine biblical
teaching and small group interaction.
For 21 years, Robert served as the di-
rectional leader of the Fellowship Bible
Church of Little Rock. During that
time, the church grew from a few hun-
dred members to over 5,000, and it was
widely recognized as being one of the
most innovative and influential
churches in America.
Robert helped to bring Downline,
which is a citywide discipleship min-
istry, to Little Rock, where he con-
tinues to serve as a part-time instruc-
tor. He continues to be involved in his

both sides of the Capitol in expressing
our grief and sadness at the passing of
our House colleague, Chairman ELIJAH
CUMMINGS.
In his over more than two decades in
the House of Representatives, CUM-
MINGS became a living legend in his na-
tive Baltimore. By all accounts, he was
a powerful and passionate voice on the
national stage and was a strong advo-
cate for his neighbors, his district, and
his values. He counted close friends and
admirers from all across the political
spectrum.
The Capitol will lower its flags today
to mark this significant loss and re-
member a life well lived. The Senate
unites our prayers with those in the
House for Maya, ELIJAH’s wife; for his
children; and for all of the colleagues,
friends, and staff who will miss him
greatly.
f
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on an entirely different matter, I was
encouraged to see yesterday’s display
of bipartisan concern in the House of
Representatives for sustaining Amer-
ica’s global leadership and, specifi-
cally, over the damaging impact of
hastily withdrawing that leadership
from Syria.
Back in January, I led a forward-
looking debate here in the Senate on
these very issues. I sponsored an
amendment to S. 1 that earned the sup-
port of a bipartisan supermajority—70
Senators. We went on the record as op-
posing a premature exit from Syria or
Afghanistan and emphasized the need
for sustained American leadership in
the fight against terrorism.
I was disappointed when a number of
leading Democrats, including my coun-
terpart, the Democratic leader, and
most of our colleagues who are running
for President, voted against this bipar-
tisan consensus, but, overall, a huge
majority of the Senate spoke up
strongly.
I know many of us are keen on en-
gaging in these important issues fur-
ther in light of recent events. As the
Senate debates our Middle East policy
and contemplates what action to take,
I believe it is important that we make
a strong, forward-looking, strategic
statement.
For that reason, my preference would
be for something even stronger than
the resolution the House passed yester-
day, which has some serious weak-
nesses. It is so narrowly drafted that it
fails to address the plight of imperiled
Sunni Arab and minority Christian
communities in Syria. It is backward-
looking, and it is curiously silent on
the issue of whether to actually sus-
tain a U.S. military presence in Syria,
perhaps to spare the Democrats from
having to go on the record on this key
question.
So my first preference is for some-
thing stronger than the House resolu-
tion. I look forward to continuing to
engage with my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle as we chart the right
course, and I expect many of us will
have much more to say on the subject
very soon.
f
S.J. RES. 53
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on one final matter, this week, I have
been discussing how Washington Demo-
crats have sought for 3 years to effec-
tively nullify the Trump Presidency.
They have tried to cancel out the vot-
ers’ decision in 2016 and dodge the con-
sequences of Secretary Clinton’s defeat
whether it be through the 3-year-old
impeachment parade that the House
Democrats have been leading or
through the unprecedented delays and
obstruction that has been visited on
the President’s nominations here in
the Senate.
Well, our Democratic colleagues will
today mount yet another effort to fire
up the time machine. They want to
move forward with legislation that
would undo a major regulatory reform
success story of the Trump administra-
tion’s and reopen the Obama adminis-
tration’s disastrous War on Coal. Spe-
cifically, they want to try and revive
the so-called Clean Power Plan, which
is a dangerous, misguided policy that
the Trump administration has rightly
done away with. We will be voting on
this resolution later today.
The basic facts haven’t changed since
this job-killing scheme was first put
forward back in 2014. This relic of the
Obama administration would have fur-
ther buried the producers of affordable
American energy under a mountain of
stifling redtape. It would have created
overlapping local, State, and Federal
standards, unrealistic compliance
deadlines, and would have set up a
Washington bureaucracy that would ef-
fectively root for American energy to
fail. It is no wonder, by one analysis,
that 125,000 jobs would have been on
the chopping block had President
Obama gotten his way.
The workers in my State know better
than anyone the true costs of the last
administration’s misguided War on
Coal. Kentucky workers know what
happens when plants that create jobs
and generate affordable electricity at
the same time are simply shut down.
That is why I have been proud to lead
the fight in ending the regulatory War
on Coal. It is why I wrote every Gov-
ernor in the country in 2015 and raised
my concerns about the Obama adminis-
tration’s dangerous Clean Power Plan
scheme, because, even today, nearly 3
years into an administration that is
not at war with American energy, Ken-
tucky miners continue to feel the ef-
fects of the previous administration’s
policies.
We also know that the full effects of
the Clean Power Plan would have
stretched far beyond coal country. The
ripples of this harmful proposal would
have been felt across the country by
Americans in paying their power bills.
One independent report predicted
that consumers in 40 States, including
Kentucky, would have seen double-
digit percentage increases in their elec-
tricity costs, and by the Obama offi-
cials’ own admissions, the proposal
would have hit low-income and minor-
ity communities the hardest. Let me
say that again: Low-income and minor-
ity populations would have been hit
the hardest by the double-digit elec-
tricity bill increases in four out of
every five States. That is quite a rap
sheet for a Federal policy.
In a nation in which carbon emis-
sions have already been trending down-
ward, this proposal would have sold off
our economic edge to overseas com-
petitors whose emissions are, actually,
steadily climbing. It would have taken
the legs out from under American job
creators while some of the world’s lead-
ing polluters would have continued to
roar right past us. It would have lit-
erally shipped our economic competi-
tiveness to places like China and India.
Here is how experts estimated the ef-
fect of all of this self-inflicted eco-
nomic damage on the climate: a one
one-hundredth-of-1-degree difference by
2050. Here is the impact estimated to
have happened if it had gone forward—
a one one-hundredth-of-1-degree dif-
ference by 2050. Think how deeply you
would have to be in the grip of leftwing
ideology for that trade-off to sound
like a good deal for American families.
Today’s effort to revive this bad pol-
icy is being pushed by the same Senate
Democrats who, overwhelmingly, could
not bring themselves to vote against
something as absurd as the Green New
Deal back in March. Unfortunately, we
know there is a considerable appetite
among Democrats to inflict huge eco-
nomic harm on American workers and
American families just so we can bet-
ter comply with this new green reli-
gion.
But here is the good news for my con-
stituents in Kentucky and for hard-
working Americans across the Nation:
Senate Republicans are on the case,
and we will not let far-left fashions
take precedence over the common good
of our country.
The American people have elected an
administration and a Senate majority
that trusts workers and job creators,
not Washington bureaucracies. We
have spent years cleaning up the mess
of overregulation that the Obama era
has left behind, and we will continue to
stop the Democrats from reenacting
that damaging history.
So I would urge all of my colleagues
to join with us today and oppose these
efforts to nullify a Presidency and take
us backward.
Let’s vote to keep this ill-conceived,
leftwing policy on the shelf, where it
belongs.

REMEMBERING ELIJAH CUMMINGS
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we
woke up this morning to learn with
profound sadness that our friend and
colleague Congressman ELIJAH CUM-
MINGS, the son of sharecroppers who be-
came the chair of the House Oversight
Committee, passed away last night at
the age of 68.
It was the first thing I saw when I
read the paper this morning, and it hit
me like a punch in the stomach.
In his 23 years in Congress, ELIJAH
amassed a legacy that will live on long
after his sudden passing. He served the
people of his Maryland district with
selflessness, passion, and grace.
Since it only happened this morning,
I can’t do justice to the legacy of ELI-
JAH CUMMINGS, but I would like to
share a few reflections, and I know
that my dear friend Senator CARDIN
was close like this—like brothers—with
ELIJAH CUMMINGS, and they had worked
together on so many things for Mary-
land and the country. I know he is here
sharing our deep sadness.
Now, truly, ELIJAH CUMMINGS was not
just a great Congressman. He was a
great man. He had a presence—a com-
manding presence—when he entered
the room, and he could be strong when
he had to be, and he had to be strong
quite often. But he also was always
kind and decent and caring and honor-
able.
It is a rare combination, that inner
strength and that decency and that
kindness. ELIJAH had it. If we had lived
in happier times, maybe the public
would have seen this kind side more
often, but ELIJAH was never one to
shrink from the moment.
I talked to him frequently. We would
talk about the goings-on in the House
or the Senate or the political trivia of
the day. Sometimes we would talk
about Maryland politics. He was an ex-
pert.
ELIJAH was revered by his constitu-
ents and indeed by the entire State of
Maryland. Liberal or conservative,
Democrat or Republican, Black or
White, you went to ELIJAH CUMMINGS
for advice. His loss is an enormous one
for his constituents, for his staff and,
above all, his family. I pray for them
this morning, as I pray for our country
when people like ELIJAH CUMMINGS of
the world are no longer with us.
f
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on
Syria, yesterday, the U.S. military car-
ried out airstrikes to destroy what
only a few weeks ago had been the
headquarters of the American cam-
paign to destroy ISIS in Syria. Nothing
encapsulates the failure of President
Trump’s decision to stand aside for
Erdogan more than the fact that we
are now bombing our own bases rather
than allow them to fall into the hands
of Assad, Erdogan, or Putin.
If Erdogan, Putin, and Assad are such
great allies or no problem, as President
Trump told us yesterday at the White
House, then why do we have to bomb
our own headquarters after American
troops evacuated so it doesn’t fall into
Syrian or Turkish or even Russian
hands? That one thing encapsulates the
absurdity, the awfulness of President
Trump’s lack of policy and erratic, im-
pulsive, and whimsical movements on
the Syrian front.
Yesterday the President said this
withdrawal was a ‘‘strategic move.’’ It
certainly is not that because this is not
the action of a military that carried
out a deliberate withdrawal. It is the
action of a military that was given a
fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants decision of
the President contrary to the rec-
ommendations of the commanders on
the ground.
Donald Trump has the nerve, the
gall, to think he knows more about the
military than these generals who have
served our country for decades. It is ap-
palling. How does America put up with
this? How do our Republican colleagues
put up with this? He doesn’t consult
the generals. What a blunder, and it
seems to be the result of the Presi-
dent’s inability to say no to dictators.
He seems to like a Putin and an
Erdogan and even a Kim more than our
allies. This is also a clear demonstra-
tion of the President’s fecklessness and
recklessness, both, or as my colleague
Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM, and one of
the President’s staunchest allies in
Congress, said, ‘‘I fear that this is a
complete and utter national security
disaster in the making.’’
Yesterday afternoon, congressional
leaders went to the White House, at its
request, to meet with the President
about the rapid disintegration of the
situation in northern Syria. Speaker
PELOSI and I talked about it ahead of
time, and we talked about it with Sen-
ators REED and MENENDEZ as well. We
had a serious purpose: to find out if the
President actually had a plan to con-
tain ISIS and fix the mess precipitated
by his decision to green-light
Erdogan’s military incursion into
Syria.
Alarmingly—alarmingly—President
Trump had no plan. The greatest insult
that occurred in that room was not any
of the name-calling that Trump did. A
far greater insult to America, to all of
us, was the lack of any policy guid-
ance, any policy decisions, any direc-
tion from the President and his top na-
tional security advisers on how to con-
tain ISIS.
I reminded the President that as two
New Yorkers, we probably knew better
than most the damage a small band of
terrorists can do, even from a half a
world away. I asked: What is your plan
to prevent ISIS from regrouping and
resurging? He didn’t have one. Sec-
retary of Defense Mark Esper didn’t
have a plan.
After we pushed them and pushed
them, I said: Who is going to take care
of all these prisoners? The President
said there were 70,000 ISIS prisoners
and their families. Who is going to
take care of them, make sure they
don’t escape, as some have already?
They finally said: Well, the Syrians
and the Turks will do that. So I asked
the group if they had any intelligence
or assurances that the Turks and Syr-
ians would do a decent job. Secretary
Esper himself said there was no evi-
dence of that.
This is amazing. Terrorists whom we
have spent a decade fighting—we have
spent billions of dollars and lost lives
to fight them—are finally in prison.
The Kurds are guarding them. The
Kurds are leaving, understandably, be-
cause they have to fight the Turks
now. What is the plan? There isn’t any,
except to rely on Syrians, Turks, who
have not even close to the interest we
have in curbing ISIS.
Assad is much more interested in
gaining back his Syrian homeland.
Erdogan is focused on hurting the
Kurds, whom he is fanatically against.
So they are not going to pay much at-
tention to ISIS.
It was appalling, just appalling.
President Trump has stepped aside for
Putin, Assad, and Erdogan. Our allies,
the Kurds, are being slaughtered as a
result of our betrayal. Most impor-
tantly, as Secretary Mattis said, ‘‘if we
don’t keep the pressure on [in Syria],
ISIS will resurge. It’s absolutely a
given that they will come back.’’
The President didn’t like hearing
Mattis’s words, but all of America
should. He is one of the most respected
military minds, one of the most re-
spected leaders on both sides of the
aisle—liberals, Independents, conserv-
atives. Here is what he said, again re-
peating:

S5858 October 17, 2019
[I]f we don’t keep the pressure on [in
Syria], ISIS will resurge. It’s absolutely a
given that they will come back.
So make no mistake, the President’s
incompetence, his impulsiveness, his
erraticness has made Americans less
safe—Americans here in our homeland.
Congress, today, must make the fact
clear to the President in a bipartisan
fashion.
We have the opportunity, my col-
leagues. The House passed a resolution
condemning the President’s decision by
an overwhelming vote of 354 to 60. That
means the vast majority of House Re-
publicans—129 to be exact—condemned
the President’s decision in Syria. Lead-
er MCCARTHY, Whip SCALISE, and No. 3
CHENEY all voted for it. They are as
loyal to President Trump as anybody,
but they saw the danger, the real dan-
ger. Today the Senate should, and I
hope will, follow suit. We can quibble
about the language, but I have no
doubt we can agree on the basic mes-
sage, and there is no reason we can’t
vote on a Senate resolution today.
Time is of the essence. To say, well,
I would like to add this word or add
this sentence, as Kurds are being
slaughtered, as ISIS terrorists are es-
caping—no, no, no. No, no, no. We
should move to the House bill imme-
diately because we all know there is
only one person who can reverse this,
and that is the President. The greatest
ability to make him reverse is an over-
whelming message from the Repub-
lican side—House and Senate—that
this is wrong. He doesn’t hear that pub-
licly too often from our Republican
friends. He has heard it from the
House, correctly and courageously.
Please, my friends, my Republican
friends in the Senate, let’s put politics
aside. Today let’s vote the House bill
passed yesterday by them. There is no
time to waste. Time is of the essence
because the President still doesn’t get
it. Our meeting at the White House
demonstrated that to all who were
present. Hopefully, an overwhelming
bipartisan vote in the Senate will
break through to him. I strongly,
strongly—in the strongest of terms—
urge my friend Leader MCCONNELL and
our Republican colleagues to allow a
vote on the Syrian resolution today.
Security, justice, fairness demand no
less.
f
S.J. RES. 53
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now
on climate, as Senator CARDIN well
knows, later the Senate will vote on
his resolution of disapproval to repeal
the Trump administration’s so-called
affordable clean energy rule. This is
one of the few opportunities where the
minority can force a vote on the Sen-
ate floor, and there may be no more
worthy an issue than protecting our
environment.
Four years ago, the Obama adminis-
tration put in place new standards and
safeguards for CO2 and fossil fuel emis-
sions from powerplants—the first of
their kind intended to meet the threat
of climate change. Earlier in July, by
employing shady science, the Trump
administration so violently obliterated
these safeguards protecting our globe,
our world, and frankly a lot of the for-
ests in my home State of New York. In
its place, the Trump administration
enacted a new rule that will allow big
polluters to wreck our air, dirty our
water, and poison our Earth with little
or no accountability.
Thanks to this new rule, common-
sense limits on carbon emissions have
been blurred, and deadlines for imple-
menting the reductions have now been
tripled or even quadrupled, but time is
running out for the United States to
meet the existential threat posed by
climate change. That is why this rule
is such a grave mistake.
Thankfully, in this case, the minor-
ity can do something under the Con-
gressional Review Act. We are allowed
to overturn some of the rules this ad-
ministration unilaterally put in place.
Later this morning, we will vote on
Senator CARDIN’s resolution of dis-
approval, which, if passed, will repeal
the Trump’s administration’s destruc-
tive rule and reinstitute the safeguards
that were originally in place.
Our Republican colleagues have a
choice. They can either stop the roll-
back of lifesaving environmental pro-
tections or they can side with energy
companies that put their fortunes
ahead of our future. The choice is
theirs.
f
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, one
final note. Today marks 1,000 days of
President Trump’s time in office. If we
were to summarize his administration
over the last 21⁄2 years in a single
phrase, it would be this: broken prom-
ises to working people.
When Candidate Trump ran for office,
he promised to drain the swamp, but
after 1,000 days as President, this place
is the swampiest it has ever been, with
conflicts of interest crippling this ad-
ministration and inexperienced billion-
aires running our government.
Candidate Trump promised health in-
surance for everybody, but after 1,000
days as President, costs are higher,
coverage is skimpier, and his adminis-
tration is suing to repeal the
healthcare we have in place and send
prices skyrocketing for millions.
President Trump promised a tax bill
that would be a middle-class miracle,
but the only miracle this has been has
been to corporate America, which uses
it for stock buybacks instead of in-
creasing salaries for their workers, in-
creasing their investments in plant and
equipment. So much of these tax
breaks went to buybacks. Shame.
One thousand days in, President
Trump has failed to follow through on
promise after promise to working
Americans, but he isn’t the only one at
fault. Democrats have fought to do the
work of the American people, but as
the House passes things, Leader
MCCONNELL and my Senate Republican
colleagues have simply turned this
Chamber into a legislative graveyard,
where good ideas that would help the
middle class and those trying to get to
the middle class just come to die.
We could be reauthorizing the Vio-
lence Against Women Act; we could be
voting on election security; we could
be voting on background checks, but
Leader MCCONNELL has buried hun-
dreds of House bills in his legislative
graveyard.
After 1,000 days since President
Trump took office, he and his Repub-
lican colleagues have made clear whose
side they are on. If you are ultrarich,
you are very powerful, you have great
connections, it has been a great few
years, but for everyone else, it has been
a string of disappointing, broken, and
heartbreaking promises. Come next
year, the American people will have a
chance to vote for real change.
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING ELIJAH CUMMINGS
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as
the senior Senator from Maryland, I
want to comment on the remarks by
Leader SCHUMER about the great loss
we had that we learned about early
this morning—the death of Congress-
man ELIJAH CUMMINGS. I found out
about this as I awoke this morning. It
is a sad day for Baltimore, for Mary-
land, and for our country.
Two days ago, I had a chance to talk
with Maya Rockeymoore Cummings,
Congressman CUMMINGS’ wife, to in-
quire as to how the Congressman was
doing. She explained to me that he was
still in the hospital but he was using
every ounce of energy he had to carry
out his responsibilities as chairman of
the Oversight Committee and as a
Member of the House of Representa-
tives. We all know that he used his en-
ergy every day on behalf of the people
he represented.
Our Nation has lost one of the great
champions for social justice. What a
powerful voice he was for those whose
voices would otherwise not have been
heard. It is a great loss. It is a great
loss for the people of Baltimore—his
record of accomplishment on behalf of
our city and our region is well known—
and it is a personal loss for me.
I first got to know ELIJAH CUMMINGS
when he was elected to the Maryland
General Assembly. I was speaker of the
house. I recognized that here was a per-
son coming in with incredible talent. I
gave him an opportunity to use that
talent, and he used it so effectively on
behalf of the people of his district as a
member of the Maryland General As-
sembly.
Congressman CUMMINGS and I have a
lot in common. We both attended the
same public high school in Baltimore
City, Baltimore City College High
School—different years. He graduated
from the University of Maryland Law
School, and I also graduated from the

We served together in the Maryland
General Assembly, and we served to-
gether in the House of Representatives.
God gave him the talent to commu-
nicate like no one I have heard. There
was incredible passion in his voice. I
had the opportunity to see firsthand
what he was able to accomplish on be-
half of the people. What a legacy. He
used every moment. He achieved the
high position of chairman of the Over-
sight Committee but never lost his
sense of purpose for the people he rep-
resented. He went home to Baltimore
every night. You could see him in the
community every day at schools and at
church. He never lost the passion for
the people he represented.
What a legacy he has left for all of
us. We can’t fill the void that has been
created by Congressman CUMMINGS’
passing, but all of us need to step up
and help carry out that legacy of pub-
lic service. It is a terrible loss for the
people of our community and a terrible
loss for our Nation.
Our prayers go out to Maya
Rockeymoore Cummings and his fam-
ily in this incredibly difficult time. We
will commit ourselves to carrying on
the legacy of a great American, our
friend ELIJAH CUMMINGS.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip.
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, be-
fore I begin, I, too, want to join with
my colleagues who have preceded me
and just say how sad I was to hear of
the death of ELIJAH CUMMINGS. We
joined the House together. He got there
a little before I did in a special election
in 1996. I came in January of 1997. I al-
ways admired his fire and his dedica-
tion. He was a fierce advocate for his
constituents and for the causes he be-
lieved in. The House will be a lesser
place for his absence.
Our prayers are with his family and
all those who had the opportunity to
know him, his constituents, those he
represented in Baltimore and the State
of Maryland who are going to mourn
his loss today and miss his presence for
many, many days in the future.
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE
AGREEMENT
Madam President, farmers and ranch-
ers have gotten some good news on the
trade front in recent weeks with the
signing of a trade deal with Japan.
U.S. farmers depend on access to the
Japanese market. It is the fourth larg-
est market for U.S. agricultural pro-
ducers. This agreement will remove
barriers to the sale of a variety of prod-
ucts, from cheese to sweet corn, beef,
pork, and wheat.
While this is very good news for
farmers and ranchers, we have a lot
more work to do on the trade front to
help our ag community and to increase
demand for American agricultural
products around the world, and we
should start by passing the United
States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade
Agreement. Canada and Mexico are the
No. 1 and No. 2 markets for American
agricultural products, and preserving
and expanding access to these markets
is key to improving the economic out-
look for America’s farmers. Over a year
ago, the administration finished nego-
tiating a strong deal with these coun-
tries that will help boost our strug-
gling agricultural economy.
To start with, the United States-
Mexico-Canada Agreement will provide
farmers with certainty about what
these important markets are going to
look like going forward. One of the big-
gest challenges facing farmers on the
trade front right now is the uncer-
tainty about what markets around the
world are going to look like. The
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment will give farmers and ranchers
clarity on what trade is going to look
like with these two key trading part-
ners.
In addition to providing certainty
and preserving American access for
American farmers and ranchers, the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment makes a number of improve-
ments to the status quo. Of particular
interest to South Dakota are the
agreement’s dairy provisions. If you
drive the I–29 corridor north of Brook-
ings, SD, you can see firsthand the
major dairy expansion South Dakota
has experienced over the past several
years. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment will preserve U.S. dairy farmers’
role as a key dairy supplier to Mexico,
and it will substantially expand mar-
ket access in Canada. The U.S. Inter-
national Trade Commission estimates
that the agreement will boost U.S.
dairy exports by more than $277 mil-
lion.
The agreement will also expand mar-
ket access for U.S. poultry and egg pro-
ducers. It will make it easier for pro-
ducers to export wheat to Canada and
much more.
I have just focused on the benefits for
farmers. In fact, the United States-
Mexico-Canada Agreement will benefit
almost every sector of our economy,
from the automobile industry to dig-
ital trade and e-commerce. It will cre-
ate 176,000 jobs, and it will raise wages
for workers.
Given the major benefits not only for
farmers but for the economy as a
whole, why hasn’t Congress passed this
agreement yet? That is a good ques-
tion, and the answer really is quite
simple. By law, the House of Rep-
resentatives has to take up the agree-
ment first, but the House has unfortu-
nately been more focused on political
theater of late than on collaborating
on measures that would actually help
American families, and unfortunately
it doesn’t look like that is going to
change.
I heard the Democratic leader down
here earlier sort of attacking the cur-
rent administration for not doing
enough on this or that. Well, the fact
is, if you look at the economic statis-
tics over the past couple of years, they

are pretty remarkable. Unemployment
is at a historically low rate—31⁄2 per-
cent. Those are numbers we haven’t
seen in a very long time—about 50
years, as a matter of fact. The number
of jobs that have been created since the
President took office is about 6.4 mil-
lion jobs. In fact—a very important
data point—the number of people look-
ing for work juxtaposed against the
number of job openings in our econ-
omy—for the 17th month in a row, we
have more jobs available—about 7.3
million jobs available—than those peo-
ple looking for work—about 5.9 million
people. That is a historically sort of
unprecedented, if you will, statistic.
So if you look at the overall econ-
omy, things are in the right place.
They are moving in the right direction.
Wages are up—the highest level in a
decade. The American people’s pocket-
books, the things they care about, the
things they talk about over the kitch-
en table in terms of their wages, their
jobs, their prospects, their certainty
about the future—those things have all
improved over the past couple of years
because of the policies this administra-
tion has put in place, coupled with the
work this Congress has done to try to
create conditions that are favorable to
economic growth.
What does that mean? Well, his tax
policy. We have cut tax rates for indi-
viduals and families. We have cut tax
rates for small businesses that are try-
ing to expand. We allowed them to ac-
celerate their cost recovery. Those are
both key incentives when it comes to
investment and expansion. And we
have seen the results of that.
We have seen regulatory changes
made by the administration—in some
cases cooperating and coupled with the
steps we have taken here in the Con-
gress—that have lessened the burden
for businesses that are trying to invest
and grow and expand and create more
jobs.
If you look at the energy changes,
energy policy, we have become energy
independent—something that a decade
ago or two decades ago, nobody ever
anticipated was possible. As a nation,
we are now actually an exporter of en-
ergy—a remarkable change over a
short period of time. I would argue
that is largely due to changes in policy
that have enabled and encouraged that
kind of investment in energy, regu-
latory changes that have lessened the
regulatory burden and made it less ex-
pensive and less difficult to create jobs
in this country rather than more ex-
pensive and more difficult, which is
what we particularly saw in the past
administration, and lowered the tax
burden in a way that provides incen-
tives for people to invest, to grow their
company, to pay better wages, and to
add jobs.
Those are the types of policy changes
that have been made that have resulted
in the economic data and statistics we
are looking at today. They are not just
data and statistics; they are actually
being felt by people across this coun-
try. So it begs the question as to why,
then, another step that we could take
on that road to economic progress
hasn’t been taken yet. Why, 320 days
after the President signed the U.S.-
Canada-Mexico Free Trade Agreement,
has that not been taken up and passed
by the House of Representatives? I
would argue that if they would take
that up and send it to the Senate, we
would vote on it here. We would pass
it. We would send it to the President.
He would sign it into law, and farmers
and ranchers in places like South Da-
kota and other agricultural States
across this country would get the ben-
efit from that. And it is not just farm-
ers and ranchers. As I mentioned ear-
lier, it is pretty much every sector of
our economy. It is manufacturing. It is
digital.
There are benefits in this trade deal
that translate into a stronger, more ro-
bust economy that will keep this ex-
pansion going forward and will con-
tinue to create these good-paying jobs
and higher wages and create that bet-
ter standard of living and quality of
life for people in this country. The rea-
son it hasn’t moved is because it is up
to the House of Representatives. They
have all the control on this. The
Speaker of the House can move this
whenever she wants to. What they are
trying to do now is renegotiate the
deal all over again.
Unfortunately, they are very much
obsessed at the moment with other
types of activities in the House. If you
look at what is happening over there
right now, it doesn’t look like that is
going to change anytime soon. With
even the Speaker of the House joining
the far left’s now impeachment cru-
sade, I don’t think it is likely that
Democrats are going to wake up one
morning and decide they should spend
less time on partisan politics and more
time working with Republicans to pass
real solutions for the American people.
But I do hope they will not destroy this
trade agreement. There are thousands
of farmers in my State of South Da-
kota and around the country who are
waiting for the relief that the United
States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade
Agreement would bring.
Irrespective of what the distractions
are in the House of Representatives at
the moment and much of the partisan
rush toward impeachment that is un-
derway there, I hope they will figure
out a way to multitask and will do
what they should have done a long
time ago, and that is to pick up this
free-trade deal, pass it through the
House of Representatives, send it to
the U.S. Senate, where we can pass it,
and send it to the President, where it
can be signed into law, and the Amer-
ican people can continue to see the
benefits of policies that are good for
this economy, that will create more
growth in our country, faster growth in
our economy, better paying jobs, and a
better quality of life for people not just
in South Dakota but all across Amer-
ica.

DEFENSE SPENDING BILL
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
come to the floor today to discuss the
current partisan blockade. It is a
blockade of critical military funding
for our troops at home and abroad.
Last month, Senate Democrats
blocked a key vote on the defense
spending bill. We need to pass this bill
to fully fund the Defense Department.
By blocking the bill, Democrats are de-
nying America’s troops the pay raises
that they have earned and that they
deserve.
To add insult to injury, both parties
in both Houses agreed a couple of
months ago to give the troops this
raise. We did it more than 2 months
ago. In fact, it was part of the bipar-
tisan budget deal that was signed in
August.
By moving the Defense spending bill,
Republicans are keeping their promises
to our all-volunteer American force.
Still, Democrats have broken their
promise to the troops.
Why on Earth would the Democrats
want to play political games with the
paychecks of our troops? Under the
harshest conditions, these brave men
and women defend our cherished free-
doms 365 days a year. America’s serv-
icemembers—our servicemembers—
help keep us safe. They keep us strong,
and they keep us, as a Nation, pros-
perous. Without question, they deserve
our full support, and that support
should be bipartisan. Why it isn’t right
now is beyond me.
Recently, I had the privilege of vis-
iting Wyoming troops, our Wyoming
National Guard. We have a very large
deployment, our largest in 10 years.
They are serving in Kuwait, in the
United Arab Emirates, and in Kosovo.
We have troop members serving, as
well, in Afghanistan.
We have about 1,500 members in the
Wyoming National Guard, and, right
now, about 400 of them are serving
overseas. They are from towns like
Casper, Cheyenne, Guernsey, Laramie,
Sheridan, Lovell, Moorcroft,
Wheatland, and brothers from Sheridan
and Casper. I met with all of them.
Some 370 Wyoming Guard members are
currently serving in Afghanistan, the
Middle East, and in Europe. It is our
largest deployment in a decade.
I was honored to spend time with
these dedicated servicemembers from
my home State. First, I visited the
115th Field Artillery Brigade Forward
in the United Arab Emirates. It is in
the desert across from the Strait of
Hormuz. From there, I traveled to Ku-
wait to meet with our 2nd Battalion,
300th Field Artillery. My father-in-law,
Bob Brown, was a member of this group
during Korea. He had also served in
World War II, as I know, Mr. President,
your father was part of the D-day inva-
sion. I finished visiting with the troops
in Kosovo, the C Company, 1st Bat-
talion, 297th Infantry Regiment in

Kosovo, up near the Serbian border. In
service to our country, these soldiers
now find themselves far from home,
and we owe it to them to give them the
raise that they have earned and that
they deserve.
You know, before I left, I gave every
one of our soldiers a challenge coin. It
is a challenge coin for me, as a Sen-
ator, and it is something I learned
about through the military. It is some-
thing you give to somebody for cama-
raderie and a job well done. The coin
shows the Wyoming iconic cowboy sit-
ting on a bucking bronco. I gave it to
each one of them saying: You are from
Wyoming, you are a cowboy, and cow-
boys never quit and never complain,
and neither will the U.S. military.
So when it comes to a raise, they are
not quitting, and they are not com-
plaining. It seems to me that it is the
Democrats who have quit. The Demo-
crats have quit. They have gone back
on their word to approve the pay raise
that they approved a couple of months
ago and now are blocking us moving
forward with this piece of legislation.
You know, the troops I met invited
the cowboy spirit. They love to see it.
They don’t need to see it for long be-
cause they have a lot to do. They are
working 7 days a week, 24 hours a day,
and 365 days a year. They wanted to
talk about what is happening at home.
They wanted to talk about Wyoming
football. They wanted to talk about
the hunting season. They wanted to
talk about the weather at home, where
we have already had snow. The day I
was in one of the locations, it was 108
degrees, and the heat index was higher
than that, and they are, of course, in
full uniform. They are there doing the
job of keeping us safe and keeping us
free, and they deserve the pay raise
that they have earned.
They are on the frontlines. They are
defending our freedoms. They are doing
it every day.
I had a meal with them, as you see
here right now, visiting with these men
and women. It is a time for camara-
derie. We talked about the challenges
they are facing overseas.
I toured each of their bases. They
know that the world is a very dan-
gerous place in which they are living
and serving, and they know what is
happening in the threats to Iran, which
to this group was only a little over 100
miles away, across the Strait of
Hormuz.
Look, clearly, the best way to pro-
tect Americans at home is to keep up
the pressure on our enemies abroad.
Our presence there is restraining evil
in the region. That is why our troops
need our full support, and they need it
right now. They shouldn’t be placed at
a point where they have to tolerate and
wait for the Democrats to come back
to the table and come to an agreement
that they had reached and made prom-
ises on earlier this year.
With growing threats from abroad,
the Defense funding bill delivers crit-
ical resources that our military needs
to keep us safe. One thing is crystal
clear from my visit: The best way to
honor our troops is to honor our com-
mitments to them.
So let’s give these men and women in
uniform the raise that they have
earned, that they deserve, that they
are entitled to, and let’s give our
troops the state-of-the-art tools they
need to protect the American people in
a dangerous world. It is time for Demo-
crats to lift their hold on this blockade
that they have had on our Defense
funding bill. We must work together, in
a bipartisan way, to complete the reg-
ular Defense appropriations process
and fully fund our military, as our Na-
tion demands and our troops certainly
deserve.
I yield the floor.

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, last
month, both the Senate and the House
of Representatives resolved, on a bipar-
tisan basis, to terminate the Presi-
dent’s declaration of a national emer-
gency along our southern border. I was
proud to lead the charge before this
body to terminate that declaration—a
declaration the President is using to
raid congressionally appropriated mili-
tary construction funds to build this
border wall. Plain and simple, the
President’s emergency declaration is
an end-run around Congress’s spending
powers and the Constitution.
Last week, a Federal district judge
agreed and concluded that the Presi-
dent’s declaration is ‘‘unlawful.’’ Arti-
cle I, section 9, of the Constitution
could not be clearer. It reads: ‘‘No
Money shall be drawn from the Treas-
ury, but in Consequence of Appropria-
tions made by Law. . . .’’
The Founders gave Congress the
power to appropriate—the power of the
purse. This is one of the most con-
sequential powers. Congress has this
power to make sure that decisions
about how public dollars are spent have
widespread support and are not the
product of an extreme minority, let
alone one man.
Our power to appropriate is part of
the system of checks and balances
built into our Constitution. The
Founders made sure that the three
branches of government exercised their
own separate and limited powers, and
they made sure that no one branch and
no one person could exercise too much
power, especially over the use of tax-
payer money.
The President’s emergency declara-
tion is an unconstitutional power grab.
Congress has not fully funded his re-
quests for border wall funding. We set
different budget priorities. Our prior-
ities include the $3.6 billion worth of
127 military construction projects
across 23 States, 3 Territories, and 20
countries, and the President canceled
them.
But this President will not accept
Congress’s judgment or our constitu-
tional authority. His emergency dec-
laration is an exercise of power that is
just not his under the Constitution.
Our system of checks and balances
only works if each branch has the will
to check the other branch if there is
encroachment. We have seen some good
bipartisan pushback, but this is the
point where we need more of that. It is
up to Congress, the legislative branch,
to guard our constitutional authority
and to exercise the will to do so.
The President has now vetoed
Congress’s resolution, and it is up to
this body to assert our constitutional
authority and override that veto. Not
only is a fundamental constitutional
principle at stake, but the President’s
emergency declaration has real life im-
pacts—impacts to our national secu-
rity and impacts to the 23 States whose
projects are now gone.
My home State of New Mexico is one
of those 23 States. We are home to two
military bases that will be hit by the
President’s raid on military construc-
tion projects to fund his wall.
Scuttled is an $85 million project at
Holloman Air Force Base that would
improve drone pilot training facilities
that are aging, have sinkholes, and bat
infestation. Training our military to
pilot drones is mission critical in this
day and age. The Air Force is battling
a shortage of these pilots.
At White Sands Missile Range, a $40
million project designed to replace an
aging and fire-damaged information
systems facility has been cut. This
project was to prepare the range to
take on the next generation of missiles
and weapons testing, including future
hypersonic testing.
Twenty-two other States are losing
military construction projects, from
Alabama to Arizona, North Carolina to
Texas, and Maine to Florida. In Utah,
the Air Force has sought a new control
center at Hill Air Force Base to replace
‘‘structurally deficient’’ and dilapi-
dated World War II-era warehouses for
mission control. In Louisiana, the Air
National Guard sought to replace an
aircraft parking ramp in a New Orleans
facility that exposes the public to an
‘‘unacceptable risk’’ of being impacted
by an explosive accident.
In Indiana, Army servicemembers
have worked in violation of safety
standards for handling explosives and
need additional space for munitions. In
Kentucky, the military seeks to repair
‘‘substandard, deficient, inadequate,
and undersized facilities’’ at a middle
school at Fort Campbell that ‘‘impair
the overall education program’’ for the
children of servicemembers.
Not only is New Mexico one of the
States hit by the President’s canceling
important military construction
projects, but we are one of four States
that borders Mexico. We are ground
zero for the President’s border wall and
the havoc it will wreak on our commu-
nities, our way of life, the local econo-
mies, landowners, and the environ-
ment. New Mexico and Mexico share a
180-mile border. This border passes

through three counties—Dona Ana,
Luna, and Hidalgo—that are home to 11
percent of our State’s population. A
majority of the population in those
counties is Hispanic. We have vibrant
communities along the border and near
the border, including our second larg-
est city, Las Cruces, 45 minutes from
Mexico.
We have two ports of entry—in Co-
lumbus and Santa Teresa—that are
bustling with commerce, international
trade, and hundreds who cross the bor-
der daily to visit family and friends, to
go to school, and to shop.
I know our border communities. I can
tell you for a fact, there is no justifica-
tion for the diversion of military con-
struction funding away from our troops
and to this wall.
Now, I support smart border security
and have voted many times to fund
smart investment. New Mexico knows
what real border security is: well-fund-
ed, well-trained, adequate resources;
mobile assets; surveillance technology
combined with well-staffed ports of
entry that welcome commerce, visi-
tors, and also asylum-seekers seeking
refuge from horrific persecution.
The President’s wall, at upward of $25
million per mile, is not a smart invest-
ment. It is antiquated and is not de-
signed for today’s challenges. This
wasteful approach contrasts to the
sound investment we made in the Co-
lumbus port of entry. Commerce, per-
sonal vehicle traffic, and foot traffic
have increased exponentially over the
years. Customs and Border Protection
needed more secure facilities. We
pushed to expand and update this New
Mexico port. For $90 million, we great-
ly enhanced border security and added
to economic growth. Now, that is a
wise investment of taxpayer dollars.
In New Mexico, we are concerned
about the land grab underway by this
administration. They are pushing to
expropriate private lands for the Presi-
dent’s wall, and there are lots of land-
owners who don’t want their lands cut
in half or made unusable.
We can’t get answers from the ad-
ministration about what they are
doing, and so Senator HEINRICH and I,
along with Senator SCHUMER and Sen-
ator DURBIN, requested the Govern-
ment Accountability Office to inves-
tigate the number of citizens who could
have their land seized, the cost of prop-
erty acquisitions, and the time it will
take. I am pleased the GAO has opened
an inquiry. Not only is there concern
that the Trump administration will
skirt eminent domain laws, but there
is a real threat that environmental
laws will be tossed out the window in
the administration’s rush to fulfill the
President’s campaign promise to build
500 miles of wall.
The wall would run through hundreds
of miles of untouched, pristine lands
that are home to wildlife like antelope,
deer, and javelina. A wall will tear up
these lands and their vegetation, cause
erosion and flooding, and cut off migra-
tory paths for wildlife.
The Department of the Interior is set
to transfer 500 acres of lands in New
Mexico, Arizona, and California to the
Army for the President’s wall, and 213
of those acres are in my State. The De-
partment of the Interior is supposed to
protect our natural resources, not en-
danger them with a border wall that
will compromise their ecological value,
destroy habitat connectivity, and harm
wildlife.
The President’s wall and his divisive
rhetoric toward immigrants is deeply
offensive to New Mexicans. We have
strong family, cultural, and economic
ties to Mexico. We are a proud multi-
cultural State. Our diversity does not
divide us; it defines us. It is our
strength.
This body holds the power of the
purse, not the President. Now is the
time to affirm this constitutional
power and affirm the appropriations
decisions we have made for our own
States and the Nation.
We should override the President’s
veto and make sure that legitimate na-
tional security interests are protected
by seeing that the 127 military con-
struction projects go forward on sched-
ule.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, the next
vote, the vote we will take in less than
an hour, is a vote that would exercise
the Congressional Review Act, of which
I am a supporter. The idea that we
should use the Congressional Review
Act is a good thing for us to look at
what any administration does and de-
termine if that is the right way to go.
Today, I certainly intend to vote to
maintain the position that the admin-
istration has had on the affordable
clean energy rule. This is a rule that
will have a very positive impact on our
State, just like the rule that it re-
places would have a very negative im-
pact. We are in the top five coal-using
States for energy in our State.
With the Obama administration’s
rule, the massive energy regulations
would have imposed billions of dollars
in compliance costs that would have
been passed along every single time
that someone harvests a crop, flips on
a light switch, shops for groceries, or
walks into the door at work. Under the
Obama-era rules, families in Missouri
would have faced double-digit utility
price increases; in fact, the average
Missourian’s average utility rate would
have doubled in approximately a dec-
ade. A vote for this Congress review act
would put that rule into effect, as op-
posed to the rule that replaces it.
These rules always have good titles.
The current rule that the Trump ad-
ministration has put into place, the Af-
fordable Clean Energy Rule, would re-
place the clean power rule. That is sig-
nificant. They both propose to do the
same thing. One rule states they will
have clean power; the other rule states
it will have clean energy. The dif-
ference in the title is actually the dif-
ference in effect, which is one proposes
affordable clean energy. It doesn’t
seem like a very tough decision: You
either want affordable clean energy or
clean energy that, in my view, is clear-
ly not affordable.
What the new rule would do would be
to look at individual sources of energy
and decide from a selection of things
that can be done, what can be done at
those individual sources.
I was on this floor many times talk-
ing about this rule prior to the 2016
elections. It had been held in abeyance
by courts that said, no, it went too far.
The administration didn’t have the
ability to do what they were trying to
do. When I was on the floor all those
times talking about what this rule
would do to our State and our economy
and similar things all over the country,
what I said was, the next time you
write your utility check, just write it
out of your checkbook again because,
within a decade, you would be paying
twice as much in Missouri for utilities
as you are paying right now. The cost
would have gone up, and it would have
happened quickly.
Thankfully, President Trump and the
administration—with the support,
frankly, I believe, today, of Senate Re-
publicans—will have charted a new
course resulting in huge strides toward
American energy independence. We are
doing that on other fronts. In fact, Sep-
tember and August were the first 2
months in 37 years that we have been a
net exporter of energy, not an importer
of energy. Energy self-sufficiency is
important, particularly when there is
an all-of-the-above strategy with oil,
natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar as
a part of the portfolio of energy that
needs to grow, but doesn’t need to grow
in a way that cripples American fami-
lies when they try to pay their bills or
when they try to get a job. To become
a net exporter of energy, we have done
all those things while we were still cut-
ting emissions. Carbon dioxide emis-
sions in the power industry are down 28
percent since 2005, without the Clean
Power Plan ever having gone into ef-
fect.
The EPA’s Affordable Clean Energy
Rule strikes exactly the right bal-
ance—in my view and, I believe, today
in the view of a majority of my col-
leagues—between reducing emissions
and ensuring that Americans can still
continue to have access to reliable, af-
fordable energy.
For many families, the cost of energy
is one of the biggest items to think
about when they think about their
budget. In fact, for many families,
there is not much to think about. You
pay whatever you are paying for your
housing, then you pay your utility bill,
and you see what is left over. The lux-
ury of having a technical budget with
how you are going to do all the things
your family would like to do doesn’t
happen all too often now. It would hap-
pen much less often if the utility bills
are twice what they are today.
The action we take here today, sup-
porting the affordable energy rule and

walking away from the clean power
rule, will make a difference for those
families. It makes a difference in the
utility bill at home, and it makes a dif-
ference in the utility bill at work. Lots
of jobs simply just don’t work at twice
the cost of today’s utility bills. It is a
foolish rule and has been properly re-
placed with a rule that makes sense. I
urge my colleagues to maintain the
rule we are headed to, rather than the
one we are running away from.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come
to the floor today because our Nation
is at a crossroads that strikes at the
heart of our democracy. The increas-
ingly outrageous actions of this Presi-
dent and his administration have
brought us to this moment where we,
as a nation, must make a decision
about who we are, what we stand for,
and what kind of behavior we will
allow at the highest levels of our gov-
ernment.
As we continue down this road paved
by the President’s reckless actions and
his complete disregard for our Nation’s
laws and democratic norms, I want to
take a moment to step back and talk
about how we got here and how much is
truly at stake for our country and our
democracy if we don’t get this right.
Let’s start by considering what we
know for sure. The President has re-
peatedly sought foreign interference in
our elections, which we should all find
appalling. We know that President
Trump and his associates pressed the
Ukrainian Government to meddle in
our democratic process, pushing them
to launch an investigation without
basis into the President’s political op-
ponents in an effort to help his elec-
tion.
We know that he has made overtures
to China—out in the open—to do the
same. This is important. We don’t have
to take anyone else’s word for it. We
saw President Trump’s call record with
the Ukrainian President, and we all
heard the President and his associates
admit to the surreptitious actions from
their own lips on camera.
These facts are indisputable and
can’t be spun. President Trump and his
circle of friends have been clear about
their actions and their intentions, and
it is clear they are unacceptable, but
even more seriously, there are still
many questions about the extent of
President Trump and his associates’
actions and their potential impact on
our democracy, questions for which the
American people undoubtedly deserve
answers.
That is why the House is right to
begin impeachment proceedings to de-
termine if President Trump has com-
mitted high crimes and misdemeanors,
and why months ago I, too, called on
the House to open an inquiry to inves-
tigate the President’s deeply dis-
tressing actions because, for me and for
so many other people across the coun-
try, this is not about partisan politics
or any politics. This is about maintain-
ing our Nation’s security and defending
the rule of law. It is about nothing less
than the future of our democracy. Let
me be clear: Because of President
Trump, all of this is on the line. That
is how serious this is.
I have news for my Republican col-
leagues: As much as you would like to
stay silent on this, it is not an option.
Our forefathers warned us against the
power of foreign interference to under-
mine the foundations of our democ-
racy, and their cautions echo as clearly
and as strongly today as they did more
than 200 years ago.
As Members of Congress, as rep-
resentatives of the American people,
we took an oath to defend our Nation’s
security and our democracy. That is
why the Constitution gives authority
to Congress and the immense responsi-
bility to provide oversight of the Presi-
dent’s actions. Based just on what we
know, it would be a dereliction of duty
for Congress not to investigate the
grave threats to our country’s safety
and to our democratic institutions.
If President Trump and his adminis-
tration have nothing to hide, they
should stop obstructing. Let Congress
do its job and find the facts. Further-
more, if Congress fails to investigate
these issues, it would set its own dan-
gerous new precedent, essentially
green-lighting this President’s uneth-
ical behavior and his attacks against
our democratic institutions for future
generations of our Nation’s leaders.
That is a frightening notion.
We are now at the crossroads, and we
have to make a decision. Over the com-
ing weeks, the actions of the House and
possibly each individual in this body
will in large part determine which path
we take. Will we allow foreign actors
to interfere in our elections and under-
mine our security or not? Will we stand
by it and allow this President and per-
haps future Presidents to ignore our
Constitution and mangle our demo-
cratic norms or not? Will we be a na-
tion of laws or not?
I believe that this country is a coun-
try of laws, that our elections must be
completely free from foreign inter-
ference, and that every elected official
should ensure that these fundamental
principles come before party or par-
tisanship as this process moves for-
ward.
There are other priorities Congress
needs to focus on, important work we
have to continue doing to secure our
elections, which is all the more para-
mount given this President’s actions.
We will, of course, continue, as well,
our efforts to lower healthcare costs
and address the climate crisis and the
epidemic of gun violence and more, but
we cannot ignore what President
Trump and his associates have done
and said and the impact their actions
can have on our elections, our democ-
racy, and the future of this country.
I sat in this Chamber as a juror in an
impeachment trial before. It was a
deeply serious undertaking, and one
each Member took seriously before ren-
dering a decision. That is the same se-
riousness that is required in this mo-
ment at this crossroad. If and when the
House elects to accuse the President of
an impeachable offense or offenses, the
Senate right here will host the trial,
and as Senators, we will all serve as ju-
rors. If and when that time comes, I
know I will approach it seriously, and
I deeply hope each of my colleagues
will, as well. Each of us will have to
put aside every other consideration be-
yond the facts and focus solely on pre-
serving the integrity of our democracy
and upholding our solemn obligation to
defend the Constitution. History will
record where we all stand.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut.
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President,
there is very little question today that
our democracy is under attack. The
threat is not only from outside our
country but from within with the
threat to our rule of law, our basic val-
ues, and our democratic institutions.
From outside the country, that
threat is reaffirmed by the Senate In-
telligence Committee, which recently
released a bipartisan report offering a
sobering warning of fresh signs of in-
terference by Russia and other foreign
actors in the upcoming election.
The fact is that the lights are flash-
ing red. The warning has come to us
from multiple sources. Our intelligence
community has warned us. The FBI has
warned us. Our national security pro-
fessionals have warned us. Still, the
majority leader has refused to permit
us a vote on commonsense measures
that will better guarantee election se-
curity.
We need to move forward on these
measures that safeguard our democ-
racy from outside interference—cyber
attack and social disinformation. And,
of course, I have sponsored some of
these bills. Many of them are bipar-
tisan. We can move forward with that
effort even as we confront the chal-
lenge and the obligation, which we
must do in the ongoing impeachment
proceedings.
What saddens and angers me is that
in the midst of this crisis and the
threat from outside our Nation from
Russia and other countries, our Com-
mander in Chief has essentially refused
to believe that threat exists. He has in
fact and in effect denied that there is
any threat. That is what happened
when the President used the power and
authority of the Oval Office to pressure
a foreign leader, President Zelensky of
Ukraine, to investigate a political op-
ponent, Joe Biden. This action is not
only a breach of his oath of office and
his constitutional duty, it is unpatri-
otic, immoral, criminal, and it is a

threat to our national security be-
cause, again, it invites interference. In
fact, it pressures interference in our
democracy. It validates and strength-
ens Vladimir Putin, not this Nation.
That is why the impeachment in-
quiry is being conducted by the House
and why it is so important. Impeach-
ment is not a remedy we take lightly
or happily; it is a serious, last-resort
remedy for the worst abuses of power
and an unchecked, rogue President who
cannot be held accountable in any
other way. But the President has given
us no choice. He may not be upholding
his oath of office, but we must uphold
ours.
The most powerful proof here comes
from the words of the President him-
self in that July 25 conversation. There
is no Member of this body who is unfa-
miliar with those words inviting, solic-
iting, in fact extorting the President of
a foreign nation to interfere in our de-
mocracy. He involved officials at the
highest level who joined in trying to
cover it up, who now have a whistle-
blower complaint, as well as those call
notes between President Trump and
President Zelensky that repeat the
President’s own words. The transcript
of that call is truly chilling and fright-
ening almost beyond words.
When Mr. Zelensky mentioned that
Ukraine was ‘‘ready to buy more Jave-
lins from the United States for defense
purposes,’’ President Trump responded
with, ‘‘I would like you to do us a favor
though.’’ That is a quote: ‘‘I would like
you to do us a favor though.’’ And the
favor was, of course, interference in
our election.
That kind of invitation emboldens
not only the President of Ukraine but
every other autocrat and tyrant who
might seek similarly to interfere. Let
us remember that what the Founders
feared most was exactly that kind of
interference, whether it was from the
imperial powers that we had just
fought and successfully won our free-
dom or dictators like Vladimir Putin
or other nations that will be
emboldened to interfere.
My Republican colleagues’ silence
will not age well. Not only are they un-
willing to stand up to this President’s
abuses and threats to our democracy,
the majority leader has refused to put
those bills on the floor. He has outright
refused to give us a vote on security
legislation.
My bill, the duty to report bill, would
require campaigns, candidates, and
family members to immediately report
to the FBI and Federal Election Com-
mission any offers of illegal foreign as-
sistance. It codifies into law what is al-
ready a moral duty and a patriotic
duty. It is basic common sense. The
law already forbids soliciting and ac-
cepting that kind of foreign assistance
during a campaign; this measure, very
simply, would require it to be reported.
I have told this body—and I have re-
peated it numerous times—that when
FBI Director Wray came before the
Senate Judiciary Committee, he
warned that the Russians are still ac-
tively trying to interfere in our elec-
tion. But President Trump just said
that if offered foreign assistance, ‘‘I’d
take it.’’
Congress must pass this Duty to Re-
port Act, along with other common-
sense measures that support election
security. Not only can we do it while
we are considering impeachment, we
must do it because the impeachment
offense, in fact, involves foreign inter-
ference that these election security
measures would help to stop.
Likewise, I want to mention gun vio-
lence protection. Senator GRAHAM and
I and others in this body have worked
hard over months on negotiating emer-
gency risk protection order legislation.
It could be passed along with back-
ground checks, and the two should go
together.
The ball is in the White House’s
court. The President has shifted
ground one way and the other, unpre-
dictably and uncertainly, but I feel we
can muster a consensus here. Even as
we consider impeachment, we can
move forward on a comprehensive set
of measures that would help make
America safer.
My goal, eventually, is to save as
many lives as possible and as quickly
as possible through those kinds of
measures that would include not only
background checks made universal and
emergency risk protection orders
passed by States with the incentives
we would provide with this bill but also
a ban on assault weapons and safe stor-
age in honor of Ethan Song, a young
man who was killed in Guilford, CT, be-
cause of improper storage of a gun that
he and a friend were playing with.
They would include a ban on high-ca-
pacity magazines and a reversal of the
sweetheart deal that gave the gun
manufacturers near-complete immu-
nity. These commonsense measures can
be done even as we consider impeach-
ment.
Likewise, to take another guarantee
of our values and the rule of law, forced
arbitration clauses cause harm to mil-
lions of Americans every year. These
clauses are often tucked into the fine
print of lengthy consumer contracts
and employee handbooks, with workers
and consumers having no meaningful
choice but to consent to the terms.
These forced arbitration clauses, like
that immunity for the gun manufac-
turers, denies basic justice. They deny
Americans their day in court, and they
deny public accountability. Consumers
and workers are forced into unfair arbi-
tration clauses where corporations can
write the rules. They write the rules.
Everything can be done in secret, and
there is no meaningful judicial rebuke.
In many cases, these clauses are paired
with provisions that block Americans
who have suffered similar harm from
banding together in seeking account-
ability together in a class action law-
suit.
At the start of this Congress, 34 Sen-
ators joined me in sponsoring the FAIR
Act. This bill would render invalid or
unenforceable any arbitration agree-
ment between workers and consumers
and corporations that governs employ-
ment, civil rights, consumer, or anti-
trust disputes. It has an exception for
those arbitration agreements that are
the product of real collective bar-
gaining agreements. It is hardly a rad-
ical proposal; it is a reform to give
Americans access to the justice system
again. Yet Senator MCCONNELL regret-
tably has blocked this bill and others
from a vote. Senator MCCONNELL said:
‘‘As long as I am majority leader of the
Senate, I get to set the agenda.’’ Mean-
while, corporations are cheating work-
ers, consumers, children, and families
out of their day in court.
We need to move forward on these
matters: gun violence protection, elec-
tion security, the FAIR Act. We can do
it because America wants it. We will go
back to our constituents in this next
election, and my colleagues who will
face them will be asked: What have you
done? We can answer with real action if
we come together and move forward.
I yield the floor.

ator from North Dakota.
S.J. RES. 53
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, before
we vote, I want to take a few minutes
to express my strong opposition to
what our colleagues on the other side
of the aisle are doing with their Con-
gressional Review Act resolution. They
are asking the United States to give up
a very good, responsible, and Afford-
able Clean Energy Plan and replace it
with the old, Obama-era, illegal, and
unconstitutional Clean Power Plan.
Prior to being elected to Congress, I
spent nearly 10 years in North Dakota
as an energy regulator and oversaw
both economic and environmental poli-
cies and regulations in our State. I
know something of this issue. For the
American people, a fully implemented
Obama-era Clean Power Plan would re-
sult in much higher electricity costs,
less money in their pockets, fewer well-
paying jobs, and just a lot less freedom.
Across the country, their plan would
reduce household spending by $79 bil-
lion. It would increase electricity
prices in my State of North Dakota by
43 percent, and it would cost over
125,000 jobs over the next decade.
Perhaps one of the most disturbing
things about the Clean Power Plan
that was presented by the Obama ad-
ministration—one of the reasons,
frankly, that it was deemed to be un-
constitutional and illegal and had a
stay put on it by the U.S. Supreme
Court—was that in my State, under the
proposed rule, we had a CO2 reduction
target of 11 percent. Yet, in the classic
bait-and-switch maneuver, the final
rule increased that 11 percent by 400
percent. The 11 percent, while illegal,
was doable, but the 400 percent was ri-
diculous.
So make no mistake, right now, here
in the U.S. Senate, the Democrats are
asking us to vote to eliminate good

jobs, to raise the cost of living, and to
take more money out of the pockets of
the American people. For what? The
United States does not need an uncon-
stitutional Federal power grab, like
this one, in order to lead the world in
reducing our emissions. In fact, we al-
ready do. Emissions have been declin-
ing in the United States for nearly 50
years. We don’t need to apologize for
our action or inaction. In fact, we need
to start honoring the innovators who
have made these reductions possible in
the first place. We should be encour-
aging them and incentivizing them to
continue their work in order to pave
the way for responsible energy produc-
tion that will be used for generations
to come not just here in the United
States but across the world.
In the context of several issues, I
often speak about needing to follow a
Federalist model, the cooperative fed-
eralism that our Founders envisioned
when they created the States. That is a
model of State control, with Governors
being in charge, not Presidents. This is
under the umbrella, of course, of good
Federal oversight and, of course, some
authority. Yet States need to have pri-
macy. Put those who are closest to the
people in charge, give them the author-
ity and the resources they need, and
this model will produce the best results
nearly every time, if not every time.
The Obama era’s Clean Power Plan is
exactly the opposite of that. It is a
Federal power grab that the States
have rejected and, yes, that the Su-
preme Court has ruled a stay on.
By stark contrast, the affordable
clean energy rule that has been put for-
ward by the Trump administration,
which is the rule the Democrats want
to overturn today in favor of the un-
constitutional plan that hurts the
American people, is a win for North
Dakota and for States across the coun-
try. It respects the law and restores the
proper balance between States and the
Federal Government. It also promotes
energy security. Maybe one could even
say it promotes energy dominance.
ACE, as it is called, gives States the
flexibility to set their own emission
standards. It focuses on energy effi-
ciency improvements at individual
powerplants, and it incentivizes in-
creased efficiency for coal powerplants,
which allows them to remain open. We
have that important base of low-cost,
reliable electricity in the form of clean
energy.
This simple, responsible plan is what
the Democrats find so abhorrent. With
the vote today, they are asking us to
scrap the affordable clean energy rule
and return to a rule that is unconstitu-
tional, that tramples on States’ rights,
that kills jobs, that raises electricity
rates, and that does nothing substan-
tial to reduce emissions.
I applaud President Trump and EPA
Administrator Wheeler for having in-
cluded Governors and States and
innovators in the discussion before
having made the final rule.
We cannot let this happen today, and
I urge my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing no.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire.
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask

Without objection, it is so ordered.
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise
to express my outrage with regard to
President Trump’s decision to with-
draw U.S. troops from northeast Syria.
This decision is dangerous, premature,
and wholly inconsistent with what the
facts on the ground in Syria and the
advice from everyone—from our dip-
lomats to our military advisers.
In just 1 week, President Trump has
managed to undo 5 years of hard-fought
stability in northeast Syria. Just 1
week ago, over 10,000 ISIS fighters, in-
cluding high-value prisoners who tar-
geted American victims, were secured
in prisons throughout northeast Syria.
We face, today, a very different pic-
ture. Several ISIS prisons are already
unmanned as a result of Turkey’s in-
cursion, and it is estimated that over
100 ISIS prisoners have been released
already. We don’t know what will hap-
pen in those other detention centers
that have housed ISIS prisoners.
One week ago, a limited U.S. troop
presence of 1,000 Special Forces sta-
bilized a population that was once ter-
rorized by the Syrian regime and later
by ISIS. These forces secured a region
of Syria that controls over two-thirds
of Syria’s natural resources. American
troops have, today, either left or are
preparing to leave this area, and the
Syrian regime is moving in.
Russian troops have moved into U.S.
military bases, and over 160,000 Syrian
civilians have already fled their homes
as a result of the spike in violence that
has been instigated by Turkey. It is so
hard to watch the videos on television
that show Turkey-affiliated fighters
assassinating Kurdish forces—Kurds
with their hands tied behind their
backs.
I traveled to Syria a year ago last
summer. LINDSEY GRAHAM and I saw
firsthand the work of the combined
joint task force, Operation Inherent
Resolve. We saw the work its partner
forces, the Syrian Democratic Forces,
were doing, and it was truly remark-
able. The United States owes a huge
debt of gratitude to the men and
women of the SDF who sacrificed over
11,000 of their own lives in fighting
ISIS so we didn’t have to sacrifice our
own.
Because of this sacrifice, when we
were in northeast Syria last summer,
we witnessed communities like Manbij
steadily recover and rebuild after 3
years under ISIS’s brutal occupation,
and the widespread appreciation of the
U.S. presence among local, multiethnic
residents was a testament to the im-
portance of our partnerships and our
willingness to lead in times of crisis.
As we drove down the roads, we saw
kids flashing victory signs at our
troops. When we were in the market-
place, we had people come out and tell
us how relieved they were that the
United States was there to help ensure
that peace was being kept. We saw
local governance taking place on the
ground.
So it is incredibly difficult now to see
images coming out of Manbij and the
other places we visited in northeastern
Syria. The Syrian regime has already
moved troops back into this region,
and Turkey’s proxies, who are seem-
ingly undeterred by the Syrian pres-
ence, continue to move into the city of
Manbij with heavily armed vehicles.
Meanwhile, Russia has spent the last
few days touring and posting videos of
abandoned, taxpayer-funded U.S. bases.
What is taking place in Manbij and in
so many cities across northeast Syria
is an insult to the thousands of Amer-
ican servicemembers who have risked
their lives to help stabilize that region
and support the fight against ISIS, and
it could have all been avoided.
This really began in December of 2018
when the President said he planned to
withdraw troops from Syria. That was
after holding up for months the sta-
bilization dollars that could have been
used to make it very clear that we
were committed to the region—to en-
suring that ISIS wouldn’t rebuild there
and that there would be stability in
northeastern Syria. We were com-
mitted to making sure the United
States was at the table when Russia
and Iran and Assad moved in and
carved up Syria.
I ask unanimous to have printed in
the RECORD the recommendations on
the best way forward in Syria that
were issued last month by the bipar-
tisan Syria Study Group, which I
helped to create.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The United States cannot avoid or ignore
the conflict in Syria. From the outset of hos-
tilities, minimizing American involvement
in the war and safeguarding U.S. national se-
curity interests have proven to be incompat-
ible goals. This will remain the case for the
foreseeable future. The essential question be-
fore American policymakers is not whether
the United States should keep or withdraw
its forces in Syria, but what strategy and
mix of tools will best protect the United
States from the conflict’s reverberations and
advance American interests. This report sets
out such a strategy.
THE SYRIAN CONFLICT AND AMERICAN
INTERESTS
From the conflict’s beginning in 2011 as a
peaceful domestic uprising, experts warned
that President Bashar al-Assad’s brutal re-
sponse was likely to have serious, negative
impacts on U.S. interests. Given Syria’s cen-
tral location in the Middle East, its ruling
regime’s ties to terrorist groups and to Iran,
and the incompatibility of Assad’s authori-
tarian rule with the aspirations of the Syr-
ian people, many worried about the conflict

spilling over Syria’s borders. These concerns
are now a reality. The Syrian conflict
spawned a refugee crisis that has encum-
bered Syria’s neighbors and roiled European
politics, strained U.S.-Turkish relations to
the point of crisis, led to direct hostilities
between Iran and Israel, provided a vector
for Russia’s resurgence in the Middle East,
and challenged international norms around
weapons of mass destruction and the protec-
tion of civilians. Areas of Syria have become
safe havens for al-Qaeda and its fellow trav-
elers and home to the largest concentration
of foreign terrorist fighters since Afghani-
stan in the 1990s. The conflict also fueled the
rise of ISIS, prompting an ongoing U.S.-led
military intervention. Eight years in, the
conflict has not been meaningfully con-
tained, nor has the United States been shel-
tered from its effects.
Events on the ground disprove the nar-
rative that the conflict has been won by the
Assad regime. The Syrian war, far from end-
ing, is entering a new phase. As of this writ-
ing, the Assad regime and its patron Russia
are pressing an offensive against Idlib that
could spur a new humanitarian catastrophe
and outflow of refugees. Tensions are sim-
mering between the Kurdish element that
dominates the U.S.-trained Syrian Demo-
cratic Forces (SDF) in northeastern Syria
and the Arab populace of some of the areas
under SDF control. Turkey is positioning
troops to invade northeastern Syria, which
would divert the SDF away from the essen-
tial task of preventing ISIS’s resurgence.
ISIS itself, down but not defeated, is already
resurfacing as an insurgency and may yet at-
tempt to retake territory in both Syria and
Iraq. Iran and Israel, already locked in a low-
level conflict in Syria, may escalate to open
conflict, especially in the Golan Heights.
The Assad regime and its partners may seek
to cross the Euphrates River, which could in
turn breathe life into the ISIS insurgency
and allow Iran to consolidate its land routes
from Iraq to Lebanon. All of these scenarios
become more likely without U.S. forces in
Syria and without committed U.S. leader-
ship to avert these scenarios.
The Syria Study Group uncovered no easy
solutions in Syria; optimal outcomes were
left behind long ago. Yet the Group deter-
mined that the threats the conflict in Syria
poses—of terrorism directed against the
United States and its allies and partners; of
an empowered Iran; of an aggrandized Rus-
sia; of large numbers of refugees, displaced
persons, and other forms of humanitarian ca-
tastrophe; and of the erosion of international
norms of war and the Western commitment
to them—are sufficiently serious to merit a
determined response from the United States.
The United States and its allies retain tools
to address those threats and the leverage to
promote outcomes that are better for Amer-
ican interests than those that would prevail
in the absence of U.S. engagement. Using
those tools effectively, however, will require
better alignment of ends and means—the
former must be more realistic and the U.S.
investment of the latter increased—as well
as clear, consistent, and high-level political
leadership. Sharp shifts and reversals in
American policy, and the failure of senior
U.S. government officials to prioritize the
issue with their counterparts, have under-
mined American credibility and the effec-
tiveness of U.S. policy.
ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT SITUATION IN
SYRIA
While the conflict in Syria is often charac-
terized as winding down, it is the assessment
of the Syria Study Group that this is incor-
rect; in fact, the conflict remains dynamic
and dangerous. In particular:
The liberation of ISIS-held territory does
not eliminate the group’s threat to the
United States. ISIS no longer holds signifi-
cant territory in Syria or Iraq, but it is not
defeated. The group has morphed into an in-
surgency with the will, capability, and re-
sources to carry out attacks against the
United States. ISIS will seek to take advan-
tage of any opening, whether a reduction in
U.S. counterterrorism pressure or discontent
among eastern Syria’s Arab population, to
recruit new fighters and mount attacks.
ISIS’s terrorist ideology, or ‘‘brand,’’ con-
tinues to hold global appeal.
The ISIS detainee population is a long-
term challenge that is not being adequately
addressed. Although ISIS has suffered sig-
nificant casualties, many of its fighters—in-
cluding thousands of foreign fighters—re-
main in detention under SDF management.
If released, they will form the core of a new
iteration of ISIS or a similar group. In addi-
tion, tens of thousands of family members of
ISIS fighters are residing in camps in east-
ern Syria. The SDF has custody of both
groups but lacks the resources and outside
support to hold them indefinitely. U.S. and
allied efforts to deal with this problem have
suffered from a lack of political will.
Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups re-
main active in Syria and threaten the United
States. Although ISIS has received far more
attention, other terrorist groups are active
and control territory, especially in Idlib. Al-
Qaeda offshoot Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has
formed a government in Idlib, which is home
to numerous other groups, including al-
Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, Hurras ad-Din, and
a large number of foreign terrorist fighters.
The United States lacks freedom of action to
conduct a full-fledged counterterrorism cam-
paign in these areas.
Despite Israeli air strikes and U.S. sanc-
tions, Iran continues to entrench itself in
Syria; Russia and Iran show few serious signs
of divergence. Iran appears to be pursuing a
two-track policy of military entrenchment
and political and economic activity designed
to enhance its power and influence in Syria
for the long term. Iran’s activities have re-
portedly caused discontent among Syria’s
population, but the Assad regime is heavily
dependent on Iranian support. Israeli offi-
cials believe that Israel’s air strikes have
disrupted Iran’s attempts to move sophisti-
cated weapons systems into Syria, but Iran’s
overall objectives appear unchanged and the
risk of broader Iran-Israel conflict remains
high. Although Russia has acquiesced to the
Israeli campaign against Iran, there are few
signs of a wider divergence between Moscow
and Tehran regarding aims or tactics in
Syria.
Assad has not won the conflict in Syria.
The regime has recaptured large swaths of
territory and now holds 60 percent of the
country. However, its control outside Da-
mascus is tenuous, in part because it lacks
the forces to secure the areas it retakes, but
also because it pursues punitive policies
against local populations. In much of re-
gime-held areas, civilians are subject to con-
scription as well as arbitrary arrest, torture,
and execution at the hands of the regime.
Crime and warlordism are rampant. The
Assad regime is determined to retake Idlib
and is receiving Russian assistance to do so,
but so far it has struggled to recapture terri-
tory without the help of Iranian ground
forces
Progress toward a political settlement to
the Syria conflict has stalled, and Assad
shows no willingness to compromise with his
opponents. Neither the UN-led ‘‘Geneva proc-
ess’’ based on UN Security Council Resolu-
tion 2254 nor the ad hoc ‘‘Astana process’’
comprising Russia, Iran, and Turkey has
yielded progress toward a political settle-
ment to the conflict. While the United
States is leading a new effort to break the
stalemate, the fundamental obstacle remains
the Assad regime’s unwillingness to coun-
tenance meaningful reform. Presidential
elections in 2021 are unlikely to produce a le-
gitimate electoral outcome, because there is
little chance that the regime will permit free
and fair elections or the credible participa-
tion of the Syrian diaspora.
The United States underestimated Russia’s
ability to use Syria as an arena for regional
influence. Russia’s intervention, beginning
in 2015, accomplished its proximate aim—the
preservation of the regime in defiance of
U.S. calls for Assad to ‘‘go’’—at a relatively
low cost. Russia has enhanced its profile and
prestige more broadly in the Middle East.
The extent of Russia’s success in Syria is de-
batable—it has yet to translate Assad’s mili-
tary gains into the political victory Moscow
seemingly seeks—but Russia has neverthe-
less reestablished itself as a crucial player in
the region’s politics for the first time in dec-
ades.
U.S.-Turkey relations are strained in Syria
by starkly diverging views of the SDF. A
Turkish incursion into northeastern Syria
would represent a major setback to U.S.
aims in Syria and a new crisis for the U.S.-
Turkish relationship. The United States re-
gards its decision to partner with the SDF to
fight ISIS as having been necessitated by the
lack of credible and timely Turkish alter-
native; Turkey regards the SDF as a grave
security threat due to its links to the
Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a threat
made more dangerous by U.S. training and
equipping of the SDF. This dispute has
played a significant role in the erosion of
U.S.-Turkish relations and may yet prompt a
third Turkish incursion into Syria, which
would severely complicate the U.S. military
campaign against ISIS. There is little sign
that Turkey intends to relinquish control of
the two Syrian areas it currently controls—
Afrin and the ‘‘Euphrates Shield’’ area.
Although the SDF has been a highly effec-
tive partner in the fight against ISIS, it
must undergo a transition to ensure sta-
bility in northeastern Syria. The SDF is re-
garded by the U.S. military as a highly effec-
tive partner in the conventional military
campaign against ISIS. That partnership
faces new challenges with the shift from
fighting to governing. The SDF remains
dominated by Syrian Kurds—specifically by
the People’s Protection Units (YPG)—despite
its control over large stretches of predomi-
nantly Arab territory. This disparity, and
the YPG’s heavy-handed approach to gov-
erning and resource allocation, has led to un-
rest in Arab tribal areas. Minimal U.S. civil-
ian engagement and the halt in U.S. sta-
bilization funding in northeastern Syria
have diminished American influence.
The Assad regime’s systematic targeting of
civilians and civilian infrastructure con-
stitutes war crimes and demands account-
ability, as well as enhanced efforts to protect
civilians. The Assad regime and its patrons,
including Russia, have systematically tar-
geted civilians and civilian infrastructure. A
UN commission found the regime guilty of
crimes against humanity. Syrians have been
subjected to arbitrary detention, torture,
and execution at the hands of the regime. Al-
though prospects for accountability are dim
in the near term, efforts to document the re-
gime’s atrocities are under way.
Syria’s humanitarian crisis, not least the
challenges posed by internally displaced peo-
ple and refugees, will reverberate for dec-
ades. Most refugees are unlikely to return
voluntarily given current conditions in
Syria. The Syrian conflict has provoked the
most serious human displacement since
World War II, 6 million Syrians are inter-
nally displaced, and nearly 6 million more
are registered as refugees outside the coun-
try. Refugees have placed a heavy economic

burden on host countries, especially Syria’s
neighbors; pressure is increasing, particu-
larly within Lebanon and Turkey, for non-
voluntary returns. Inside Syria, a large pro-
portion of the population relies on humani-
tarian aid, over which the regime seeks to
exercise control in order to enhance its
power.
Despite these challenges, the United States
maintains leverage to shape an outcome in
Syria that protects core U.S. national secu-
rity interests. The Group identified several
key points of leverage held by the United
States, particularly if used in coordination
with allies and partners: influence over
northeastern Syria; sanctions against the
Assad regime and its backers; the with-
holding of reconstruction assistance desired
by Assad and Russia; and the ongoing diplo-
matic isolation of the Assad regime.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR U.S. POLICY
Despite its daunting assessment of the sit-
uation in Syria, the Group believes that the
United States is still able to exercise influ-
ence over the conflict’s trajectory, and that
it must do so given the threats the conflict
poses to American interests. The Group be-
lieves that the best end state in Syria is one
in which a Syrian government is viewed as
legitimate by its own population and has the
will and capability to end Syria’s dependence
on foreign forces and to prevent terrorist
groups from thriving on Syrian territory.
This in turn requires conditions in which
Syrian citizens live free from fear of the
Assad regime and of Russian, Iranian, and
ISIS brutality and within an updated polit-
ical and social compact based on decentral-
ized governance and equitable resource allo-
cation.
Recognizing that such an outcome is a dis-
tant prospect, the Group recommends a
strategy that makes a negotiated political
settlement in Syria more likely yet also al-
lows the United States to defend its interests
even if a political solution is not found. None
of those consulted by the Group believe that
withdrawing U.S. forces would make ISIS
less likely to regroup, Iran less likely to en-
trench itself, or a negotiated settlement
more likely. Although the U.S. military mis-
sion in Syria is often lumped together with
the Iraq and Afghanistan missions in the
‘‘forever war’’ category, the Syria case offers
a different—and far less costly—model. A
small U.S. military footprint, supported by
U.S. air power and other high-end capabili-
ties, reinforced by a global coalition of like-
minded allies and partners, rallied a local
partner force many times its size to liberate
territory from a terrorist group. What U.S.
forces and their partners have gained in
Syria should not be discarded with a pre-
mature withdrawal.
To that end, the Group recommends that
the United States, working in concert with
allies and partners, continue its military
mission in order to maintain pressure on
ISIS and other terrorist groups while main-
taining and strengthening pressure on the
Assad regime and its backers until condi-
tions are conducive for a political settlement
that ends the Syria war. In particular, the
Group recommends that the United States:
Halt the U.S. military withdrawal; consoli-
date gains following the territorial defeat of
ISIS; and support communities liberated
from ISIS in forming an alternative model
for governance, resource allocation, and se-
curity in Syria. The Group recommends that
the United States (1) update its military
mission to head off an ISIS insurgency; (2)
adequately prepare for various contingencies
and escalation scenarios; (3) return a U.S. ci-
vilian presence and stabilization funding to
northeastern Syria; (4) press the SDF to gov-
ern more inclusively; (5) elevate the ISIS de-
tainee problem set; and (6) prioritize diplo-
matic and military engagement in Iraq.
Until conditions inside Syria improve,
deny the Assad regime and its backers all
avenues for normalization by enforcing the
regime’s diplomatic isolation and a rigorous
sanctions architecture. Among other steps,
the United States should continue to press
allies and partners to refrain from reestab-
lishing diplomatic ties with the Assad re-
gime, to withhold reconstruction assistance,
and to strictly enforce sanctions and seek to
expand them. In addition, the international
community should begin preparing the
ground now for the eventual accountability
of those responsible for war crimes in Syria,
without imposing accountability as a pre-
condition for a political settlement.
Test and verify Russian willingness to sup-
port political settlements acceptable to the
United States but continue activities that
increase the costs to Russia for its actions in
Syria. Many observers believe that agree-
ment between the United States and Russia
is a prerequisite for progress toward a polit-
ical settlement, yet Russia has consistently
failed to deliver on its commitments in
Syria. The United States should require con-
crete actions of Russia pursuant to any dis-
cussions of a political settlement and, absent
such actions, should avoid making conces-
sions to Moscow or legitimizing its positions.
Concurrently, the United States should pres-
sure Moscow, in part by highlighting Rus-
sian complicity in war crimes.
Remain focused on expelling Iranian forces
and proxies from Syria but recognize that
this is best accomplished in phases. The key
near-term goal should be to prevent further
entrenchment of Iran and its many partners
and proxies while raising the cost to Iran for
its actions in Syria. To this end, the United
States should continue its support of Israeli
air strikes; enforce sanctions aimed at un-
dermining Iran’s ability to fund its proxies
and partners in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq;
maintain the U.S. military presence at the
al-Tanf military base; and support efforts to
expose Iranian influence efforts in Syria.
The United States should insist that any po-
litical settlement require the withdrawal of
Iranian forces and proxies from Syria.
Seek areas for cooperation with Turkey
and address legitimate Turkish security con-
cerns while pressing Turkey to avoid any in-
cursion into northeastern Syria and to im-
prove conditions in the Afrin and Euphrates
Shield areas. U.S. efforts to reach agreement
on a security zone or security mechanism
along Turkey’s border with northeastern
Syria should continue, and every attempt
should be made to isolate Syria from other
problems in the U.S.-Turkey relationship.
The United States should encourage the re-
sumption of Turkey-PKK peace talks, which
hold the best possibility of leading to a
détente between Turkey and the SDF. The
United States should press Turkey to im-
prove conditions and access in the areas of
Syria it controls.
Seek to avert a humanitarian catastrophe
in Idlib while addressing the presence there
of terrorist groups. The United States should
explore avenues to increase the pressure on
terrorist groups in Idlib that may be plotting
external attacks. At the same time, the
United States should seek to deter the Assad
regime and its partners from continuing to
target civilians in the territory. In prepara-
tion for a renewed humanitarian and refugee
crisis in Idlib, the United States should press
Turkey to facilitate the work of nongovern-
mental organizations (NGOs) serving the
population.
Energize efforts to address the humani-
tarian crisis inside Syria while taking steps
to shore up countries hosting Syrian refu-
gees. The United States should work to en-
sure the continued provision of humani-
tarian aid to vulnerable populations inside
and outside Syria. The United States should
press for the renewal of the UN ‘‘cross-border
resolution,’’ rally other states to fund hu-
manitarian appeals for Syria, and work with
international financial institutions to sup-
port refugee-hosting countries. The United
States should stand firmly against efforts to
forcibly repatriate Syrian refugees and
should resume accepting Syrian refugees in
the United States.
Mrs. SHAHEEN. The report read that
the United States should make the
most of its gains and hold this critical
piece of land until a negotiated settle-
ment was reached between all parties.
Moreover, the report, which was bipar-
tisan—that had Representatives ap-
pointed by Members of Congress and by
the administration—read that with-
drawing U.S. troops would not make
ISIS less likely to regroup or Iran less
likely to entrench itself.
President Trump’s ill-informed and
hasty decision will not only breathe
new life into the terrorist groups—into
ISIS, which is really just al-Qaida by
another name—and cede America’s
hard-fought gains in the region to Rus-
sia, Iran, and Assad, but it will erode
U.S. credibility in the long term. It
will cede America’s hard-fought gains
in the region.
I wish there were alternatives that
we as a country could pursue. Sadly, I
don’t think we can put the genie back
in the bottle. Here in Congress, though,
I hope we will look at ways to hold
Turkey and President Erdogan ac-
countable for his actions.
I certainly hope President Trump
will revoke his invitation to President
Erdogan to visit the United States.
President Erdogan needs to hear an un-
equivocal message of opposition to this
incursion from the United States, and
it makes no sense to extend hospitality
and niceties during this moment of cri-
sis.
Republicans and Democrats must
come together and ensure that the ad-
ministration understands the con-
sequences of these actions. We have to
do more to ensure that such mistakes
never happen again.
I yield the floor.
S.J. RES. 53
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
today in support of the resolution of
disapproval sponsored by Senator
CARDIN that would block the Adminis-
tration’s harmful Affordable Clean En-
ergy Rule.
In Maine, our economy is inex-
tricably linked to the environment.
Our State, which is situated at the end
of the Nation’s air pollution tailpipe,
has made substantial progress in reduc-
ing harmful emissions by increasing
energy efficiency, adopting clean en-
ergy technologies, and improving air
quality and public health. While I am
pleased by the progress our country has
already made in reducing air pollut-
ants, the administration’s rule to re-
peal and rewrite the Clean Power Plan
is a step in the wrong direction.

S5868 October 17, 2019
Climate change is a significant risk
that threatens Maine’s working for-
ests, fishing, and agricultural indus-
tries, as well as tourism and recreation
and our coastal communities. I will
continue to work in Congress to sup-
port realistic, responsible solutions
that help reduce harmful emissions and
protect our environment and the
health of our citizens.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to complete my re-
marks prior to the vote.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise
in strong opposition to the Congres-
sional Review Act resolution that has
been put forward by the Democrats on
which we will soon be voting.
The Democrats’ resolution would
eliminate President Trump’s affordable
clean energy rule. The President’s rule
is commonsense policy. It protects our
air, and it allows our economy to grow
at the same time. The affordable clean
energy rule would replace the Obama
administration’s so-called Clean Power
Plan. The punishing plan would have
damaged our economy, and what I have
here is a map to go over some of that.
It would have closed powerplants. It
would have put energy workers on un-
employment. It would have reduced the
reliability of our electricity. It would
have increased energy bills for Amer-
ican families and for small businesses.
The results would have been dra-
matic. There would have been dramatic
increases in electricity bills all across
the country. The plan would have dev-
astated communities, certainly in my
home State of Wyoming. It would have
raised electricity bills by 42 percent in
the State of Wyoming, and they would
have gone up in every State.
Wyoming is America’s leading pro-
ducer of coal. It supports thousands of
good-paying jobs all across the State.
Across Wyoming, the punishing power
plan would put hard-working men and
women out of work. The rule would be
a massive roadblock for States. Instead
of working collaboratively with State
governments, it would put the EPA in
the driver’s seat of setting a national
energy policy.
States would be told what energy
sources were allowed within their bor-
ders and how to regulate them.
Worst of all, the so-called Clean
Power Plan would have barely reduced
carbon emissions, it would have crip-
pled our economy, and done very little,
if anything, to help the environment.
President Obama’s plan wasn’t just
bad policy, it was illegal. Twenty-seven
States, including Wyoming, filed a law-
suit to stop the regulation. The Su-
preme Court ruled that Obama’s EPA
went way beyond its legal authority.
The Court blocked the overreaching
rule.
Now President Trump has put for-
ward a commonsense replacement to
protect America’s air. The affordable
clean energy rule follows the law, and
it is good news for the people of Wyo-
ming and the rest of the country. It
recognizes that the EPA is not sup-
posed to pick winners and losers.
Under the new rule, powerplants can
make reasonable changes like improv-
ing efficiency. The rule promotes the
use of new cleaner technologies to gen-
erate electricity so energy companies
can modernize their powerplants with-
out having to shut them down com-
pletely.
The rule also respects the role of
States under the Clean Air Act. It gets
rid of ‘‘Washington knows best,’’ which
is an approach we deal with—a top-
down approach of unelected, unac-
countable, heavyhanded bureaucrats.
States understand how to protect the
air their citizens breathe. They know it
is an important thing to do. The end
result will be cleaner air and more af-
fordable energy for America’s house-
holds.
Now Senate Democrats want to play
politics once again and uproot the af-
fordable clean energy rule. Democrats
want to resurrect a rule that the Su-
preme Court took unprecedented ac-
tion to stop. That would be bad for our
environment, bad for our economy, and
bad for our country.
Under the Congressional Review Act,
if Congress repeals the affordable clean
energy rule, the administration
couldn’t replace it with a similar rule.
The administration put forward a
commonsense rule to protect our air
quality, and now Democrats want to
kill it. That is the proposal on the floor
today.
Democrats have become hostages to
the far-left agenda, even when it
doesn’t make any sense. It is not good
policy, and we have seen this before.
The Environment and Public Works
Committee, which I chair, recently
passed legislation to help reduce the
amount of plastic pollution in our
oceans. The bipartisan bill follows up
on the previous bipartisan Save Our
Seas Act that passed and was signed
into law last Congress.
Instead of supporting the legislation,
extreme environmentalists oppose the
bill—a bipartisan bill we got passed
last Congress. We are going on to the
next level now. Now the extreme envi-
ronmentalists, of course, oppose the
bill because we are not banning all
plastics. Can you imagine something so
ridiculous? But that is what they want.
Working together in a bipartisan
way—even when we are doing things
that to me make sense, to others make
sense, to bipartisan Senators make
sense, to the House make sense, the ex-
treme environmentalists say it is still
not enough for them and their extreme
measures and approaches.
These extreme activists want to do
the same thing with our air. Instead of
finding common ground, their goal
seems to be to shut down our economy
because that is what they are pro-
moting.
Democrats in the House of Rep-
resentatives, regrettably, have fol-
lowed a similar pattern. House Demo-
crats refuse to work with Republicans
to pass commonsense bills to protect
our air and address climate change,
which we are promoting—an effort to
actually address it. Apparently, it is
not going far enough for the extreme
Democratic environmentalists.
Bipartisan legislation to support car-
bon capture technologies, which we
passed in this body, sits in the House of
Representatives waiting for a vote.
The USE IT Act—which I introduced
along with Senator WHITEHOUSE, who
gives speeches each week on climate
change on the floor of the Senate. We
have worked together. It has passed
our committee unanimously. It has
passed the Senate unanimously. Yet,
with overwhelming bipartisan support
in the Senate, it is still being blocked
in the House. The bill has bipartisan
support in the House as well, but it
hasn’t gone anywhere. It is being
stopped because Democratic leaders in
the House refuse to move a common-
sense bill that would lower carbon
emissions and help address carbon cli-
mate change.
They are climate alarmists. They
want things done drastically, unilater-
ally, immediately, when we are trying
to take commonsense steps in the right
direction.
Killing commonsense policies, like
the affordable clean energy rule and
the USE IT Act, makes no sense to me.
President Trump’s rule respects the
law, and it helps the environment. It is
a win-win for our country. Americans
deserve clean air. They also deserve
clear rules, and the affordable clean en-
ergy rule gives us both.
I urge every Senator to oppose the
resolution that is coming up to the
floor.
I yield the floor.

RELATING TO A NATIONAL EMER-
GENCY DECLARED BY THE
PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 15,
2019—VETO
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the pending business.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
Veto message to accompany S.J. Res. 54, a
joint resolution relating to a national emer-
gency declared by the President on February
15, 2019.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate Democratic leader.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.J. RES. 77
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
am going to speak for a minute before
I make my unanimous consent request.
Now, we have a crisis here in this
world and here in America. Because of
the President’s precipitous action to
take a small number of American
troops out of northern Syria and green-
light Erdogan’s invasion, we are in real
trouble. We are in trouble in a whole
lot of ways.
Most importantly, we, in New York,
know that a small group of bad people
can cause terrible terrorism with huge
loss of life, even when they are 7,000
miles away. There are about 70,000 ISIS
prisoners and their families now being
guarded by the Kurds, but because of
the President’s action, they will no
longer be guarded.
When we went to the White House
yesterday and asked the President and
his military folks what is the plan to
prevent many of these ISIS would-be
terrorists from escaping, they didn’t
have one. They didn’t have one because
the Kurds have left, and the only peo-
ple who might guard them are the Syr-
ians or the Turks, and neither of them
have a great interest in stopping ISIS.
In fact, I asked the Defense Secretary
Esper: Is there any intelligence that
shows that either the Syrians or the
Turks would do a good job at guarding
the ISIS prisoners and preventing them
from escaping?
No, there was no intelligence to that
effect. As a result, ISIS prisoners are
escaping, will continue to escape, and
America will pay an awful price—an
awful price. The Kurds will pay an
awful price. They have fought along-
side our soldiers. They are our allies.
I talked to my friend from Kentucky
who said the Kurds are better off with
the Syrians. Well, the Kurds sure don’t
think so. They would rather be back to
the status quo. Talk to their leaders.
Certainly, America will not be better
off at all with ISIS prisoners escaping.
Who did this? The President. The
President’s incompetence has put
American lives in danger—simply,
starkly put but accurate. In New York,
as I said, we know well how a small
group of fanatics halfway around the
world can do incredible damage and
kill thousands of Americans here on
our soil.
It should shake every Member of this
body, regardless of their ideology and
regardless of their views on Turkey,
that the President made this decision
so abruptly without heeding the advice
of our commanders on the ground and
now has no plan to manage the con-
sequences.
After meeting with the President
yesterday, it was clear to both Demo-
crats and Republicans in the room that
he does not grasp the gravity of the sit-
uation. He doesn’t understand it. The
most important thing we can do right
now is send President Trump a message
that Congress, the vast majority of
Democrats and Republicans, demand he
reverse course.
I am asking this as a unanimous con-
sent to not go through a long regular
process because the bottom line is, the
longer we wait, the more Kurds will
die—our allies—the more ISIS pris-
oners will escape, and the greater dan-
ger, hour by hour, day by day, America
falls into. We should move this resolu-
tion. We need unanimous consent.
I spoke to my good friend from Ken-
tucky. He said he wanted to put a reso-
lution on the floor about military aid
to Turkey, something many on my side
would be sympathetic to. I offered him
the ability of moving his resolution—
we would have to, of course, get per-
mission of all Members, but I would
work through that—in return for us
moving our resolution. He still said no.
He still said no. I think that is a hor-
rible decision. I think it could well risk
the lives of Americans down the road. I
think it will certainly risk the lives of
many more Kurds, who are our allies.
We will return to this issue. I wish we
could pass it now—the same bill that
passed the House with the vast major-
ity of Republicans, 2 to 1, with Leaders
MCCARTHY and SCALISE and CHENEY
voting for it—and go forward. I under-
stand the motivations of my friend
from Kentucky are sincere and real. He
has had these positions consistently.
They are not the positions of the ma-
jority on his side nor on our side on
many issues. On some, we have worked
together and agreed, but I think it is so
wrong not to move forward. It is so
wrong to let the man, both Democrats
and Republicans saw in the White
House yesterday, stay in control with-
out pressuring him to do better—with-
out pressuring him to do better.
There is no better, quicker, or more
powerful way to pressure the President
to undo the damage he has caused than
to pass a bipartisan joint resolution
that will go directly to his desk. We
will come back to this issue. It will not
go away. It cannot go away for the
safety of America, for the safety of the
Kurds, for some degree of stability, not
chaos in the Middle East that the
President, President Trump, precipi-
tously caused.
I plead with my colleague from Ken-
tucky and anyone else who might ob-
ject to let us have the vote. Let us
make our arguments and prevail. We
are willing to do debate time. Let us
not say it has to be my way or the
highway when so many lives and such
danger is at risk.
I ask unanimous consent that the
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 246, H.J.
Res. 77; that the joint resolution be
read a third time and the Senate vote
on passage with no intervening action
or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Kentucky.
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object. The Constitu-
tion is quite clear on this subject. If
the minority leader wishes to engage in
the civil war in Syria that has been
going on for nearly a decade, we should
obey the Constitution. He should come
to the floor and say we are ready to de-
clare a war, we are ready to authorize
force, and we are going to stick our
troops in the middle of this messy,
messy five-sided civil war, where we
would be ostensibly opposed to the
Turkish Government that has made an
incursion. We would then be opposed to
our NATO ally. It would be the first
time in history that we would be in-
serting ourselves militarily against a
NATO ally.
None of this is to excuse Turkey’s ac-
tion. In fact, today I will offer a resolu-
tion that would actually do something.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5870 October 17, 2019
The resolution that is being offered is
simply a way to have petty, partisan
criticism of the President infect this
body. Mine, actually, would have the
force of law and would prevent any
arms from being sold to Turkey, which
would be a serious rebuke to what they
are doing in Syria.
The Constitution is quite clear. No
authorization has ever been given for
the use of force in Syria. There was no
authorization of declaration of war and
no permission to be there at all. So if
they want to insert themselves in this
civil war, by all means, let’s have a de-
bate. Let’s have a constitutional de-
bate, but I, for one, am not willing to
send one young man or one young
woman, one soldier over there without
a clear mission.
There is no clear mission. There is no
clear enemy. In fact, the war is largely
over. Assad is going to remain, for bet-
ter or worse. So we have a despot on
one side, Erdogan. We have another
despot on the other side, Assad. Here is
the deal: The Kurds have to live there.
It is despairing that they have to live
there, but you know what, their best
chance for survival is having an ally
inside of Syria.
If they become allied, and it appears
they are—if they become allied with
Assad, you know what, there is a possi-
bility of a Kurdish area within Syria.
There may well be an opportunity for a
Kurdish area similar to what has hap-
pened in Iraq.
So I object to this resolution because
this resolution does nothing to fix the
problem. My resolution would stop
arms sales to Turkey, so I will object
to this resolution.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
YOUNG). Objection is heard.
The minority leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. I believe history will
show that the country, the Senate, and
even the Senator from Kentucky will
regret his blocking of this resolution.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2624
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, at this
time I want to ask unanimous consent
that we introduce S. 2624, Turkey arm
sales, which would eliminate any fur-
ther sale of arms to Turkey and, in-
stead of sending a fake message or a
sense of the Senate resolution, would
actually be a binding resolution and
would tell the Turks: Yes, we are seri-
ous. We object to your incursion into
Syria. You need to respect the terri-
torial integrity of Syria, and we there-
fore are no longer going to be selling
you arms.
I ask unanimous consent that this be
passed.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Idaho.
Mr. RISCH. Reserving the right to
object, colleagues, this is a very fluid
situation, as we all know, and, cer-
tainly, Americans who are watching
this from home are confused about the
parties. Then, when laying politics on
top of it, where you have a level of ani-
mus toward the Commander in Chief
that there is at this point, it becomes
very difficult to sort this out. So as
chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, I want to try to lay out
some fundamentals that we need to
deal with.
As has been pointed out by every-
one—and I think everyone agrees—the
situation on the ground in Syria is an
incredibly complex situation. It is dif-
ficult to understand and impossible to
manage at some point because of the
fact that there are dozens and dozens of
tribal entities that share religious or
cultural or tribal affiliations either to-
gether or in opposition. The result of
that is the mess that we have had in
Syria for so long.
On top of that, in northern Syria we
have a situation where the Kurds and
the Turks are at odds with each other.
This has happened just recently, and as
everybody in this body—House and
Senate, Republicans, Democrats—
knows, it is a very serious situation,
but this is not new. The animosity and
fight between the Turks and the Kurds
have been going on for centuries. This
fight between these two groups has
been going on for centuries.
Who are these two groups? First, we
have the Turks on one side, on the
north of the border, who are members
of NATO and are at the very least theo-
retical allies of the United States, al-
though in recent years that alliance
has been strained, and that is an under-
statement of what the situation is.
Recently, they negotiated a deal with
the Russians to buy S–400 missiles,
which is a horrendous problem for a
member of NATO. NATO was formed,
of course, to push back against the
Russians, and now you have a member
of NATO that is engaging with the Rus-
sians in this fashion. This has caused
us real grief.
Those of us who deal with it have
dealt with it for months. We have been
pressing the Turks as hard as we can
about the mistake they have made and
the consequences it is going to have.
They have an order for F–35s. They
make a number of parts for the F–35.
We have told them clearly, in no uncer-
tain terms, for months that they can
have the F–35s or they can have the S–
400s, but they cannot have both. They
insisted that they can. That is simply
not going to happen. I think they are
starting to believe that.
Fast forward to where we are now.
The Turks have amassed 30,000 troops
on the border with Syria and are ready
to come in and take on the Kurds, who
had moved into the northern part of
Syria due to the failed-state status of
Syria.
To say that the President of the
United States is responsible for this is
simply a political statement that isn’t
true. You can dislike the Commander
in Chief, you can dislike the calls that
he makes, but this is a war that has
been going on between these two
groups for centuries. It was going to
happen.
The fact that Erdogan had amassed
30,000 troops on the border was a clear
indication that it was going to go for-
ward. We had about 28 troops between
the two standing armies and admit-
tedly the President of the United
States pulled those 28 troops out of
harm’s way.
In any event, you can argue about
what got us here, what the triggering
factor was, whether it was or wasn’t
going to happen anyway, but what you
can’t argue about is what the situation
is today. There isn’t anyone in this
body that would disagree that this is a
very serious situation.
Turkey is alone on this, by the way.
With the possible exception of the
Qataris, they are alone on this. The
world has been watching this, con-
demning what Turkey is doing. They
have done a cross-border incursion, and
they are facing their age-old enemy,
the Kurds, inside of Syria.
So what do we do about this? Well,
the House has passed a matter that the
minority leader has talked about and
wanted to pass. Senator PAUL has
brought his idea to the floor. But I
want to tell you that the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee has been working on
this since it blew up.
I want to thank my staff, and I want
to thank Senator MENENDEZ’ staff, the
ranking member, who pulled an ‘‘all-
nighter’’ last night, putting together a
piece of legislation, and an ‘‘all-
morninger’’ to get to the point where
we are.
This piece of legislation is going to
be dropped very quickly. Risch-Menen-
dez is a bipartisan piece of legislation
that addresses the issues that all of us
are concerned about. It addresses the
issues with Turkey. It addresses the
issues with the Kurds. It addresses the
issues that the minority leader ad-
dressed regarding the ISIS prisoners
who are being held. It is a good piece of
legislation.
It is going to have numerous—and I
mean numerous—cosponsors to the bill
from both sides of the aisle. So with
that in mind, I am going to enter an
objection to Senator PAUL’s piece of
legislation, not because I object to it as
it stands by itself but because we have
a comprehensive piece of legislation
that does address this that is the result
of consultation between both the ma-
jority and the minority and the admin-
istration to get us a bill that could ac-
tually become law.
From my own standpoint, I am al-
ways at a point where I want to reach
an objective and want to get to a re-
sult. Senator PAUL’s and the other leg-
islation cannot become law. This bipar-
tisan piece of legislation, Risch-Menen-
dez, which addresses this very, very se-
rious issue can become law. As a result
of that, Mr. President, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I applaud
President Trump for the restraint, the

resolve, and the commitment to con-
stitutional principles that he dem-
onstrated when he decided not to have
the United States go into Syria, not to
continue to involve our troops in a
looming conflict in Syria.
I agree that it is a horrible situation.
I agree that we have people running
both Syria and Turkey who are not our
friends and who have shown significant
hostility toward us. It is precisely be-
cause of that and not in spite of it that
we shouldn’t be there, especially when
you take into account that we do not
have a declaration of war relative to
Syria. We do not have an authorization
for the use of military force with re-
gard to Syria. Under our system of gov-
ernment, the U.S. Constitution placed
the power to declare war or otherwise
authorize the use of military force in
Congress. This was no accident. It is
the branch of the Federal Government
most accountable to the people at the
most regular intervals.
This was a significant break from our
previous system of government—the
one that was based in London. In Fed-
eralist No. 69, Alexander Hamilton ex-
plained that this was no accident, that
under the British model, the King, as
the chief executive, had the power to
take the country to war. It was Par-
liament’s job, then, to follow along, to
figure out what to do about it and how
to fund it.
This would not be the case in the
American Republic. This is not the
case under our Constitution. Yet,
sadly, for decades we have had a Con-
gress consisting of Republicans and
Democrats, Senators and Representa-
tives who have allowed the legislative
muscle to atrophy, who have refused
and declined to exercise the power to
declare war.
In that context, I have heard Repub-
licans and Democrats, Senators and
Representatives alike, defer again and
again and again to Presidents of every
conceivable partisan combination, say-
ing: Let the President decide what we
do.
Through our own inaction, we have
essentially relinquished the power to
declare war.
Why does this matter? This is the
only connection the American people
have to the power to declare war. When
we send their brave sons and daughters
into harm’s way, we owe it to them to
have an open, public robust debate and
discussion in which we make a deal
with them, in which we outline the
terms for our engagement.
We don’t have that in Syria. There
are those who are upset that we don’t,
and I understand that they are upset
that we don’t. If they are upset that we
don’t, it is not as though we are a vic-
tim. We are the actor, not the acted
upon. We have the power right here and
right now to bring up a proposal. If
they want to declare war with regard
to Syria, let’s have that discussion.
I am not a fan of war. I am not a fan
of war starting on behalf of the United
States anywhere in the world right
now, but if somebody wants to make
that discussion, let’s have it, and let’s
debate it.
But what people shouldn’t be doing is
criticizing President Trump, who has
shown restraint and shown deference to
the American people, who wants to
protect our sons and daughters who
would be protecting us. He is saying:
Maybe, just maybe, when you have a
bad guy in Turkey, wanting to do some
things in Syria with regard to the
Kurds, maybe, just maybe, when you
take into account the fact that Turkey
is, in fact, a NATO ally and we have a
NATO article 5 obligation to do some-
thing about that, that is going to lead
to full-blown war. We should therefore
respect him. We should be grateful to
him for taking that step of restraint.
This President has been unique in
modern history in not blindly deferring
to the military industrial complex. I
thank him for that and salute his will-
ingness to stand behind our brave men
and women.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana.
Mr. BRAUN. I rise to speak today be-
cause I just finished up visiting all 92
counties in our home State, and every
one of them, especially at the tail end,
have backed what we have been doing
here, especially following the lead of
President Trump.
When it comes to the particular issue
of Syria, I think it begs the question
when people say it green-lighted what
occurred there. What would the reac-
tion have been had we not gotten out
of harm’s way? I am guessing it would
have been a bigger fiasco in many dif-
ferent dimensions.
The minority leader indicated that
Mr. PAUL’s idea was horrible. I want to
make the point that, collectively, over
the last 40 to 50 years, we have been en-
gaged all the way back to the Vietnam
war, where we have been adventure-
some and have done it where we have
not paid for it, and we are now in a
pickle. That is why I was for what the
President decided to do. You cannot
continue being engaged like this when
running trillion-dollar deficits—$22
trillion in debt. Hoosiers understand
that, and most Americans do as well.
So I am going to support RAND
PAUL’s amendment, and I am glad that
the President finally had the guts to do
what most Americans have been for,
and I am disappointed that the other
side in any other situation would have
been for that exact action.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator for Wisconsin.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2598
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise
today on behalf of nearly 25,000 work-
ers and retirees in Wisconsin who have
paid into the Central States Pension
Fund. More than 4 years ago, thou-
sands of Wisconsinites started receiv-
ing letters in the mail telling them
that their pensions—which they had
worked for, planned on, and earned—
would not be paid out in full as was
promised to them.
Instead, those letters said their pen-
sions would be slashed by 50 percent, 60
percent, or sometimes 70 percent. Since
then, those retirees have organized.
They have organized at home. They
have called on their Members of Con-
gress. They have come to Washington
countless times to remind us of the
promises that were made when they
earned their pensions and to fight for a
solution to the pending crisis.
I have been proud to work side-by-
side with these Wisconsin workers and
retirees, and with my colleague Sen-
ator BROWN to introduce the Butch
Lewis Act.
This legislation will put failing mul-
tiemployer pension plans, including
Central States, back on solid ground,
and it does so without cutting the pen-
sions that retirees have earned. It does
so without cutting the pensions retir-
ees have earned. This is not just good
policy for workers and retirees because
putting these pensions back on strong
footing would also protect the small
businesses that employed them from
the threat of closing their doors if
these plans are allowed to fail.
Compounding this looming crisis is
the reality that the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, known as the
PBGC—the government’s insurance for
multiemployer pension plans like Cen-
tral States—is on its own path to insol-
vency by 2025. This week, I reintro-
duced legislation to help address the fi-
nancial challenges of the PBGC. The
Pension Stability Act would add fund-
ing to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation’s multiemployer program
by imposing a fee on financial firms
convicted of financial crimes.
This weekend, I was in Endeavor, WI,
with retirees who meet once a month
at the fire station to update one an-
other on our progress here in Wash-
ington. I have been to many, many
such meetings like that across the
State. In the months since the House
passed the Butch Lewis Act, there
hasn’t been much other progress to
speak of. The Senate hasn’t taken up
the bill, no other proposals have been
offered, and all the while, retirees and
workers in the Central States Pension
Fund continue to doubt their retire-
ment security.
Today, I am asking my colleagues in
the Senate to join me and pass my Pen-
sion Stability Act and to help generate
new revenue to help safeguard the re-
tirement security of millions of Ameri-
cans. If Washington does not act, work-
ers and retirees will face massive cuts
to the pensions they have earned over
decades of hard work. I have come to
the floor many times to remind this
body about the retirees—some of whom
stand to lose more than 50 percent of
their pensions—and still, nothing has
been done. So I am here once again to
remind my colleagues that this is
about a promise that must be kept.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the HELP Committee be dis-
charged from further consideration of
S. 2598 and the Senate proceed to its

objection?

Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving
the right to object, I thank and com-
mend my friend and distinguished col-
league, the Senator from Wisconsin, for
her work on this effort. I am not famil-
iar with this legislation. I don’t serve
on the Health, Education, Labor, and
Pensions Committee. I have friends
who do. I have friends who couldn’t be
here today but who have asked me to
voice objection on their behalf.
On behalf of the senior Senator from
Tennessee, Senator ALEXANDER, I ob-
ject.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Wisconsin.
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, my
message to my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle today is simple: If you
will continue to object to my proposal
to help shore up the PBGC and the pro-
posals from me and other Democratic
colleagues to put failing multiem-
ployer pensions back on solid ground,
then please bring up your own plans.
Bring your ideas to the table, and let’s
work together to solve this pension cri-
sis and protect the retirement security
of Americans because just objecting to
our plans is not an option for the 25,000
workers and retirees I am representing
here today. Doing nothing is not an op-
tion. If we don’t act, we will be break-
ing a promise made to 1.5 million work-
ers and retirees nationwide. Pension
promises must be kept.
Once again, I will say Washington
needs to act, and we need to do it now.
I yield back.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1044
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise yet
again today to speak about an issue
near and dear to my heart and an issue
that has become the focus of many of
my passions here in the Senate, and
that is the Fairness for High-Skilled
Immigrants Act. This is an important
and overwhelmingly bipartisan piece of
legislation. It is a piece of legislation
that passed the House in July by an
overwhelming vote of 365 to 65.
Two of these things should strike the
American people as remarkable: No. 1,
that something with that much of a bi-
partisan margin passed in the House of
Representatives, and No. 2, that it
deals with immigration, and it was
still that overwhelmingly bipartisan.
As I explained in this Chamber be-
fore, the concept of this legislation is
simple. Our current method for allo-
cating green cards caps the total num-
ber of green cards that nationals of any
one country may receive. In practice,
this results in severe de facto discrimi-
nation on the basis of country of ori-
gin. Immigrants from countries with
large populations are restricted to re-
ceiving the same number of visas as
immigrants from smaller countries.
Their wait times have ballooned, in
some cases stretching out literally for
decades. The problem compounds over
time, and it has become even more un-
fair than it was many decades ago
when it was first enacted into law.
I repeat, this happens for absolutely
no reason other than the country in
which the immigrant was born. Let’s
say that two immigrants—one from
India and the other from Germany—
with the exact same skills, the exact
same degrees, and the exact same job
experience apply at the same hour of
the same day for an employment-based
green card. The German might wait
maybe 12 months to receive a green
card. Well, the Indian applicant will al-
most certainly wait a decade or far
more. This kind of system is antithet-
ical to American values and to the in-
terest our country has in recruiting the
very best and the very brightest from
around the world irrespective of race,
religion, or country of origin.
It is simply unacceptable that in 2019
our immigration system still contains
country-of-origin discrimination as a
defining feature. The per-country caps
simply must go. They are wrong. They
were never good policy. Whatever pol-
icy they might have had in mind dec-
ades ago, it escapes me—except, in
fact, that the policy itself was wrong
at the outset. It has become more
wrong over time as these problems
have compounded.
The obviousness of the moral error
embedded within this legislation is
more profound and easily visible today
than it has ever been. If you were to
describe this to anyone, they would
scratch their head and say: Why would
you want to do that unless you are en-
gaging in some type of discrimination
that we as a country understandably
abandoned a long time ago and should
no longer embrace?
The harm inflicted by any kind of in-
vidious discrimination, whether it be
on the basis of race or sex or country of
origin, does not exist simply in the ab-
stract, in the ether; the human suf-
fering caused by it happens to be real
and heartbreaking.
Although, in the time we have here
this afternoon to discuss this, I am
sure I can’t come anywhere close to
doing justice to all the people who are
being harmed by the per-country cap
system, I would like to share at least a
few of their stories so that you under-
stand how this law operates. I find that
when you tell stories about a law, peo-
ple understand the law and they under-
stand what needs to change about the
law a lot more than they would have
otherwise.
Agna Hingu is a registered nurse who
lives in South Jordan, UT, currently
working at a nonprofit healthcare or-
ganization in Utah. She received her
bachelor’s degree in this country. She
has lived in this country for the past 10
years. Languishing in the decade-long
backlog, she is now being forced to con-
sider leaving the United States due to
the continuous uncertainty of her im-
migration status and the incessant re-
newals of temporary visas. If she
leaves, she will take her talents and
her training with her, depriving Utah’s
residents of a smart, skilled, kind, and
caring nurse.
Ashish Patel first came to Utah le-
gally in 2005 on a temporary high-
skilled work visa. Since that time, he
has worked hard at his job, paid taxes,
followed the law, got married, and had
two kids, both of whom were born as
American citizens. In February of 2011,
Mr. Patel’s petition to earn a green
card was approved. Despite this and de-
spite the fact that 8, going on 9 years
have now elapsed, his green card re-
mains unissued. Why? Well, solely be-
cause of the arbitrary, wrong, discrimi-
natory per-country caps. Ashish Patel
is still in the backlog even as immi-
grants of other countries who have ap-
plied years and years after he did and
years and years after he received his
approval have already been granted
permanent resident status. If Mr. Patel
had emigrated from any country in the
world other than India, he would al-
ready have his green card today.
Dr. Chaitanya Mamillapalli is an
endocrinologist who has been serving
in central Illinois for the past 9 years.
He came to the United States in 2007.
He will likely not receive his green
card for at least another decade. His
daughter was 1 year old when she came
with her parents to this country. In a
few years, she will age out of her tem-
porary visa, and Dr. Mamillapalli will
face a decision that confronts many
people stuck in the backlog commu-
nity: Does he separate from his daugh-
ter as she loses her temporary status,
or does he abandon his life in the
United States in order to keep his fam-
ily together?
Dr. Priya Shanmugam lives in Lou-
isiana and is an aerospace engineer
who studied at the University of Ala-
bama and at UCLA. She dreams of
working for NASA. After 13 years in
the backlog, she is still waiting for a
green card. As a result of that, she can-
not fulfill her dream of joining Amer-
ica’s space team and helping put the
first person on Mars. Until she finally
gets her green card, our country will
continue to lose out on her talent.
Dr. Krishnendu Roy is a professor of
computer science and head of the De-
partment of Computer Science at Val-
dosta State University in Georgia. He
studied for his degree in Louisiana and
has lived in the United States for over
16 years. During that time, he shaped
the lives of countless students in Geor-
gia through the classes he teaches by
organizing computing camps for K–12
students and by mentoring the robotics
team in his community. He has fol-
lowed the law, and he has done exactly
what is required of him under our im-
migration system in order to earn his
green card. Yet he remains stuck in the

backlog, with no end to his wait in

Dr. Sri Obulareddy is an oncologist
working just outside Dickinson, ND,
who came to the United States in 2006.
She moved to North Dakota because
the area is experiencing a shortage of
specialized physicians. Her impact on
the community has been invaluable.
Recently, she tried to return from a
trip to India, but approval for her visa
was delayed for 6 weeks, forcing her pa-
tients to travel as far as 100 miles as
they scrambled the find a temporary
physician. The pain this caused her pa-
tients would never have come about if
she had not been subjected to an arbi-
trary, discriminatory cap based on her
country of origin and had already re-
ceived her green card.
Ash Kannan lives in Oklahoma. His
story is a heartbreaking example of the
devastating effects of the long wait for
a green card and the effects that a fam-
ily can endure under this system. Ash
and his wife lost their toddler son to a
congenital disease about 3 years ago.
The illness that took their son could
have been treated had they been able
to move to a different home, one closer
to the medical facility that provided
the necessary treatment. They were
unable to do so, and their son was thus
unable to receive the care he required,
that he needed, because Ash was forced
to remain with the same employer
while he waited in the green card back-
log and, consequently, was unable to
move.
These are just some of the names and
stories of some of the hard-working,
law-abiding immigrants who have
come to the United States to build
lives and to contribute to our commu-
nities but who have been told that be-
cause of the countries in which they
were born, they have to wait decades in
the green card backlog before they can
start living the American dream.
These stories stir us to action, and
they darned well should. They should
remind us that while policymaking is
often messy and complicated, it is
sometimes simple and straightforward
because sometimes you stumble across
something that is a good idea. Some-
times you stumble across something
that was a bad idea that was put into
law decades ago that should be taken
out of the law. Sometimes the solution
to our problems is clear and beyond
question. In those cases, all we need is
the will to act.
I have yet to hear someone offer a
reasoned defense of the per-country
caps as meritorious or sound public
policy on their own terms, and that is
because there is no such defense, at
least not one that anyone would be
willing to defend in public. Country-of-
origin discrimination, whether it be in
our immigration system, in our justice
system, in the employment context, or
in housing, is wrong and inconsistent
with the values upon which our coun-
try was founded. It becomes even more
repugnant when its human con-
sequences are as obvious and tragic and
focused on people of a particular coun-
try of origin as they are here.
With respect to the ancestors of the
people now serving in this body, what
if there had been something in place
that had arbitrarily and unfairly dis-
criminated against people from Eng-
land, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Den-
mark, or other countries from which
people have been immigrating to
America for centuries?
We should think about that for a mo-
ment and think about how we would
never have been able to have enjoyed
the blessings of America. I think it is
equally wrong for us to identify a sin-
gle country that we punish, that we ex-
clude uniquely against other countries
of origin in the context of employ-
ment-based immigrant visas.
I understand and recognize that
while the per-country caps themselves
are completely indefensible—and they
are—some people have concerns about
how eliminating the caps might impact
fraud and abuse within the H–1B sys-
tem. That is a legitimate concern.
To address those very concerns in
this Congress, I have negotiated with
Senator GRASSLEY an amendment to
the Fairness for High-Skilled Immi-
grants Act to include some new protec-
tions for American workers in how we
process applications for H–1B visas.
The amendment does three things.
First, the Grassley amendment would
strengthen the Department of Labor’s
ability to investigate and enforce labor
application requirements. In addition,
it reforms the labor condition applica-
tion process to ensure the complete
and adequate disclosure of information
regarding the employers’ H–1B hiring
practices. Finally, it closes off loop-
holes by which employers could other-
wise circumvent the annual cap on H–
1B visa workers.
These are important and worthy re-
forms that I was happy to add to the
bill. Indeed, we saw an example just
last month of the positive impact these
reforms would have. In September, Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement
announced a $2.5 million settlement
with an Indian consulting firm for H–
1B visa fraud. That firm was exploiting
the so-called ‘‘B–1 in lieu of H–1B’’
loophole. One of the new provisions we
added to the bill this Congress would
help close that specific loophole.
Importantly, the Grassley amend-
ment, like the underlying bill, consists
of provisions that have long enjoyed
support from Members of both sides of
the aisle. They are drawn primarily
from an H–1B reform bill that has been
championed by both Senator GRASSLEY
and Senator DURBIN. They are also
modeled, in large part, on an amend-
ment to the Fairness for High-Skilled
Immigrants Act that Senator SCHUMER
negotiated with Senator GRASSLEY in a
previous Congress.
I am grateful that Senator GRASSLEY
was able to come to the table and work
with me and others in good faith on a
reasonable compromise to this bill. I
believe the deal we struck is a fair and
even-handed way to address long-
standing concerns about our H–1B sys-
tem, while eliminating country-of-ori-
gin discrimination in how we allocate
skills-based green cards.
As I have said in the past, there is no
question that immigration, if not the
single most politically fraught issue, is
one of the most politically fraught
issues in Congress right now. That
makes it all the more important for us
to at least come together to get some-
thing done in those areas in which we
can find common ground. It is a little
bit like eating an elephant. You can’t
swallow the whole thing at once, either
the elephant or the donkey. You have
to do it one bite at a time. Why not
start with an area in which there is
broad-based, bipartisan agreement?
That is what this bill is. The Fairness
for High-Skilled Immigrants Act is an
important step toward common
ground.
Unquestionably, there are broader
debates on immigration policy being
had in Congress and across the country
right now. Some wish to reform our
immigration system by increasing the
number of green cards we issue while
others wish to move to a more merit-
based system. That debate is almost
certainly not going to be resolved this
day, today, or this month or this year
or, perhaps, even during this Congress.
Notably, however, many Senators on
both sides of that debate—ardent
champions of both liberal and conserv-
ative immigration reforms, who ordi-
narily could not be farther apart when
it comes to immigration policy—are
cosponsors of the Fairness for High-
Skilled Immigrants Act. The reason
this is the case is that they recognize
that regardless of what else we might
do to reform our immigration system,
country-of-origin discrimination is
outdated, outmoded, immoral, morally
indefensible, and inconsistent with our
values. It is also a problem that we can
solve right now.
The other reason the Fairness for
High-Skilled Immigrants Act has been
so successful in attracting support
from both sides of the aisle and from
every end along the political con-
tinuum is that we have scrupulously
avoided the typical poison pill provi-
sions that so often doom attempts at
immigration reform. We have also
quite carefully avoided this becoming
about so many things that it is going
to become controversial no matter
what.
This bill is not comprehensive immi-
gration reform. It is not anything close
to that. That is, in fact, why this bill is
something that we can get done right
now. It is the reason it was able to pass
the House of Representatives with 365
votes.
While it does not fix many of the
other flaws that plague other compo-
nents of our broken, outdated, out-
moded, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly-era
immigration law system, it is a great
and important step toward reform. If
we are ever going to have a chance at

modernizing and repairing our immi-
gration laws, we need to recognize that
we cannot necessarily solve all of our
problems at once. The fact that this is
the case should not stand in our way of
starting the work the American people
sent us here to do.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on the Judici-
ary be discharged from further consid-
eration of H.R. 1044 and that the Sen-
ate proceed to its immediate consider-
ation. I ask unanimous consent that
the Lee amendment at the desk be
agreed to, that the bill, as amended, be
considered read a third time and
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, as I under-
stand it, we have only 6 minutes until
the rollcall vote, and I don’t want to
inconvenience my colleagues.
I would like to ask permission from
the Senator of Utah to make my unani-
mous consent request the first item of
business after the rollcall vote is an-
nounced.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection to the Senator for Illinois’
request?
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, in reserving
the right to object, I want to make
sure I understand that the Senator
wants to make his live UC request
after the rollcall vote.
Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.
Mr. LEE. There is no objection.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Is there objection to the original re-
quest?
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, I would say
the following: I have been on the floor
of the Senate more often than any
other Senator to ask for immigration
reform. Our system is broken. As we
debate this important issue, the Gal-
leries are filled with people who are
following this debate personally be-
cause it literally affects their lives and
their families and their futures. This
Senator has been willing to move for-
ward on comprehensive immigration
reform. Sadly, the Senator on the
other side has not supported that. I
hope he will consider doing it.
In the meantime, though, what are
we going to do about the current issue
of an annual quota of no more than
140,000 EB immigrant visas and more
than 500,000 applicants of Indian de-
scent who are asking for permission to
move forward with EB–2 green cards
and their lives?
What the Senator from Utah has sug-
gested is that we shouldn’t increase the
140,000 annual cap. I think that is
wrong. If you follow Senator LEE’s pro-
posal and do exactly what he says—
give these visas only to those who are
waiting in line who are of Indian de-
scent and give no visas to the rest of
the world—in 10 years, there will still
be over 165,000 people of Indian descent
waiting in line, and the rest of the
world will have been excluded. This is
unfair. It doesn’t make sense.
I will offer a unanimous consent re-
quest to lift that 140,000 cap, and with-
in 5 years, all who are waiting in line
will get their chances for green cards—
5 years—but not at the expense of the
rest of the world. Let’s do this in a fair
fashion. While we are at it, it is unfair
that your spouses and children are
being counted when it comes to the
140,000. My bill exempts that. They are
no longer going to be bound by any
quota.
Secondly, if your children are aging
out, if they are reaching the age of 21—
a new legal status and new worries for
you and your family—I eliminate that
problem completely. My approach is
one that will solve the problem by lift-
ing the legal immigration for talented
people like many who have gathered
here today.
The Senator from Utah says he can’t
support that. I hope he will reconsider.
Lifting that cap is what we need to
do—lifting the country quotas, making
certain that those in line finally get
their chances. This is all within 5
years, which is something the under-
lying bill does not do. So I hope the
Senator from Utah will agree to my
bill that I will be offering as an alter-
native after this rollcall vote.
I object to this bill.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, how much
time remains?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There
are 2 minutes remaining.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I will be
brief.
Just as the per-country cap system is
a quintessential example of the poorly
designed, broken system and of what a
poorly designed broken system looks
like, the objection that we have heard
today is, I fear, emblematic of the bro-
ken state of affairs that we face when
it comes to the immigration process.
I mentioned earlier that one of the
reasons this bill has been able to
achieve as much support and as many
cosponsors as it has and why it was
able to pass the House of Representa-
tives with 365 votes is that we have
avoided poison pill efforts. The adjust-
ment of the overall numbers that my
friend and distinguished colleague from
Illinois has proposed would doom this
bill. He knows that it would doom this
bill.
To what avail? To what end? What
good would it do to doom this bill?
The fact still remains that regardless
of where we put the overall number for
employment-based green cards, we still
have a problem in that we are treating
people from India unfairly, arbitrarily,
and discriminatorily. This has impacts
everywhere. In Illinois today, there are
over 40,000 green card applicants, plus
their spouses and children, who are
stuck in an interminable green card
backlog that is morally indefensible.
We must change this. I hope and I en-
courage my colleague to change his
mind. We can pass this today. We could
make our country a better place as a
result.
Thank you.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there
any time remaining?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is
no time remaining.

S.J. RES. 54
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in Feb-
ruary of this year, Senator UDALL and
I joined in introducing a resolution to
terminate the national emergency dec-
laration. On March 14, 59 Members of
this body joined together in a strong
bipartisan majority to pass the com-
panion House Resolution and send it to
the President. Unfortunately, the
President chose to veto that resolu-
tion, and the House vote to override
the veto fell short.
Last month, a bipartisan majority
again came together in the Senate to
pass a resolution introduced by Sen-
ator UDALL, Senator SHAHEEN, and my-
self to reverse the President’s national
emergency declaration. Unfortunately,
but not unexpectedly, the President
has chosen to veto this resolution
again, and we will be voting shortly on
whether to override that veto.
Before we do so, I would like to take
a few minutes to speak to the funda-
mental issue raised by the emergency
declaration: It directly conflicts with
the ‘‘power of the purse’’ vested in Con-
gress by the Framers of our Constitu-
tion.
The question presented by this veto
of the resolution is not whether you
are for a border wall or against a bor-
der wall, nor is the question whether
you believe security at our southern
border should be strengthened or
whether it is sufficient.
In fact, the question is, simply; Do
we want the executive branch, now or
in the future, to hold the power of the
purse, a power the Founders delib-
erately entrusted to Congress?
Throughout our history, the courts
have consistently held that ‘‘only Con-
gress is empowered by the Constitution
to adopt laws directing monies to be
spent from the U.S. treasury.’’ This
view is central to several ongoing cases
challenging the President’s national
emergency declaration.
I have consistently supported funding
for the construction of physical bar-
riers and strengthening security on our
southern border. I will continue to sup-
port those efforts and believe that they
are important, but I cannot support the
President unilaterally deciding to take
money that has been appropriated for
one purpose and diverting that money
for another purpose.
The system of checks and balances
established by the Founders gives Con-
gress the power to protect our author-
ity on our own. That is what this reso-
lution does, and I urge my colleagues

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this

Two-thirds of the Senators voting, a
quorum being present not having voted
in the affirmative, the joint resolution,
on reconsideration, fails to pass over
the veto of the President of the United
States.
The Senator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I asked
unanimous consent before the rollcall
to be recognized to make a unanimous
consent request. I would like to take
that opportunity now, unless there is
some other item of business before the
Senate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is
none.
The Senator from Illinois.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2603
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let’s
start with math, basic math, Andrew
Yang math. Here is what it boils down
to. Each year, we have 140,000 employ-
ment-based visas issued in the United
States—140,000. A decision was made
several years ago that politicians were
playing favorites, picking countries
that would get more of one and more of
another, and so they put in country
quotas, country caps—7 percent. I will
do the math, being a liberal arts law-
yer. It is about 10,000 per year, per
country—no more than 10,000 per coun-
try, per year, if 7 percent of the total is
our cap.
The problem is obvious. There are
some 520,000 people of Indian descent in
the United States who came here le-
gally on H–1B visas, for example, who
have worked here for a period of time,
and who now want to stay in the
United States. From this Senator’s
point of view, you are welcome. We
need you. You brought extraordinary
skills that we need to our country. I
want you to stay. But many have found
that they get into a queue that is so
long, and because of the limitations of
the cap, they can’t even imagine living
long enough to ever get the green card
they are waiting for, the green card
that can ultimately lead to citizenship.
Senator LEE comes to the floor with
a bill, and his bill says as follows: We
are going to take care of those waiting
in line, which is primarily over half a
million of Indian descent, and we will
close down immigration from other
countries during this period of time,
EB–2 visas. So it would be to the ben-
efit of those of Indian descent, who are
the vast majority of those waiting in
line, but at the cost of every other
country in the world that has anyone
who can come in and qualify for an EB–
2 visa. Even his approach that I just de-
scribed—if you follow it through, at
the end of 10 years, there would still be
165,000 people of Indian descent still
waiting in line in 10 years. That is not
fair. It is not right.
Last Sunday, I had a meeting in
Schaumburg, IL. As I came to the
meeting—it was a Democratic Party
breakfast—there were about 200 people
standing with signs with my name on
them. That will wake you up on a Sun-
day morning. They were there to say:
DURBIN, don’t stop LEE’s bill.
I met with many of them afterward.
I would have met with all of them. I
am prepared to. One of them told me a
story. He is a physician from my home-
town of Springfield, IL. He brought his
12-year-old daughter along with him, a
beautiful young girl.
He said: Senator, I am waiting in
line. I don’t know if I will ever get a
green card. What is going to happen
with my daughter when she reaches
age 21? She can no longer be my de-
pendent and stay in the United States.
What is going to happen to her? Is she
supposed to go back to India? In the
meantime, how is she going to go to
college? What is her status in this
country?
These are perfectly legitimate ques-
tions. I have an answer for all of these
questions, and I will tell you what it is.
First, we lift the 140,000 cap. That is
what is holding us back here. Why is
140,000 of these EB visas a year a magic
number? It is not. We are a nation of
350 million people. We have at least a
million legal immigrants coming in
each year. To expand the cap for those
who are seeking the EB visas beyond
140,000 to people with skills who are al-
ready living in the United States and
who want to stay here and continue to
work is perfectly reasonable to me.
That is what my bill proposes, and it
does two other things. This bill also
says that we are not going to count
your dependents when it comes to the
annual quotas. So if it is 140,000, we are
talking about the actual bread-
winners—140,000. If you are married,
have a spouse and two children, you
are not seeking four of these visas—
only one—and your spouse and depend-
ents automatically come along with
you, in my bill. They are not counted
against the 140,000.
The third point: When you make ap-
plication, it freezes in place, for legal
reasons, the status of your dependents.
So if it takes 2 or 3 years, and that
daughter of yours becomes 21 years of
age, it is no different—she is still going
to come in with you based on your ap-
plication.
To me, that is a reasonable way of
approaching it. I have said to my
friends in the Indian-American commu-
nity, in the Indian community in Illi-
nois: I am not against your being here.
I want you to be here. I have an ap-
proach that will allow you to be a part
of our future. You have been an impor-
tant part of America to this point. I
want you to continue to be, and my ap-
proach will allow it.
Senator LEE of Utah comes to the
floor and says: DURBIN, if you lift that
140,000 cap, you will doom this bill.
I have just spoken to him, and I have
several times. I will not doom this bill
if he will support it. If he, as a Repub-
lican, will gather support for this bill,
we can lift the number of people who
will be eligible under these skilled im-
migrant visas to be part of America’s
future. We can do that together.
I am finding, even as I talk to Repub-
lican colleagues here, that they feel we
should be opening up the skilled visa
opportunities for legal immigration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5876 October 17, 2019
The sentiment is growing, and it
should. I want people who have real
skills that they either learned in the
United States or earned in the United
States to be part of the growth of our
economy and the future and part of
America. When it comes to diversity,
count me in.
My mother was an immigrant to this
country, brought here at the age of 2.
Her son stands right here with a full-
time government job. That is the
American dream, right? I basically be-
lieve in immigration, and I believe in
the diversity of America. But what will
not work and what will not succeed is
the notion that we can somehow favor
just one group from one country at the
expense of every other country.
We found that what has happened
since Senator LEE started moving for-
ward with this is we have people from
a variety of different countries around
the world saying: You mean you are
going to cut us off entirely? We can’t
have any EB–2 visas for 10 years? You
are saying that is going to apply to
Canada, Mexico, the European nations,
and all of Asia as well? That is unfair.
Why would you cut us off to give op-
portunity to those from India? That
isn’t fair.
We have to have a more balanced ap-
proach. I think my approach resolves
that and will solve that. I ask Senator
LEE to consider it.
I would also say to him—in the
course of bringing this measure to the
floor, Senator LEE has been negoti-
ating with Members of his own polit-
ical party. That is all right. I under-
stand that. I have been in this business
for a while. But he should be talking to
people on both sides of the aisle. What
he has given are so-called carve-outs to
the 140,000. I probably wouldn’t argue
with any single carve-out in substance
if he wants to give them to nurses or
medical professions, but each time he
makes a carve-out to the 140,000, he
lengthens the long waiting period for
those of Indian descent.
As far as I am concerned, the real an-
swer is to increase legal immigration
to the United States. My bill would do
that. It will take the country caps off,
take the 140,000 cap off. It would open
the door for those who have been wait-
ing in line—and many have for years, if
not decades. Stop discriminating
against their children. Through no
fault of their own, they have been
stuck in the line with them. Their
legal status shouldn’t change. And
don’t count the dependents—the
spouses and children—against the
quota, whatever the number might be
in the future.
I think that is a reasonable way to do
this, but to do that, you have to accept
one premise: that immigration is good
for America. I believe it is. I believe it
always has been. I think the diversity
of this country is its strength. People
come from every corner of the Earth,
ready to make great personal and fam-
ily sacrifices so that they and certainly
their children will have a chance they
never would have had where they were
born. That is the key to what is dif-
ferent about this country and why we
should honor it.
Let’s not apologize for increasing
legal immigration, particularly of peo-
ple with proven skills. Let’s celebrate
that they want to be part of America’s
future.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Judiciary Committee be
discharged from S. 2603 and that the
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration; further, that the bill be
considered read a third time and passed
and the motion to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with
no intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving
the right to object, the request the
Senator is describing is not one that
can pass the body and certainly is not
one that can pass this body unani-
mously.
He is absolutely right. My friend and
distinguished colleague from Illinois is
correct in noting that I have had con-
versations and negotiations with Re-
publicans, and I have also had con-
versations and negotiations with
Democrats. I have been working on
this for nearly 9 years. At every mo-
ment, we have made concessions to
people on both sides of the aisle.
I wish the solution he is offering
today were something that could allow
us to pass the Fairness for High-Skilled
Immigrants Act. Alas, it is not.
I would note that it is not as though
this is something new or objectionable
or even something that the passage of
which would amount to a concession on
his part. For one thing, the Fairness
for High-Skilled Immigrants Act is a
bill that he was an original cosponsor
of in a previous Congress. This is his
bill. You might ask what is different
about the bill he championed a few
years ago and the substitute amend-
ment I put forward earlier today. The
answer is that, aside from a short sub-
section that temporarily alleviates
nursing shortages in parts of this coun-
try, the only thing we have changed is
that we have added a variety of new
provisions to combat some abuse in the
H–1B program.
As I have said, these provisions are
drawn almost verbatim from the Dur-
bin-Grassley H–1B reform bill, of which
my colleague from Illinois has long
been the lead Democratic cosponsor.
The only other thing that has
changed from the time when the Sen-
ator from Illinois would have stood by
my side instead of in opposition and
helped to pass this bill is the problem
that he sought to solve when he sup-
ported this bill. That very same prob-
lem still exists and has gotten worse.
As I indicated earlier, there are 40,000
green card applicants in Illinois alone,
plus there are thousands of children
stuck in this awful backlog. These are
individuals whose children are aging
out of their temporary visas, and they
are forced to return to a country they
left behind long ago—a country that, in
many cases, their children don’t know
and have never known.
To repeat, the amendment that I
offer today and that has been the sub-
ject of some of my colleague’s remarks
this afternoon in his unanimous con-
sent request consists of nothing more
than the Fairness for High-Skilled Im-
migrants Act, of which my colleague
from Illinois was once a leading spon-
sor, and a series of H–1B reforms that
he himself has long sought to enact. If
passed, it would provide relief to many
hard-working families from both his
State and for mine. Yet he objects. As
he objects, he offers up something else
that he knows cannot possibly get
close to passing this body by unani-
mous consent. Yet we can do that
today. We can do that right now if he
would lift his objection. He knows that
I cannot, and I will not, and on that
basis, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard.
The Senator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would
like to make two points regarding the
comments from my friend from Utah. I
know he has to leave for another ap-
pointment.
The first point I want to make is that
what I support today is what I intro-
duced and voted for when 68 Senators,
Democrats and Republicans, passed a
comprehensive immigration reform
bill, which he opposed.
I hope that shows my good faith and
intent when it comes to this issue. I
am not just thinking of something
today that has never been considered
on the Senate floor. It has passed on
the Senate floor in a previous Senate,
and I think it can pass again with your
active support.
The second point I want to make is
this. For us to have dueling unanimous
consent requests and both to object in
this debate is really unfair to the peo-
ple who have gathered in this Gallery
today, as well as those who are fol-
lowing this debate on television with
literally the fate of their family and
future again in our hands.
I would like to ask you a favor to
consider the following. When Senator
KENNEDY objected on your behalf yes-
terday, or the day before, in a similar
manner, he suggested that we push this
issue forward for a hearing in the Sub-
committee on Border Security and Im-
migration of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary where we both serve. That com-
mittee is not overworked. It considered
one bill this year and no amendments.
So let us try to prevail on the chair-
man of that subcommittee to have a
hearing on this subject and to bring
out all the facts before the sub-
committee and the full committee in
the hopes that we can find some sort of
reasonable, bipartisan compromise. If
you will join me in that request, I hope
we can prevail on Senator GRAHAM and
Senator CORNYN.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5877
October 17, 2019
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank my
colleague for his constructive observa-
tions there. With respect to the Gang
of 8 legislation, yes, it passed through
this body, and, yes, I voted against
that, as did a number of my colleagues.
My view is, that was a piece of legisla-
tion that while it entailed a lot of work
by a lot of people who were trying to
make things better, it was doomed at
the outset for failure because the mes-
sage of that bill and of those who were
pushing it was essentially you either
pass all of this bill and all of its re-
forms—a large number of which and
the majority of which I agreed with—or
you pass nothing. We were literally
told that. It is either this entire pack-
age or it is nothing. We spent weeks in
the Committee on the Judiciary debat-
ing it and discussing it. I personally
proposed dozens of amendments to
that.
What emerged at the end of that
from the committee was a—this has
been 6 years, so my colleague will for-
give me if I don’t remember the exact
numbers. It was about a 700-page bill.
When we got to the floor, what we de-
bated and discussed was substituted
out at the last minute. What we ended
up getting was another bill that was, as
I recall, 1,200 pages long. It was a dif-
ferent bill.
The message was the same with both
of them. This is a package deal. You ei-
ther reform all of what this bill re-
forms and do it at once or you get none
of it. Many of the sponsors of that leg-
islation made clear that they would op-
pose any smaller effort.
I believe this is exactly the opposite
of the type of solution that will work.
What is going to work here is if we
start with incremental, step-by-step
legislation. If we start with something
the Senator from Illinois has himself in
the past sponsored, both as to the Fair-
ness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act
itself and as to the substance, the nuts
and bolts of the Grassley amendment—
he has been on the cutting edge of sup-
porting both of those things. If not
here, where? If not us, who? If not now,
when? This is what we need to do. I am
going to continue to come to the floor.
I am going to continue to seek unani-
mous consent and to pass this every
way I can.
As to my colleague’s suggestion with
regard to a committee hearing. This
hasn’t, of course, been the topic of
committee hearings in the past, and it
has been fully discussed. I would, of
course, welcome any further com-
mittee action that the chairman might
choose to hold, and I would be happy to
have any committee action that, of
course, isn’t mine to offer or give, but
I would always prefer more consider-
ation of the Fairness for High-Skilled
Immigrants Act than less. So if that is
what we have to do, great, but I don’t
believe any further factual develop-
ment is necessary here.
Just for the record, I want to state
this bill is ready to pass right now.
This bill has 365 votes on the House
floor right now. This bill would become
law right now, would pass out of the
Senate and would pass out of the Sen-
ate in a form that would be passed out
of the House of Representatives, ulti-
mately, right now but for this objec-
tion.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Utah
is my friend, and we have worked close-
ly together on important legislation. I
trust him and respect him, though we
disagree on some of the merits on this
issue.
What I think I heard was an offer,
which I am going to accept, of a good-
faith, bipartisan request of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary to have a hear-
ing on this measure. It will be the first
hearing on it, and I think it is long
overdue.
In terms of the comprehensive immi-
gration reform, I don’t want to dwell
on history, but we went through hun-
dreds of amendments in Judiciary and
scores of amendments on the floor. Ev-
eryone had their day in court and their
opportunity to come up with a good
idea, and, yes, it did come down to one
bill at the end. You had to vote yes or
no. I voted yes, and he voted the other
way.
This bill is not even close to it in
terms of deliberation and in terms of
amendments and that process. So let’s
start the right way. Let’s have a hear-
ing. You have the majority party on
the committee, so I am not going to
pull anything over on you, but let’s do
it.
For the people who are following this
and saying: Well, how did that end? Let
us say to them it ended by both of us
agreeing to pursue a committee hear-
ing on this important subject as soon
as possible and appealing to the chair
of the Committee on the Judiciary to
ask for that hearing.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank my
friend, the Senator from Illinois, and I
appreciate his dedication to detail and
to the hard work he has put into the
area of immigration and reform.
Yes, you are right. That was a dif-
ficult process. It went through 6 years
ago, and I commend you, even though
you and I reached different conclusions
as to the ultimate outcome of that leg-
islation.
My point there is simply to say: It is,
and properly should and always is,
going to be the case that it can be easi-
er to get something done that is more
narrowly focused. In this case, we have
a bill the Senator from Illinois has
himself cosponsored in the past. It has
been modified by another provision
that he has also sponsored in the past.
We should be able to do this one.
It is not my place to commit on be-
half of the Committee on the Judiciary
or its chairman whether we are going
to have hearings. I reiterate my view
that no further factual development of
this is necessary. I don’t believe a hear-
ing is necessary.
I am never going to object to simply
holding more hearings on it, and if that
is what the chairman of the Committee
on the Judiciary is inclined to do, I am
certainly not going to interfere with
that. In the meantime, I am going to
continue to do everything I can to get
this thing passed. It is ready to pass. It
is ready to pass right now. I am going
to continue to find every way possible
to get this the consideration it de-
serves.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am
coming to the floor to speak on a dif-
ferent subject, but I do want to ac-
knowledge that this is an issue I follow
as well. I actually cosponsored Senator
LEE’s bill. I do hope what my friend
from Illinois proposed, in terms of a
process—that that process will take
place and that we can get this legisla-
tion, or a variation thereof, passed
through the Senate; that we deal with
this issue is something I hear a lot
from my constituents in Virginia—spe-
cifically, Northern Virginia.
Again, although no piece of legisla-
tion is perfect, I think the direction
Senator LEE has put forward is one I
carefully considered before I cospon-
sored the legislation. Again, the only
way we are going to get this resolved is
if we go through this process. Nobody
on the Senate works harder on immi-
gration issues and with more passion
and willingness to get to yes on an
issue than the Senator from Illinois, so
I thank him for his work as well.
TRIBUTE TO VICTORIA BRAHM
Mr. President, I came down here
today to address the question I came
for, to actually continue the tradition
of my friend Senator Ted Kaufman. I
had the distinction of serving here as a
staff member for a long time and filled
in for a few years when Senator Biden
became the Vice President of the
United States.
What Senator Ted Kaufman did was
he came, during his tenure in the Sen-
ate, on a regular basis, came to this
floor and highlighted the contributions
of exceptional Federal employees. He
highlighted the work they do every day
to make our Nation and communities
safer, healthier, and stronger.
I came to the floor earlier this year
to congratulate three Virginians who
were recognized by the Partnership for
Public Service as finalists for the Serv-
ice to America Medals. Within the
world of Federal employees, this award
may not be as well known as the Os-
cars, but the award, the Service to
America Medals, are known as the
‘‘Sammies.’’
During my time on the floor earlier,
when I spoke about the Virginians who
were nominated, I spoke about Ambas-
sador Michael Kozak from Arlington,
Kara De Castro from Haymarket, and
John Wagner from Ashburn. Each of
these public servants have made sig-
nificant contributions to our national

security, as well as to global peace and
human rights. We are indebted to them
for their contributions, and I congratu-
late them again for their much de-
served recognition as finalists.
Unfortunately, none of this year’s
winners hail from Virginia. Still, I
want to congratulate the 2019 Federal
Employee of the Year, Victoria Brahm
from Wisconsin. Ms. Brahm is a career
public servant who has spent more
than 37 years working in the VA sys-
tem.
Since 2015, she has served as the di-
rector of the Tomah VA Medical Cen-
ter. When she arrived, the center was
struggling with unsafe medical prac-
tices, high staff turnover, and other
issues impacting the quality of care
that veterans were receiving. In the
years since her arrival, there has been
a rise in patient satisfaction and a dra-
matic drop in the use of opioids and
other prescription pain relievers.
Under Director Brahm’s leadership,
preventable inhospital complications
have also dropped significantly, and
the center has risen from one of the
worst ranked hospitals in the VA sys-
tem to the top 10 percent. This remark-
able turnaround that is making life
better for our veterans is due in many
ways to the work of Ms. Brahm. Con-
gratulations, Ms. Brahm, and thank
you for your service.
Congratulations, as well, to all of
this year’s award winners who hail
from around the country, not just
Washington, DC. While the Federal
workers we recognize today are excep-
tional, the truth is they are not the ex-
ception. Federal employees across the
country dedicate their lives to serving
the country, to protecting its people,
and to making sure our tax dollars are
properly spent.
Unfortunately, this commitment has
not been honored by the Trump admin-
istration. In addition to the longest
government shutdown in history, Fed-
eral workers have endured pay freezes,
hiring freezes, bad-faith collective bar-
gaining, and other efforts to dismantle
our nonpolitical civil service. This is
wrong. It is also unsustainable, and ul-
timately it will be everyday Americans
who suffer the consequences of this ad-
ministration’s actions. If you drive out
and drive down the morale of our work-
force, the American people end up with
a less good product.
I commit that I will continue fight-
ing in the Senate to ensure this coun-
try is keeping its commitment to Fed-
eral workers because they deserve so
much better than the treatment they
have received recently.
FUTURE ACT
Mr. President, let me now, for a cou-
ple of moments, turn to another impor-
tant issue where I fear we are not keep-
ing our commitments, and that is our
commitment to our Nation’s histori-
cally Black colleges and universities,
also known as HBCUs.
I will talk briefly in support of legis-
lation introduced by my colleague
from Alabama, Senator JONES, and my
colleague from South Carolina, Sen-
ator SCOTT. The legislation they intro-
duced is called the FUTURE Act.
The FUTURE Act would provide a 1-
year reauthorization of the mandatory
funding for HBCUs and other minority-
serving institutions that already ex-
pired on September 30. This is a com-
monsense bipartisan fix that is fully
paid for, and it would allow us to keep
our commitment to institutions across
the country that are educating histori-
cally underrepresented and under-
served students.
Virginia is home to five outstanding
HBCUs whose funding would be pre-
served by this legislation: Virginia
State University, Norfolk State Uni-
versity, Hampton University, Virginia
Union University, which I was proud,
prior to my tenure in government, to
serve on the board of, and Virginia Uni-
versity of Lynchburg. All told, these
institutions received nearly $4 million
in funding last year that is now at risk
unless we pass the FUTURE Act.
I have letters of support here from
the Presidents of Hampton, Norfolk
State, and Virginia Union. These let-
ters highlight the FUTURE Act and
the importance of this funding to the
representative universities.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that these letters be printed in the
RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
HAMPTON UNIVERSITY,
Hampton, VA, July 16, 2019.
Hon. MARK WARNER,
U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SENATOR WARNER: I am writing to re-
quest that you cosponsor S. 1279, the Fos-
tering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking
Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act
sponsored by Senator Doug Jones (D–AL) and
Senator Tim Scott (R–SC). This bipartisan,
bicameral bill was written to extend impor-
tant mandatory funding for education in the
sciences, technology, engineering, and math-
ematics (STEM) in Title III, Part F of the
Higher Education Act of 1965 until Sep-
tember 30, 2021.
Title III, Part F, benefits Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and
other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs)
by providing mandatory funds that allow
these institutions to better serve their stu-
dents in the STEM fields. As I am sure you
are aware, a STEM education is crucial to
the growth and continued development of
our economy. Hampton University and other
institutions have benefited greatly from the
availability and usage of these funds.
A report released by the White House Na-
tional Science and Technology Council stat-
ed that the ‘‘national benefits of a strong
STEM foundation cannot be fully realized
until all members of society have equitable
access to STEM education and [until] there
is much broader participation by those his-
torically underserved and underrepresented
in STEM fields . . .’’ The report goes on to
highlight the importance of diversity in the
workplace leading to more engaged, innova-
tive, and higher-performing organizations.
Hampton serves all students, some of whom
are low-income, first generation post-sec-
ondary students of color; an underserved
population. One benefit of funding through
Title III, Part F is that it dlrectly helps
achieve the goal of diversifying our work-
force and ensuring more underrepresented
students are entering STEM fields.
The mandatory funds included in Title III,
Part F, were originally established by the
College Cost Reduction and Access Act for
the years of 2008–2009, retained in the Higher
Education Opportunity Act of 2008, and then
extended until 2019 in the Health Care Edu-
cation and Reconciliation Act of 2010. All
three pieces of legislation were passed in the
House and Senate on a bipartisan basis show-
ing support for this crucial stream of fund-
ing.
However, this stream of funding is sched-
uled to expire September 30, 2019. Therefore,
it is imperative that this bill passes both
Chambers and becomes law before the expi-
ration date. Again, I ask that you cosponsor
S. 1279 and help institutions of higher edu-
cation, HBCUs in particular, continue to pro-
vide the much needed services to the stu-
dents on our campuses.
With all good wishes,
WILLIAM R. HARVEY,
President.
NORFOLK STATE UNIVERSITY,
September 5, 2019.
Hon. MARK WARNER,
U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SENATOR WARNER: On behalf of Nor-
folk State University, I ask your support in
cosponsoring S. 1279, the Fostering Under-
graduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for
Education (FUTURE) Act sponsored by Sen-
ator Doug Jones (D–AL) and Senator Tim
Scott (R–SC). This bipartisan, bicameral bill
would extend important mandatory funding
for education in the sciences, technology, en-
gineering, and mathematics (STEM) in Title
III, Part F of the Higher Education Act of
1965 until September 30, 2021.
The mandatory funding included in Title
III, Part F, was established in 2008 by the
College Cost Reduction and Access Act. The
funding was later extended through author-
izations in the Higher Education Oppor-
tunity Act of 2008, and the Health Care Edu-
cation and Reconciliation Act of 2010. All
three pieces of legislation passed in the
House and Senate on a bipartisan basis with
strong congressional support. Current fund-
ing will expire on September 30, 2019.
Title III, Part F, benefits Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and
other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs)
by providing mandatory funds that allow
these institutions to support their students
in the STEM fields. Whether it be innova-
tions in cybersecurity, or emerging research
in deep space exploration, Norfolk State Uni-
versity has a longstanding history of pre-
paring students to excel in the STEM fields.
Title III, Part F is a critical resource that
has played an important role in NSU’s suc-
cess.
Continued funding for Title III, Part F is
crucial to the growth and continued develop-
ment of our economy and this University.
Your cosponsorship and vote of support for
S. 1279 is very much needed, and will rep-
resent a sound investment in America’s fu-
ture.

Fostering Undergraduate Talent by

October 17, 2019
(D–AL) and Senator Tim Scott (R–SC). This
bipartisan, bicameral bill was written to ex-
tend important mandatory funding for edu-
cation in the sciences, technology, engineer-
ing, and mathematics (STEM) in Title III,
Part F of the Higher Education Act of 1965
until September 30, 2021.
Title III, Part F, benefits Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU’s)
and other Minority-Serving Institutions
(MSIs) by providing mandatory funds that
allow these institutions to better serve their
students in the STEM fields. STEM edu-
cation is crucial to the growth and continued
development of our economy, and my insti-
tution has benefited greatly from the avail-
ability and usage of these funds.
A report released by the White House’s Na-
tional Science and Technology Council said
that the ‘‘national benefits of a strong STEM
foundation cannot be fully realized until all
members of society have equitable access to
STEM education and [until] there is much
broader participation by those historically
underserved and underrepresented in STEM
fields . . .’’ The report goes on to highlight
the importance of diversity in the workplace
leading to more engaged, innovative, and
higher-performing organizations. Like my
institution, HBCUs and MSIs serve all stu-
dents, but primarily serve students who are
low-income, first generation, and students of
color, which would directly help achieve the
goal of diversifying our workforce and ensur-
ing more underrepresented students are en-
tering the STEM fields.
The mandatory funds included in Title III,
Part F were originally established by the
College Cost Reduction and Access Act for
the years of 2008–2009, retained in the Higher
Education Opportunity Act of 2008, and then
extended until 2019 in the Health Care Edu-
cation and Reconciliation Act of 2010. All
three pieces of legislation were passed in the
House and Senate on a bipartisan basis show-
ing support for this crucial stream of fund-
ing.
This stream of funding is scheduled to ex-
pire September 30, 2019, so it is imperative
that this bill passes both Chambers and be-
come law before the expiration date. Again,
I ask that you co-sponsor S. 1279 and help me
continue to provide the much-needed serv-
ices to the students on my campus.
Sincerely,
HAKIM J. LUCAS, PH.D.,
President & CEO.
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, re-
cently our colleagues in the House
passed this important legislation on a
bipartisan basis. Now it is time for the
Senate to do the same. Let’s pass the
FUTURE Act without further delay
and then work together on a com-
prehensive reauthorization of the High-
er Education Act.
As Dr. Harry Williams, president of
the Thurgood Marshall College Fund,
said, America’s HBCUs ‘‘simply do not
have the time to wait for Congress to
work out a deal.’’ So let’s put our
broader policy differences aside for now
and honor the commitments we made
to HBCUs and other minority-serving
institutions before Congress’s inaction
harms students in Virginia and around
the country.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to an-
nounce a new use of an old require-
ment. I rise to speak about the latest
Senate scorekeeping report which I
filed this week in the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD. The CONGRESSIONAL RECORD is
available to anyone online. This report
could show overspending by commit-
tees and a number of other things. This
is the first such report since I filed a
current law budget for the fiscal year
2020 as authorized by the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2019.
This week’s filing tracks the Senate’s
adherence to that current law budget
and provides up-to-date budgetary in-
formation about the Federal Govern-
ment for Congress and for the public.
For the first time, a copy of the
scorekeeping report can be found on
the Senate Budget Committee’s
website to allow the American people
to better track Congress’s fiscal deci-
sion making. That is new.
Let me repeat that. For the first
time, a copy of the scorekeeping report
can be found on the Senate Budget
Committee’s website to allow the
American people to better track
Congress’s decision making.
Since this is the first time the com-
mittee is posting the scorekeeping re-
port on its website, I want to take this
opportunity to explain the report for
those taxpayers who are concerned, as
I am, about our country’s fiscal health
and want to learn more.
I hope the people will look at the fu-
ture months and each monthly report.
A current-law budget allows the Senate
to enforce the budget spending levels
projected under current law. While it
will not put us on a path to stabilizing
our debt and deficits, like the levels
approved by the Senate Budget Com-
mittee earlier this year would do, it
tells the Congress to stop making our
fiscal situation worse—to stop making
our debt and deficits worse.
The scorekeeping report covers six
primary areas. First, it shows whether
authorizing committees are sticking to
their allocation, which is just a fancy
term for each committee’s spending al-
lowance. We track that for the 1-year,
5-year, and 10-year periods for this re-
port. For the October 2019 report, all
committees are in compliance and no
breaches have been recorded since I
filed the current-law budget on Sep-
tember 9. That is good news, though
with our debt approaching $23 trillion,
going a month on the budget is not
something to pat ourselves on the back
over, but it is a good start.
Second, the report tracks whether
the Appropriations Committee is ad-
hering to the discretionary spending
limits imposed by the most recent Bi-
partisan Budget Act. For fiscal year
2020, the limit on regular discretionary
spending for accounts in the defense
category is $666.5 billion, and for the
accounts in nondefense category, it is
$621.5 billion. Since full-year appropria-
tions measures for this fiscal year have
not yet been enacted, the only budg-
etary effects recorded are for advanced
or permanent appropriations made
through our prior law.
Third, the scorekeeping report tracks
changes in mandatory programs. We
call that CHIMPS, which is used by the
Appropriations Committee. That is so
we are not using the very important
wording of ‘‘changes in mandatory pro-
grams,’’ actually making changes in
mandatory programs without people
knowing. The Appropriations Com-
mittee uses those changes in manda-
tory programs to offset new discre-
tionary spending each year. In recent
years, the Budget Committee has
ratcheted down the total amount of
changes in mandatory programs that
can be used in a given year in an effort
to hold the line on spending.
This year’s total limit is $15 billion—
that is extra spending—and the report
tracks the Appropriations Committee’s
adherence to that limit thus far. I
know that many of my colleagues
share my desire to finally end the prac-
tice of using changes in mandatory
programs to inflate spending.
Fourth, the report tracks the amount
of emergency and overseas contingency
operations spending in appropriations
bills. Emergency spending is not con-
strained by discretionary spending lim-
its that I talked about, but it has the
potential to cost hundreds of billions of
dollars each year. To date, for fiscal
year 2020, there has been $8 million
worth of emergency budget authority
adjustments. These adjustments are
the result of agriculture provisions and
the additional supplemental appropria-
tions for the Disaster Relief Act of
2019. Emergencies don’t count against
the budget, but they do go to increased
debt. There is no requirement to adjust
the budget to pay for emergencies.
Fifth, included in the report is infor-
mation provided to me by the Congres-
sional Budget Office that compares
topline spending and revenue amounts,
known as aggregates, to the current-
law budget levels. The report shows
there is currently enough room on the
spending aggregate to accommodate all
outstanding regular appropriations and
no additional room for revenue loss.
Finally, the report includes the cur-
rent balances of the Senate’s pay-go
scorecard. Pay-go stands for ‘‘pay as
you go,’’ a unique concept around here.
In other words, was it paid for? If not,
the report shows it on the scorecard.
The Senate’s pay-go scorecard, which
is enforced with a 60-vote point of
order, tracks the budgetary effects of
legislation moving through Congress
affecting mandatory spending and rev-
enues. This report shows a zero balance
on the Senate’s pay-go scorecard due to
the filing of new budgetary levels just
last month.
As chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, I try to come to the floor
regularly to sound the alarm about our
country’s unsustainable fiscal course.
We are on a perilous path with the Con-
gressional Budget Office projecting our
debt and deficits to skyrocket in the
coming years. Debt is the cumulative
amount. Deficits are the annual
amount.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5880 October 17, 2019
The deficit for the fiscal year that
ended September 30 reached $984 bil-
lion. While revenues were up $133 bil-
lion over the previous year, or 4 per-
cent, compared to fiscal year 2018,
spending was up $338 billion, or 7 per-
cent, over the prior year. I can say that
again. We overspent $984 billion. Reve-
nues were up $133 billion, but spending
was up $338 billion. The Congressional
Budget Office projects the budget def-
icit for the current fiscal year to top $1
trillion. That is another trillion dollars
added to our already high debt. That is
overspending in spite of increased reve-
nues.
We are long overdue for an honest
conversation about the country’s fi-
nances. I hope the Senate scorekeeping
report can contribute in a small way to
that conversation. I believe the more
we allow the public to follow the dol-
lars, the more pressure there will be on
all of us to finally address our over-
spending problem. I truly hope all
Members view this report and come to
see it as a valuable tool for getting our
books in order.
I yield the floor.

jority leader.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, our
Democratic colleagues insist that de-
spite their political differences with
President Trump, they are still pre-
pared to tackle important legislation
and do our work for the American peo-
ple.
Well, next week they will have an op-
portunity to prove it. Congress has
fallen badly behind schedule on appro-
priations. It has been a month since
my Democratic colleagues filibustered
government funding on the floor,
blocking defense funding and a pay
raise for our servicemembers. We need
to get moving. The country is watch-
ing. It is time to make progress.
So in just a moment, I will file clo-
ture on motions to proceed to two gov-
ernment funding bills, setting up votes
for next week.
In order to meet Democrats halfway,
the first House shell we will vote on
will be a package of domestic funding
bills. If we can get bipartisan support
to take up that domestic funding bill,
we will stay on it until we complete it.
I hope Chairman SHELBY and Senator
LEAHY can work together to craft a bi-
partisan substitute amendment.
Afterward, we will turn to a second
package, including the defense funding
that our Armed Forces and com-
manders need, especially in this dan-
gerous time and considering current
events, plus resources for other prior-
ities such as the opioid epidemic. So we
will be voting next week, and I urge all
of our colleagues to move in that direc-
tion. Let’s make good on all the talk
about bipartisanship and finally make
progress toward funding the govern-
ment.

f
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise
today to address the current situation
in Syria.
First, I welcome the Vice President’s
announcement of a cease-fire, which
will prevent further loss of life. I hope
the agreement is honored. But at the
heart of this matter is a central ques-
tion of why these terms and assurances
were not negotiated before the Presi-
dent consented to withdraw our troops.
Let me briefly recount what has hap-
pened in the past 7 days since the
United States announced our with-
drawal. The Kurds, suffering loss of life
and property, have allied with Assad,
Russia has assumed control of our pre-
vious military positions, and the
United States has been forced in many
cases to bomb our own facilities to pre-
vent their appropriation by Russia and
Turkey.
The announcement today is being
portrayed as a victory. It is far from a
victory. Serious questions remain
about how the decision was reached
precipitously to withdraw from Syria
and why that decision was reached.
Given the initial details of the cease-
fire agreement, the administration
must also explain what America’s fu-
ture role will be in the region, what
happens now to the Kurds, and why
Turkey will face no apparent con-
sequences. Further, the cease-fire does
not change the fact that America has
abandoned an ally. Adding insult to
dishonor, the administration speaks
cavalierly, even flippantly, as our ally
has suffered death and casualty. Their
homes have been burned, and their
families have been torn apart.
We know the truth about our Kurd
allies. They lost 11,000 combatants in
our joint effort to defeat ISIS. We
dropped bombs from the air and pro-
vided intelligence and logistics behind
the lines. The Kurds lost thousands of
lives, and 86 brave Americans also lost
their lives so tragically.
It is argued that the Kurds were
fighting for themselves. Of course they
were. That is the nature of an alliance.
We fight together, each pursuing our
own vital interests. America leaves no
soldier behind, often at great cost in
blood and treasure. We recover our
dead and our wounded, and we free our
men and women who are held captive.
This is a matter of American honor and
promise. So, too, is the principle that
we stand by our allies, that we do not
abandon our friends.
The decision to abandon the Kurds
violates one of our most sacred duties.
It strikes at American honor. What we
have done to the Kurds will stand as a
blood stain in the annals of American
history.
There are broad strategic implica-
tions of our decision, as well. Iranian
and Russian interests in the Middle
East have been advanced by our deci-
sion at a time when we were applying
maximum pressure on Iran. By giving
them a stronger hand in Syria, we have
actually weakened that pressure. Rus-
sia’s objective to play a greater role in
the Middle East has also been greatly
enhanced. The Kurds, out of despera-
tion, have now aligned with Assad. So
America is diminished, and Russia,
Iran, and Assad are strengthened.
So I ask how and why this decision
was reached. I serve on the Foreign Re-
lations Committee, and given the Syria
decision taken by the administration, I
might be forgiven for wondering why
our committee even exists. I say this
because apparently the decision to
leave Syria was made without con-
sultation with the committee or even
with the committee chairman and
ranking member.
Just 3 weeks ago, our subcommittee
held hearings to receive an extensive
analysis of the conditions and the way
forward in Syria. It was presented to us
by the Syria Study Group, a bipartisan,
congressionally mandated commission
tasked with providing an in-depth as-
sessment of the conditions in Syria and
to provide recommendations for Amer-
ican strategy going forward. So far as I
am aware, the administration made no
effort to contact those who attended
that hearing or to speak with the Syria
Study Group to be able to understand
the content in their extensive pub-
lished report.
I ask whether it is the position of the
administration that the Senate—a
body of 100 people representing both
political parties—is to be entirely ab-
sent from decisions of the magnitude
just taken in Syria.
Some argue that we should not have
been in Syria in the first place because
there was not a vote taken by the Sen-
ate to engage in war there. I disagree.
Congress has given the President legal
authority and funding to fight against
terrorists in Syria.
However, for purposes of argument,
even if one believed that no authoriza-
tion had been given, that is really ir-
relevant to the decision as to the with-
drawal once we have allied with a peo-
ple—the Kurds—committed to defend
them, and together defeated ISIS. Once
you jump in the ocean to save a drown-
ing soul, you don’t turn around with
the excuse that you didn’t have to
jump in in the first place. It is a mat-
ter of commitment.

Others argue that we should just get
out of a messy situation like this. Mid-
dle East, they say, has had wars going
on forever; just let them have at it.
There is, of course, a certain logic to
that position, as well, but again, it ap-
plies only to the original decision as to
whether we should have gone into
Syria. Once we have engaged and made
the commitments we made, honor, as
well as self-interest, demands that we
not abandon our allies.
It has been suggested that Turkey
may have called America’s bluff—tell-
ing the President they were coming no
matter what we did. If that is so, we
should know it, for it would tell us a
great deal about how we should deal
with Turkey now and in the future.
Some have argued that Syria is sim-
ply a mess, with warring groups, sub-
groups, friends and allies shifting from
one side to the other, and thus we had
to exit because there was no reasonable
path for us to go forward. Are we in-
capable of understanding and shaping
complex situations? Russia seems to
have figured it out. Are we less adept
than they, and are our principles to be
jettisoned when we find things get
messy?
The administration claims that none
of these reasons are accurate. Instead,
the President has said that we left to
fulfill a commitment to stop endless
wars, to bring troops home, to get
them out of harm’s way, and perhaps to
save money. I find these reasons hard
to square. Why? Well, we withdraw
1,500 troops in Syria, but we are adding
2,000 troops in Saudi Arabia. All to-
taled, we have some 60,000 troops in the
Middle East.
Assuming for the sake of under-
standing that getting out of endless
wars was the logic for the decision,
why would we take action so precipi-
tously? Why would we not warn our
ally, the Kurds, of what we were about
to do? Why would we not give them
time to also withdraw or perhaps to dig
in to defend themselves? Clearly, the
Turks had a heads-up because they
were able to start bombing within mere
hours. I simply don’t understand why
the administration did not explain in
advance to Erdogan that it is unaccept-
able for Turkey to attack an American
ally. Could we not insist that together
we develop a transition plan that pro-
tects the Kurds, secures the ISIS pris-
oners, and meets the legitimate con-
cerns of Turkey, as well? Was there no
chance for diplomacy? Are we so weak
and so inept diplomatically that Tur-
key forced the hand of the United
States of America—Turkey? I believe
it is imperative that public hearings be
held to answer these questions, and I
hope the Senate will be able to conduct
those hearings next week.
I note in closing that I also hope the
cease-fire agreement is honored and
that Turkey ends its brutal killing, but
I note that lives are already lost and
American honor has already been tar-
nished. We once abandoned a redline;
now we abandon an ally. We need an-
swers. What has happened in Syria
should not happen again. And we, the
Senate, must take action to make sure
that it does not.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this
afternoon to discuss the situation in
Syria. Let me commend my colleague
Senator ROMNEY for his very thought-
ful and very timely and very important
comments.
We all recognize that the situation in
Syria is highly fluid. I think it is im-
portant to state the case with respect
to the President’s decision to acquiesce
to President Erdogan’s offensive
against the Kurds. The President’s de-
cision is a disaster for our partners in
the fight against ISIS and United
States foreign policy more broadly.
While I welcome the temporary
cease-fire announced a short time ago
and hope that a permanent cease-fire
can be achieved, it does not absolve
President Trump of his responsibility
for his betrayal of our Kurdish partners
and his role in unleashing violence and
instability in northern Syria. It is not
clear whether Turkey made any con-
cessions as part of the deal struck with
the U.S. delegation or whether Kurdish
forces will comply. If not, I am con-
cerned that additional violence is like-
ly to follow and we will have little le-
verage to prevent it. In fact, there is a
quote attributed to the Turkish For-
eign Minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, by
the White House reporter for CNN. She
quotes the Turkish Foreign Minister as
saying:
This is not a cease-fire. We will pause the
operation for 120 hours in order for the ter-
rorists to leave. We will only stop the oper-
ation if our conditions are met.
So, indeed, even this supposed cease-
fire may not materialize as a cease-
fire.
But the reality is that the blood of
many Kurds is on President Trump’s
hands, and thousands of hardened ISIS
prisoners could be let loose as a result
of his hasty and uninformed decision.
President Trump’s decision to aban-
don our close partners also strengthens
the hand of Erdogan, Putin, Assad, and
Khamenei. Those are not friends; they
are, in many cases, adversaries and an-
tagonists.
Members of the administration claim
that the U.S. Government opposed the
Turkish incursion, but the President’s
own actions and statements make clear
that he gave Erdogan a green light.
The President ordered our military to
begin a phased withdrawal from Syria
last December—a decision that prompt-
ed the resignation of former Secretary
of Defense Mattis and that surely gave
the Turks the impression that he
would fold when pressed by Erdogan.
Not surprisingly, he did. In that phone
call, Erdogan was pushing against an
open door. He knew it. The President
knew it. That is why the Turks went
across the border.
Stating that we should let the Kurds
and Turks fight it out because of their
longstanding grievances, as the Presi-
dent has said repeatedly, betrays both
our national security interests in the
Middle East and our own American
ideals.
It is shameful that the White House’s
statement that was released after the
President’s call with Erdogan did not
even criticize the planned Turkish in-
cursion or warn of potential con-
sequences if it went forward. It wasn’t
until the following day, after a bipar-
tisan and international outcry, that
the President began to express any
concerns about Turkish plans while at
the same time reiterating his invita-
tion for Erdogan to visit the White
House next month. It is impossible to
read the President’s initial statements
as anything but acquiescence.
Furthermore, the President’s state-
ments over the following days have
sought to distance the United States
from the Kurds and the foreseeable
consequences of his decision with re-
gard to ISIS and the humanitarian
challenges in northern Syria.
The violence we have witnessed over
the last few days in northern Syria has
been the direct result of an impulsive
President who has made decisions that
are counter to the advice of our na-
tional security experts. President
Trump has often expressed disdain for
the career military, diplomatic, and in-
telligence professionals our Nation re-
lies on to develop and implement sound
national security policy. We are once
again seeing the ramifications of his
incompetence.
The President’s stunning ignorance
of the complexities in the Middle East
was on full display over the weekend in
a tweet in which he seemed not to have
an understanding of the location or
identity of the separate Kurdish groups
with whom we have partnered in Syria
and Iraq.
The Secretaries of Defense and State
both insist they were consulted by the
President on this decision. Maybe so,
but it is clear that he didn’t heed their
advice or that of our national security
experts. I am not aware of any security
experts who advocated for standing by
while the Turkish military carried out
an offensive against our Kurdish part-
ners.
In fact, on October 2—just 4 days be-
fore the phone call between Presidents
Trump and Erdogan—the State Depart-
ment’s Special Envoy for Syria, Joel
Rayburn, publicly warned: We cer-
tainly think that a conflict along the
Turkey-Syria border would serve the
interests of all the bad actors in the
conflict and in the surrounding re-
gion—whether that is ISIS or al-Qaida
or the Iranian regime or what have
you.
That was President Trump’s Special
Envoy.
The President’s capitulation to
Erdogan runs directly counter to all of
the administration’s stated objectives
in Syria. The administration’s stated
strategy is to, No. 1, defeat ISIS; No. 2,
force the removal of Iranian-aligned

foreign forces from Syria; and No. 3,
achieve a negotiated political settle-
ment to the Syrian civil war in line
with the United Nations’ resolutions.
The security and humanitarian ca-
tastrophe that President Erdogan has
unleashed with Trump’s approval will
make achieving any of these goals
nearly impossible. The violence in
northern Syria over the last few days
has led to the displacement of at least
160,000 people, the suspension of hu-
manitarian assistance into affected
areas, the escape of an unidentified
number of ISIS detainees, and the hor-
rific killings of unarmed civilians, in-
cluding incidents that Secretary of De-
fense Esper has described as potential
war crimes.
Just weeks ago, at our urging, the
SDF removed personnel from border
areas, relocated heavy weapons, and
destroyed defensive fortifications in
northern Syria. They did so even in the
face of a continued Turkish military
buildup along the Syrian border be-
cause they believed the United States
and Turkey had agreed to a security
mechanism in good faith that could
avoid bloodshed. It seems that they
were wrong to put their faith in this
administration.
The Turkish incursion into Syria has
undermined years of effort against ISIS
by the United States and the inter-
national community. Despite the
elimination of the so-called physical
caliphate, ISIS is not defeated. Former
Secretary of Defense Mattis correctly
warned over the weekend that ISIS will
resurge if pressure against the group
isn’t sustained.
Perhaps even more damaging than
the current situation in Syria is the
long-term impact of the President’s de-
cision on our standing in the world and
our ability to achieve the goals out-
lined in the national defense strategy
of his administration. The President’s
shortsighted abandonment of the Kurds
is a strategic disaster that raises grave
doubts among our allies and our friends
about whether the United States under
this President can be counted on to de-
fend our shared interests.
Given the diverse national security
challenges we face, we must attract
and rely upon partners who share our
interests. Our military leaders often
promote the virtues of the ‘‘by, with,
and through’’ approach, especially
when it comes to counterterrorism.
Since 9/11, we have built partnerships
with local forces throughout the
world—from North and East Africa, to
the Middle East, and across the Pa-
cific—to enable efforts against violent
extremist groups. We have sought to
apply exquisite capabilities only pos-
sessed by the U.S. military to support
local partners doing the preponderance
of the fighting and dying in service to
our shared objective of containing and
defeating such violent groups.
Contrary to President Trump’s asser-
tions, we are not engaged in an endless
war in Syria. In fact, the Kurd’s part-
nership with the United States should
be viewed as a model of how to leverage
an ‘‘economy of force’’ commitment of
U.S. military capabilities to achieve
strategic effects, thereby obviating the
need for large numbers of U.S. per-
sonnel to be put at risk. In Syria, rel-
atively small numbers of U.S. forces on
the ground enabled a Kurdish and Arab
ground force of approximately 60,000
personnel known as the Syrian Demo-
cratic Forces, or SDF. With our help,
the SDF liberated millions of innocent
civilians from the violent oppression of
ISIS and defeated the so-called phys-
ical caliphate. Some have estimated
that the SDF lost more than 10,000
fighters taking on ISIS.
It is true that many who joined the
SDF did so to liberate their homes
from ISIS; however, it is also true that
even after their homes were liberated,
the SDF—Kurds and Arabs alike—con-
tinued to pursue ISIS all the way
through the Euphrates River Valley,
where the last remnants of the phys-
ical caliphate were ultimately defeated
earlier this year.
Those in the SDF were not only
fighting for themselves; they were also
fighting for us. They were fighting to
help ensure that there were no more
ISIS-directed or -inspired attacks like
those carried out in Paris, Brussels,
Istanbul, Orlando, and San Bernardino.
After the SDF successfully liberated
the territory that was formerly con-
trolled by ISIS, it also maintained cus-
tody of more than 10,000 ISIS detain-
ees—including more than 2,000 foreign
fighters—even when many of their
home countries refused to take them
back. Given the sacrifices of the SDF
in the fight against ISIS, it was par-
ticularly insulting for President Trump
to imply that the SDF may now be re-
leasing ISIS detainees to get us in-
volved, in his words, in the ongoing vi-
olence in northern Syria.
As our military leaders will tell you,
our partnership with the SDF was not
only built on our shared opposition to
ISIS but also on the trust established
between our forces in their fighting
shoulder to shoulder against a common
enemy. They deserved more from the
United States and President Trump in
the face of demands by Turkey’s auto-
cratic leader. Given all the SDF has
sacrificed in furtherance of the fight
against ISIS and our partnership, our
betrayal of their trust is nothing short
of appalling.
Again, just days before President
Trump’s fateful call with Erdogan, the
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
for the Middle East publicly stated:
‘‘We, quite frankly, could not carry out
our national defense strategy if it
weren’t for partners like [the SDF].’’
I fear that the President’s impulsive
abandonment of the Kurds has done
significant and lasting damage to the
standing of the United States in the
world and has shaken the confidence of
our allies and partners. We are losing
valuable partners in a region where the
United States has critical national se-
curity interests.
Congress and the international com-
munity must send a clear, bipartisan
signal to the President that we do not
condone the Turkish incursion into
northern Syria or the President’s deci-
sion to abandon the Kurds.
President Trump must rescind the in-
vitation to President Erdogan to visit
the United States in November. We
should not welcome an autocrat who is
responsible for endangering our troops
on the ground in Syria, the release of
dangerous ISIS fighters, the mass dis-
placement of hundreds of thousands of
civilians, and violence against non-
combatants, which, if reports are true,
may amount to war crimes.
The United States does not need to
stand alone in condemning the violence
in northeastern Syria. Our partners in
the counter-ISIS coalition share our
concerns about the damage the Turk-
ish incursion has caused to our efforts
to defeat ISIS and the potential hu-
manitarian costs. The United States
should take the lead within the United
Nations and NATO to organize efforts
to denounce Turkey’s actions and re-
strain the strategic consequences. We
must also redouble diplomatic efforts
to seek a negotiated settlement to the
Syrian civil war that is consistent with
U.N. Security Council Resolution No.
2254 and that protects the equities of
the SDF and civilians who are living
under their protection.
Unfortunately, the greatest impedi-
ment to securing our national security
interests in northern Syria and bring-
ing about an end to the conflict there
appears to be President Trump’s inabil-
ity to grasp the strategic significance
of his actions.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise to
call attention to the dire situation
that continues to unfold in northern
Syria.
Turkey embarked on a reckless and
brutal intervention on October 9, 2019,
ostensibly to clear northern Syria of
terrorist elements. It has ironically
dubbed this operation ‘‘Peace Spring.’’
The departure of U.S. forces in the
days just prior to this incursion left
nothing between Turkish military
forces and the predominantly Kurdish
militia, known as the Syrian Demo-
cratic Forces, or SDF. Up until the
cease-fire agreement that was an-
nounced today, the SDF bore the brunt
of the Turkish assault.
The Kurds are deeply stung by what
they see as America’s abandoning
them—this after a long, hard, and suc-
cessful fight against ISIS.
At the height of its power, ISIS con-
trolled territory larger than the United
Kingdom. As many Americans know,
ISIS directed and inspired terrorist at-
tacks on our homeland, in commu-
nities across the United States, and
staged numerous attacks against our
troops overseas. ISIS’s branches across
the globe have conducted unimaginable
atrocities, including targeting Chris-
tians, Yazidis, Kurds, and others who

opposed ISIS’s corrupt interpretation
of Islam. Examples of these atrocities
are the heartbreaking stories of so-
called Yazidi brides who were forced
into marriages with ISIS fighters.
They were raped and brutalized repeat-
edly and were forced to decide whether
to abandon their children or to make
an escape. There are multiple stories of
ISIS’s terror that has been inflicted on
those with disabilities, such as babies
being suffocated simply for being born
with Down syndrome.
The United States, together with a
coalition of over 30 countries, engaged
in a campaign to rid the world of ISIS
and to restore peace and stability to
that region. Yet it was not a nation-
state that bore the brunt of the fight-
ing against ISIS. The Kurds and the
Arabs who made up the Syrian Demo-
cratic Forces took the fight to the
heart of the caliphate. With the help of
U.S. Special Operations Forces and air-
strikes, the SDF liberated lands held
by the terror group, imprisoned thou-
sands of terrorist fighters, and restored
hope to hundreds of thousands who suf-
fered under ISIS rule.
In our fast-moving and quickly
changing world, it is easy for some to
forget the terrible threat ISIS once
posed while they were at their most
powerful, but it would be wrong to
think we can now allow ourselves to
take our foot off of our enemy’s throat.
Even now, ISIS cells are seeking to
take advantage of the chaos in north-
ern Syria to reconstitute and once
again pose a direct threat to Ameri-
cans right here in our homeland.
You cannot watch what is unfolding
in Syria without being fundamentally
concerned about the security of our
friends and our neighbors. A recapital-
ization of ISIS is a threat to us all.
It is for this reason that I have intro-
duced a resolution which calls on the
Department of Defense and the Depart-
ment of State to provide a plan within
30 days which will outline a strategy to
ensure ISIS will never again threaten
Americans or our allies now or in the
future.
This strategy will address the ongo-
ing threat that ISIS poses regionally
and globally and will outline the plan
to prevent an ISIS resurgence, contain
ISIS expansion, mitigate the threat
ISIS poses to the United States and our
allies, and describe how our gains
against ISIS since 2014 will be further
protected.
We cannot afford to take our eyes off
of this vital task of ensuring the last-
ing and irreversible defeat of ISIS. We
must consolidate our gains to rid the
world of this terrible organization and
insist on a sound strategy to ensure
our success to that end.
Too many of our partner forces and
indeed American brothers and sisters
in arms have fought and died in this
fight, and we must ensure that those
sacrifices were not made in vain.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for

objection, it is so ordered.
f
SAUDI FUGITIVE
DECLASSIFICATION ACT OF 2019
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have
come to the floor to fight for answers—
answers that are long overdue.
In 2018, my hometown newspaper,
The Oregonian, identified a handful of
cases where Saudi nationals accused of
serious crimes in the United States,
like manslaughter and sexual assault,
fled the country and escaped American
justice.
Since then, The Oregonian has iden-
tified numerous similar cases—in fact,
almost two dozen such cases across the
United States. That includes 19 in just
the last 7 years.
Today I want to tell the Senate
about just one of those cases.
Three years ago, not far from my
home in Southeast Portland, a young
woman had her life taken from her.
Fallon Smart was then a rising sopho-
more at Franklin High School, and she
was aspiring to be a teacher. By all ac-
counts, she would have been a terrific
teacher.
She was 15, and according to every-
body who knew her, Fallon was warm
and smart and friendly. She had her
whole life ahead of her.
According to police, she lost her life
when she was crossing the street in
front of stopped traffic, and a vehicle
illegally swerved into the left-hand
lane and hit her at 55 or 60 miles per
hour. Her mom was in a car half a
block away and ran to her daughter.
Fallon died in her mother’s arms, and
the car that hit her just sped away.
A Saudi Arabian college student
named Abdulrahman Sameer Noorah
later returned to the scene and was ar-
rested. He was eventually charged with
manslaughter in Fallon’s death and
then released on $1 million bail. The
Saudi consulate posted his $100,000
bond, according to The Oregonian
newspaper.
In the United States, in our country,
there was every expectation that Mr.
Noorah would get a fair shake from the
justice system. Our justice system was
working the right way here until 2
weeks before Mr. Noorah was scheduled
to go to trial. His tracking bracelet
was somehow cut, and he disappeared.
Mr. Noorah has never stood trial for
Fallon Smart’s death.
Eventually, this spring, the State De-
partment confirmed in a letter to me
that Mr. Noorah had returned to Saudi
Arabia.
I felt then, and I do today, this raises
an important and a serious question:
How does a foreign national charged
with manslaughter, whose passport was
seized, disappear from the United
States without a trace? How does this
person escape the country and make it
thousands of miles back to Saudi Ara-
bia with there being no record of his
doing so?
News reports in 2018 suggest that the
Saudi Arabian Government knew about
Mr. Noorah and these other fugitives
and potentially helped them flee jus-
tice.
I have five children. I cannot imagine
the grief I would feel if one of them was
taken from me, and the person respon-
sible somehow managed to evade the
justice system. It is almost impossible
to comprehend the anger and the help-
lessness and the frustration any parent
would feel in a situation like this.
I met with Fallon’s mom Fawn, and
while she and all of Fallon’s loved ones
have borne this miscarriage of justice
with extraordinary grace, they are just
heartbroken.
In addition to being heartbroken,
they are angry. They are outraged by
the notion that the person charged
with killing their daughter may have
just been able to escape scot-free and
face no consequences for his action.
For some time, I have been demand-
ing information from the Trump ad-
ministration. In my view, the victims
of these crimes, their families, and the
American people are owed some essen-
tial answers. How did this happen?
What is the U.S. Government doing
about it?
I have written the Department of
Justice. I have written the State De-
partment. I have written the U.S. Mar-
shals Service. I have written to the De-
partment of Homeland Security. As far
as I can tell, I would have gotten better
answers from the Saudi royal family
themselves.
In fact, when I asked Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo what he was doing
to try to return the Saudi fugitives to
the United States, basically what his
Department did is that we just got a
collective shrug of the shoulders. I sent
the Secretary of State a letter last De-
cember. He didn’t respond.
So I sent another letter in February.
I said: The State Department needs to
use all its resources and all the tools at
its disposal to hold the Saudi Govern-
ment accountable. I asked whether our
Ambassador pressed the Saudi Govern-
ment about this disturbing, shocking
pattern of Saudi nationals skipping
bail.
The State Department finally did re-
spond to my second letter. What I got
was a whole bunch of nothing. One of
Mr. Pompeo’s aides said that without
an extradition treaty, there wasn’t
anything they could do about it. This
is from a Secretary who tried to
rebrand State as the ‘‘Department of
Swagger.’’ That swagger was nowhere
to be found when it was time to protect
innocent Americans.
Today, I am not writing any more
letters. I am here on the Senate floor
asking for action—action today. I am

seeking to pass the Saudi Fugitive De-
classification Act of 2019. My bill re-
quires the FBI Director, in coordina-
tion with the Director of National In-
telligence, to quickly—quickly—de-
classify any and all information re-
lated to a key question: whether the
Government of Saudi Arabia helped
any Saudi nationals escape the country
when those Saudi nationals were
awaiting trial or sentencing for a
criminal offense.
Let me just repeat that so there is no
confusion. The bill requires that the
FBI Director and what is called the
DNI, or the Director of National Intel-
ligence, would quickly—quickly—de-
classify any and all information on the
issue of whether the Government of
Saudi Arabia helped any Saudi nation-
als escape the country when those
Saudi nationals were awaiting trial or
sentencing for a criminal offense in the
United States.
I believe what I am asking for today
must happen in the name of justice im-
mediately. The American people de-
serve answers. The people I represent
at home in our neighborhoods in
Southeast Portland want answers.
These are not academic matters. This
is not about a series of victimless
crimes.
This is about manslaughter. It is
about rape. It is about a whole array of
ugly offenses. This is about real people,
real families—families who have suf-
fered immeasurable pain. They deserve
to see justice served. When individuals
who are charged with violent crimes—
no victimless crimes here, violent
crimes—manage to escape and when
the United States fails to do much of
anything about it, it undermines public
safety and it harms the U.S. justice
system.
If, as some of the press stories have
suggested, the Saudi Government has
helped these alleged criminals escape
justice, the American people have the
right to be doubly concerned. Is the
public image of Saudi Arabia a higher
priority than the safety of American
citizens?
Any action by a foreign government
to thwart our criminal justice system
would be an attack on our national se-
curity and our sovereignty. If that is
what has happened, then, all Ameri-
cans deserve to know.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the U.S. Senate proceed to
the immediate consideration of S. 2635,
submitted earlier today.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the bill by title.
The bill clerk read as follows:
A bill (S. 2635) to require the Director of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation to de-
classify any and all information relating to
whether the government of Saudi Arabia as-
sisted a citizen or national of Saudi Arabia
in departing the United States while the cit-
izen or national was awaiting trial or sen-
tencing for a criminal offense committed in
the United States, and for other purposes.
There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded to consider the bill.
Mr. WYDEN. I further ask unanimous
consent that the bill be considered read
a third time and passed and the motion
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table, with no inter-
vening action or debate.

The bill (S. 2635) was ordered to be

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

Not later than 30 days after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Director of the

TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, it is inter-
esting. When we come here, we seem to
think that everybody in America is
reading the blogs and all the major
newspapers every morning. A lot of
people do, but some people have lives.
They get up early. They go to work.
They listen to the news from time to
time, but they don’t follow it closely.
That is what they hire us to do and
they hire us to deal with as policy-
makers.
On this issue of Syria, it strikes me,
and it really did earlier this week when
I visited this gas station close to my
home that I frequent. It also has a lit-
tle convenience store with a coffee
stand inside. A gentleman comes up to
me and basically says: Why do we care
about all the stuff that is happening
there? You know, it is thousands of
miles away. These people have been
fighting forever. Let them figure it
out. Why do we have to be involved in
all of this?
I will tell you that there is appeal to
that argument. There really is. I un-
derstand why Americans feel that way.
Since September of 2001, we have lost
countless young men and women
abroad in combat. We have seen fami-
lies who have been ripped apart. We
have seen the injuries that people come
home with, not to mention the amount
of money that has been spent on all of
this as well. At a time when we face so
many challenges, a lot of people are
saying to themselves: Well, why do we
have to be everywhere? Why do we
have to care? These people have been
fighting for a billion years. It is not
our problem. We need to focus on issues
here at home.
I do understand the appeal of that ar-
gument. I want to tell you that despite
how much I focus on these issues and
spend time on them, from time to time,
those arguments appeal to me. But
then you have to analyze why we are
there to begin with and what it would
mean in the short to long term to our
country to just walk away from these
obligations. That is what I hope to do
here today in a way that answers the
question the gentleman asked me last
Monday. I didn’t have time to get into
all of this because I had an airplane to
catch, and these airlines don’t wait for
anybody.
So here is the way I would explain it.
The first is that you have to tell people
why we are there to begin with. Let me
tell you what this is not. This is not
about an endless war or being some-
where for the rest of our lives. Frank-
ly, it is not even about committing
thousands of troops. The U.S. force
presence in Syria was quite small. It
actually achieved an extraordinary
amount with such a few number of peo-
ple.
There were 2,000 special operators
imbedded alongside thousands of Kurds
and our international partners. Basi-
cally, it is an area that ISIS once
dominated. They literally controlled
the cities. The capital of the caliphate
was once there at one point. They were
driven out. There was tremendous suc-
cess, a real example of the sort of
counterterror that these missions have
successfully pursued.
The stated goal was, first and fore-
most, to stamp out and eliminate ISIS.
The second was that our presence
would provide leverage when the time
came for a Syrian peace settlement—a
settlement that would reflect our na-
tional interests, which are primarily
three things.
The first is limiting Assad’s power.
The guy is a stone-cold criminal. This
guy has gassed and murdered his own
people. There has to be some limits and
constraints to his power.
The second is to safeguard the Kurds.
As you have heard others come to the
floor and talk about, these people
fought with us. We told them: If you
will do the ground-fighting and we help
you from the air and with logistics, we
are going to be here with you. They
did, and they lost over 10,000 people in
that fight. They have been great part-
ners in that endeavor. We had a moral
obligation, not to mention a promise
that we made.

The third is to limit Iran’s influence.
Iran would love nothing more than to
completely dominate Syria because it
links them directly into Lebanon to
supply and support Hezbollah. It allows
them to pivot over into Iraq to become
the dominant power there.
Just imagine a Middle East in which
Iran is the dominant power in Lebanon,
in Syria, and, of course, in Iran, and,
eventually, in Iraq, and, God forbid, in
Bahrain, and with a growing influence
in Yemen through the Houthis. They
not only encircle Israel. They encircle
Saudi Arabia. It would be a nightmare.
We are engaged in a campaign of
maximum pressure against Iran, and
the last thing you want to do in a max-
imum-pressure campaign is to alleviate
pressure, and having a greater influ-
ence in Syria would alleviate a lot of
pressure for Iran. That is the purpose
of our presence there.
The administration’s and the Presi-
dent’s decision has undermined every
single one of them. That is the only
way to talk about it. I think it has
done so in ways we are going to regret
for a long time.
The first is the ISIS mission. There
are 10,000 ISIS killers being held in
jails and camps in northern Syria. The
guards at those camps are not Ameri-
cans. They are Kurdish guards. What
happens when someone invades the cit-
ies that your family lives in? You send
people to go meet that enemy. That
means that they have been removing
guards from the prisons to the
frontlines.
There are less and less guards in
these camps. Estimates are already
that a large number of ISIS killers
have already gotten out, and they an-
ticipate more to get out soon. Just
imagine 10,000 killers running loose,
not to mention efforts by ISIS to break
them out with less security.
By the way, this is a problem not just
in Syria. It is a real problem in Iraq.
About 200,000 refugees have already
amassed at the border. There is no way
Iraq can go through every single one of
them and determine who is an ISIS
killer and who is a refugee who is com-
ing back. So you can suddenly see this
resurgence of ISIS spread and desta-
bilize Iraq. So, suddenly, this evil
movement that we had on the ropes
and had become an insurgency—and,
frankly, was already reemerging as an
insurgency—has just been given fuel to
operate in one, and now in two, coun-
tries.
How about the goal of providing le-
verage for a future settlement to re-
flect our interests? First of all, in re-
straints on Assad’s power, think about
it this way. Literally, overnight, when
the Turks came in and the Kurds didn’t
have us anymore, they were forced to
cut a deal with Assad. So, suddenly,
the Kurds are basically telling Assad’s
troops: Come up to the cities that we
once had, and you now be the troops
here to back us up. You take control of
them. That is what they had to do to
avoid being slaughtered.
In practical terms, what it means is
that Assad, literally, overnight, has
captured a third of the land of Syria at
no price and no concession. He had to
make no concessions, pay no price, do
nothing other than just send people up
to take it.
To me, this doesn’t sound like we
have imposed restraints on Assad. It
sounds like he has just literally been
gifted control over a third of the na-
tional territory at no concession and
no price. He had to do nothing.
How about safeguarding the Kurdish
interests? I think that is self-explana-
tory. The Kurds have now been forced
to align themselves with Assad, who, in
the short term, may be fine, but once
this is all over, I doubt very seriously
whether the Kurds will be treated well,
not to mention the Yazidi and the
Christian communities that the Kurds
were protecting, who now are also
under Assad’s rule. Suffice it to say
that nothing here has safeguarded
their interests.
There is news today that the Vice
President and the Secretary of State
were able to go to Turkey and work out
what is being called a ceasefire. I think
they deserve praise, along with the
President, for pursuing that mission
because anytime that human lives are
spared from death in a war, that is
cause for celebration.
With all due respect, it does not ap-
pear to me, however, that this is really
a ceasefire. It is more an ultimatum
because what Erdogan is basically say-
ing is this: Here is land that I intend to
take. I intend to drive every Kurd out
of this area, and I intend for Turkey to
control this area in northern Syria as a
security zone, as he calls it. The only
thing he has agreed to as an ultimatum
is that the Kurds can leave this area
voluntarily in the next 5 days, or he
will move in and take it and kill them.
You can call it a ceasefire, but, frank-
ly, it doesn’t appear to have changed
the strategic objective that Erdogan
has for that region.
I certainly think that while it is good
news that it made some lemonade out
of this lemon, nonetheless, these are
cities in which not just Kurdish troops
but people and families are going to
have to leave now, and we are going to
have to be involved in helping to co-
ordinate and guarantee that, which
runs its own risks.
Ultimately, it is an ultimatum by
him saying: You have 5 days to leave
before I move in and kill you.
How about limiting Iran’s influence?
First of all, clearly, Iran will now have
more operating space in Syria. The
lack of a U.S. presence there means
that Iran and its affiliated groups, par-
ticularly these Hezbollah shoots that
are now in Syria, will have much more
operating space. The stronger Assad is,
the stronger Iran will be. Assad is a
very close ally of the Iranians, and the
more space he controls, the more space
they have to operate.
Embedded in this, as you have no-
ticed, is that Iran has developed this
ability to conduct attacks against the
United States, sometimes using third
groups that they control, to either
blame the attacks on, to claim credit
for the attacks, or, in some cases, to
conduct them, because what this does
is it gives Iran the capability of at-
tacking the United States without fac-
ing international condemnation for the
attack—enough deniability—especially
from countries that are looking to not
blame Iran anyway because it would
force them to get out of the Iran deal.
And they have gotten away with it.
But one of the things that Iran has
calculated in these attacks—one of the
things they have taken into the cal-
culation—is this: We believe the United
States is trying to get out of the re-
gion; meaning, if we attack them, we
can hit them much harder than we ever
had before because they don’t want an-
other war. They are not going to hit us
back as hard. We can get away with
more.
I submit to you that I am pretty con-
fident that this decision has strength-
ened that perception, not weakened it.
I fear what that can mean next.
This also increases Iran’s influence in
Iraq. If you are an Iraqi politician right
now, whether you are a Shia or a
Sunni, and you have just seen this de-
cision, you are thinking to yourself:
We are next. And when the Americans
leave here at some point—at some
point we will have to—the Iranians are
going to become the most important
group on the ground.
In fact, there were reports yesterday
that there were these protests on the
street and there were Iranian-linked
militias with snipers on the rooftops
operating in Iraq. These were not ele-
ments of the army or the police force.
These were Iranian elements operating
in Iraq. This has increased their influ-
ence in Iraq and their ability to deter-
mine the future of Iraq in a way that is
terrible for us, terrible for our allies,
like Israel, and a great benefit to the
Iranians, not to mention that Syria
creates an extraordinary land bridge
that the Iranians can now use to in-
creasingly continue to supply
Hezbollah in Lebanon and to increas-
ingly supply their own militias just
across the Golan Heights.
The irony in all of this, ironically, is
that I fear this decision actually makes
it likely that there is going to be a
war. I will tell you why. As I pointed
out first, there is the Iranian attack
calculation. This further strengthens
their belief that they can get away
with even more brazen attacks because
the threshold for a U.S. military re-
sponse is higher than it has ever been
because we are looking to get out, and
this proves it.
What that can mean is they can mis-
calculate it, and we are going to have
to respond. Then, all of a sudden, you
are in a real shooting war—not a ‘‘2,000
person on the ground, working with the
Kurds’’ war, a real regional conflict.
The other point is that all of our alli-
ances around the world are built on se-
curity guarantees. In Eastern Europe,

the NATO security guarantee in many
of these countries is a 300-, 400-, 500-
man force—a tripwire. It is not enough
to stop a Russian incursion, but they
are there because if they were con-
fronted by Russians, that would trigger
a broader conflict.
You could say the same about South
Korea, our presence in Japan, the com-
mitments we have made to Israel, and
the troop presence we have now in
Saudi Arabia. It goes on and on and on.
Ask yourself: After this, would any
ally relying on the U.S. security assur-
ances be more or less confident of our
assurances? I will tell you this. Less
than 48 hours before this withdrawal
decision was made, the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff gave un-
equivocal assurances that we were not
going anywhere. The Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, a general, Gen-
eral Milley, said: We are there. We are
not going anywhere. These are all ru-
mors. Forty-eight hours later, this
withdrawal announcement was made.
With all due respect, this is not his
fault. I don’t blame him, if he believes
that. What is his credibility now when
he says anything like that to anybody
else or when he warns someone not to
do something against us because we
will act in return? Maybe his credi-
bility isn’t shot—and I would warn our
enemies not to view it that way—but I
can tell you it certainly hasn’t been
strengthened by this. One last point on
this. You know, Russia and China are
going all over the world trying to come
up with an ad hoc, anti-U.S. coalition—
a coalition of countries that are sanc-
tioned—to try to get around the
dollarization of the global economy, a
coalition to fight against the impedi-
ments against Chinese spyware and
technology, and a coalition to limit
our presence in one part of the world or
another. The argument they make to
these countries is, Why are you aligned
with America? They are unreliable.
They are unreliable partners. They will
cut on you as soon as it makes sense
domestically for them to do so or
somebody else gets elected and has a
different opinion.
Well, ask yourselves, has that argu-
ment been strengthened or weakened?
Have we made it easier or harder for
Russia and China to make that argu-
ment, including the countries that we
have basing agreements with now and
including the countries that we are
meeting with every single day and ask-
ing them: Don’t buy Russian weapons.
Don’t install Chinese technology and
spyware in your Safer City Initiatives
so they can spy on you and ultimately
on us. Don’t allow them to take over
your port facilities or operate
rotationally based military forces in
your national territory. We will help
you with those things instead.
Well, I can tell you that when China
and Russia go to them the next time
and say that America is unreliable,
they will have one more exhibit to
show them as evidence to prove it.
That is why I say this decision has an
impact that goes well beyond Syria.
I will tell you that, again, I think
what the Vice President and the Sec-
retary of State did today is noble.
There are lives that are going to be
saved because now they have 5 days to
leave those areas. But that doesn’t ad-
dress any of these other repercussions.
In a blink of an eye, we completely un-
dermined and unraveled the very jus-
tification for this operation and all of
the stated reasons we said we were
there. We had these 2,000 troops work-
ing with the Kurds to keep ISIS from
reemerging and to provide leverage in
the future Syrian settlement, to re-
strain Assad’s power, to safeguard
Kurdish interests, our partner’s inter-
est, and to limit Iranian influence.
Every single one of those stated inter-
ests—that was our policy less than 2
weeks ago—has been wiped out.
One of my favorite questions in the
hallway from the reporters is, What
should Congress do now? What can we
do? Well, I think we are all searching
to see what we can do to mitigate some
of this damage. But I want to be honest
with you—there are some mistakes and
some decisions that cannot be reversed.
There is some damage that cannot be
mitigated, and I fear that some of
these things are a part of it. We will
spend time thinking about it. I think
there might be some opportunities for
the administration in the weeks and
months to come to do something about
it, but right now, I think we need to
prepare ourselves for the consequences,
for what this is going to mean in the
long term.
So it was kind of a long answer to
give someone at a gas station when I
had a flight to catch in 45 minutes and
they were in a hurry as well, but I hope
that for the people back home and po-
tentially around the country who have
an interest in this topic, I was at least
able to shine some light on why some
of us do not support this decision.
It isn’t because we favor endless wars
or want invasions. It is because while
this may be popular when first pre-
sented to people, when you view it in
its totality and entirety, sometimes
what is popular in the short term is not
good for America’s national security in
the long term, and it is my fear that
this is one such example.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask

HEALTHCARE
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the
purpose of my speaking today is to re-
mind my colleagues about some his-
tory as it relates to the adoption of
Part D of Medicare back in 2003 and the
importance of considering that history
in regard to the importance of passing
legislation this year in regard to high
drug costs. The reminder goes to my
colleagues who are up for election,
based on the fact that the history of
the elections of 2000 and 2002 had con-
sequences for people who weren’t aware
of the grassroots support for doing
something for prescription drugs and
Medicare, as Part D turned out to be.
In this environment today, I don’t
think there is proper concern that peo-
ple—the grassroots of America—are ex-
pressing the need to do something
about prescription drug prices, so I am
going to spend my time doing what I
just summarized for you going through
the history of 20 years ago versus now.
I want to lower the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs for American seniors. I have
spoken on this topic many times be-
fore, and in my previous speeches years
and years ago, I said that we were de-
livering on the promises of the last
three elections in a bipartisan manner
to help seniors who had waited far too
long for relief, and that relief came out
as Medicare Part D.
That speech was more than 15 years
ago. We have been here before. In 2003,
I was leading the last piece of bipar-
tisan entitlement reform, the creation
of the Medicare Part D Program that
was entitled the ‘‘Medicare Moderniza-
tion Act of 2003.’’
Now here we are again on the cusp of
meaningful, bipartisan action in regard
to prescription drugs. This action
would fulfill the promises that I and
many of my colleagues and the admin-
istration, meaning the Trump adminis-
tration, made to the American people
that we are going to do something
about prescription drug pricing. We
should be reminded that promises made
ought to be promises kept.
I want to remind my colleagues that
history does not have to repeat itself.
Hopefully, this will help rid the grid-
lock that delayed us from delivering
Medicare Part D nearly two decades
ago.
As we all know, the Medicare Mod-
ernization Act was signed into law in
November of 2003, but the process of
creating Part D began long before the
President actually signed the bill. We
could go back more than a decade—but
that is not the most important part of
it—but Congress was voting on what
would become prescription drug cov-
erage as early as 1988. Obviously, it
didn’t become law.
Suggestions for how to help seniors
with prescription drugs came from
every corner throughout the next dec-
ade after those 1988 votes. Yet the pro-
posals weren’t enacted, so we failed to
bring any kind of comprehensive
change to Medicare.
Under President Clinton, prescription
drug pricing reform gained national at-
tention, just like it has national atten-
tion today because President Trump
has made it one of his premier goals of
reducing drug prices.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5888 October 17, 2019
So going back to the Clinton admin-
istration as part of the Balanced Budg-
et Act of 1997, Congress created a
forum to bring more attention to the
prescription drug program under Medi-
care. That was called the National Bi-
partisan Commission on the Future of
Medicare.
After a year’s worth of work and re-
search, the Commission voted on three
recommendations in 1999, including a
prescription drug benefit. However, the
recommendations failed to receive the
mandated supermajority of members’
votes, so no formal recommendations
were ever submitted to Congress be-
cause that was the rule of the Commis-
sion at the time. It had to be a super-
majority of the members of the Com-
mission.
Facing mounting pressure from the
public in anticipation of the 2000 elec-
tion, all of the major Presidential can-
didates presented plans. President
Bush had suggested a new Federal sub-
sidy to help low-income beneficiaries
purchase drug coverage through pri-
vate insurers.
Vice President Al Gore, the Demo-
cratic candidate, proposed a new vol-
untary benefit within Medicare to pro-
tect chronically ill and low-income
beneficiaries against catastrophic ex-
penses. Yet the Congress still couldn’t
reach a compromise, even though it
was very much discussed during that
Presidential election, and it was in a
lot of discussions in Senate races as
well.
At that time, the country was united
behind Medicare reform, but Congress
was divided on how or even if it should
act, and it did not act.
In the Finance Committee, the per-
son that preceded me when I took over
the chairmanship of the Finance Com-
mittee, a person by the name of Bill
Roth of Delaware, proposed two plans
to committee members in hopes that a
consensus could be reached. The first
plan worked to fundamentally change
the Medicare Program. The proposal
included a universal drug benefit for
the Medicare Program with several
major contracting reforms. The re-
forms would have permitted pharmacy
benefit managers, insurers, and other
qualified firms to compete to manage
the government drug benefit in a cost-
effective way.
Then-Chairman Roth also proposed a
scaled-back plan which would extend
prescription drug coverage to low-in-
come seniors and on the State level to
those seniors facing catastrophic levels
of spending. This second piece of the
Roth proposal was meant to be a back-
stop—just a short-term, bipartisan
bandaid on a gaping wound while nego-
tiations continued to find a longer
term solution.
Despite the support from then-Presi-
dent Bill Clinton and the Republican
majority leader, Trent Lott, com-
promise was elusive, and the Finance
Committee did not act before the No-
vember election. So then we had the
2000 election. Prescription drug cov-
erage was a big issue, and it was a big
issue probably more for Republicans
because we controlled the U.S. Senate.
We lost five incumbent Republican
Senators because people didn’t pay at-
tention to this being a major issue.
Hence, to remind you what I opened
with, I don’t want Senators making
that same mistake this year.
The American people were obviously
disappointed in the lack of action back
in 2000, and it showed, but as we have
to do when there is grassroots support
like there was then, we marched on to
find a path forward, but building con-
sensus was not easy.
I was chairman during part of that
time between the years 2000 and 2003. I
wasn’t chairman all that time because
the Senate flipped to a Democratic ma-
jority when Senator Jeffords of
Vermont changed from Republican to
Democrat. Between the years 2000 and
2003, we held countless meetings and
hearings on the status of Medicare and
how we could come to an agreement to
add Part D and bring Medicare into the
21st century. The gridlock seemed ines-
capable.
In 2002, the budget allowed for $350
billion to reform the Medicare Pro-
gram, most of that going toward the
prescription drug reform that we were
proposing. Partisan discord led to three
separate proposals being sent to the
Senate from House Republicans that
were subsequently voted down.
As a result of the 2002 elections, Re-
publicans were back in the majority,
and I retook the gavel as chair of the
Finance Committee. I promised at that
time legislation that would address
seniors’ concerns and be bipartisan so
it would pass an almost evenly split
Senate. That was my goal. In the Fi-
nance Committee, we went through the
important and wide-ranging process of
creating what eventually became the
Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.
I worked across the aisle, across the
Capitol, and down Pennsylvania Ave-
nue to make sure the prescription
drugs and Medicare improvement bill
struck the right balance, spending the
money allocated to us by President
Bush to be done in a fair and equitable
way. A lot had changed in the practice
of medicine since Medicare had been
signed into law 40 years before, in 1965,
and we needed to recognize that the
practice of medicine had changed. My
friend Senator Baucus, who was at that
time the Democratic ranking member
of my committee, and I were able to
thoughtfully pull together a Medicare
package by closing a big coverage gap
and doing that in the right way. The
Part D marketplace offered consumers
better choice, better coverage, and bet-
ter value. Of course, it was about time
that Congress had taken this action de-
manded by the grassroots of America
in a serious way. I said in 2003, ‘‘We all
know seniors don’t want politics, they
want prescription drugs,’’ and that
holds true today as we consider this
issue.
It is important to note that just like
in the 2000 election, the country took
notice, but this time it was for our ac-
complishments, and Republicans
gained four Senate seats in that 2004
election.
I am now standing here again, more
than 15 years later, to make the very
same point. It seems like deja vu.
American seniors don’t care about
party politics any more now than they
did in 2003. When it comes to almost
any issue, but particularly healthcare
issues, what they care about is having
access to affordable medication.
Once again, I am leading a bipartisan
effort to enact much needed entitle-
ment reform, and once again some of
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle
are resisting compromise. Once again,
medicine has changed since the last en-
titlement reform I led. Let me remind
you, prescription medication was not
much of a part of the cost of medicine
in 1965 when Medicare was passed. By
2003, it had become a significant por-
tion of the cost of medicine. That is
why people needed Medicare Part D.
Pharmaceuticals are even more a part
of the practice of medicine today. Sci-
entific advances have led to many new
and more effective treatments. How-
ever, they are often accompanied by
very high costs. That means prescrip-
tion drug prices have skyrocketed, and
Americans want Congress to act now so
they can afford their lifesaving medica-
tions.
Our seniors deserve better than the
over 5-year delay in action we put
them through last time—in other
words, 5 years before we finally passed
something in 2003 called Part D of
Medicare. They shouldn’t have to wait
5 years this time. Congress has been
here before. We want to make sure his-
tory doesn’t repeat itself. I want to
make sure it doesn’t repeat itself. I
personally have been here before. I
have watched the opportunity to help
patients slip away. Now, just like in
2003, Americans want action on entitle-
ment reforms. Now, just like in 2003,
the President supports action. Now,
just like back then in 2003, numerous
proposals were floated and ultimately
fell short of the finish line.
We have another opportunity to de-
liver meaningful reforms to help the
Part D program adapt to new innova-
tions in the healthcare world. The bill
that came out of my committee 19 to 9,
titled the ‘‘Prescription Drug Cost Re-
duction Act of 2019,’’ builds on the suc-
cessful programs we created in 2003. It
will lower beneficiary premiums by $6
billion and lower out-of-pocket costs
by $25 billion. The bill will implement
an out-of-pocket cap, eliminate excess
payments, cap taxpayer subsidies, and
permanently repeal the doughnut hole
in Medicare Part D. It uses market
forces. Those market forces will
incentivize manufacturers to lower list
prices and report more accurate cal-
culations of their rebate obligations.
In short, this is the right bill at the
right time. We should seize this oppor-
tunity to support actions that Ameri-
cans need now, not 5 or 10 years from
now.

tradition of the Finance Committee in
the same way that Senator Baucus and
I worked together 15 years ago on Part
D legislation.
I ask all of my colleagues to join
Senator WYDEN and me in our bipar-
tisan effort to lower the cost of pre-
scription drugs.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk

S.J. RES. 53
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I
rise today to discuss S.J. Res. 53, the
resolution of disapproval under the
Congressional Review Act on the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency’s Afford-
able Clean Energy, ACE rule. I fully
support passage of the resolution.
Every week seems to bring fresh evi-
dence of the damage climate change is
causing to our environment and econ-
omy. Increasing floods, heatwaves,
droughts, hurricanes, and snowstorms
have wreaked havoc on communities
across the country. We cannot con-
tinue to ignore that climate change is
already happening all around us. We
must take immediate action.
The Obama administration’s Clean
Power Plan established Federal stand-
ards for emissions of carbon dioxide
from fossil fuel-fired power plants. The
plan set achievable carbon emissions
reduction targets of 32 percent from
2005 levels by 2030 to be reached by re-
ducing emissions from coal-fired power
plants, shifting energy generation from
fossil fuels to renewable sources, and
promoting energy conservation. The
Clean Power Plan not only helped drive
the transition of our energy generation
to cleaner sources, it also served as the
centerpiece of U.S. efforts to lead the
world in addressing climate change
through the Paris Climate Agreement.
The administration’s rule would take
us backward by repealing the emissions
reduction targets in the Clean Power
Plan and replacing them with less am-
bitious targets based on narrow energy
efficiency improvements that also
wholly exempt natural gas-fired power
plants. It is clear that the new rules
will likely result in more carbon pollu-
tion, halt the accelerated trends to-
ward low- and zero-carbon energy, and
have dire implications for our air qual-
ity and public health.
For these reasons, I oppose the ad-
ministration’s rule and support passage
of Senator CARDIN’s resolution—S.J.
Res. 53—to disapprove of it.
Thank you.∑

States Code, of the rule submitted by
the Environmental Protection Agency
relating to ‘‘Repeal of the Clean Power
Plan; Emission Guidelines for Green-
house Gas Emissions From Existing

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Republic of Korea—AIM–120C Advanced Me-
dium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM)
The Republic of Korea (ROK) has requested
to buy one hundred twenty (120) AIM–120C–7/
C–8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Mis-
siles (AMRAAM). Also included are con-
tainers; weapon support and support equip-
ment; spare and repair parts; U.S. Govern-
ment and contractor engineering, technical,
and logistics support services; and other re-
lated elements of logistical and program sup-
port. The total estimated program cost is
$253 million.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security objectives of
the United States by meeting the legitimate
security and defense needs of one of the clos-
est allies in the INDOPACOM Theater. The
Republic of Korea is one of the major polit-
ical and economic powers in East Asia and
the Western Pacific and a key partner of the
United States in ensuring peace and stability
in that region. It is vital to U.S. national in-
terests to assist the Republic of Korea in de-
veloping and maintaining a strong and ready
self-defense capability.
This proposed sale will improve the ROK
capability to meet current and future
threats by increasing its stocks of medium
range missiles for its F–15K, KF–16, and F–35
fleets for its national defense. The potential
sale will further strengthen the interoper-
ability between the United States and the
ROK. The ROK will have no difficulty ab-
sorbing these additional missiles into its
armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The principal contractor will be Raytheon
of Waltham, MA. There are no known offset
agreements proposed in connection with this
potential sale. Any offset agreement will be
defined in negotiations between the Pur-
chaser and the prime contractor.
Implementation of the proposed sale will
not require the assignment of any additional
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the ROK.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5890 October 17, 2019
1. The proposed sale will involve the re-
lease of sensitive technology to the Republic
of Korea related to the AIM–120C–7/C–8 Ad-
vanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile
(AMRAAM). The AIM–120C–7/C–8 AMRAAM
is a supersonic, air launched, aerial inter-
cept, guided missile featuring digital tech-
nology and micro-miniature solid-state elec-
tronics. Purchase will include AMRAAM
Guidance Sections. AMRAAM capabilities
include look-down/shoot- down, multiple
launches against multiple targets, resistance
to electronic countermeasures, and intercep-
tion of high- and low-flying maneuvering
targets. The AIM–120C–8 is a form, fit, func-
tion refresh of the AIM–120C–7 and is the
next generation to be produced. The capa-
bilities of the AIM–120C–7 and C–8 are iden-
tical. The AMRAAM All Up Round is classi-
fied CONFIDENTIAL, major components and
subsystems range from UNCLASSIFIED to
CONFIDENTIAL, and technical data and
other documentation are classified up to SE-
CRET.
2. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system
effectiveness or be used in the development
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities.
3. A determination has been made that the
Republic of Korea can provide substantially
the same degree of protection for the sen-
sitive technology being released as the U.S.
Government. This sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the
Policy Justification.
4. All defense articles and services listed on
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Republic of Korea.

RECOGNIZING CAPE ELIZABETH
HIGH SCHOOL
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am
delighted to commend Cape Elizabeth
High School of Cape Elizabeth ME, on
being named a 2019 National Blue Rib-
bon Exemplary High Performing
School. This outstanding high school is
one of only 362 schools across the coun-
try to receive Blue Ribbon recognition
this year from the U.S. Department of
Education.
Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon
Schools Program honors schools that
are either academically superior in
their States or that demonstrate sig-
nificant gains in student achievement.
The schools singled out for this na-
tional recognition are models of high
educational standards and account-
ability.
This award recognizes the hard work
and determination of Cape Elizabeth
High School’s students, faculty, and
staff. This top-performing school has a
strong commitment to professional de-
velopment that ensures that teachers
and staff, as well as students, are life-
long learners. This recognition con-
tinues a tradition of excellence that
builds upon Cape Elizabeth High
School’s previous Blue Ribbon Award
in 2004.
Cape Elizabeth High School’s mission
is to ‘‘open minds, open doors.’’ The
school provides its 540 students with a
rigorous academic experience that pre-
pares students for college and career,
in a supportive environment that offers
students many opportunities to explore
their interests. Approximately 90 per-
cent of students participate in at least
one extracurricular activity, from the
arts and athletics to robotics club and
model united nations.
Cape Elizabeth students support each
other. Every incoming ninth-grade stu-
dent is assigned an upper class mentor
to ease the transition to high school.
Freshman Academy helps ninth grad-
ers explore their own values and
strengths. Across the grade levels, stu-
dents often say ‘‘thank you’’ to their
teachers at the end of class, a powerful
sign of a respectful school climate.
An active high school parents asso-
ciation strengthens the connections be-
tween school and home. The Cape Eliz-
abeth Education Foundation, the first
education foundation in Maine, fosters
innovation and excellence. Over the
years, the foundation has funded the
creation of the Achievement Center to
offer individualized tutoring, commis-
sioned compositions for performance
by school music ensembles, sponsored
sexual assault awareness programs
planned by students and staff together,
and supported teacher professional de-
velopment.
This Blue Ribbon Award is a tribute
not only to the students but also to the
administrators, teachers, staff, and
parents of Cape Elizabeth High School.
Together, they are accomplishing their
mission to help students succeed in the
classroom and as engaged citizens.
They are making a difference in the
lives of their students, helping them
reach their full potential. I congratu-
late the entire community for this
well-deserved recognition.

ELEMENTARY
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am
delighted to commend Fruit Street El-
ementary School in Bangor, ME, on
being named a 2019 National Blue Rib-

School. Serving 325 students from pre-
K through third grade, this out-
standing school is one of only 362

the U.S. Department of Education.
Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon

Maine.
Fruit Street Elementary School’s
mission statement, ‘‘A high quality
education is attainable by all of our
students who will receive the encour-
agement and opportunities to develop
the knowledge, skills, and attitudes
that prepare them for citizenship in a

social studies, with special programs
that recognize each student’s indi-
vidual learning style.
At Fruit Street, rich and diverse
learning opportunities are a part of
every child’s experience, from art and
music, to library skills and physical
education. The school involves all stu-
dents in extracurricular activities,
which helps forge a strong school com-
munity where students are connected
and encouraged to pursue their inter-

dents are also taught to use technology
both effectively and responsibly.

members are committed to both aca-
demic excellence and each child’s so-
cial, emotional, and physical health.
Faculty work to ensure an effective
learning environment and to develop
strong and collaborative relationships
with parents and community members.
An active parent-teacher organization
supports enriching educational activi-
ties and promotes excellence and inno-
vation by funding special projects and
initiatives.
I applaud the administrators, teach-
ers, staff, and parents of Fruit Street
Elementary School. Together, they are

students’ confidence and generate mo-
mentum for learning. I congratulate
the entire school community for this
outstanding achievement.

October 17, 2019
Yarmouth Elementary School was
awarded a Blue Ribbon last year.
The mission of Yarmouth High
School is to ‘‘empower all students to
create fulfilling lives in a changing
world.’’ Yarmouth High School is
known for its extensive extra-cur-
ricular activities, which help forge a
strong school community where stu-
dents are connected and encouraged to

vides strong STEM education and
world language courses. A comprehen-
sive social studies curriculum includes
a Public Policy Project in which stu-
dents conduct individual research on a
contemporary policy issue and present
their recommendations to policy mak-
ers.
Yarmouth High School students are
active in their community. The stu-
dent senate allows them to be involved

INDUCTION OF BROOKS & DUNN,
RAY STEVENS, AND JERRY
BRADLEY INTO THE COUNTRY
MUSIC HALL OF FAME
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, in
Nashville, we have a saying: it all
starts with a song; but a song is just
the beginning of the story.
This Sunday, Nashville’s unbroken
circle of elite artists, producers, enter-
tainers, and musical masterminds will
welcome four new members into the
Country Music Hall of Fame.
Kix Brooks, Ronnie Dunn, Ray Ste-
vens, and Jerry Bradley represent dif-
ferent sectors within the music indus-
try, but they have all contributed to
country music’s evolution.
Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn—we
know them as Brooks & Dunn—began
their careers as solo singer-songwriters
but rocketed to stardom as a duo.
Their fusion of classic rock composi-
tion and heartfelt songwriting spoke to
country music fans craving an edge to
the genre’s traditional ‘‘Nashville
Sound.’’ Nearly three decades after
their first album dropped, their music
still inspires emerging generations of
fans.
From the beginning of his career, au-
diences and fellow artists alike were
drawn to Ray Stevens’ wonderful sense
of humor, open heart, and commitment
to entertainment as an art form.
Known for his work in musical comedy,
Ray stretched his legs and also made a
name for himself as a studio musician,
producer, songwriter, publisher, label
owner, gospel singer, and country star.
Jerry Bradley, this year’s final in-
ductee, may not have invented country
music, but no one on Music Row would
deny the impact his work has had on
generations of country stars. Jerry
began his career in Nashville when the
industry was on the brink of a major
transformation. He drove the format
into a new era defined by rebels, out-
laws, and crossover superstars.
Today, I encourage my colleagues to
take a moment to think of their favor-
ite song and to remember how it made
them feel the first time they heard it.
Kix, Ronnie, Ray, and Jerry are re-
sponsible for making millions of people
feel that exact same way about their
favorite song.
Their body of work represents more
than just a series of accomplishments.
It represents the best of Music City.
It is a gift.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO JOHN ROBERTSON
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise
today to recognize my friend John Rob-
ertson, a dedicated servant to the great
people of West Virginia and native of
our State capital, Charleston. After a
41-year career, John is retiring as the
general manager of the Charleston Col-
iseum and Convention Center.
Throughout these past four decades,
John’s leadership has transformed the
facility, turning it into one of the cul-
tural epicenters of our State.
In August of 1978, with a bachelor’s
degree from the University of Charles-
ton under his belt, John began his ca-
reer as an assistant manager for the
Charleston Civic Center. At the time,
the building was in its fledgling stages,
having just broken ground the month
before. For John, it was all hands on
deck, and he hit the ground running,
assisting in structural related duties,
as well as the concession stand oper-
ations. Two years later, in August of
1980, the Charleston Civic Center was
host to its first big concert—the band
Queen.
With John’s vision and leadership at
the helm, this was just the beginning
for the Charleston Civic Center. Soon
after the center was completed, the
necessary renovations to turn the civic
center into exhibit and meeting facili-
ties were well under way. Through ad-
ditional construction, two parking
structures were placed contiguous to
the Civic Center, creating an entirely
different complex by 1983.
John’s greatest of many accomplish-
ments has come within the past few
years, when approval of a city sales tax
appropriated the proper funding to
build the state-of-the-art facility that
he had always dreamed of creating for
his home town. John worked tirelessly
with the mayor and Charleston city
council, civic center board members,
his staff, city planners, and consulting
firms to complete the new Charleston
Coliseum and Convention Center in the
fall of 2018. This achievement is under-
scored by the fact that the center was
continually operated during the entire
construction period.
The Charleston Civic Center is held
so fondly in the memories of so many
West Virginians. For some, it is where
they saw their favorite band perform
live for the first time. For others, it
was where they were able to bring
home a State basketball title. From
Garth Brooks concerts, to oldtime car
shows, West Virginia versus Marshall
basketball games or the West Virginia
Book Festival, one thing has remained
the same; that is, John’s dedication to
the citizens of Charleston through his
tireless work to make sure that every
detail of every event, no matter how
big or small, held at the Charleston
Civic Center was in place.
In retirement, John will now have
more time to spend with his loving wife
Kimberly, his daughters Bethany and
Allyson, and his grandchildren Lucy
and Henry, but the lasting effects of
what he did for our State and the city
of Charleston will continue on for gen-
erations to come. I wish John all the
best as he continues to make a dif-
ference in his community with his un-
wavering diligence and kind soul. It is
truly an honor to call you friend and
fellow West Virginian.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
ON JUNE 13, 2019
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and
Mr. MANCHIN):
S. 1868. A bill to provide support to
States to establish invisible high-risk
pool or reinsurance programs; to the
Committee on Finance.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, rising
health care costs are a major concern
for millions of Americans—whether it’s
expensive health insurance premiums,
high out-of-pocket expenses, or soaring
prescription drug costs. In the indi-
vidual market, where 11.5 million
Americans who do not have employer-
sponsored insurance have to go to buy
their insurance—including the 78,000
individuals in Maine—premiums con-
tinue to rise exponentially.
With this in mind, I am introducing
the Premium Reduction Act of 2019
with my good friend and colleague,
Senator JOE MANCHIN. Leading health
care experts at Oliver Wyman indicate
that our legislation would lower aver-
age health insurance premiums for con-
sumers in the individual market by as
much as 30 percent. In addition, more
than a million more individuals would
have health insurance that they now
lack.
Data from the Kaiser Family Foun-
dation show premiums for the bench-
mark ‘‘silver’’ plans under the Afford-
able Care Act (ACA) are nearly 75 per-
cent higher than they were when the
ACA went ‘‘live’’ in 2014. While individ-
uals who are eligible for the ACA’s pre-
mium tax credits are shielded from
these increases, the price of these sil-
ver plans is out of reach for many who
are not eligible for these tax credits.
Even ‘‘bronze plans’’—the lowest cost
individual market policies available
through the ACA exchanges—have be-
come unaffordable for those without
subsidies. Bronze plan premiums have
gone up so much that they now exceed
those charged for silver plans in 2014,
despite the fact that these bronze poli-
cies have far higher deductibles and
out-of-pocket expenses.
Individuals who make 400 percent or
less of the federal poverty level get a
federal tax credit to help defray the
monthly premium cost. But individuals
who make just one dollar over that
level get no help at all, and must pay
the full premium on their own. These
premiums are simply unaffordable for
middle-income families.
The difference in premiums is shock-
ing for many families. For example, in
Aroostook County, Maine, a 60 year-old
couple enrolled in a silver plan will pay
about $6,500 for coverage if they earn
400 percent or less of the federal pov-
erty level: in other words, as long as
they earn less than roughly $66,000. But
if they earn just a dollar more, they
will lose their eligibility for a premium
tax credit, and will have to pay the en-
tire premium themselves—an incred-
ible $36,500!
One step Congress could take to help
alleviate the rising cost of premiums in
the individual health insurance mar-
kets is to provide States with addi-
tional flexibility and support to design
State-based stabilization programs
that would help offset the costs of cov-
ering consumers with high medical ex-
penses. Once these costs are covered,
the premiums needed to provide insur-
ance to the rest of the population can
be set at a much lower level. Thus far,
seven states—Maine, Alaska, Mary-
land, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon,
and Wisconsin—have established such
programs. According to the health care
experts at Avalere, the programs in
these seven states have reduced pre-
miums in the individual market by 20
percent compared to what they other-
wise would have been, and saved the
federal government nearly $1 billion in
funding in the first year, which was re-
turned to the states in the form of
‘‘pass through’’ funding.
Under the Premium Reduction Act,
$5 billion would be available annually
over three years to support states that
operate stabilization programs under
section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act.
In addition, $500 million is provided to
assist states with planning the design
of their own stabilization program, and
there is a ‘‘federal fallback’’ for 2021 to
give states time to apply for waivers
under section 1332. It is important to
note that our proposal does not change
in any way the ACA’s essential benefits
requirements or its protections for in-
dividuals with pre-existing conditions.
The bill provides three options for ex-
pedited review so that states could
quickly stand-up their own programs
using the existing waiver process under
section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act:
First, a state can demonstrate that
their program is an ‘‘invisible high-risk
pool’’ in keeping with the design pio-
neered by Maine early in this decade
and used as a template by Alaska more
recently;
Second, a state can show that its pro-
gram fits within the parameters of the
ACA’s transitional reinsurance pro-
gram, which expired at the end of 2016;
or
Third, a state can submit what can
be described as a ‘‘copycat’’ application
based on another state’s program that
has already received approval.
In lieu of these three expedited ap-
proval options, a state may seek ap-
proval of a program of their own de-
sign. Regardless of the option they se-
lect, all states operating qualifying
stabilization programs would be eligi-
ble to receive an allocation from the
funding provided by the bill. States
may also add funds from other sources
to the mix.
In addition, in 2021, states that do
not wish to establish their own sta-
bilization program may instead receive
funding through the ‘‘federal fallback’’
that I described a few moments ago.
Finally, the bill would also extend
the section 1332 ‘‘feedback effect’’ to
states that receive funding through the
federal fallback provision. This will en-
sure that the benefits of lower pre-
miums are felt in all states as quickly
as possible, giving states ample time to
seek and obtain approval of their own
programs under the waiver process.
In a recent letter to me endorsing
our bill, the National Association of In-
surance Commissioners stressed that
‘‘[alction must be taken to make cov-
erage more affordable or we will see
even higher uninsured rates, more peo-
ple move to less regulated plans, and
sicker individual market pools.’’ The
NAIC’s letter goes on to note the suc-
cess of stabilization programs at the
state level, stating that such programs
are ‘‘a cost-effective way to signifi-
cantly reduce individual market pre-
miums’’ that can expand coverage and
make it more affordable unsubsidized
individuals and families. The NAIC
closed its letter with a call to imple-
ment such programs nationwide.
Also, a consortium of health care
providers, insurers, and stakeholders—
joined by the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce—circulated a letter recently to
Senate and House leadership urging
them to adopt a proposal like the one
we are introducing as a ‘‘commonsense
solution to significantly lower pre-
miums.’’ In their letter, they stressed
that premium reduction programs can
‘‘help cover the costs of people with
significant health care needs and im-
prove the affordability of health care
coverage,’’ especially for those who are
not eligible for subsidies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5900 October 17, 2019
Mr. President, I ask that these let-
ters be entered into the RECORD imme-
diately after my remarks.
Efforts at further reform of Amer-
ica’s health care system have been the
source of frustration and division in
this chamber. At the same time, many
members of both parties are committed
to reducing health care costs and ex-
panding access to quality, affordable
coverage. The programs adopted by
seven pioneering states have a proven
track-record in reducing premiums for
consumers and would make policies in
the individual market more affordable.
The bill Senator MANCHIN and I are in-
troducing today would help extend and
fund these successful models to every
state that chooses to participate, help-
ing to reduce premiums for the 11.5
million Americans who get their insur-
ance in the individual market nation-
wide. I urge my colleagues to support
our bill.
MAY 28, 2019.
DEAR LEADERS MCCONNELL AND SCHUMER,
SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCARTHY: As
providers of health care and coverage to hun-
dreds of millions of Americans, we write to
you to urge prompt action to lower health
insurance premiums. The individual market
is a critical source of coverage for millions
of Americans, helping them to access care.
Unfortunately, however, individual market
premiums are often unaffordable for many
middle class families who do not receive any
financial assistance. With health insurers fi-
nalizing their premium rates for 2020, the
time is now for Congress to establish a pre-
mium reduction/reinsurance program to help
cover the costs of people with significant
health care needs and improve the afford-
ability of health care coverage.
A reinsurance program is a commonsense
solution to significantly lower premiums,
which would greatly improve access to cov-
erage and care. Independent analyses, includ-
ing ones by Oliver Wyman and Avalere
Health, show that a premium reduction/rein-
surance program could reduce premiums by
up to 20% while preserving the comprehen-
siveness of coverage, primarily helping those
who are not subsidy eligible.
We understand that there are numerous ef-
forts in Congress underway to establish a
premium reduction/reinsurance program,
and we are happy to work with all parties to-
wards a final bill that will improve the indi-
vidual market for 2020 and beyond.
We urge you to deliver on the promise to
reduce premiums for millions of deserving
Americans and their families so they can ac-
cess the care they need. We look forward to
working with you in support of this promise.

Hon. SUSAN COLLINS,
Senator, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SENATOR COLLINS: On behalf of the
members of the National Association of In-
surance Commissioners (NAIC) we write to
express our support for your continued ef-
forts to help improve the individual health
insurance markets in our states through the
funding of state stabilization programs.
While many states have seen more stable
premium rates and carrier participation over
the past two years, the fact remains that in
all states premiums continue to be signifi-
cant for those who do not receive federal
subsidies. This has resulted in shrinking in-
dividual markets and less stable risk pools.
Action must be taken to make coverage
more affordable or we will see even higher
uninsured rates, more people move to less-
regulated plans, and sicker individual mar-
ket pools.
This is why commissioners from across the
political spectrum have contacted their con-
gressional delegations, testified before House
and Senate committees, and urged federal
policymakers to take immediate action to
stabilize the individual health insurance
market. In particular, we support your pro-
posal to provide federal funding for state sta-
bilization programs, as well as for grants to
help states develop innovative solutions
through Section 1332 waivers. We also sup-
port the creation of a federal program to as-
sist consumers in states unable to imple-
ment their own program quickly.
State reinsurance programs and invisible
high-risk pools have already proven their ef-
fectiveness. According to a recent Avalere
study, the seven states that have already im-
plemented a program through a Section 1332
waiver using state funds have reduced pre-
mium by almost 20%. Additional federal
funding, as outlined in your bill, would pro-
vide even more benefit to consumers, and ex-
tend the benefits to all states.
Creating a federal market stabilization
program is a cost-effective way to signifi-
cantly reduce individual market premiums,
thus making coverage more affordable to un-
subsidized individuals and families and grow-
ing the individual market pool. We have seen
it work in the handful of states that have
implemented such programs; it is time to
implement it nationwide.

SENATE RESOLUTION 360—AFFIRM-
ING THE IMPORTANCE OF AC-
CESS TO SAFE, QUALITY EDU-
CATION, INCLUDING PROTECTION
FROM ATTACKS ON EDUCATION,
FOR CHILDREN IN CONFLICT
SETTINGS
Mr. MURPHY submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions:
S. RES. 360
Whereas providing children with education
is critical to the international, humani-
tarian, and development efforts of the United
States;
Whereas 142,000,000 children live in high-in-
tensity conflict zones, according to a Feb-
ruary 2019 report from Save the Children;
Whereas grave violations against children,
which are defined by the United Nations Se-
curity Council as the killing and maiming of
children, recruitment or use of children as
soldiers, sexual violence against children,
abduction of children, and attacks against
schools or hospitals, have nearly tripled
since 2010;
Whereas attacks on education settings, in-
cluding targeted killings, sexual and gender-
based violence, abduction, child recruitment,
intimidation, threats, military occupation,
and destruction of property, are common
tactics in conflict;
Whereas there were 1,432 verified attacks
on schools in conflict contexts in 2017, ac-
cording to the United Nations Secretary
General’s annual report on children and
armed conflict;
Whereas conflict limits educational oppor-
tunities for millions of students worldwide,
and regions with low rates of education have
a 50-percent chance of experiencing conflict;
Whereas 27,000,000 children of primary and
lower secondary school age are out of school

in 24 conflict-affected countries, and refugee
children are 5 times more likely to be out of
school as compared to nonrefugee children;
Whereas only 61 percent of refugee children
attend primary school compared to 92 per-
cent of nonrefugee children, only 23 percent
of refugee adolescents attend secondary
school compared to 84 percent globally, and
only 1 percent of refugee children make it to
a university;
Whereas education in emergencies is life-
saving, providing access to critical services,
including nutrition, health services, mental
health and psychosocial support, water, sani-
tation, and hygiene;
Whereas education supports children’s
safety and well-being as part of child protec-
tion strategies;
Whereas education accounts for less than 2
percent of total global humanitarian funding
and child-specific protection programs ac-
count for 0.53 percent;
Whereas girls and boys experience conflict
differently, encounter distinct gender-re-
lated barriers to education, and require gen-
der-responsive and context-specific ap-
proaches to education, child protection, and
health services, including mental health and
psychosocial support programming;
Whereas girls, children with disabilities,
and those impacted by traumatic experi-
ences living in conflict contexts face signifi-
cant barriers to access, enrollment, and at-
tendance in schools;
Whereas access to quality educational op-
portunities can contribute to peace and secu-
rity as well as mitigate factors that lead to
conflict and displacement; and
Whereas Congress passed the Reinforcing
Education Accountability in Development
Act (Public Law 115–56), and the Protecting
Girls’ Access to Education in Vulnerable
Settings Act (Public Law 115–442), which rec-
ognize the importance of education in crisis
and conflict situations, and require reporting
on progress toward a comprehensive United
States strategy to promote quality basic
education in partner countries and address
the needs of displaced girls: Now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) condemns attacks on education set-
tings, including violence against schools, the
military use of schools, acts of sexual vio-
lence against children in school settings, and
the abduction and recruitment of children
into armed forces from schools;
(2) affirms the commitment of the United
States Government to support educational
services for children affected by conflict, in-
cluding the most vulnerable and
marginalized, beginning in the earliest
phases of humanitarian response efforts—
(A) to save lives and facilitate access to
critical services, including nutrition, health,
psychosocial support, water, sanitation, and
hygiene;
(B) to support physical, psychosocial, and
cognitive protection; and
(C) to support greater short- and long-term
stability, promote peace, and support the
vital contributions of women and girls to
communities, nations, and regions around
the world; and
(3) calls on the United States Govern-
ment—
(A) to monitor attacks on education set-
tings, including attacks on schools, teachers,
and students, and attacks that are gender-re-
lated, and to use that information to support
effective and coordinated diplomatic and
programmatic responses;
(B) to hold accountable all parties, includ-
ing government and non-state actors, re-
sponsible for attacks on schools and other
grave violations against children in armed
conflict;
(C) to support policies and programs to re-
turn refugee children to educational settings
as soon as possible upon arrival in a host
country;
(D) to provide support for the inclusion of
refugee children in host country national
education plans and systems whenever pos-
sible;
(E) to recognize that education in emer-
gencies and child protection programs are
lifesaving and complementary efforts that
are strongest when equally supported;
(F) to ensure that marginalized children in
conflict settings, especially girls, children
with disabilities, those suffering from trau-
ma, and those excluded from access to qual-
ity and inclusive education due to other
causes, are able to access safe, quality edu-
cation;
(G) to ensure appropriate training and sup-
port for teachers to best support students’
distinct needs, including their psychosocial
well-being, and to apply conflict-sensitive
and gender-responsive approaches;
(H) to encourage the inclusion of child pro-
tection experts in peacekeeping missions, to
push for reporting requirements on attacks
on schools and children in peacekeeping
mandates, and to support the inclusion of
child rights experts in justice and account-
ability mechanisms;
(I) to support preventative measures, such
as early warning systems and rapid response
mechanisms, in places where attacks on edu-
cation occur or are highly likely to occur;
and
(J) to work in collaboration with civil soci-
ety experts to better prevent and respond to
attacks on education, and with relevant mul-
tilateral institutions and other nations to
share responsibility for monitoring, pre-
venting, and responding to attacks on edu-
cation.

SENATE RESOLUTION 361—AC-
KNOWLEDGING THE KURDS’
VITAL ROLE IN STOPPING THE
SPREAD OF ISIS MILITANTS IN
THE MIDDLE EAST, AND FOR
OTHER PURPOSES
Ms. ERNST (for herself and Mr.
RUBIO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations.:
S. RES. 361
Whereas, in 2014, the United States led an
international coalition against Islamic State
(ISIS) militants, conducting airstrikes and
later building military bases on Syrian terri-
tory to assist ground operations against
ISIS;
Whereas a coalition of Arab and Kurdish
militias, known as the Syrian Democratic
Forces (SDF), with the help of United States
airstrikes and military advisors, drove ISIS
away from the Turkish border and out of
northern Syria;
Whereas, since ISIS militants swept across
Syria and military action against ISIS
began, the SDF has done the critical work of
clearing, holding, and governing the terri-
tory previously conquered by the ISIS mili-
tants;
Whereas the SDF became one of the United
States’ strongest partners in fighting ISIS as
fearless and loyal fighters who fought fierce-
ly alongside United States special operations
forces and other coalition partners, losing
over 10,000 SDF troops throughout the course
of military operations;
Whereas the SDF with coalition support
captured approximately 11,000 ISIS fighters
and detained them in Kurdish-held territory;
Whereas the Kurds have assisted humani-
tarian efforts in the area, including caring
for refugees and operating more than a dozen
camps for displaced families, helping tens of
thousands of people, many of them the wives
and children of ISIS fighters;
Whereas the Government of Turkey is hos-
tile toward Kurdish groups living along its
border with Syria, claiming that the Kurdish
fighters in Syria are linked to the Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK), which has been in con-
flict with Turkey for the past several dec-
ades;
Whereas the SDF has not engaged in offen-
sive operations against Turkey and has
served as a buffer preventing extremist fight-
ers from launching attacks into Turkey and
beyond;
Whereas the United States Armed Forces
were ordered to withdraw from sites along
the Turkish border in northern Syria, fol-
lowed by a Turkish incursion that began on
October 9, 2019;
Whereas the withdrawal of United States
troops and the ongoing conflict between Tur-
key and Kurdish-led fighters will allow ISIS
to profit from the instability in the region,
as SDF counter-ISIS missions have been sus-
pended, and Kurdish-held ISIS prisoners are
in danger of being released from confine-
ment, as the SDF no longer have the capac-
ity to guard detention facilities while they
are engaged in defensive operations against
Turkish forces; and
Whereas the withdrawal of United States
forces from northern Syria has severely dam-
aged our relationship with our Kurdish part-
ners, effectively forcing them to ally with
the Assad regime, allowing the Governments
of the Russian Federation and Iran to expand
their influence in the region, while at the
same time laying the groundwork for an
ISIS resurgence, damaging the United
States’s standing in the international com-
munity and undermining both regional secu-
rity as well as our own national security:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That is the sense of the Senate—
(1) to acknowledge the importance of the
Kurds’ vital role in stopping the spread of
ISIS militants in the region;
(2) that ISIS still poses a danger in the
Middle East and beyond and must not be al-
lowed the opportunity to mount an effective
resurgence campaign;
(3) that the United States Government
must continue its leading role in promoting
peace in the Middle East and fighting
against terrorist groups such as ISIS, wher-
ever they may be located; and
(4) that the Department of Defense, in con-
junction with the Department of State,
should provide a briefing to Congress within
30 days outlining plans and a strategy to
continue the global fight against ISIS, spe-
cifically addressing the ongoing threat of
ISIS in Syria and Iraq and how this strategy
will—
(A) prevent an ISIS resurgence in Syria;
(B) prevent ISIS efforts to capitalize from
recent developments;
(C) contain any ISIS expansion in Syria or
in nations bordering Syria;
(D) mitigate the threat of ISIS attacks on
the United States homeland or our partners
and allies; and
(E) protect the gains made in the fight
against ISIS since 2014.

S5902 October 17, 2019
S. RES. 362
Whereas, in 1903, President Theodore Roo-
sevelt established the first national wildlife
refuge on Pelican Island in Florida;
Whereas, in 2019, the National Wildlife Ref-
uge System, administered by the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service, is the pre-
mier system of land and water to conserve
wildlife in the world and has grown to 567 na-
tional wildlife refuges and 38 wetland man-
agement districts located in every State and
territory of the United States;
Whereas national wildlife refuges are im-
portant recreational and tourism destina-
tions in communities across the United
States and offer a variety of recreational op-
portunities, including 6 wildlife-dependent
uses that the National Wildlife Refuge Sys-
tem manages, specifically hunting, fishing,
wildlife observation, photography, environ-
mental education, and interpretation;
Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge Sys-
tem receives more than 50,000,000 visitors an-
nually, which generates more than
$3,200,000,000 in sales and more than 41,000
jobs in local economies;
Whereas 382 units of the National Wildlife
Refuge System have hunting programs that
receive more than 2,000,000 hunting visits an-
nually, and 316 units of the National Wildlife
Refuge System have fishing programs that
receive more than 7,000,000 fishing visits an-
nually;
Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge Sys-
tem has hosted more than 30,000,000 wildlife
observation visits in recent years;
Whereas national wildlife refuges are im-
portant to local businesses and gateway
communities;
Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge Sys-
tem encompasses every kind of ecosystem in
the United States, including temperate,
tropical, and boreal forests, wetlands,
deserts, grasslands, arctic tundras, and re-
mote islands, and spans 12 time zones from
the United States Virgin Islands to Guam;
Whereas national wildlife refuges are home
to more than—
(1) 700 species of birds;
(2) 220 species of mammals;
(3) 250 species of reptiles and amphibians;
and
(4) 1,000 species of fish;
Whereas national wildlife refuges are the
primary Federal land on which the produc-
tion, migration, and wintering habitats for
waterfowl are fostered;
Whereas, since 1934, the Migratory Bird
Conservation Fund, which has been largely
funded from the sale of the Federal Duck
Stamp to outdoor enthusiasts, has generated
more than $1,500,000,000 and enabled the con-
servation of more than 5,900,000 acres of
habitat for waterfowl and numerous other
species in the National Wildlife Refuge Sys-
tem;
Whereas national wildlife refuges provide
protection to more than 380 threatened and
endangered species;
Whereas national wildlife refuges are cores
of conservation for larger landscapes and re-
sources for other agencies of the Federal
Government, State governments, private
landowners, and organizations in efforts to
secure the wildlife heritage of the United
States;
Whereas more than 38,000 volunteers and
almost 200 national wildlife refuge ‘‘Friends’’
organizations contribute approximately
1,350,000 volunteer hours annually, the equiv-
alent of 650 full-time employees, and provide
an important link to local communities;
Whereas national wildlife refuges provide
an important opportunity for children to dis-
cover and gain a greater appreciation for the
natural world;
Whereas there are national wildlife refuges
located in several urban and suburban areas
and there is a national wildlife refuge lo-
cated within a 1-hour drive of nearly every
metropolitan area in the United States,
which has enabled national wildlife refuges
to employ, educate, and engage young people
from all backgrounds in exploring, con-
necting with, and preserving the natural her-
itage of the United States;
Whereas, since 1995, national wildlife ref-
uges across the United States have held fes-
tivals, educational programs, guided tours,
and other events to celebrate National Wild-
life Refuge Week during the second full week
of October;
Whereas the United States Fish and Wild-
life Service has designated the week begin-
ning on October 13, 2019, as ‘‘National Wild-
life Refuge Week’’; and
Whereas the designation of National Wild-
life Refuge Week by the Senate would recog-
nize more than a century of conservation in
the United States, raise awareness about the
importance of wildlife and the National
Wildlife Refuge System, and celebrate the
myriad recreational opportunities available
for the enjoyment of the protected land and
water within that system: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates the week beginning on Octo-
ber 13, 2019, as ‘‘National Wildlife Refuge
Week’’;
(2) encourages the observance of National
Wildlife Refuge Week with appropriate
events and activities;
(3) acknowledges the importance of na-

SENATE RESOLUTION 363—DESIG-
NATING OCTOBER 2019 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL YOUTH JUSTICE ACTION
MONTH’’
Mr. SCHUMER (for Ms. HARRIS) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary:
S. RES. 363
Whereas the historical role of the juvenile
court system is to rehabilitate and treat
young offenders while holding them account-
able and maintaining public safety, and the
juvenile court system is therefore better
equipped to work with youth than the adult
criminal justice system, which is punitive in
nature;
Whereas youth are developmentally dif-
ferent from adults, and those differences
have been—
(1) documented by research on the adoles-
cent brain; and
(2) acknowledged by the Supreme Court of
the United States, State supreme courts, and
many State and Federal laws that prohibit
youth under the age of 18 from taking on
major adult responsibilities such as voting,
jury duty, and military service;
Whereas youth who are placed under the
commitment of the juvenile court system
are able to access age-appropriate services
and education and remain closer to their
families, which reduces the likelihood that
those youth will commit offenses in the fu-
ture;
Whereas, every year in the United States,
an estimated 76,000 youth are tried, sen-
tenced, or incarcerated as adults, and most
of those youth are prosecuted for nonviolent
offenses;
Whereas most laws allowing the prosecu-
tion of youth as adults were enacted before
the publication of research-based evidence
by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention and the Office of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention of the Depart-
ment of Justice demonstrating that pros-
ecuting youth in adult court actually de-
creases public safety as, on average, youth
prosecuted in adult court are 34 percent
more likely to commit future crimes than
youth retained in the juvenile court system;
Whereas youth of color, youth with disabil-
ities, and youth with mental health issues
are disproportionally represented at all
stages of the criminal justice system;
Whereas it is harmful to public safety and
to young offenders to confine youth in adult
jails or prisons where they are significantly
more likely to be physically and sexually as-
saulted and often placed in solitary confine-
ment;
Whereas youth sentenced as adults receive
an adult criminal record that hinders future
education and employment opportunities;
Whereas youth who receive extremely long
sentences deserve an opportunity to dem-
onstrate their potential to grow and change;
and
Whereas, in October, people around the
United States participate in Youth Justice
Action Month to increase public awareness
of the issues facing youth transferred to the
adult criminal justice system and to provide
people across the United States with an op-
portunity to develop action-oriented events
in their communities: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) acknowledges that the collateral con-
sequences normally applied in the adult
criminal justice system should not auto-
matically apply to youth arrested for crimes
before the age of 18;
(2) designates October 2019 as ‘‘National
Youth Justice Action Month’’; and
(3) recognizes and supports the goals and
ideals of National Youth Justice Action
Month.

FOOD DAY’’
Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. MORAN,
Mr. BOOZMAN, and Mr. LEAHY) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 365
Whereas hunger and malnutrition are daily
facts of life for hundreds of millions of peo-
ple around the world;
Whereas women and children suffer the
most serious effects of hunger and malnutri-
tion;
Whereas millions of children die each year
from hunger-related illness and disease;
Whereas many people suffer permanent
physical or mental impairment because of
vitamin or protein deficiencies;
Whereas the United States has a long tra-
dition of demonstrating humanitarian con-
cern for the hungry and malnourished people
of the world;
Whereas there is a growing concern in the
United States and in other countries about
threats to the future food supply, including—
(1) misuse and overuse of land and water;
(2) loss of biological diversity; and
(3) erosion of genetic resources on a global
scale;
Whereas the world community increas-
ingly calls upon the United States to resolve
food problems stemming from natural- and
human-made disasters by providing humani-
tarian assistance;
Whereas the United States—
(1) plays a major role in the development
and implementation of international food
and agricultural trade standards and prac-
tices; and
(2) recognizes the positive role that the
global food trade can play in enhancing
human nutrition and alleviating hunger;
Whereas, although progress has been made
in reducing the incidence of hunger and mal-
nutrition in the United States, certain
groups remain vulnerable to malnutrition
and related diseases;
Whereas the conservation of natural re-
sources, the preservation of biological diver-
sity, and strong public and private agricul-
tural research programs are required for the
United States—
(1) to remain food secure; and
(2) to continue to aid the hungry and mal-
nourished people of the world;
Whereas the United States is a world lead-
er in the development of agricultural innova-
tion and technology aimed at enhancing the
improved production, safety, and quality of
the world food supply and must continue to
retain that role;
Whereas participation by private vol-
untary organizations and businesses, work-
ing with national governments and the inter-
national community, is essential in the
search for ways to increase food production
in developing countries and improve food
distribution to hungry and malnourished
people;
Whereas the Food and Agriculture Organi-
zation of the United Nations (referred to in
this preamble as the ‘‘FAO’’) is mandated to
lead global efforts to address food and nutri-
tion security issues;
Whereas the member nations of the FAO
have unanimously designated October 16 of
each year as ‘‘World Food Day’’;
Whereas the FAO has worked to organize
activities and efforts on ‘‘World Food Day’’
in over 130 countries to promote awareness
of and action for people suffering from hun-
ger and malnutrition;
Whereas past observances of ‘‘World Food
Day’’ have been supported—
(1) by proclamations by Congress, the
President, the 50 States, the District of Co-
lumbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
and the territories and possessions of the
United States; and
(2) by programs of the Department of Agri-
culture and other Federal departments and
agencies;
Whereas private voluntary organizations
and community leaders are participating in
planning ‘‘World Food Day’’ observances in
2019 and 2020, and a growing number of these
organizations and leaders are using ‘‘World
Food Day’’ as a focal point for year-round
programs; and
Whereas the people of the United States
can express their concern for the plight of
hungry and malnourished people throughout
the world by study, advocacy, and action:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates October 16, 2019, and October
16, 2020, as ‘‘World Food Day’’; and

States to observe the days with appropriate

HONORING THE LIFE OF TRISHA
MARTINEZ
HON. NORMA J. TORRES
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of Trisha Mar-
tinez of the City of Montclair, and her tireless
dedication to serving the Inland Empire com-
munity.
A resident of Montclair since 1992, Trisha
was elected to the Montclair City Council in
2014 and re-elected in 2018. Throughout her
tenure, Trisha was a fierce advocate for the
City she dearly loved. As a Council member,
she fought for Montclair’s award-winning
Montclair to College Program which provides
free tuition and books to graduating Montclair
High School students who attend Chaffey Col-
lege for up to two years.
Trisha also remained committed to
Montclair’s seniors, working to ensure the el-
derly community continues to receive free or
reduced-cost services, including micro-transit
and discounted refuse services. Trisha also
continued to volunteer with the Senior Nutri-
tion Program at the Montclair Senior Center
for over 10 years.
In April 2019, Trisha was diagnosed with
cervical cancer. Despite spending most of
these past months in hospitals, Trisha still
dedicated herself to attending City Council
meetings and other local and regional board
meetings. This rare kind of commitment and
devotion to the people of Montclair is worthy
of admiration.
For her exemplary life of service, Madam
Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Montclair
City Council Member Trisha Martinez on the
House floor. Her decades of commitment and
contributions to the city she loved are exem-
plary, and her memory will live on through the
countless lives she impacted. May she rest in
peace.

TRIBUTE HONORING LATHRAN J.
WOODARD
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to pay tribute to an outstanding South
Carolinian and a proven health care champion
for the people of South Carolina and the na-
tion. Lathran Johnson Woodard has devoted
her career to promoting the health and well-
being of South Carolinians, especially those
who struggle to access quality health care.
A Columbia, South Carolina native, Ms.
Woodard received her primary and secondary
education in Richland County public schools,
graduating from C.A. Johnson High School in
Columbia. She received her Bachelor of
Science Degree in Business Administration
from Southern Wesleyan University and began
her career at the South Carolina Department
of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).
Over the course of her fourteen-year tenure,
she was promoted to various positions at the
agency. Her hard work and dedication earned
her the position of Deputy Director for the Divi-
sion of Maternal Health. While at DHEC, Ms.
Woodard helped write and initiate the state’s
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program
and led initiatives to ensure access and im-
prove the quality of services provided to moth-
ers and children in South Carolina.
Ms. Woodard has achieved over 30 years of
service in the health care field. In 1987, she
became the Assistant Director for the South
Carolina Primary Health Care Association
(SCPHCA), where she now serves as the
Chief Executive Officer. As CEO of SCPHCA,
Ms. Woodard has worked relentlessly to en-
sure the strength and capacity of the state’s
primary care safety net, focusing primarily on
assistance to those health care centers that
provide vital services to medically underserved
communities. Her primary interests are com-
munity systems design, the development of in-
tegrated systems of healthcare, and youth
self-enhancement.
Beyond her work in South Carolina, Ms.
Woodard has promoted health care on a na-
tional level as well. She is currently the Chair-
Elect of the National Association of Commu-
nity Health Centers. She holds membership in
the National Association of Female Execu-
tives, the National Rural Health Association,
the American Society of Association Execu-
tives, and the South Carolina Public Health
Association. She has earned several awards
and honors. Most recently, Ms. Woodard was
a recipient of the Order of Palmetto, the high-
est honor a civilian can receive in the State of
South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my col-
leagues join me in offering congratulations and
sincere gratitude to Ms. Lathran J. Woodard
for her unwavering service to the people of
South Carolina and the nation. Her many con-
tributions have improved the quality of life for
so many South Carolinians and helped ad-
vance healthy communities throughout the
country. I am pleased to honor her for exem-
plifying what it means to be a true public serv-
ant.

CONGRATULATING SENATOR
MAGGIE HASSAN ON RECEIVING
THE 2019 NEW ENGLANDER OF
THE YEAR AWARD
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate my friend and colleague, Sen-
ator MAGGIE HASSAN, for receiving the 2019
New Englander of the Year award from the
New England Council. This award recognizes
New Englanders who make our region such a
wonderful place to live, learn, and grow.
Senator HASSAN epitomizes all that we
should strive for as public servants. Her call to
public service is deeply rooted in her belief
that everyone, no matter their ability or back-
ground, should be able to fully participate in
their communities. Senator HASSAN knows that
when we lift up and empower all members of
our community, we can collectively rise higher.
First as a New Hampshire State Senator,
then as Governor, and now as a United States
Senator, Senator HASSAN has been a com-
mitted public servant and champion in making
our communities stronger. During her tenure
as governor, I was honored to work under her
leadership to expand access to health care
and deliver additional resources for treatment
and recovery. Now in Washington, I am proud
to work with her to address the opioid crisis,
foster a more inclusive future, and build a New
Hampshire economy that works for everyone.
Senator HASSAN’s steadfast advocacy for
our state and region may only be surpassed
by one other thing—her passion for our great
New England sports team.
I could not think of a better recipient of such
an award than my colleague, Senator MAGGIE
HASSAN. On behalf of our constituents in New
Hampshire’s First Congressional District, I
want to congratulate Senator HASSAN on this
well-deserved honor.

Long-Term Readiness Reform Act.’’ I want to
thank Congresswoman HARTZLER for her sup-
port as an original cosponsor.
Our legislation would require the Depart-
ment of Defense to acquire and purchase only
American-made raw materials, medicines, and
vaccines for our military. It would also require
the Department of Defense to identify the na-
tional security vulnerabilities caused by our
country’s current dependence on Chinese
pharmaceuticals.
As a result of the Chinese government’s
chokehold on the generic pharmaceutical mar-
ket, our military servicemembers have been
left vulnerable. China is a principal creator of
generic prescriptions, which account for ap-
proximately 90 percent of the global pharma-
ceutical market.
The reality is that if the Chinese wanted to
cripple the United States they could sabotage
or cut off our supply of generic medications
and antibiotics used by our military. This sim-
ply is a vulnerability that we cannot let con-
tinue to exist. We need to reinvigorate the

HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE YEMENI AMER-
ICAN BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
honor of the Yemeni American Benevolent As-
sociation, an outstanding service organization
in Wayne County, Michigan, for its fifty years
of service.
The Yemeni American Benevolent Associa-
tion was founded in 1969 to promote em-
powerment of people, environmental protec-
tion, and respect for cultural diversity. They
have worked to cultivate community leader-
ship, as well as providing education and other
services to the surrounding community. Aside
from language classes, translation services,
and tutoring, the Yemeni American Benevolent
Association has grown its annual scholarship
program to help young people achieve their
dreams of pursuing higher education. The
scholarship program is an amazing achieve-
ment that has provided a pathway to a better
future and encourages young people to give
back to their community.
I ask you to please join me in tribute to the
Yemeni American Benevolent Association as
they celebrate this milestone.

With the help of their PTA’s, Plano ISD is cul-
tivating crucial relationships between teachers,
parents, and the surrounding community.
Their dedication to improving the learning
environment for students in and outside of the
classroom serves as a crucial reminder of vol-

RECOGNIZING THE WASHINGTON
BLADE
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing The Washington Blade on
the occasion of its 50th anniversary.
On October 5, 1969, Richard M. Nixon was
President, John W. McCormick was Speaker
of the House, Richard Russell, Jr. was Senate
President pro tempore, Americans were listen-
ing to ‘‘Sugar Sugar’’ by The Archies, and the
91st Congress was in weekend recess. How-
ever, a few LGBTQ Washingtonians read the
first edition of The Gay Blade, created by
Nancy Tucker and Lilli Vincenz.
The Gay Blade survived controversy, epi-
demic and bankruptcy to thrive as America’s
LGBTQ newspaper of record, The Washington
Blade. On October 18, 2019, The Blade cele-
brates its 50th anniversary with a gala at the
Wharf.
Since its inception, The Blade continued as
a monthly one-sheet newsletter until it ex-
panded to four pages in June 1972. By April
1974, it grew to eight legal-sized sheets, and
in July of the following year, The Gay Blade
moved to newsprint.
During the 1970s, The Gay Blade changed
its name to The Blade. Don Michaels became
the editor. Michaels took The Blade out of the
closet by prohibiting pen names, and he in-
creased its frequency to biweekly. By the dec-
ade’s end, the newspaper added ‘‘Wash-
ington’’ to its masthead.
The Washington Blade entered the 1980s
with headline, ‘‘Rare, Fatal Pneumonia Hits
Gay Men,’’ one of the earliest newspaper arti-
cles on the disease that became AIDS. The
Blade promoted Don Michaels to publisher, a
position he held for two decades. By the dec-
ade’s end, the newspaper adopted computer
layout that led to its online edition in 1995.
Window Media, LLC purchased The Blade
in 2001. The paper’s staff unionized, and in
2008, The Blade published the first interview
ever given by a Republican presidential can-
didate to an LGBTQ newspaper. The Blade
grew steadily until November 16, 2009.
That Monday, Window Media filed Chapter
7 bankruptcy. The Blade’s staff found its of-
fices locked. Former staff volunteered to
produce a new publication, DC Agenda, by the
following Friday.
Publisher Lynne Brown, editor Kevin Naff,
sales executive Brian Pitts and other former
Blade staff members pooled their resources to
form Brown Naff Pitts Omnimedia. This com-
pany published DC Agenda weekly until April
2010, when it acquired The Blade’s assets
from the bankruptcy court. Like a phoenix, The
Washington Blade rose from the ashes on
April 30, 2010.
The Blade remains, for many in our nation’s
capital, including me, a weekly must-read. It
continues, according to The New York Times,
to be ‘‘one of the most influential publications
written for a gay audience.’’
In closing, I remind the House of Represent-
atives that the 700,000 residents of the District
of Columbia have yet to read, and The Blade,
despite its many scoops and breaking news
stories, has yet to publish the banner ‘‘Wash-
ington, D.C. the 51st State.’’
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in celebrating The
Washington Blade on the occasion of its 50th
anniversary.

HONOR THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF
MR. DON WAFUL
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life and legacy of Mr. Don Waful,
who passed away at the age of 103 on Sep-
tember 12, 2019. Mr. Waful was known in
Central New York as a decorated World War
II veteran, prominent Syracuse University
sports fan, and for his tenure as the President
of the Syracuse Sky Chiefs baseball team.
After graduating from Syracuse University
with a bachelor’s degree in 1937 and master’s
degree in 1939, Mr. Waful went on to enlist in
the U.S. Army at the onset of World War II. In
the war, Mr. Waful served with the 1st Ar-
mored Division, receiving several commenda-
tions for his service including, the POW
Medal, American Defense Service Medal, Eu-
ropean-African-Middle Eastern Campaign
Medal, World War II Victory Medal, and the
Honorable Service Lapel Button. Notably,
while in Tunisia, Mr. Waful and his unit en-
countered a German tank company, which
subsequently took him and his unit prisoner.
Mr. Waful survived as a POW in camps in
Italy, Poland, and Germany before finally re-
turning home.
Following World War II, Mr. Waful returned
home to Central New York to pursue a career
in insurance and to serve as the President of
the Syracuse Sky Chiefs baseball team. In his
role with the Sky Chiefs, Mr. Waful contributed
to the design and construction of NBT Bank
stadium, which opened in 1997. Along with his
contributions to the Sky Chiefs, Mr. Waful was
known for his unwavering support of Syracuse
University sports. As a lifelong Syracuse Uni-
versity Football fan, Mr. Waful was a mainstay
at home games, missing only three contests
since 1945.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
in the House join me in honoring the life and
legacy of Mr. Don Waful. As a celebrated
member of our Central New York community
and prominent Syracuse sports supporter, Mr.
Waful will be dearly missed. I ask my col-
leagues to keep him and his family in mind as
we remember his life.

HON. MARK E. GREEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 64th Anniver-
sary of the Clarksville, Tennessee chapter of
the NAACP.
This local chapter was chartered 64 years
ago in 1955, just as the Civil Rights Movement
was starting to gain momentum throughout the
nation, culminating in 1963 with the March on
Washington and Martin Luther King, Jr.’s ‘‘I
Have A Dream’’ speech. The leadership of Dr.
King and the NAACP challenged the nation to
live up to its own founding ideals of liberty and
justice for all.
The Clarksville NAACP has continued to
serve the community since its founding, par-
ticularly in its engagement with the young peo-
ple of Clarksville and its support for education.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
United States House of Representatives to
join me in congratulating the Clarksville branch
of the NAACP for its service to the community
over the past 64 years.

HON. NYDIA M. VELÁZQUEZ
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 90th Anniversary of
Queens Public Library, Ridgewood Branch. I
also rise to thank Friends of the Ridgewood
Library and Principal Librarian Thomas
Maxheimer for their contributions to this cele-
brated anniversary.
Queens Public Library, Ridgewood Branch
opened on October 15, 1929. Not only was
Queens Public Library, Ridgewood Branch the
first library to open in Queens, but also the
first library to be publicly-funded by the City of
New York.
Over the last 90 years, Queens Public Li-
brary, Ridgewood Branch has served as a cor-
nerstone of the Queens community. In one of
the most diverse counties in New York State,
the Library continues to invite individuals of all
ages and ethnicities to learn, research and
discover. In addition, Queens Public Library,
Ridgewood Branch serves the community
through unparalleled accessibility, providing
resources for individuals with physical and/or
visual impairments. From children’s story time
to genealogical research tools, the library of-
fers a wide range of programming and learn-
ing opportunities.
I ask my colleagues of the 116th Congress
to join me in celebrating the 90th Anniversary
of the Queens Public Library, Ridgewood
Branch by recognizing its crucial contributions

CALLING ATTENTION TO AN IM-
PRESSIVE PROGRAM THAT
ORIGINATED IN POCATELLO,
IDAHO
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 2019 Idaho Career & Tech-
nical Education (ICTE) Special Program
Award recipient, the Construction Combine.
At the Construction Combine, program par-
ticipants learn to demonstrate their construc-
tion skills to builders who are potential em-
ployers. The program recruits local contractors
to teach construction skills to interested high
school students and others, and construction
materials suppliers such as Home Depot gen-
erously provide the necessary supplies and
tools to facilitate building sheds for this two-
day event. The completed sheds are donated
to deserving veterans at no cost.
The Construction Combine is the brain-child
of Mr. Scott Stevens. As a staff member in
Idaho State University’s (ISU) Continuing Edu-
cation and Workforce Training Program
(CEWT), Mr. Stevens recognized the need to
attract more skilled workers to the construction
industry and to increase the housing stock in
order to promote economic growth. He teamed
up with Brad Landon, the Pocatello/Chubbuck
Home Depot Store manager, to execute his vi-
sion—one that helps home builders, veterans
and students. There was extensive additional
support from the surrounding high schools;
local contractors; Gary Salazar, the Director of
ISU’s CEWT; and others in ISU’s CEWT Pro-
gram.
The first Construction Combine event took
place at the Pocatello/Chubbuck Home Depot
in the Spring of 2018 with 54 participants, pro-
ducing eight sheds. The following year, in
2019, the Construction Combine hosted six
events in Idaho and Oregon with 228 partici-
pants, producing 41 sheds. I am eager to see
the continued growth of this program in years
to come.
Madam Speaker, I would like to join the
ICTE Awards Selection Committee in recog-
nizing the Construction Combine as an inno-
vative solution to the construction and low
housing stock issues associated with Idaho’s
very low unemployment rate and our booming
economy. I would like to recognize ISU’s
CEWT, the Home Depot, and the local con-
tractors for their efforts to make the Construc-
tion Combine a success and to give back to
their communities. Congratulations.
RECOGNITION OF WOOD COUNTY,
OHIO’S 200TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the Bicentennial of Wood County,
Ohio. This Crossroad of America was estab-
lished by the Ohio State Legislature on Feb-
ruary 12, 1820. Wood County has historical
ties to the earliest days of Ohio history, gain-
ing its name from Colonel Eleazer D. Wood,
the planning engineer of Fort Meigs in 1813.
Wood County was once home to the Great
Black Swamp. This made settlement of the
area extremely difficult, but the pioneering
spirit of early residents produced an extensive
system of ditches which drained the swamp
and revealed the rich farmland beneath. There
are still more than 3,000 miles of drainage
ditches keeping the county dry to this day.
The oil and natural gas industries were the
first to enter Wood County in the late 1800s.
This caused a large spike in population as
people migrated to the county in hopes of ob-
taining riches. Wood County currently covers
nearly 620 square miles of land and water
which provides evidence of the rural traditions
and history of the area, while fostering agricul-
tural ingenuity, manufacturing developments,
and educational success.
The celebration of the 200th Anniversary of
Wood County is a meaningful reminder of the
hard work, grit, and pioneering attitude upon
which Wood County, Ohio and the United
States of America were founded. Congratula-
tions to Wood County in celebration of its Bi-
centennial Year.

a national historical landmark in Fair Lawn,
New Jersey. This year marks the 300th anni-
versary of the settlement of Garretson in 1719.
Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the vol-
unteers of Garretson Forge and Farm Res-
toration, Inc., this special property has been
preserved and kept open to the community. In
recognition of Garretson’s anniversary, I would
like to include in the RECORD the poem ‘A Her-
itage to Keep,’ by William F. Haywood which
captures the long history of Garretson Forge
and Farm, a Bergen County treasure:
The traffic moves in swifter pace
Around the bend that holds this place
In gentle curves where time has flown
And countless passers it has known.
The silent step of moccasin,
The echoing of forge’s din;
A gangling pine saw all of these,
New homes replacing other trees.
The continental soldier came,
Lone hunter seeking wary game,
A farmer tilling fertile soil
Where the river turns its coil.
So generations came and went
Through seasons ill and fairly spent.

HONORING LYLE ENDICOTT
HON. MIKE BOST
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Lyle Endicott of Mt. Vernon, Illinois, for
his selfless service to our country during
World War II and for his upcoming 98th birth-
day. Mr. Endicott served his country with
honor, started multiple successful businesses,
and is a staple in his community.
Mr. Endicott was born in Mt. Vernon on De-
cember 7, 1921. Twenty years later, when the
Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, he enlisted
in the United States Navy and became a fight-
er pilot. As a naval aviator, Mr. Endicott de-
ployed to the Pacific on the Steamer Bay Air-
craft Carrier, where he supported the inva-
sions of Iwo Jima and the Okinawa Islands.
After his honorable discharge, he married Eliz-
abeth ‘‘Annie’’ Piercy and started a family.
Upon settling in Woodlawn, Illinois, the two
opened a grocery store and Endicott Interiors,
a furniture business that still operates today.
Mr. Endicott later became the head pilot for
Self Oil Company in Mt. Vernon and was re-
nowned as one of Southern Illinois’ finest avi-
ators. Those who know Mr. Endicott say that
he is fun-loving and fearless in his approach
to life. As a father, grandfather, and now
great-grandfather, he is a true family man who
has touched countless lives.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
Lyle Endicott for his unwavering patriotism and
celebrate his birthday. On behalf of Southern
Illinois, happy 98th.

Thursday, October 17, 2019
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

Fehr is an educator at Cassidy Elementary
School in Lexington, Kentucky.
Mrs. Fehr has been selected to receive a
Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathe-
matics and Science Teaching by the National

on behalf of the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy, recognizes
outstanding K–12 teachers for their contribu-
tions to the teaching and learning of science,
technology, engineering, mathematics, and/or
computer science.
Mrs. Fehr, a graduate of Xavier University,
has been an elementary teacher for 24 years
and has taught at Cassidy Elementary School
since 2014. She is a science lab teacher for
grades K–5. Among many of her accomplish-
ments, she partnered with a bio-systems engi-
neer at the University of Kentucky to imple-
ment a science garden at Cassidy. She led a
Scientists and Engineers Empowering Kids
(SEEK) Science Club for 3rd through 5th grad-
ers. She annually recruits engineers from the
community to lead sessions with students dur-
ing National Engineers Week. Mrs. Fehr has
been awarded numerous environmental and
sustainability awards. She is a recognized
leader in her school and among science edu-
cators.
I thank Mrs. Fehr for educating and inspiring
her students in the field of science. This pres-
tigious award is well-deserved by Mrs. Fehr
due to her innovation, dedication, and passion
that she brings to science education. I con-
gratulate her on being awarded the Presi-

MISSING AND MURDERED
INDIGENOUS WOMEN
SPEECH OF
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I include in
the RECORD the following letter regarding the
Special Order on Missing and Murdered Indig-
enous Women on October 17, 2019.
NEZ PERCE,
TRIBAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,
Lapwai, ID, September 18, 2019.
Hon. JERROLD NADLER,
Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary,
Washington, DC.
Hon. RAÚL GRIJALVA,
Chairman, House Committee on Natural Re-
sources, Washington, DC.
Hon. DOUG COLLINS,
Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judi-
ciary, Washington, DC.
Hon. ROB BISHOP,
Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural
Resources, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMEN NADLER AND GRIJALVA AND
RANKING MEMBERS COLLINS AND BISHOP: As
Congressman Newhouse stated in his June 6
letter, Native American and Alaska Native
women face a murder rate ten times higher
than the national average, with 84% experi-
encing some form of violence in their life-
time. Still, the tools and resources to docu-
ment and address this issue are severely
lacking in Indian Country due to outdated
databases and a lack of coordination between
law enforcement agencies. In addition to the
Violence Against women Reauthorization
Act of 2019 (H.R. 1585), legislation such as Sa-
vanna’s Act (H.R. 2733), the Native Youth
and Tribal Officer Protection Act (H.R. 958),
and the Bridging Agency Data Gaps and En-
suring Safety for Native Communities Act
(H.R. 4289) are each distinctly designed to
provide an array of solutions to some of
these unique problems.
To fully understand the need for this type
of legislation and the federal resources and
programs necessary to combat violence
against women and the resulting issues, it is
important to hear directly from commu-
nities to learn how reservations, families,
and law enforcement are impacted by this
crisis. The Nez Perce Tribe has suffered the
loss of a number of our tribal citizens as a
result of violence. It is for this reason, and
because Washington State encompasses some
of the Tribe’s treaty-reserved homelands,
that the Nez Perce Tribe supports Congress-
man Newhouse’s request that either one or
both of your committees host field hearings
in the state of Washington to examine issues
relating to missing and murdered Indian
women.
Thank you for your consideration of this
request.
Sincerely,
SHANNON F. WHEELER,
Chairman.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF LOUIS
M. CHIBBARO, JR.
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, during the
50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riot, it is my
honor and pleasure to rise today to ask the
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing my friend, Ward 6 neighbor and Wash-
ington institution Louis M. Chibbaro, Jr.
Chibbaro is the Senior News Reporter for our
nation’s LGBTQ newspaper of record, The
Washington Blade.
Washington, D.C. contains one of the larg-
est LGBTQ communities in the United States.
Among the thousands of LGBTQ Washing-
tonians, two names stand out: the late Dr.
Franklin Kameny, who made the headlines,
and Lou Chibbaro, Jr., who wrote the bylines.
Chibbaro is a native New Yorker who came
to D.C. in 1971 as a college student with the
State University of New York at Brockport
Washington Semester Program. Upon gradua-
tion, he returned to work for the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency. He continued his
studies at American University before begin-
ning his career as a reporter for several
Washington-based independent newsletters,
Environment Report, Energy Today and
Science Trends.
Chibbaro became a public information rep-
resentative for the American Public Power As-
sociation in 1975. Chibbaro volunteered as a
freelance news writer and co-host for the then
D.C. gay radio program ‘‘Friends.’’ He soon
began freelancing for The Washington Blade.
The Blade hired him in 1982 part-time and
later promoted him to full-time staff in 1984.
Chibbaro pounds the LGBTQ beat. He has
covered the panoply of national and local
LGBTQ interests of social, religious, and gov-
ernmental institutions: the White House, Con-
gress, the U.S. Supreme Court, the military,
law enforcement agencies and the Catholic
Church. Chibbaro began reporting on D.C.
local politics with the 1978 mayoral and coun-
cil elections. He commenced his chronicles of
the Democratic and Republican conventions
as a credentialed reporter in 1984.
Chibbaro has covered HIV and AIDS since
the 1980s. He reported on the Matthew Shep-
herd trial from Laramie, Wyoming. Chibbaro
filed radio news repo1ts on LGBTQ develop-
ments for the Sirius XM Radio Network’s
‘‘OutQ News’’ program from 2013 to 2019.
Chibbaro has received accolades for his
contributions to journalism. The Office of the
United States Attorney for the District of Co-
lumbia presented him with the 1998 Justice for
Victims of Crime Award. The Office cited his
‘‘outstanding service to crime victims and their
families’’ through his news reporting. His col-

MISSING AND MURDERED
INDIGENOUS WOMEN
SPEECH OF
HON. DON YOUNG
OF ALASKA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to
speak about the ongoing epidemic of Missing
and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.
Alaska Native and American Indian women
and girls face disproportionately high rates of
violent crimes including murder, rape, kidnap-
ping, and trafficking. Alaska Native and Amer-
ican Indian women are 10 times more likely to
be murdered than other Americans. The Na-
tional Crime Information Center reported that,
in 2016, there were close to 6000 reports of
missing American Indian and Alaska Native
women and girls. According to the Urban In-
dian Health Institute, Alaska is the fourth high-
est state in terms of the number of these
cases.
In Alaska, extreme isolation and lack of law
enforcement in remote Native communities
make it difficult to prevent and respond to
these crimes. In fact, only one out of every
three Alaska Native villages have any law en-
forcement at all. These villages are not con-
nected to the road system, and it can take
days for state troopers to respond to incidents,
particularly when weather prevents flights from
landing. Women and girls in urban areas also
face risk factors, particularly when they are
away from the support of family and culture.
Given the scale of the crisis, it is troubling
that tribes and Native communities do not
have adequate resources to respond. Native
communities around the country are governed
by a varying patchwork of criminal jurisdictions
that complicate law enforcement and leave
Native women and girls unprotected. Native
communities and tribes also lack full access to
crime databases, which undermines the efforts
of tribal law enforcement and tribal courts. In
addition, the Justice Department, which is re-
sponsible for pursuing the most serious crimes
in Native communities, declines to prosecute
the majority of these cases.
Instead of simply acknowledging these
issues, Congress must act. We must reauthor-
ize the Violence Against Women Act. VAWA
funds vital programs, like domestic violence
shelters. The House’s reauthorization bill ex-
pands legal authority for tribes to prosecute
violent crimes against women. It also includes
a new demonstration program, enhanced by
an amendment I offered, that would expand
Alaska Native villages’ jurisdictional authority.
We must pass the BADGES Act, which
Rep. HAALAND sponsored and I cosponsored.
The BADGES Act improves BIA law enforce-
ment recruitment and retention. The bill also
improves federal law enforcement reporting
mechanisms for missing and murdered Indige-
nous women. In addition, it expands tribal ac-
cess to federal criminal databases. Congress
must honor the trust relationship and pass this
crucial legislation.

HONORING THE NEW MEMORIAL
PARK IN THE TOWN OF SARA-
TOGA DEDICATED TO THE HIS-
TORIC SURRENDER OF BRITISH
GENERAL BURGOYNE TO AMER-
ICAN GENERAL GATES ON OCTO-
BER 17, 1777
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the new memorial park in the
town of Saratoga dedicated to the historic sur-
render of British General Burgoyne to Amer-
ican General Gates on October 17, 1777.
242 Years ago, the first and second battles
of Saratoga marked a crucial turning point in
the American Revolutionary War. The courage
and effectiveness of American troops during
the battles broke the British Army’s air of in-
vincibility and led to the Franco-American alli-
ance that proved crucial to winning the war.
Today, that famous battle is memorialized in
the rotunda of the Capitol with the famous
painting by John Trumbull depicting General
Burgoyne surrendering his sword to General
Gates. That image was used to create a
bronze relief that is displayed at the new me-
morial park. Many historians rank The Battle
of Saratoga as one of the most consequential
battles in history and I am glad to see this rec-
ognition for the heroism and sacrifices made
that day.
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional
District, I want to thank The Friends of Sara-
toga Battlefield, Open Space Institute, the
Hudson-Hoosic Partnership and Saratoga Na-
tional Historical Park for their hard work mak-
ing this memorial a reality. It is crucial that we
honor the achievements and sacrifices of
those Americans who came before us as we
chart our path forward. I look forward to this
memorial serving as a space for all Americans
to come and reflect on our history while we
contemplate the future.

COMMEMORATING THE 50 YEAR
ANNIVERSARY OF COMMUNITY
HUMAN SERVICES
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 17, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask my colleagues in the House join me in
congratulating Community Human Services on
the occasion of their 50th Anniversary.
Throughout the last half-century, Community
Human Services has not only brought atten-
tion to, but also alleviated the hardships that
middle and low income individuals and fami-
lies in Monterey County face on a daily basis.
Under the leadership of Chief Executive Offi-
cer Robin McCrae, the agency has grown
from three programs, 55 employees, and a $1
million budget to a multi-million dollar organi-
zation with a workforce that has doubled and
operates twelve programs throughout Mon-
terey County.
Community Human Services’ mission is to
address the tribulations that can be associated
with addiction, mental illness, emotional
health, domestic violence, child abuse, home-
lessness, and any other issue individuals may
have trouble solving on their own. The institu-
tion allows people of all ages access to the
tools necessary to overcome these chal-
lenges, creating lasting and sustainable
changes on the central coast of California.
A key aspect of Community Human Serv-
ice’s mission involves connecting with individ-
uals in our community and ensuring them that
help is available to them without insurance or
monetary compensation. Information regarding
programs and corresponding issues are widely
distributed to schools, businesses, civic
groups, churches, and service organizations.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in recognizing and congratulating the
commitment that Community Human Services
has provided the Central Coast. As the organi-
zation celebrates its 50th Anniversary, I am
proud to recognize Community Human Serv-
ices for its continued work to address the chal-
lenges of individuals and families on the Cen-
tral Coast. We are fortunate to have an institu-
tion like Community Human Services call the
20th Congressional District of California home.

enriching and enhancing the quality of life of
Chinese-American families in Brooklyn and
beyond. The families it serves are grateful for
their dedication and commitment to the com-
munity.

gratulating the Chinese American Planning
