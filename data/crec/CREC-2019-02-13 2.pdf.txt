SEC. 748. (a) The Secretary of Agriculture (re-

county-level agriculture risk coverage payments
under section 1117(b)(1) of the Agricultural Act
of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017(b)(1)), that provides all or
some of the State Farm Service Agency offices in
each State the opportunity to provide agricul-
tural producers in the State a supplemental
payment described in subsection (c) based on the
alternate calculation method described in sub-
section (b) for 1 or more counties in a State if
the office for that State determines that the al-
ternate calculation method is necessary to en-
sure that, to the maximum extent practicable,
there are not significant yield calculation dis-
parities between comparable counties in the
State.
(b) The alternate calculation method referred
to in subsection (a) is a method of calculating
the actual yield for the 2018 crop year for coun-
ty-level agriculture risk coverage payments
under section 1117(b)(1) of the Agricultural Act
of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017(b)(1)), under which—
(1) county data of the National Agricultural
Statistics Service (referred to in this section as
‘‘NASS data’’) is used for the calculations;
(2) if there is insufficient NASS data for a
county (as determined under standards of the
Secretary in effect as of the date of enactment
of this Act) or the available NASS data produces
a substantially disparate result, the calculation
of the county yield is determined using com-
parable contiguous county NASS data as deter-
mined by the Farm Service Agency office in the
applicable State; and
(3) if there is insufficient NASS data for a
comparable contiguous county (as determined
under standards of the Secretary in effect as of
the date of enactment of this Act), the calcula-
tion of the county yield is determined using reli-
able yield data from other sources, such as Risk
Management Agency data, National Agricul-
tural Statistics Service district data, National
Agricultural Statistics Service State yield data,
or other data as determined by the Farm Service
Agency office in the applicable State.
(c)(1) A supplemental payment made under
the pilot program established under this section
may be made to an agricultural producer who is
subject to the alternate calculation method de-
scribed in subsection (b) if that agricultural pro-
ducer would otherwise receive a county-level ag-
riculture risk coverage payment for the 2018
crop year in an amount that is less than the
payment that the agricultural producer would
receive under the alternate calculation method.
(2) The amount of a supplemental payment to
an agricultural producer under this section may
not exceed the difference between—
(A) the payment that the agricultural pro-
ducer would have received without the alternate
calculation method described in subsection (b);
and
(B) the payment that the agricultural pro-
ducer would receive using the alternate calcula-

that new position has higher-level duties and a
pre-established level or range of pay higher

mediately before the movement. Any such in-
crease must be based on the rates of pay and ap-
plicable pay limitations in effect on December
31, 2013, after those rates and pay limitations
are increased by 1.9 percent (after applicable
rounding).
(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of

State or the USAID Administrator, as appro-

tinue to be available for an additional fiscal

tual abatement remedies to assist relocation of
tenants for imminent major threats to health
and safety after written notice to and informed
consent of the affected tenants and use of other
available remedies, such as partial abatements

family property described under this section, the
contract and allowable rent levels on such prop-
erties shall be subject to the requirements under
section 524 of MAHRAA.

ble State or local laws, rules, ordinances, or reg-
ulations relating to the physical condition of
any property covered under a housing assist-
ance payment contract.

Standards (UPCS) score of 60 or less; or
(2) fails to certify in writing to the Secretary
within 3 days that all Exigent Health and Safe-
ty deficiencies identified by the inspector at the
project have been corrected.
Such requirements shall apply to insured and
noninsured projects with assistance attached to
the units under section 8 of the United States
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but do not
apply to such units assisted under section

partial abatement, as determined by the Sec-

make all required repairs and to accept renewal
of the assistance contract as long as such re-
newal is offered;
(E) transfer the existing section 8 contract to
another project or projects and owner or own-
ers;
(F) pursue exclusionary sanctions, including
suspensions or debarments from Federal pro-
grams;
(G) seek judicial appointment of a receiver to
manage the property and cure all project defi-

formance requiring the owner to cure all project
deficiencies;
(H) work with the owner, lender, or other re-
lated party to stabilize the property in an at-
tempt to preserve the property through compli-

steps to ensure that project-based contracts re-
main in effect, subject to the exercise of contrac-
tual abatement remedies to assist relocation of
tenants for major threats to health and safety
after written notice to the affected tenants. To
the extent the Secretary determines, in consulta-
tion with the tenants and the local government,

(1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating
the property and all available Federal, State,
and local resources, including rent adjustments
under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted
Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997
(‘‘MAHRAA’’); and
(2) environmental conditions that cannot be
remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Sec-
retary may contract for project-based rental as-
sistance payments with an owner or owners of
other existing housing properties, or provide
other rental assistance.
(e) The Secretary shall report quarterly on all
properties covered by this section that are as-

management and occupancy review within the

dress such conditions, including imposition of
civil money penalties and termination of sub-
sidies, and identify properties that have such
conditions multiple times;

and Urban Development is taking to protect ten-
ants of such identified properties; and
(3) any administrative or legislative rec-
ommendations to further improve the living con-
ditions at properties covered under a housing
assistance payment contract.

sistent with the requirements in the Budget

ments to compensation.

rection to amend the heading and short title

state, and local levels, to prevent and re-
spond to terrorist attacks, and to hire, train,
and equip DHS frontline forces protecting
the homeland.
The language set forth in Senate Report

cally addressed to the contrary in the con-
ference agreement or in this joint explana-
tory statement. While the statement repeats
some language for emphasis, it does not ne-
gate any language in the Senate report un-
less expressly stated. Direction contained in

component of ‘‘Operations and Support’’ ap-
propriations may be used by DHS as guid-
ance. When this explanatory statement re-
fers to the Committees or the Committees on
Appropriations, these references are to the
House Appropriations Subcommittee on
Homeland Security and the Senate Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Homeland Secu-
rity.

tain laws, organizations, persons, funds, and

Act of 2011, Public Law 112–25, is referenced
as the BCA; the Implementing Recommenda-
tions of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, Pub-
lic Law 110–53, is referenced as the 9/11 Act;
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and
Emergency Assistance Act, Public Law 93–

cution for three of the four major appropria-
tion account types: Operations and Support
(O&S); Procurement, Construction, and Im-
provements (PC&I); and Research and Devel-
opment (R&D). With limited exception, the
O&S accounts shall have one year of avail-
ability; the PC&I accounts shall have five
years of availability for construction and
three years for all other activities; and the
R&D accounts shall have two years of avail-

the results of the inspections and other re-
ports related to custody operations activities
on its public website. As the OIG continues
to conduct unannounced inspections of de-
tention facilities, it is directed to pay par-
ticular attention to the health needs of de-
tainees.

standard operating procedures to improve
the agency’s awareness of migrant welfare
and response to emergency situations. CBP
is directed to brief the Committees, within 60
days of the date of enactment of this Act, on
its progress in establishing more permanent
plans, standards, and protocols, to include
the following: health assessment standards
and response protocols for medical emer-
gencies, including transportation between
CBP locations and to hospitals or other med-
ical response sites; requirements for ensur-
ing that CBP provides water, nutrition, hy-
giene, and sanitation needs of migrants in
temporary CBP custody; standards for tem-
porary holding facilities that ensure such fa-
cilities are humane and used appropriately
for single adults, families, and unaccom-
panied children; protocols for responding to
surges in migrants crossing the border; and a
plan for providing training to federal and
contract personnel who interact with mi-
grants in CBP custody. As part of the brief-
ing, CBP shall also present a schedule for fi-
nalizing and implementing these plans, pro-
tocols, and standards; estimates of the asso-
ciated short-term and longer-term funding
requirements; and any changes to legal au-
thorities that might be necessary. To facili-
tate these additional requirements, the con-
ferees provide $192,700,000 above the request
to include $128,000,000 for contract medical
professionals, $40,200,000 for increased

When CBP is responsible for the custody of
siblings who are unaccompanied alien chil-

est of the children, place such siblings in the
same facility and keep such siblings together
before the Department of Health and Human
Services assumes custody pursuant to 8
U.S.C. 1232(b). When considering whether a
family should remain together while in cus-
tody, the Commissioner should consider the
criminal history of the parent, safety and
comfort of the child, immigration history,
and physical and mental health of all mem-
bers of the family. DHS is directed to ensure,
when appropriate and feasible, that sepa-
rated family units are reunited and trans-
ferred together prior to removal, release
from CBP custody, or transfer to Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement custody.
As directed in the explanatory statement
accompanying Public Law 115–141, CBP shall
continue to brief the Committees quarterly
on its progress toward the development of a
comprehensive assessment of CBP-wide capa-
bility gaps, to include personnel, and directs
CBP to brief monthly on efforts to develop
and utilize a Border Patrol workforce staff-
ing model and to continue these briefings
until the model is mature and used to allo-
cate personnel.
Also as directed in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying Public Law 115–141, CBP
shall continue to post to its website a com-
bined table of CBP interdictions of currency

As directed in House Report 115–948, CBP
shall provide a briefing to the Committees
on the results of the Incident-Driven Video
Recording Systems pilot upon its completion
and assessment, including details on lessons
learned for policy, privacy, and resource re-
quirements.
The conferees direct CBP to provide the
Committees with data pertaining to the
number and efficacy of roving patrol stops
and to release this data publicly on a semi-
annual basis, including a description of CBP
policies governing enforcement actions of
this nature; the total number of roving pa-
trol stops made by CBP personnel, including
the number resulting in arrest; and the date,
location, duration, type of, and reason for
each roving patrol stop and each resulting
arrest. All personally identifiable informa-
tion about specific individuals shall be re-
dacted from these reports.
The conferees direct the Department to
submit a report that details its
prioritization of POE infrastructure capital
investment projects, the methods and models
used to determine prioritization, and an
overview of Public-Private Partnership
agreements. The conferees encourage CBP to
work with the General Services Administra-
tion and the Office of Management and Budg-
et on the annual 5-year Land POEs mod-
ernization plan, which is based on CBP’s
operational priorities and should include
plans to complete the modernization of pre-
9/11 POEs along the northern border. Specific
attention should be paid to the health, safe-
ty, and welfare needs of CBPOs.

parison to those of a prospective duty sys-
tem, with the goal of minimizing uncollected
duties.
CBP and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services are directed to jointly brief the
Committees on current challenges related to
the implementation of section 289 of the Im-
migration and Nationality Act, related to
the right of entry of American Indians into
the United States from Canada. The briefing
shall include legislative options for how to
more equitably implement the intent of sec-
tion 289 while also addressing appropriate se-
curity concerns. The Department shall also
make this briefing available to the House Ju-
diciary Committee and the Senate Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, upon request.
PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND

taling over $200,000,000 provided in fiscal year
2018 that has not been placed on contract
which include significant balances for cross
border tunnel threat; integrated fixed tow-
ers, linear ground detection including fiber
optics, mobile video surveillance systems;
remote video surveillance systems, and
small unmanned aerial systems.
Not later than 30 days prior to any con-
struction contract award for physical bar-
riers funded in this Act, CBP shall submit a
report to the Committees on the estimated
amount of private property necessary to be
obtained, the estimated associated cost, ef-
forts to consult with stakeholders, and
timeline for acquisition.
The agreement includes $564,000,000 for
non-intrusive inspection equipment at land
ports of entry. Additionally, $6,000,000 has

ment at international mail and express con-
signment facilities; and $10,000,000 for auto-
mated commercial environment enhance-

requested, and $14,775,000 for Office of Field
Operations facilities as requested. The con-
ferees expect the new El Paso facility and
renovations to the existing processing center
in McAllen, Texas, will make them more ap-
propriate for use as temporary holding sites
for individuals in CBP custody, particularly
families and unaccompanied children. At a
minimum, these facilities should be equipped
with appropriate temperature controls and
avoid chain-link fence-type enclosures. CBP
is also encouraged to use a more appropriate
blanket type than currently utilized.
The conferees provide $18,544,000 for rev-
enue modernization, as requested.
U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS
ENFORCEMENT
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
The conference agreement provides
$7,542,153,000 for Operations and Support. Of
the total amount provided, $75,448,000 is
made available until September 30, 2020, of
which $13,700,000 is for the Visa Security Pro-
gram; $26,498,000 is for wiretaps that are nec-
essary to support dismantling transnational
criminal organizations that threaten the na-
tional security and public safety of the
United States; $15,250,000 is for half of the in-
crease described below for family case man-
agement; and $20,000,000 is for half of the in-
crease described below for ICE management
of immigration cases of enrollees in the al-
ternatives to detention program.
The conference agreement includes
$47,250,000 for the 2019 pay raise and does not
assume the use of $207,600,000 in Immigration
Examination User Fee revenue to partially
offset costs for eligible activities in this ac-
count due to concerns with the impact to
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
(USCIS) operations and the growing backlog
in applications for immigration benefits. The
conference agreement assumes a net reduc-
tion below the request of $80,578,000 for sala-
ries and benefits based on updated payroll
analyses provided by U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE) in January of
2019 indicating that payroll costs to sustain
staffing levels achieved by the end of fiscal
year 2018 would fall short of the amounts
proposed in the budget request.
The conferees direct the Department and
ICE that while Section 503 of this Act pro-
vides limited authority to address unantici-
pated, unavoidable detention needs within
the Operations and Support appropriation,
the budgetary impacts of any detention and
enforcement policy must be carefully consid-
ered prior to implementation. Accordingly,
within 60 days of the date of enactment of
this Act, and monthly thereafter, ICE shall
provide a briefing to the Committees on a
detailed operational and spending plan to
show how ICE will execute its budget within
the funding levels appropriated. Such plan
shall not assume the use of transfer or re-
programming authorities, shall show antici-
pated budget allocations at the field office
level, and shall track actual monthly obliga-
tions and updated projected obligations
against the original projections for each of
the remaining months of the fiscal year. In
the event that ICE transfers or reprograms

Within 90 days of the date of enactment of
this Act, ICE is directed to brief the Com-
mittees on its plan and schedule for com-

∑ Requirements related to detention facil-
ity inspections reports;
∑ Death in custody reporting, with subse-
quent reporting to be released within 90 days
of the initial report unless additional time is
required for redacting personally identifiable
information;
∑ Access to facilities;
∑ Detainee locator information;
∑ Changes to the current detention facility
category and inspection framework;
∑ Compliance with the 2011 Performance
Based National Detention Standards
(PBNDS 2011) and PREA requirements; and
∑ Weekly rate of operations for Custody
Operations.
The Department shall continue to submit
data on the deportation of parents of U.S.-
born children semiannually, as in prior
years, and shall also report semiannually on
removals of honorably discharged members
of the armed services.
The conferees direct ICE, in conjunction
with CBP, USCIS, and the Office of the Chief
Financial Officer, to provide the Committee
with regular updates on apprehensions, the
average daily population (ADP) in ICE de-
tention, asylum claims, the number of pros-
ecution referrals to the Department of Jus-
tice (DOJ), and the number of referrals ac-
cepted by DOJ. These updates should also in-
clude information on how the Department is
executing its current year and fiscal year
2019 funding compared to the enacted appro-
priations levels.
Within 60 days of enactment of this Act,
the Director shall provide one or more na-
tional, nonprofit organizations that have ex-
perience advising on legal resources avail-
able to immigrants, asylum-seekers, and ref-
ugees with the location of all over-72 hour
detention facilities, including those owned
by ICE, by contractors, or by units of state
or local government in the event such orga-
nizations are willing to identify pro bono im-
migration legal services providers in the
area of each facility. ICE shall also display
this information on an easily accessible area
of its website, or provide a link to the orga-
nizations’ websites if such information is
provided there. To ensure the information is
up-to-date, the Director shall notify the or-
ganizations prior to any change to the inven-
tory or location of the above mentioned de-
tention facilities.
The conferees are concerned about the re-
sults of a recent Office of Inspector General
audit finding that ‘‘[i]nstead of holding fa-
cilities accountable through financial pen-
alties, ICE issued waivers to facilities with
deficient conditions, seeking to exempt them
from complying with certain standards.’’
Further, the audit revealed that ‘‘ICE has no
formal policies and procedures to govern the
waiver process, has allowed officials without
clear authority to grant waivers, and does
not ensure key stakeholders have access to
approved waivers.’’ To ensure appropriate
oversight of waiver authority, the ICE Direc-
tor shall have sole authority to approve
waivers, and shall notify the Committees of
such waivers within 3 business days of such
approval.
Homeland Security Investigations
Domestic Investigations.—The conferees in-
clude the following increases above the re-
quest: $7,200,000 for additional Computer
Forensics Analysts, including for the Child
Victim Identification Program; $1,500,000 for
paid internships for the Human Exploitation
Rescue Operative Child-Rescue Corps pro-
gram; $1,300,000 for an interoperable, nation-
wide information sharing platform related to
the relationships of gang members, the iden-
tification of trafficking routes, and federal
coordination between ICE, CBP, and DOJ;
and $2,000,000 for upgrades to the Sexual Of-
fender Registration and Notification Act ex-
change portal. The conference agreement
also provides the requested $6,498,000 for ad-
ditional wiretaps to support dismantling
Transnational Criminal Organizations that
threaten the national security and public
safety of the United States.
The conferees understand the importance
of enhancing the capacity of Homeland Secu-
rity Investigations (HSI) and its partners to
investigate criminal activity on the Internet
to combat opioids/fentanyl. Accordingly, the
conferees include an increase of $31,605,000
above the request for up to 155 additional
criminal investigators and 72 support per-
sonnel dedicated to enhancing opioid/
fentanyl-related investigations. HSI shall
brief the Committees not later than 30 days
after the date of enactment of this Act on its
plan for executing these funds.
ICE plays a critical role in investigating
criminal organizations that traffic individ-
uals into and within the United States. The
conferees encourage ICE to work with appro-
priate nonprofit organizations and victim
service providers to improve the training of
ICE officers in the field to assist in the iden-
tification of human trafficking victims and
provide appropriate referrals to victim serv-
ice organizations.
The conferees include an increase of
$7,500,000 above the request for the HSI Vic-
tim Assistance Program for additional Vic-
tim Assistance Specialists (VASs), Forensic
Interview Specialists, and related personnel.
These additional resources are intended to
ensure that HSI’s victim assistance capa-
bility is commensurate with that of other
federal law enforcement agencies, with the
goal of placing of a VAS with every human
trafficking task force in which HSI partici-
pates.
The total includes not less than $305,000 for
promoting public awareness of the child por-
nography tip line and not less than
$15,770,000 for investigations of forced labor
law violations, to include forced child labor.
ICE is directed to continue to submit an an-
nual report on expenditures and performance
metrics associated with forced labor law en-
forcement activities.
The conference agreement provides not
less than $15,000,000 for intellectual property
law enforcement through the work of HSI
and the National Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR) Coordination Center. ICE is di-
rected to ensure that the National IPR Cen-
ter is properly staffed to facilitate continued
enforcement actions against the theft of U.S.
intellectual property, particularly online, as
required in Public Law 114–125. Based on a
new wave of digital copyright piracy involv-
ing devices and software that connect con-
sumers’ televisions directly to copyright-
theft sites, the conferees direct ICE to in-
crease investigations and enforcement to
thwart illicit streaming involving media
boxes and televisions.
International Investigations.—The con-
ference agreement provides an additional
$4,780,000 over fiscal year 2018 levels for 12 ad-
ditional special agents for international in-
vestigations and 2 support staff, whose focus
will be to enhance opioid/fentanyl-related in-
vestigations. The conference agreement
annualizes growth to overseas operations
funded in fiscal year 2018, for continued ef-
forts to interrupt the illicit movement of
people and goods prior to their arrival in the
United States.
Not later than 60 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act, ICE shall brief the Com-
mittees on expansion plans and on efforts to
implement the recommendations in GAO–18–
314, Actions Needed to Strengthen Performance
Management and Planning for Expansion of
DHS’s Visa Security Program.
Intelligence.—The conferees provide an ad-
ditional $7,615,000 over fiscal year 2018 levels
for 100 additional intelligence analysts,
whose focus will be to enhance opioid/
fentanyl-related investigations.
Enforcement and Removal Operations
Custody Operations.—The conference agree-
ment includes increases above the request of
$12,450,000 for 112 additional Health Service
Corps staff assigned to detention facilities
and $4,000,000 to bring detention facility
compliance with Prison Rape Elimination
Act (PREA) requirements up to 97 percent,
from the current 86 percent.
In the execution of these activities, ICE is
directed to ensure that field personnel, in-
cluding ERO officers, are appropriately
trained on all agency policies and procedures
involving detained parents and legal guard-
ians, including ICE’s directive on the Deten-
tion and Removal of Alien Parents or Legal
Guardians and time of arrest protocols to
minimize harm to children.
ICE is directed to prioritize the use of ATD
programs for families, including family case
management, for which the bill provides sig-
nificant additional resources. ICE should
continue working with the Executive Office
for Immigration Review at the Department
of Justice to prioritize the adjudication
timeline for the cases of individuals enrolled
in ATD, particularly those of families and
asylum seekers.
An administrative provision in the bill re-
quires ICE to provide weekly reports to the
Committees and to the public on the average
daily population, average length of stay, and
total year-to-date book-ins of single adults
and of members of family units detained in
ICE custody, delineated by arresting agency;
the daily counts of single adults and family
units in detention custody; the number of in-
dividuals in detention custody with positive
fear determinations and the average and me-
dian post-determination length of stay for
such individuals; and the total number of en-
rollees in Alternatives to Detention, includ-
ing the Family Case Management Program,
along with the average length of participa-
tion.
ICE is also directed to make public the fol-
lowing statistics, to be updated monthly: the
average bond amount for detainees; the per-
centage of detainees released after paying a
bond; the average length of detention for in-
dividuals who are released on bond; and the
average length of detention for individuals
offered release on bond who remain in deten-
tion because they do not pay the bond.
All forms required to be signed by a de-
tained person must be available in both
English and Spanish. ICE is directed to re-
port to the Committees within 90 days of the
date of enactment of this Act on a plan and
timeline for achieving this goal.
Additionally, ICE is directed to provide a
semi-annual report to the Committees de-
tailing the number of individuals, by field of-
fice, who are detained by ICE for removal
from the United States but are subsequently
determined to be U.S. Citizens, along with
the average and median lengths of stay in
detention for such individuals. The report
should also describe ICE’s process for adjudi-
cating claims of U.S. citizenship by individ-
uals it arrests for removal from the United
States; major impediments to more quickly
resolving such claims; and ICE’s efforts to
mitigate those impediments. The first report
is due within 90 days of the date of enact-
ment of this Act.
ICE shall provide a report to the Commit-
tees, not later than 90 days after the date of
enactment of this Act, identifying for each
detention contract, Inter-governmental
Service Agreement (IGSA), or Inter-govern-
mental Agreement (IGA), the detention
standards under which it is inspected and the
status of its compliance with PREA stand-
ards; all fiscal year 2018 costs by category, as

appropriate; and the number of authorized
and average number of on-board medical and
mental health personnel, if any, during the
fiscal year. In addition, the ICE Director
shall continue to report to the Committees
at least 30 days in advance of entering into
any new or significantly modified detention
contract or other detention agreement that
does not meet or exceed the Performance-
Based National Detention Standards 2011, as
revised in 2016. Each report shall include a
justification for why such contract or agree-
ment requires different standards.
Within 30 days of the date of enactment of
this Act, ICE is directed to brief the Com-
mittees on its progress in implementing the
five recommendations made by OIG in its re-
cent report on detention standards (OIG–18–
67). In addition, GAO is directed to follow-up
on the OIG report by examining ICE’s man-
agement and oversight of detention facili-
ties, including the extent to which DHS has:
(1) effective mechanisms in place to mon-
itor compliance with applicable detention fa-
cility standards, including implementation
of corrective actions; and
(2) effective processes in place for obtain-
ing and addressing complaints from aliens in
detention facilities.
GAO shall provide a preliminary briefing
to the Committees on its findings within 180
days of the date of enactment of this Act.
Individuals detained in ICE detention fa-
cilities can voluntarily participate in work
programs at those facilities, doing jobs such
as cooking, laundry, and providing janitorial
services. OIG is directed to review ICE poli-
cies and oversight of contract detention fa-
cilities related to detainee work programs,
with a particular focus on how ICE can en-
sure that such work is strictly voluntary.
ICE should ensure that operators of family
detention facilities do not prevent co-sleep-
ing by parents and their young children,
which can be a source of comfort to children
in unfamiliar circumstances.
Within 30 days of the date of enactment of
this Act and monthly thereafter, ICE shall
report to the Committees on the fiscal year-
to-date criminality breakdown of the indi-
viduals in its custody, as well as the esti-
mated criminality breakdown associated
with its fiscal year-to-date average daily
population, and the criminality breakdown
of its daily population as of the date of the
report.
Criminal Alien Program.—ICE is directed to
ensure that every 287(g) jurisdiction has es-
tablished, and routinely and formally meets
with, steering committees of external stake-
holders to discuss the performance and over-
sight of 287(g)-designated officers. ICE shall
continue to provide an annual 287(g) report,
as detailed in House Report 115–239, which
should also describe any plans for future ex-
pansion of or changes to the use of its 287(g)
authority.
The conferees also expect ICE, the Office of
Inspector General (OIG), and the Office for
Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to continue
providing rigorous oversight of the 287(g)
program, and directs ICE to notify the Com-
mittees prior to implementing any signifi-
cant changes to the program, including any
changes to training requirements, data col-
lection, or selection criteria.
Alternatives to Detention.—The conferees in-
clude increases above the request of
$28,000,000 to increase the number of partici-
pants in Alternatives to Detention (ATD)
programs to 100,000, up from 82,000 assumed
in the request; $40,000,000 for additional ICE
staffing dedicated to the management of
ATD immigration cases, particularly those
of asylum applicants; and $30,500,000 for the
Family Case Management Program (FCMP),
which can help improve compliance with im-
migration court obligations by helping fami-
lies’ access community-based support for
basic housing, healthcare, legal, and edu-
cational needs. Within 90 days of the date of
enactment of this Act, ICE shall brief the
Committees on a plan for a program within
the FCMP managed by non-profit organiza-
tions that have experience in connecting
families with community-based services.
ICE is directed to continue to provide per-
formance reports to the Committees on the
ATD program, as described in House Report
114–668. The analysis should also include
ATD enrollment by field office, type of su-
pervision, and arresting agency, as well as
the average length of enrollment by type of
supervision. In addition, the report shall in-
clude ICE guidance for referral, placement,
escalation, and de-escalation decisions in
ATD programs.
ICE is directed to ensure that access to
‘‘know your rights’’ presentations is avail-
able at the point of enrollment for all ATD
programming, and to explore opportunities
to work with community based organiza-
tions that directly provide case management
services, including referrals to services al-
ready available in the community that are
associated with higher ATD compliance
rates. ICE shall brief the Committees not
later than 60 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act on any challenges it en-
counters to achieving this requirement.
Further, ICE is directed to continue ex-
ploring the use of available ATD models on
an ongoing basis, prioritize the use of such
detention alternatives for immigrant chil-
dren and their families, where appropriate,
and release individuals and their family
members who pass credible fear screening
and do not present a public safety or flight
risk.
Within 60 days of the date of enactment of
this Act, ICE is directed to brief the Com-
mittees on an analysis of each active Alter-
natives to Detention program within the last
5 years. This report shall include compliance
with court appearances, immigration ap-
pointments, and removal orders, cost per in-
dividual served, response times to requests
for legal counsel, family contact, and med-
ical treatment (including mental health
services). This report shall also provide data
on whether noncompliant ATD participants
were actively in the ATD program, such as
whether participants were expected to be
wearing monitors at the time of noncompli-
ance.
Within the total, not less than $3,000,000 is
included to continue to enable certain aliens
on the non-detained docket to check-in with
ICE via self-service kiosks at ERO field of-
fices. The goal of the program is to reduce
the time and resources that deportation offi-
cers devote to managing encounters and
check-ins with applicable aliens, and allow-
ing those officer resources to devote more
time and effort to improving attendance at
immigration hearings and compliance with
removal orders.
Transportation and Removal Program.—In re-
cent months, ICE has collaborated with or-
ganizations that provide temporary shelter
to migrants released from ICE custody.
Within the $114,147,000 increase above the fis-
cal year 2018 funding level for the Transpor-
tation and Removal Program, ICE is directed
to provide for the transportation of migrants
to such shelters based on where collabo-
rating organizations have open sheltering ca-
pacity, including during surge periods. ICE
shall immediately notify the Committees in
advance of any decision to deny such trans-
portation.
Mission Support
The conferees provide an increase above
the request of $6,975,000 for staffing at the Of-
fice of Detention Oversight within the Office
of Professional Responsibility. ICE is di-
rected to increase the number of inspections
of over–72 hour detention facilities from once
every three years to twice per year not later
than the end of fiscal year 2019.
Office of the Principal Legal Advisor

$7,397,000 for additional attorneys and for
courtroom expansion to assist in the backlog
of immigration cases currently in the sys-
tem.

curement, construction, and improvements,
consisting of $4,700,000 for the Consolidated
Financial Solution; $30,859,000 for tactical
communications; and $10,000,000 for critical
repairs to ICE facilities.

crease of $73,635,000 above the request for the
2019 pay raise.
The conferees provide an increase of
$222,210,000 above the request for Aviation
Screening Operations, including: $77,000,000
to maintain existing Transportation Secu-
rity Administration (TSA) staffing at airport
exit lanes in accordance with section 603 of
Public Law 113–67; $44,596,000 for additional
transportation security officers and associ-
ated training and support costs to address

creases of $15,660,000 to fully fund fiscal year
2019 Screening Partnership Program require-
ments; $2,410,000 for increased field rent;
$12,885,000 to hire, train, certify, and deploy
50 new canine teams to support increased
passenger screening requirements; $10,440,000
for additional program management staffing
to support new technology acquisitions; and
$4,280,000 for the procurement of additional
Credential Authentication Technology units.
The conferees also provide $94,220,000 above
the request for Other Operations and En-
forcement, including: $3,000,000 to establish
additional training capacity for the Federal
Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) and Flight Crew
Training Program at a location that is more
conducive to pilot participation; $46,280,000
to sustain the Law Enforcement Officer Re-
imbursement Program; and $55,637,000 to
maintain 31 Visible Intermodal Prevention
and Response (VIPR) teams.
The conference agreement directs TSA to
brief the Committees on a plan for a new
FFDO training center not later than 60 days
after the date of enactment of this Act.
The conferees provide an additional
$17,699,000 above the request for mission sup-
port for costs associated with added trans-
portation security officers and canines.
Within 90 days of the date of enactment of
this Act, TSA shall provide a classified brief-
ing to the Committees on the agency’s plans
for identifying 3D-printed guns at passenger
screening checkpoints.
The conferees direct TSA to brief the Com-
mittees on the status of the third party ca-
nine program not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
The funding level for the Federal Air Mar-
shals Service (FAMS) reflects the fiscal year
2019 requirement, given the restoration of
funds for VIPR teams. In lieu of the direc-
tion in the Senate Report 115–283, TSA shall
submit semiannual reports on FAMS mission
coverage, staffing levels, and hiring rates.
As directed in House Report 115–948, TSA
shall make available a framework for estab-
lishing operations centers to promote inter-
agency response and coordination at federal-
ized airports.
As directed in House Report 115–948, TSA

cluding increases of: up to $9,500,000 for over-
time pay for agents and officers in calendar
year 2018; $20,171,000 for the 2019 pay raise;
$14,400,000 to annualize funding for additional
personnel hired in fiscal year 2018; $3,729,000
for increased hiring in fiscal year 2019;
$11,900,000 for additional retention initia-
tives; $594,000 for audio countermeasures;
$784,000 to sustain fiscal year 2018 funding
levels for forensic and investigative support

of missing and exploited children; $21,022,000
for basic and advanced computer forensics
training for state and local law enforcement
officers, judges, and prosecutors in support
of the Secret Service mission. The increases
above the request accelerate the Secret
Service’s long-term hiring plan to rebuild
law enforcement and mission critical sup-
port staffing and will enable the Secret Serv-
ice to reach 7,650 personnel in fiscal year
2019.
Within the total amount provided,
$40,036,000 is made available until September

ational Mission Support; $18,000,000 for pro-
tective travel; and $4,500,000 for National
Special Security Events (NSSE).
In addition, the conference agreement pro-
vides $19,000,000 to defray costs specific to
the Secret Service execution of its statutory
responsibilities to direct the planning and
coordination of NSSEs. This amount in-
cludes a realignment of $14,500,000 from the
Protection of Persons and Facilities PPA to
the Presidential Campaigns and NSSE PPA,
in light of Secretary’s designation of recur-
ring significant events as NSSEs on an ongo-
ing basis.

TITLE III—PROTECTION, PREPARED-
NESS, RESPONSE, AND RECOVERY
CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE
SECURITY AGENCY
Public Law 115–278 authorized the reorga-
nization of the National Protection and Pro-
grams Directorate into a new Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
In concert with that authorization, appro-
priations for the Office of Biometric Identity
Management (OBIM) have been realigned to
the Management Directorate. While the Sec-
retary determines an organizational place-
ment for the Federal Protective Service
(FPS), as directed by Public Law 115–278,
funding for FPS is provided within CISA.
CISA is directed to provide a briefing, not
later than 90 days of the date of enactment
of this Act and semiannually thereafter, on
the updated timelines and acquisition strate-
gies for the National Cybersecurity Protec-
tion System (NCPS) program and the Con-
tinuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM)
program, including the accelerated deploy-
ment of CDM Phase 4 data protection man-
agement (Digital Rights Management, Data
Masking, Micro-Segmentation, Enhanced
Encryption, Mobile Device Management,
etc.) across all ‘‘.gov’’ civilian agencies.
Advanced persistent threats targeting crit-
ical infrastructure sectors in the United
States is cause for concern. Not later than 60
days of the date of enactment of this Act,
the Department is directed to brief the Com-
mittees on the status of implementing the
recommendations of the 2017 report of the
National Infrastructure Advisory Council,
Securing Cyber Assets: Addressing Urgent
Cyber Threats to Critical Infrastructure.
To provide greater flexibility, CISA PPAs
are included in the control table for purposes
of reprograming and transfer thresholds at
the second level PPA. It is expected that
CISA will include in its budget request
greater detail, to at least the third level
PPA, so Congress can continue fiscal over-
sight and not have to return to a greater
level of specificity in the control table.
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
A total of $1,345,802,000 is provided for Op-
erations and Support, of which $18,650,000 is
made available until September 30, 2020, for
the National Infrastructure Simulation
Analysis Center (NISAC). The conferees in-
clude a total of $33,000,000 for the Election
Infrastructure Security Initiative (EISI) and
$7,397,000 for the 2019 pay raise as described
through CISA PPAs.
CYBERSECURITY
The Department has a significant role in
assisting state and local election officials as
they prepare for federal elections. While an
OIG investigation on the status of the De-
partment’s assistance to States continues, to
further aid the Committees’ oversight, the
GAO shall examine how the Department is
implementing its key responsibilities in
overseeing protection of the elections crit-
ical infrastructure subsector and the re-
ported benefits and challenges of such ef-
forts. GAO shall provide a report not later
than 180 days after the date of the enactment
of this Act.
CISA is directed to explore opportunities
for facilitating partnerships, such as those
described in House report 115–948, between
and among federal, state, local, and private
entities on the use of testing and modeling
to evaluate cyber vulnerabilities in critical
infrastructure and work with the Chief of
the National Guard Bureau and other stake-
holders to identify best practices for such
testing and modeling. CISA shall brief the
Committee not later than 180 days after the
date of enactment of this Act on how CISA,
the National Guard, and other stakeholders
could play a larger role in facilitating such
partnerships.
CISA is directed to brief the Committees,
not later than 90 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act, on the feasibility of es-
tablishing a pilot for a hacking competition
that would allow independent cyber experts
to identify cybersecurity vulnerabilities in
election systems across the country, with
participants potentially eligible to receive
rewards, as determined by the Secretary,
based upon their findings. The participation
of state and local election officials, including
any access to their networks, should be com-
pletely voluntary. State and local election
officials, as well as election service pro-
viders, should be appropriately notified
about relevant cybersecurity vulnerabilities
discovered through the competition.
Cyber Readiness and Response.—The con-
ferees include an increase above the request
of $29,379,000 for EISI; $3,000,000 to increase
cybersecurity services for the non-election
critical infrastructure sectors; and $11,400,000
to continue enhanced training, malware
analysis, safety systems vulnerability anal-
ysis, incident response, and assessments of
Industrial Control Systems in emerging sec-
tors and subsectors.
The conferees also include $3,000,000 for the
establishment of pilot programs to explore
and evaluate the most effective methods for
cybersecurity information sharing, focusing
on regional information sharing; commu-
nications and outreach; training and edu-
cation; and research and development for the
improvement of State, local, tribal, and ter-
ritorial (SLTT) government capabilities and
capacity.
Cyber Infrastructure Resilience.—The con-
ferees include an increase above the request
of $7,971,000 to fully fund cybersecurity advi-
sors; $4,300,000 to sustain fiscal year 2018
funding levels for the Cybersecurity Edu-
cation and Training Assistance Program
(CETAP); and $4,100,000 to hire subject mat-
ter experts for training systems and for in-
structional system design, develop consoli-
dated cybersecurity training curricula and a
course catalog, and create marketing mate-
rials to engage customers.

ferees include an increase of $1,121,000 above
the request for EISI and includes an increase
of $4,650,000 above the request, as well as a
realignment of $2,750,000, to support region-
alization efforts to improve service delivery
to the field. The conferees also include a
total of $17,277,000 for the Office of Bombing
Prevention (OBP), of which $2,090,000, above
the request is to provide needed training, in-
formation sharing, and awareness programs
for SLTT and private sector entities related
to trends in terrorist utilization of explo-
sives. The funding will also provide for anal-
ysis of current counter-explosives capabili-
ties and identification of capability gaps.

In July 2018, the Secretary announced the
redesignation of the Office of Cyber and In-
frastructure Analysis (OCIA) as the National
Risk Management Center (NRMC) in an ef-
fort to refocus risk management efforts
across the various critical infrastructure
sectors. As part of the effort, CISA aims to
improve security and resiliency outcomes by
focusing more on sector-wide and cross-sec-
tor risks and dependencies. The conferees in-
clude a realignment of $17,216,000 into this
PPA for such activities. Not later than 90
days after the date of the enactment of this
Act, the NRMC is directed to provide a de-
tailed spend plan for its fiscal year 2019 ac-
tivities. This spend plan should highlight the
operational change in strategy from prior
years, to include the anticipated outcome re-
sulting from these efforts.
The conferees include an increase of
$4,962,000 above the request for risk analyses
of industrial control systems. The conferees
also encourage CISA to use commercial,
human-led threat behavioral analysis and
technology. NRMC is also encouraged to em-
ploy private sector, industry-specific threat
intelligence and best practices to better
characterize potential consequences to other
critical infrastructure sectors during a sys-
temic cyber event.
Critical Infrastructure Situational Aware-
ness.—The conferees include an increase of
$3,000,000 above the request to improve and
enhance capabilities for near-real-time mon-
itoring of the inter-connected dependencies

chains.
FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE
A total of $1,527,110,000 is made available
for the FPS. This funding is generated by
collections of security fees from federal
agencies based on security services provided
by FPS.
Not later than 90 days of the date of enact-
ment of this Act, FPS shall provide a brief-
ing to the Committees as described in Senate
Report 115–283. In addition, FPS is directed
to provide an expenditure plan to the Com-
mittees, not later than 90 days after the date
of enactment of this Act, detailing planned
obligations for operating expenses and coun-
termeasures by region and facility.
A new revenue model study completed by
the Administration and FPS, which proposed
a method to more accurately assign security
costs to users, is currently scheduled for im-
plementation in fiscal year 2020. A provision
is included requiring FPS to evaluate alter-
native approaches and methods to fund
‘‘Countermeasures’’ security costs and pro-
vide a report to the Committees on its con-
clusions not later than 180 days after the
date of enactment of this Act. These ap-
proaches and methods should demonstrate
efficiency, focusing on innovative counter-
measures which are planned for in advance,
and solutions that take into consideration a
federal agency’s own investments in secu-
rity.

1 The conference agreement provides $250,000,000, from the Disaster Relief Fund, for the National Predisaster Mitigation Fund which can be combined with the recently authorized National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation
Assistance, consistent with the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, Public Law 115–254.
The conference agreement includes $472,000
for the 2019 pay raise. The conference agree-
ment does not provide funding for the pro-
posed Competitive Preparedness Grants Pro-
gram.
The conference agreement includes a gen-
eral provision in Title V of this division pro-
viding an increase above the budget request
of $41,000,000 to reimburse state and local law
enforcement agencies for extraordinary costs
associated with the protection of the Presi-
dent in jurisdictions where the President
maintains a residence.
The total under this heading includes
$8,000,000 for Continuing Training Grants to
support competitively-awarded training pro-
grams to address specific national prepared-
ness gaps, such as cybersecurity, economic
recovery, housing, and rural and tribal pre-
paredness. Of this amount, not less than
$3,000,000 shall be prioritized to be competi-
tively awarded for FEMA-certified rural and
tribal training.
Consistent with the 9/11 Act, the con-
ference agreement requires FEMA to con-
duct risk assessments for the 100 most popu-
lous metropolitan statistical areas prior to
making UASI grant awards. The conferees
expect that UASI funding will be limited to
urban areas representing up to 85 percent of

The conferees direct the Department, in
consultation with the Department of Labor
to review options for addressing the problem
of unavailability of H–2B visas for employers
that need workers to start work late in a
semiannual period of availability and to re-
port to the Committees on these options not
later than 120 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act.
The conferees also direct U.S. Citizen and
Immigration Services (USCIS) to conduct a

USCIS is expected to continue the use of
fee waivers for applicants who can dem-
onstrate an inability to pay the naturaliza-
tion fee. USCIS is also encouraged to con-
sider whether the current naturalization fee
is a barrier to naturalization for those earn-
ing between 150 percent and 200 percent of
the federal poverty guidelines, who are not
currently eligible for a fee waiver.
The conferees encourage USCIS to main-
tain naturalization fees at an affordable
level while also focusing on reducing the
backlog of applicants. As USCIS undertakes
its next biennial fee study, the conferees
urge the agency to include in its final report
an estimate of the resources required to
clear the backlog of applications for tem-
porary status, adjustment of status, and nat-
uralization, as well as reduce future wait
times from the submission to initial adju-
dication to no more than one year for all pe-
titions processed by the agency. Addition-
ally, USCIS is directed to brief the Commit-
tees on specific actions, if any, that the
agency is taking to reduce the backlog of
asylum applications while ensuring that asy-
lum applicants are properly reviewed for eli-
gibility and for security purposes.
The conferees urge USCIS to dedicate more
resources to U visa adjudication, specifically
increasing trained U visa adjudicators by at
least 60 additional agents, and provide ade-
quate resources to hire staff and train adju-
dicators for the purpose of reviewing applica-
tions within six months of receipt.

biosurveillance program. However, it is un-
clear whether the requested funding will
fully support the capabilities currently de-
livered by the National Biosurveillance Inte-
gration Center (NBIC) and the Joint Anal-
ysis Center. Therefore, within the amount
provided, $5,000,000 above the request is to

vided by NBIC and the Joint Analysis Center
in order to provide situational awareness of
biological threats for the Department, as
well as federal, state, local, and private sec-
tors partners.

from state and local entities that can serve
as a bio-preparedness tool for emergency re-
sponse, emergency management, and law en-
forcement at all levels of government.
The $25,200,000 requested under this head-
ing for the acquisition of portable detection

Section 502. The conference agreement
continues a provision providing authority to
merge unexpended balances of prior appro-

to be used for the same purpose, subject to
reprogramming guidelines.
Section 503. The conference agreement
continues a provision limiting reprogram-
ming authority for funds within an appro-
priation and providing limited authority for
transfers between appropriations. All compo-
nents funded by the Department of Home-
land Security Appropriations Act, 2019, must
comply with these transfer and reprogram-
ming requirements.
The Department must notify the Commit-
tees on Appropriations prior to each re-
programming of funds that would reduce pro-
grams, projects, activities, or personnel by
ten percent or more. Notifications are also
required for each reprogramming of funds
that would increase a program, project, or
activity by more than $5,000,000 or ten per-
cent, whichever is less. The Department
must submit these notifications to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations at least 15 days in
advance of any such reprogramming.
For purposes of reprogramming notifica-
tions, ‘‘program, project, or activity’’ is de-
fined as an amount identified in the detailed
funding table located at the end of this
statement or an amount directed for a spe-
cific purpose in this statement. Also for pur-
poses of reprogramming notifications, the
creation of a new program, project, or activ-
ity is defined as any significant new activity
that has not been explicitly justified to the
Congress in budget justification material
and for which funds have not been appro-
priated by the Congress. For further guid-
ance when determining which movements of
funds are subject to section 503, the Depart-
ment is reminded to follow GAO’s definition
of ‘‘program, project, or activity’’ as detailed
in the GAO’s A Glossary of Terms Used in
the Federal Budget Process. Within 30 days
of the date of enactment of this Act, the De-
partment shall submit to the Committees a
table delineating PPAs subject to section 503
notification requirements, as defined in this
paragraph.

Limited transfer authority is provided to
give the Department flexibility in respond-
ing to emerging requirements and signifi-
cant changes in circumstances, but is not
primarily intended to facilitate the imple-
mentation of new programs, projects, or ac-
tivities that were not proposed in a formal
budget submission. Transfers may not reduce
accounts by more than five percent or in-
crease accounts by more than ten percent.
The Committees on Appropriations must be
notified 30 days in advance of any transfer.
To avoid violations of the Anti-Deficiency
Act, the Secretary shall ensure that any
transfer of funds is carried out in compliance
with the limitations and requirements of
section 503(b). In particular, the Secretary
should ensure that any such transfers adhere
to the opinion of the Comptroller General’s
decision in the Matter of: John D. Webster,
Director, Financial Services, Library of Con-
gress, dated November 7, 1997, with regard to
the definition of an appropriation subject to
transfer limitations.
The Department shall submit notifications
on a timely basis and provide complete ex-
planations of the proposed reallocations, in-
cluding detailed justifications for the in-
creases and offsets, and any specific impact
the proposed changes would have on the
budget request for the following fiscal year
and future-year appropriations require-
ments. Each notification submitted to the
Committees should include a detailed table
showing the proposed revisions to funding
and FTE—at the account, program, project,
and activity level—for the current fiscal
year, along with any funding and FTE im-
pacts on the budget year.
The Department shall manage its pro-
grams, projects, and activities within the
levels appropriated, and should only submit
reprogramming or transfer notifications in
cases of unforeseeable and compelling cir-
cumstances that could not have been pre-
dicted when formulating the budget request
for the current fiscal year. When the Depart-
ment submits a reprogramming or transfer
notification and does not receive identical
responses from the House and Senate Com-
mittees, it is expected to reconcile the dif-
ferences before proceeding.
The Department is not to submit a re-
programming or transfer notification after
June 30 except in extraordinary cir-
cumstances that imminently threaten the
safety of human life or the protection of
property. If an above-threshold reprogram-
ming or a transfer is needed after June 30,
the notification should contain sufficient
documentation as to why it meets this statu-
tory exception.
Deobligated funds are also subject to the
reprogramming and transfer limitations and
requirements set forth in section 503.
Section 503(f) authorizes the Secretary to
transfer up to $20,000,000 to address immigra-
tion emergencies after notifying the Com-
mittees of such transfer at least five days in
advance.
Section 504. The conference agreement
continues a provision by reference, prohib-
iting funds appropriated or otherwise made
available to the Department to make pay-
ment to the Working Capital Fund (WCF),
except for activities and amounts allowed in
the President’s fiscal year 2019 budget re-
quest. Funds provided to the WCF are avail-
able until expended. The Department can
only charge components for direct usage of
the WCF and these funds may be used only
for the purposes consistent with the contrib-
uting component. Any funds paid in advance
or for reimbursement must reflect the full
cost of each service. The Department shall
submit a notification prior to adding a new
activity to the fund or eliminating an exist-
ing activity from the fund. For activities
added to the fund, such notifications shall
detail the source of funds by PPA. In addi-
tion, the Department shall submit quarterly
WCF execution reports to the Committees
that include activity level detail.
Section 505. The conference agreement
continues a provision providing that not to
exceed 50 percent of unobligated balances
from prior-year appropriations for each Op-
erations and Support appropriation, shall re-
main available through fiscal year 2020, sub-
ject to section 503 reprogramming require-
ments.
Section 506. The conference agreement
continues a provision that deems intel-
ligence activities to be specifically author-
ized during fiscal year 2019 until the enact-
ment of an Act authorizing intelligence ac-
tivities for fiscal year 2019.
Section 507. The conference agreement
continues a provision requiring notification
to the Committees at least three days before
DHS executes or announces grant alloca-
tions; grant awards; contract awards, includ-
ing contracts covered by the Federal Acqui-
sition Regulation; other transaction agree-
ments; letters of intent; task or delivery or-
ders on multiple contract awards totaling
$1,000,000 or more; a task or delivery orders
greater than $10,000,000 from multi-year
funds; or sole-source grant awards. Notifica-
tions shall include a description of the
project or projects or activities to be funded
and the location, including city, county, and
state. If the Secretary determines that com-
pliance would pose substantial risk to
health, human life, or safety, an award may
be made without prior notification but the
Committees shall be notified within 5 full
business days after such award or letter is
issued.
Section 508. The conference agreement
continues a provision prohibiting all agen-
cies from purchasing, constructing, or leas-
ing additional facilities for federal law en-
forcement training without advance notifi-
cation to the Committees.

proved.
Section 510. The conference agreement
continues a provision that includes and con-
solidates by reference prior-year statutory
provisions related to a contracting officer’s
technical representative training; sensitive
security information; and the use of funds in
conformance with section 303 of the Energy
Policy Act of 1992.
Section 511. The conference agreement
continues a provision prohibiting the use of
funds in contravention of the Buy American
Act.
Section 512. The conference agreement
continues a provision regarding the oath of
allegiance required by section 337 of the Im-
migration and Nationality Act.
Section 513. The conference agreement

organization authority. This prohibition is
not intended to prevent the Department
from carrying out routine or small realloca-
tions of personnel or functions within com-
ponents, subject to section 503 of this Act.
This section prevents large-scale reorganiza-
tion of the Department, which should be
acted on legislatively by the relevant con-
gressional committees of jurisdiction. Any
DHS proposal to reorganize components that
is included as part of a budget request will be
considered by the Committees.
Section 514. The conference agreement
continues a provision prohibiting funds for
planning, testing, piloting, or developing a
national identification card.

February 13, 2019
DIVISION B—AGRICULTURE, RURAL DE-
VELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMIN-
ISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019
CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVES
The explanatory statement is silent on
provisions that were in both the House Re-
port (H.Rpt. 115–706) and Senate Report
(S.Rpt. 115–259) that remain unchanged by
this conference agreement, except as noted
in this explanatory statement.
The conference agreement restates that ex-
ecutive branch wishes cannot substitute for
Congress’s own statements as to the best evi-
dence of congressional intentions, which are
the official reports of the Congress. The con-
ference agreement further points out that
funds in this Act must be used for the pur-
poses for which appropriated, as required by
section 1301 of title 31 of the United States
Code, which provides: ‘‘Appropriations shall
be applied only to the objects for which the
appropriations were made except as other-
wise provided by law.’’
The House and Senate report language
that is not changed by the explanatory
statement is approved and indicates congres-
sional intentions. The explanatory state-
ment, while repeating some report language
for emphasis, does not intend to negate the
language referred to above unless expressly
provided herein.
In cases in which the House or the Senate
have directed the submission of a report,
such report is to be submitted to both the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions no later than 60 days after enactment
of this Act, unless otherwise directed. Here-
after, in division B of this statement, the
term ‘he Committees’ refers to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate.
For the appropriations provided by this
Act and previous Acts, the departments and
agencies funded by this conference agree-
ment are reminded that the Committees use
the definitions for transfer, reprogramming,
and program, project, and activity as defined
by the Government Accountability Office
(GAO) in GAO–04–261SP Appropriations
Law—Vol. I and GAO–05–734SP Budget Glos-
sary.
A transfer is the shifting of funds between
appropriations. It applies to (1) transfers
from one agency to another, (2) transfers
from one account to another within the same
agency, and (3) transfers to an interagency
or intra-agency working fund. In each in-
stance, statutory authority is required.
Reprogramming is the utilization of funds
in an appropriation account for purposes
other than those contemplated at the time of
appropriation. It is the shifting of funds from
one object to another within an appropria-
tion.
A program, project, or activity (PPA) is an
element within a budget account. PPAs are
identified by reference to include the most
specific level of budget items identified in
the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food
and Drug Administration, and Related Agen-
cies Act, 2019, accompanying Committee re-
ports, explanatory statements, the State-
ment of Managers, and budget justifications.
Program activity structures are intended to
provide a meaningful representation of the
operations financed by a specific budget ac-
count by project, activity, or organization.
For fiscal year 2019, the Committees con-
tinue to include bill language requiring ad-
vanced notification of certain agency ac-
tions. Notification will be required at least
30 days in advance of any action if (1) a
major capital investment is modified; (2) an
office is realigned or reorganized; and (3) ac-
tivities are carried out that were not de-
scribed in the budget request.
The conference agreement directs the Of-
fice of Budget and Program Analysis (OBPA)
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) to provide an organizational chart
for each agency funded by this Act to the di-
vision and subdivision level, as appropriate,
by March 1, 2019. The conference agreement
also directs the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) and the Farm Credit Administra-
tion (FCA) to provide an organizational
chart of each agency respectively to the divi-
sion and subdivision level, as appropriate, by
March 1, 2019.
Further, USDA and FDA should be mindful
of Congressional authority to determine and
set final funding levels for fiscal year 2020.
Therefore, the agencies should not pre-
suppose program funding outcomes and pre-
maturely initiate action to redirect staffing
prior to knowing final outcomes on fiscal
year 2020 program funding. The conference
agreement directs OBPA to provide the Com-
mittees with the number of staff years and
employees on board for each agency funded
by this Act on a quarterly basis.
Not later than 60 days after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agri-
culture and the Commissioner of Food and
Drugs shall enter into a formal agreement
delineating the responsibilities of the two
agencies for the regulation of cell-cultured
food products derived from livestock and
poultry. Such agreement shall be made pub-
lic on the USDA and FDA websites within
one day of the completion of the agreement.
TITLE I—AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS
PROCESSING, RESEARCH AND MARKETING
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The conference agreement provides
$46,603,000 for the Office of the Secretary.
In addition to updates provided to the
Committees, the Department is directed to
include in its fiscal year 2020 Congressional
Justification, as a single exhibit, a table list-
ing all deliverables, with a column for due
dates if applicable.
The conference agreement includes contin-
ued investment towards providing access to
high-speed broadband infrastructure and
services to rural areas of the United States.
The conference agreement continues to pro-
vide resources for broadband deployment
through the Broadband Loan program, Com-
munity Connect grant program, Distance
Learning and Telemedicine program and an
additional $550,000,000 for the broadband pilot
program established in section 779 of division
A of the Consolidated Appropriations Act,
2018 (Public Law 115–141). To ensure these in-
vestments are maximized, the conference
agreement reminds the Department to avoid
efforts that could duplicate existing net-
works built by private investment or those
built leveraging and utilizing other federal
programs and directs the Secretary of Agri-
culture to coordinate with the Federal Com-
munications Commission (FCC) and the Na-
tional Telecommunications Information Ad-
ministration (NTIA) to ensure wherever pos-
sible that broadband loans and grants issued
under the broadband programs are targeted
to areas that are currently unserved. In par-
ticular, the conference agreement directs
USDA to utilize the NTIA’s assessment of
the current state of broadband access nation-
wide, which includes the identification of ex-
isting infrastructure, gaps, and opportunities
for more efficient deployment. In imple-
menting a strategy for broadband deploy-
ment to unserved communities, the Depart-
ment shall explore utilizing all technologies,
including but not limited to, fiber, cable
modem, fixed wireless, and television white
space as a means of building sustainable
rural infrastructure for the modern econ-
omy. The amounts made available for the
broadband pilot program, as with the Rural
Economic Development Loan Program shall
remain available until expended.
The conferees encourage the Secretary to
work with stakeholders to develop accepted
remediation protocols that will allow for the
repurposing of poultry growing facilities into
controlled environment agriculture facilities
safe for food production.
The conferees are concerned about the un-
known costs associated with the proposed
move of the National Institutes of Food and
Agriculture and the Economic Research
Service to a new location outside of the Na-
tional Capital Region. In submitting the fis-
cal year 2020 budget justification, the De-
partment is directed to include all cost esti-
mates for the proposed move of the two
agencies, as well as a detailed analysis of
any research benefits of their relocation.
There is an expectation that this process will
be followed in the future for any other poten-
tial proposed agency relocations by the De-
partment.
The conferees support an indefinite delay
in the proposed transfer of ERS to the Office
of the Chief Economist. At this time, the
conferees find it appropriate for ERS to re-
main under the Research, Education and Ec-
onomics mission area. The conferees take
this position as several questions remain
about the merits of the proposed transfer as
well as the proposed relocation of ERS out-
side of the National Capital Region. Insuffi-
cient information and justification relating
to the reorganization and relocation make
moving forward on these proposals pre-
mature at this time.
The conferees await the cost-benefit anal-
ysis of the National Finance Center and ac-
companying sufficiency review by the Comp-
troller General of the United States as di-
rected in P.L. 115–141. The conferees remind
the Department of enacted language prohib-
iting the initiating, planning, developing,
implementing, or making of any changes to
remove or relocate any systems, missions, or
functions of the offices of the Chief Finan-
cial Officer or any personnel from the Na-
tional Finance Center prior to written notifi-
cation to and prior approval of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress.

The conferees recognize that the Depart-
ment proposes to transfer the responsibility
for operational planning, and future oper-
ations of the National Bio and Agro-Defense
Facility (NBAF) to USDA and support the
fiscal year 2019 funding request to allow
NBAF to be fully operational by December
31, 2022. The conferees appreciate the joint
DHS/USDA transition team working to iden-
tify and outline transition activities to ad-
dress all requirements for the timely oper-
ational stand-up of NBAF. The conferees pro-
vide $10,600,000 to address one-time costs as-
sociated with the transfer of the science pro-
gram from the Plum Island Animal Disease
Center to NBAF and $42,000,000 to address
stand-up activities and other initial costs to
operate and maintain the facility.
NBAF will provide the U.S. with expanded
capacity to implement a comprehensive bio-
defense research program to protect against
foreign animal diseases that pose the great-
est threats to animal agriculture and public
health. The conferees provide an additional
$5,000,000 for ARS to increase research efforts
on foreign animal diseases and emerging dis-
eases with high consequence to animal and
public health.
The Committees have read the quarterly
reports on animal welfare issues submitted
by ARS. While providing helpful informa-
tion, on some issues, ARS did not report a
single specific negative finding by APHIS in-
spectors, despite the fact that numerous vio-
lations have been found involving the death
of numerous animals and serious health
issues of many more. The failure to report
these problems to the Committees is unac-
ceptable. The conferees direct ARS to submit
a single report covering all violations found
by APHIS to date and the specific actions
taken to prevent them from recurring within
60 days of enactment. They also direct ARS
to continue to submit quarterly reports that
include all violations found by APHIS during
that quarter and the specific actions that
will be taken to prevent their recurrence.
The quarterly reports shall also include each
issue found by APHIS inspectors at the pre-
compliance inspections of newly-covered re-
search activities and the remedial actions
taken.
The conferees recognize the need for ad-
vancements in dryland production practices,
cropping, and equipment to increase profit-
ability, conserve the soil, enhance soil water
storage, promote soil health, and decrease
reliance on herbicides. The conferees provide
an additional $2,000,000 to expand research
focused on resilient dryland farming.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
The conference agreement provides
$381,200,000 for ARS Buildings and Facilities
for the next highest priorities identified on
the 2012 USDA ARS Capital Investment
Strategy and 2015 ARS Co-located Coop-
erator Facility Report.

SERVICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The conference agreement provides
$1,011,136,000 for the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Salaries
and Expenses.
The conferees provide a net increase of
$34,243,000 for high priority initiatives in
order to protect the plant and animal re-
sources of the Nation from pests and dis-
eases. Within the increase total, the con-
ferees include the following: $800,000 for the
Equine, Cervid, and Small Ruminant Health
program to help address chronic wasting dis-
ease and support for the National Scrapie
Eradication Program; $10,600,000 for the Vet-
erinary Diagnostics program to carry out
the science program at the National Bio- and
Agro-defense Facility program; $1,000,000 for
Agricultural Quarantine Inspection in sup-
port of pre-departure and interline inspec-
tion efforts; $2,500,000 for Field Crop and
Rangeland Ecosystems Pests in order to con-
trol or eradicate pests destroying Roseau
cane in wetlands near the Mississippi River
Delta as well as funds for APHIS to partner
with states in the control and eradication of
the cogongrass weed; $12,843,000 for Specialty
Crop Pests, including $12,000,000 for the con-
trol or eradication of the spotted lanternfly;
$4,000,000 for Tree and Wood Pests; $500,000
for Animal Welfare; and, $2,000,000 for the
Overseas Technical and Trade Operations
Program to assist U.S. producers whose agri-
cultural exports are blocked due to unfair
sanitary and phytosanitary issues.
The conferees direct APHIS to send copies
of all inspection reports for current ARS fa-
cilities and newly covered ARS facilities, in-
cluding pre-compliance reports, to the Com-
mittees.
The conferees include no less than
$4,000,000 for cervid health activities. Within
the funds provided, APHIS should give con-
sideration to indemnity payments if war-
ranted.
The conferees support efforts to address
potential gaps in farm-specific antimicrobial
resistance data. At the same time, the agen-
cy is reminded that any information col-
lected on-farm should be done through the
National Animal Health Monitoring System
(NAHMS), keeping respondents anonymous
and ensuring that all information collected
is protected from release or distribution in a
manner that could identify an individual re-
spondent.
The conferees remain concerned with the
invasive species scale insect pest that is de-
stroying Roseau cane in the Mississippi Riv-
er’s Delta region along the Gulf of Mexico.
The conferees direct APHIS to continue
work with the Agricultural Research Service
(ARS) and stakeholders and provide an addi-
tional $500,000 to further develop an inte-
grated management program for control of
the Roseau cane scale insect pest infesta-
tion.
The conferees include $28,000,000 under
Wildlife Damage Management for national
rabies management, surveillance, and eradi-
cation efforts and $2,000,000 for Wildlife Serv-
ices education and training. The conference
agreement also provides $1,600,000 for com-
batting wildlife depredation to catfish pro-
duction and maintain fiscal year 2018 funding
levels for feral swine surveillance. Addition-
ally, no less than $250,000 should be available
for the agency to reduce blackbird depreda-
tion in the Northern Great Plains.
The conferees provide $2,000,000 for APHIS
to partner with state departments of agri-
culture and forestry commissions in states
considered to be the epicenter of infesta-
tions, to assist with control and treatment of
cogongrass in order to slow the advancing
front of this invasive plant-pest species and
its impact on forest productivity, wildlife
habitat, and private landowners.

than $5,000,000 shall be provided to support
cooperative agreements focused on innova-
tive phosphorus removal strategies where ag-
ricultural runoff has contributed nutrients
to a waterbody. Such work shall be con-
ducted in consultation with the National In-
stitute for Food and Agriculture and the Ag-
ricultural Research Service.
In carrying out the programs under section
524(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, the
Secretary is encouraged to establish multi-
year pilot projects to provide financial and
technical assistance to farms regulated
under the FSMA Produce Safety Rule for
capital improvements to address on-farm ag-
ricultural water concerns, including irriga-
tion systems and other conservation prac-
tices to improve water quality and soil
health. Payment limits and other provisions
of the AMA program will apply.
The conferees are concerned about the
number of staff vacancies at NRCS, as un-
filled state-level positions are creating
delays in application approval and the de-
ployment of important conservation funding.
NRCS is directed to provide a report no later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act up-
dating the Committees on staffing levels at
each NRCS office across the country, by lo-
cation, including vacancies that have re-
mained unfilled for more than 6 months,
plans to fill those vacancies, and the work-
load analysis that demonstrates the total
number of employees needed compared to
the national staffing cap.
The conferees reiterate their support for
irrigation agriculture and encourage NRCS
to leverage all possible funding streams to

The conference agreement provides $800,000
for the Office of the Under Secretary for
Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services.
The marketplace continues to develop in-
novative technologies, such as third-party
mobile applications, which can assist nutri-
tion program participants in managing their
benefits. The conferees encourage USDA to
ensure that these new technologies have a
secure system in place to protect personal
account information; do not sell, distribute
or make available personal account informa-
tion for commercial marketing purposes; and
that participants have consistent access to
their account information regardless of the
means in which they choose to access it.
Retailer SNAP sales data could contain
proprietary and confidential information.
Should such information be made publicly
available, USDA is directed to make every
effort to protect confidential business infor-
mation likely to cause harm to the competi-
tive position in the retail industry, espe-
cially small grocery stores and small grocery
stores in rural areas. Personal information
about individual SNAP participants should
also remain confidential.

SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM
FOR WOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN (WIC)
The conference agreement provides
$6,075,000,000 for the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children.
The conference agreement recommends
full funding for WIC that will meet esti-
mated participation in fiscal year 2019. The
recommendation includes $60,000,000 for
breastfeeding support initiatives and
$19,000,000 for infrastructure. The conferees
recognize new technologies, including tele-
medicine, that support breastfeeding moth-
ers through access to professional
breastfeeding and nutrition consultants. The
conferees provide $5,000,000 for telehealth
competitive grants to supplement the nutri-
tion education and breastfeeding support of-
fered in the WIC clinic, and to decrease bar-
riers to access to WIC services, particularly
in rural communities. Funding can be used
to support a variety of telehealth interven-
tions, including but not limited to the use of
telehealth tools by WIC staff as well as clin-
ical services and technologies provided by
third-party vendors.
The work of the National Academies of
Science (NAS) to review and make rec-
ommendations for updating the WIC food
packages to reflect current science and cul-
tural factors is recognized. The conferees
note, however, that while all revised pack-
ages now allow some fish, the amounts re-
main low compared to the recommendations
of other authoritative health agencies. The
conferees strongly encourage the Depart-
ment to consider the health and cultural
benefits of fish consumption as the NAS rec-
ommendations are reviewed and used to in-
form the Department’s next course of action.
The conferees also strongly encourage the
Department to continue to allow states to
submit cultural food package proposals to
respond to the cultural preferences of WIC
participants in states like Alaska.

PROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019
Report language included in House Report
115–704 (‘‘the House report’’) or Senate Re-
port 115–275 (‘‘the Senate report’’) that is not
changed by this explanatory statement or
the Act is approved. The explanatory state-
ment, while repeating some language for em-
phasis, is not intended to negate the lan-
guage referred to above unless expressly pro-
vided herein. In cases where both the House
report and the Senate report address a par-
ticular issue not specifically addressed in the
explanatory statement, the House report and
the Senate report should be read as con-
sistent and are to be interpreted accordingly.
In cases where the House report or the Sen-
ate report directs the submission of a report,
such report is to be submitted to both the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions (‘‘the Committees’’).
Each department and agency funded in this
Act shall follow the directions set forth in
this Act and the accompanying explanatory
statement, and shall not reallocate resources
or reorganize activities except as provided
herein. Reprogramming procedures shall
apply to: funds provided in this Act; unobli-
gated balances from previous appropriations
Acts that are available for obligation or ex-
penditure in fiscal year 2019; and non-appro-
priated resources such as fee collections that
are used to meet program requirements in
fiscal year 2019. These procedures are speci-
fied in section 505 of this Act.
Any reprogramming request shall include
any out-year budgetary impacts and a sepa-
rate accounting of program or mission im-
pacts on estimated carryover funds. Any pro-
gram, project, or activity cited in this ex-
planatory statement, or in the House report
or the Senate report and not changed by this
Act, shall be construed as the position of the
Congress and shall not be subject to reduc-
tions or reprogramming without prior ap-
proval of the Committees. Further, any de-
partment or agency funded in this Act that
plans a reduction-in-force shall notify the
Committees by letter no later than 30 days
in advance of the date of any such planned
personnel action.
When a department or agency submits a
reprogramming or transfer request to the
Committees and does not receive identical
responses, it shall be the responsibility of
the department or agency seeking the re-
programming to reconcile the differences be-
tween the two bodies before proceeding. If
reconciliation is not possible, the items in
disagreement in the reprogramming or
transfer request shall be considered unap-
proved. Departments and agencies shall not
submit reprogramming notifications after
July 1, 2019, except in extraordinary cir-
cumstances. Any such notification shall in-
clude a description of the extraordinary cir-
cumstances.
In compliance with section 533 of this Act,
each department and agency funded in this
Act shall submit spending plans, signed by
the respective department or agency head,
for the Committees’ review not later than 45
days after enactment.

new independent cost estimate, the Sec-
retary’s estimate includes additional as-
sumptions to enhance the robustness and re-
liability of the program. For example, the
new estimate assumes the need for addi-
tional in-person follow-up visits due to fewer
households expected to initially respond to
the Census. In addition, the Census Bureau is
directed to provide the Committees with no-
tification 15 days before any spending it in-
tends to incur in fiscal year 2019 that is
above the amounts included in the October
2017 life-cycle cost estimate for fiscal year

National Integrated Drought Information Sys-
tem (NIDIS).—The agreement provides
$13,500,000 for NIDIS activities.
Ocean Exploration and Research.—The
agreement adopts House and Senate report
language regarding ocean exploration and re-
search. The agreement supports the use of
existing tele-presence technology, and ap-
plied exploration, to map critically impor-
tant mineral deposits within America’s ex-
clusive economic zone and sites of sub-
merged human history, particularly in the
Pacific.
Multi-Function Phased Array Radar (MPAR)
Program.—The fiscal year 2018 appropriations
Act directed NOAA to maintain its leader-
ship in the Spectrum Efficient National Sur-
veillance Radar (SENSR) Program. There is
frustration with the decision to de-scope the
SENSR program by removing the high-reso-
lution weather sensing requirements, and
concern that NOAA is unprepared to execute
a weather radar follow-on program. In lieu of
Senate language, the agreement directs
OAR, in coordination with the National
Weather Service, to develop and submit to
the Committees, within 90 days of enactment
of this Act, a weather radar follow-on re-
search-to-operations transition plan, in ac-
cordance with the requirements for agency

transition plans set forth under NOAA Ad-
ministrative Order 216–105B, section 3.06.
Oceanographic Research Partnership Pro-
gram.—$5,500,000 is for NOAA to advance
ocean science research through the program
established under 10 U.S.C. 7901. Senate guid-
ance for this funding and support for Ocean
Joint Technology Transfer Initiative
projects funded in fiscal year 2018 is adopted.
Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI).—
House language regarding JTTI is adopted.
Of the amount provided for JTTI, up to
$5,000,000 shall be available to pursue innova-
tive, modern techniques to accelerate the
transition of weather research to operations.
Highly Migratory Species.—In lieu of House
and Senate language under NMFS, the agree-
ment provides up to $2,000,000 within OAR for
the Sea Grant program to partner with State
agencies, academia, and the fishing industry
to research highly migratory fish species in
the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic. This
should include examining the impact of off-
shore oil platforms on the biology of highly
migratory species, such as yellow fin tuna.
Highly migratory species, and the coastal
communities that rely on the health of these
stocks, could greatly benefit from improved,
science-based management and conservation.
National Weather Service (NWS).—

Quarterly Briefings.—The fiscal year 2018
appropriations Act directed the NWS to pro-
vide quarterly briefings to the Committees
on all NWS management and budget issues.
The agreement adopts House and Senate lan-
guage regarding such reporting. However,
there is frustration and disappointment that
the NWS was unable to provide any quar-
terly briefings during fiscal year 2018. The
American people entrust the NWS with more
than $1,000,000,000 each year to provide accu-
rate weather forecasting. It is unacceptable
that the NWS is unwilling or unable to re-
port to the Committees on its operations.
The leadership of the Department of Com-
merce and NOAA shall ensure NWS improves
the transparency of its operations and pro-
vides quarterly briefings on management and
budget issues to the Committees.
National Mesonet Program.—The agreement
adopts Senate report language on the Na-
tional Mesonet Program and provides
$19,000,000 for these activities.
Advanced Weather Interactive Processing Sys-
tem (AWIPS).—Within the increased funding
for Central Processing, the agreement fully
funds the request for the AWIPS Cyclical Re-
freshment.
Facilities Maintenance.—Within funding for
Analyze, Forecast, and Support, the agree-
ment provides $8,000,000 for the National
Weather Service’s highest priority facilities
repair and deferred maintenance require-
ments at Weather Forecast Offices. Thirty
days prior to obligating any of these addi-
tional facilities repair and deferred mainte-
nance funds, NWS shall submit a report pro-
viding: (1) a prioritized list of NWS deferred
facilities maintenance needs, based on the
facilities condition assessment; and (2) an es-
timate of the total amount and composition
of deferred facilities maintenance. In subse-
quent fiscal years, NOAA shall request re-
sources in line with the September 2017 NWS
Facilities Strategic Plan.
Dissemination.—House report language re-
garding the Integrated Dissemination Pro-
gram system is not adopted.
National Water Center (NWC) Operations.—
The agreement adopts Senate language
under NWS for the NWC and provides an ad-
ditional $1,500,000 within Analyze, Forecast,
and Support to expedite hiring within the
NWC Water Prediction Operations Division.
The increasing prevalence and severity of
flooding events results in loss of life and bil-
lions of dollars of property damage. While
NOAA has made progress in developing next-
generation water modeling capabilities, such
as the National Water Model, it is impera-
tive that these technologies be transitioned
into operations to enable more accurate and
longer range flood forecasts. Objective 3.3 of
the Department of Commerce’s Strategic
Plan directs NOAA to begin demonstrating
these capabilities. Therefore, NWS should
also simultaneously be preparing to
operationalize these capabilities. NWS is di-
rected to develop and make public, by the
end of fiscal year 2019, an operations and
services policy directive that defines na-
tional instructions on operations at the
NWC, and the content and provision of NWC
products and services. Further, such policy
should establish the NWC as the operational
center of excellence for water prediction and
related decision support services within
NOAA.

critical to preparing for concentrated rain
storms and flooding along the U.S. West
Coast. Therefore, the agreement provides
$1,000,000 for use of airborne assets to con-
duct increased winter storm observations to
better observe and predict these extreme
weather events.
Fleet Deferred Maintenance.—The agree-
ment provides $9,500,000 above the request in
OMAO’s Operations, Research, and Facilities
account, and $11,500,000 above the request in
OMAO’s Procurement, Acquisition and Con-
struction account to address deferred main-
tenance and technological refresh of NOAA’s

bilities.
NOAA Marine Operations Facilities.—As a
result of the submission of the report re-
quired in fiscal year 2018 regarding the facil-
ity to accommodate the NOAA fisheries re-
search vessel Henry B. Bigelow, the agree-
ment does not adopt the Senate report lan-
guage withholding certain funding. NOAA

judication process is impartial and con-
sistent with due process.
EOIR shall continue to submit monthly re-
ports on performance and IJ hiring in the
format and detail provided in fiscal year
2018, to include statistics available on the
number of cases where visa overstay is a rel-
evant factor and the median days pending for
both detained and non-detained cases. The
reports shall also list IJs who are tempo-
rarily deployed away from their permanent
courtrooms, noting the permanent and tem-
porary duty stations of each IJ and the
length of such temporary duty assignments.
To the extent EOIR has adopted new per-
formance measures related to the efficient

TITLE III—SCIENCE
OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY
The agreement includes $5,544,000 for the
Office of Science and Technology Policy
(OSTP).
Emerging Contaminants.—OSTP submitted
the ‘‘Plan for Addressing Critical Research
Gaps Related to Emerging Contaminants in
Drinking Water’’ in October 2018. Within 90
days of the enactment of this agreement,
OSTP shall update the implementation plan
included in that report, including identifying
budgetary resources required, by agency, for
fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021.
NATIONAL SPACE COUNCIL
The agreement includes $1,965,000 for the
activities of the National Space Council.
Execution of Space Programs.—Under Execu-
tive Order 13803, the National Space Council
(the Council) is directed to, among other du-
ties, ‘‘develop recommendations for the
President on space policy and space-related
issues’’ and ‘‘foster close coordination, co-
operation, and technology and information
exchange among the civil, national security,
and commercial space sectors.’’ In executing
these duties, the Council is reminded that, in
recent years, poor workmanship, poor over-
sight, and poor performance (e.g., flawed
welding techniques, component tube con-
tamination, incorrect cleaning methods,
using the wrong voltage in testing, unreli-
able launch vehicle bolt cutter assembly,
mishandling of rocket stages during trans-
port, and substandard strut components)
have led to costly delays and even loss of
mission. Overly ambitious technology devel-
opment, optimistic scheduling, and poor cost
estimation have become common. No type of
contract vehicle seems immune, whether
traditional cost-plus contracts or firm, fixed-
price contracts are used. These are inherent,
systemic problems that cannot continue. Na-
tional security, technology development, sci-
entific discoveries, and improved weather
forecasting are too important to the future
of the Nation and require the Council to ad-
dress these issues.
NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE
ADMINISTRATION
The agreement includes $21,500,000,000 for
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration (NASA). The agreement includes
substantial new resources for activities re-
lated to Moon exploration and retains lan-
guage regarding submission of a detailed re-
port prior to obligating certain funds. As
noted elsewhere in this statement, the lack
of progress across science and exploration
programs despite continued significant and
sustained investments in these programs is
dismaying. Reports by the NASA Inspector
General (IG), the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO), and independent ex-
perts point to a number of deficiencies that
NASA and its private sector partners must
address. During fiscal year 2019, NASA is ex-
pected to show marked success in addressing
the myriad deficiencies identified by over-
sight bodies.

SCIENCE
The agreement includes $6,905,700,000 for
Science.
Earth Science.—The agreement includes
$1,931,000,000 for Earth Science and adopts all
funding levels designated by the House and
the Senate.
Planetary Science.—The agreement includes
$2,758,500,000 for Planetary Science. The
agreement adopts House language regarding
the Europa Clipper and Lander missions
modified to reflect launch dates of 2023 for
the Clipper and 2025 for the Lander. The
agreement includes $97,000,000 for the Double
Asteroid Redirection Test and no less than
the fiscal year 2018 level for NEOcam. The
agreement includes up to $218,000,000 for the
Lunar Discovery and Exploration program,
including $21,000,000 for the Lunar Recon-
naissance Orbiter. The agreement adopts
Senate language regarding the helicopter
technology demonstration planned for Mars
2020.
Astrophysics.—The agreement includes
$1,191,600,000 for Astrophysics, including
$98,300,000 for Hubble Space Telescope oper-
ations and $45,000,000 for Education and Pub-
lic Outreach activities. The agreement does
not adopt House language regarding certain
work with private sector or philanthropic or-
ganizations.
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope
(WFIRST).—The agreement includes no less
than $312,200,000 for WFIRST. The agreement
emphasizes and reiterates House and Senate
language regarding cost overruns, schedule
delays, and adherence to the $3,200,000,000
cost cap. The agreement also includes
$10,000,000 for starshade technology develop-
ment and $10,000,000 for search for life tech-
nology development.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).—The
agreement includes $304,600,000 for JWST.
There is profound disappointment with both
NASA and its contractors regarding mis-
management, complete lack of careful over-
sight, and overall poor basic workmanship
on JWST, which has undergone two signifi-
cant reviews because of failures on the part
of NASA and its commercial sector partner.
NASA and its commercial partners seem to
believe that congressional funding for this
project and other development efforts is an
entitlement, unaffected by failures to stay
on schedule or within budget. This attitude
ignores the opportunity cost to other NASA
activities that must be sacrificed or delayed.
The agreement includes a general provision
to adjust the cap for JWST to $8,802,700,000,
an increase of $802,700,000 above the previous
cap. NASA should strictly adhere to this cap
or, under this agreement, JWST will have to
find cost savings or cancel the mission.
NASA and its contractors are expected to
implement the recommendations of both the
most recent independent review and the pre-
vious Casani report and to continue coopera-
tion with JWST’s standing review board. The
agreement does not adopt the reorganization
of JWST into Astrophysics, and the JWST
Program Office shall continue the reporting
structure adopted after the Casani report
and reiterated by the recent Webb Inde-
pendent Review Board.
Heliophysics.—The agreement includes
$720,000,000 for Heliophysics, including
$15,000,000 for a Space Weather Science Ap-
plications Project.
AERONAUTICS
The agreement includes $725,000,000 for
Aeronautics, including no less than
$35,000,000 for hypersonic research activities
as directed by the House. The agreement
modifies House language regarding air mo-
bility and automation and directs that this
report be submitted within 90 days of enact-
ment of this agreement.
SPACE TECHNOLOGY
The agreement includes $926,900,000 for
Space Technology. The agreement reiterates
House and Senate language regarding the
need to maintain an independent research
and technology portfolio to support both
science and human exploration programs. It
is understood that NASA has further refined
internal oversight responsibility for pro-
grams within this account and the Explo-
ration account and directs NASA to make
adjustments as necessary in the fiscal year
2019 spending plan. The agreement includes

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1834 February 13, 2019
conferees note that the bipartisan Satellite
Television Extension and Localism Reau-
thorization (STELAR) Act of 2014 was en-
acted to promote consumers’ access to tele-
vision broadcast station signals that origi-
nate in their state of residence, with an em-
phasis on localism and the cultural and eco-
nomic importance of local programming.
Congress’s intent was to ensure Americans
have access to local broadcast and media
content. The conferees note that many
broadcast stations do not neatly conform to
Nielsen-measured designated market area
boundaries, preventing many satellite tele-
vision viewers from accessing local news,
politics, sports, and emergency program-
ming. The conferees note that despite the re-
forms made in STELAR, many communities
continue to struggle with market modifica-
tion petitions. The FCC should provide a full
analysis to ensure decisions on market modi-
fication are comprehensively reviewed and
STELAR’s intent to promote localism is re-
tained. The FCC is directed to adhere to
statutory requirements and congressional in-
tent when taking administrative action
under STELAR.

for this project. No funds were requested for
the project for fiscal year 2019 and no funds

ditional funds for this project due to the un-
answered questions regarding the new plan,
including the revision of longstanding mis-
sion and security requirements. GSA is en-
couraged to work with the FBI to submit a

DIVISION E—DEPARTMENT OF THE INTE-
RIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED
AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019
The following statement is an explanation
of the effects of Division E, which provides
appropriations for the Department of the In-
terior, the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy (EPA), the Forest Service, the Indian
Health Service, and related agencies for fis-
cal year 2019.
The joint explanatory statement accom-
panying this Act is approved and indicates
congressional intent. Report language con-
tained in House Report 115–765 and Senate
Report 115–276 providing specific guidance to
agencies regarding the administration of ap-
propriated funds and any corresponding re-
porting requirements carries the same em-
phasis as the language included in this ex-
planatory statement and should be complied
with unless specifically addressed to the con-
trary herein. This explanatory statement,
while repeating some language for emphasis,
is not intended to negate the language re-
ferred to above unless expressly provided
herein.
In cases where the House report, Senate re-
port, or this explanatory statement direct
the submission of a report, such report is to
be submitted to both the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations. Where this
explanatory statement refers to the Commit-
tees or the Committees on Appropriations,
unless otherwise noted, this reference is to
the House Subcommittee on Interior, Envi-
ronment, and Related Agencies and the Sen-
ate Subcommittee on Interior, Environment,
and Related Agencies.
The Conferees direct each department and
agency funded in this Act to follow the direc-
tions set forth in this Act and the accom-
panying statement and to not reallocate re-
sources or reorganize activities except as
provided herein or otherwise approved by the
House and Senate Appropriations Commit-
tees through the reprogramming process as
referenced in this explanatory statement.
This explanatory statement addresses only
those agencies and accounts for which there
is a need for greater explanation than pro-
vided in the Act itself. Funding levels for ap-
propriations by account, program, and activ-
ity, with comparisons to the fiscal year 2018
enacted level and the fiscal year 2019 budget
request, can be found in the table at the end
of this division.
Unless expressly stated otherwise, any ref-
erence to ‘‘this Act’’ or ‘‘at the end of this
statement’’ shall be treated as referring only
to the provisions of this division.
Arts and Humanities Advocacy.—The Con-
ferees acknowledge and appreciate the dec-
ades of arts and humanities advocacy by the
late Rep. Louise M. Slaughter. In her mem-
ory, the Conferees encourage the National
Endowment for the Arts and the National
Endowment for the Humanities to expand
grant-making activities in a manner that
honors her advocacy, especially in rural and
under-served areas, so more Americans are
able to benefit from the economic, social,
and educational effects of the arts and hu-
manities.
Delivery of Reports and Correspondence.—All
reports, correspondence, and reprogramming
requests from the agencies to the Commit-
tees shall be provided in both physical and
electronic formats.
Directives.—The Department of the Interior
and Forest Service are directed to continue
the directions included in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Consolidated

ing to Vacant Grazing Allotments; State
Wildlife Data; Bighorn Sheep; Land Grants,
Acequias, and Community Ditches; and Pub-
lic Access.
Harassment-Free Workplace.—The Conferees
reiterate their expectation that all Federal
employees, especially those in leadership po-
sitions, at the agencies funded by this Act
will create and maintain harassment-free
workplaces and remind the agencies of the
directives in House Report 115–765 and Sen-
ate Report 115–276.
Making Litigation Costs Transparent.—The
Department of the Interior, EPA, and the
Forest Service are directed to provide to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions, and to make publicly available no
later than 60 days after enactment of this
Act, detailed Equal Access to Justice Act
(EAJA) fee information as specified in the
explanatory statement accompanying Divi-
sion G of the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2017 (Public Law 115–31).
Multi-Agency Transparency.—The Conferees
support increasing transparency within all
agencies of the Department of the Interior,
the Forest Service, and EPA. These agencies
are encouraged to disclose costs associated
with analyses required by the National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act.
Paper Reduction Efforts.—The Conferees
urge the Department of the Interior, EPA,
Forest Service, and Indian Health Service to
work with the Office of Management and
Budget to reduce printing and reproduction
costs and direct each agency to report to the
Committees within 90 days of enactment of
this Act on steps being undertaken to
achieve this goal and how much each agency
expects to save by implementing these meas-
ures.
Recreation Fee Authority.—A one-year ex-
tension of recreation fee authority for the
Department of the Interior and the Forest
Service is included in Section 427.
Twenty-first Century Conservation Service

276, the Conferees expect the Department of
the Interior and the Forest Service to con-
tinue conservation partnerships with the
21st Century Conservation Service Corps and
Public Lands Corps.
Water Rights.—The Conferees remind the
Department of the Interior and the Forest
Service of the States’ jurisdiction over water
law and expect that all applicable laws will
be followed when considering a request for a
permit or permit renewal.
White Nose Syndrome.—The Conferees re-
mind the agencies funded by this Act of the
directive included in Senate Report 115–276.

ter 2003 of title 54 of the United States Code,

The Conferees expect the agencies to move
forward with all projects specifically identi-
fied and funded through this agreement; to
utilize funding in a timely manner; and to
seek congressional approval for reprogram-
ming unobligated balances if applicable. The
Conferees expect the agencies to provide
timely information on project status and
available balances. Agencies are directed to
continue their longstanding process of iden-
tifying and prioritizing potential Federal
land acquisition projects in anticipation of
program appropriations as consistent with
previous years. Within 30 days of the submis-
sion of the fiscal year 2020 budget or by
March 1, 2019, whichever comes first, each
agency is directed to submit to the Commit-
tees a prioritized list of projects for fiscal
year 2020 consideration.
The Conferees believe increasing access to
our public lands for hunting, fishing, and
other recreational activities is important
and again include funding for these projects.
The agencies are expected to work with their
respective regions, State offices, and/or man-
agement units to identify potential recre-
ation access projects and to inform the Com-
mittees on project selections prior to pro-
ceeding.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
The following are the procedures governing
reprogramming actions for programs and ac-
tivities funded in the Department of the In-
terior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act. The Conferees remind
the agencies funded in this Act that these re-
programming guidelines are in effect, and
must be complied with, until such time as
the Committees modify them through bill or
report language.
Definitions.—‘‘Reprogramming,’’ as defined
in these procedures, includes the realloca-
tion of funds from one budget activity, budg-
et line-item, or program area, to another
within any appropriation funded in this Act.
In cases where either the House or Senate
Committee report displays an allocation of
an appropriation below that level, that more
detailed level shall be the basis for re-
programming.
For construction, land acquisition, and for-
est legacy accounts, a reprogramming con-
stitutes the reallocation of funds, including
unobligated balances, from one construction,
land acquisition, or forest legacy project to
another such project.

H1856 February 13, 2019
A reprogramming shall also consist of any
significant departure from the program de-
scribed in the agency’s budget justifications.
This includes proposed reorganizations, espe-
cially those of significant national or re-
gional importance, even without a change in
funding. Any change to the organization
table presented in the budget justification
shall be subject to this requirement.
The Conferees are aware that agencies
funded by this Act are currently working to
implement Executive Order 13781, a Com-
prehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Execu-
tive Branch, and have included in the fiscal
year 2019 budget request a number of signifi-
cant reorganization proposals for the Com-
mittees’ consideration. The Conferees are
also aware of reports that agencies funded by
this Act may be weighing additional organi-
zational changes during the remainder of
this fiscal year. Agencies are reminded that
this agreement continues longstanding Gen-
eral Guidelines for Reprogramming that re-
quire agencies funded by this Act to submit
reorganization proposals for Committee re-
view prior to their implementation. It is
noted that such reprogramming guidelines
apply to proposed reorganizations, workforce
restructure, reshaping or transfer of func-
tions presented in the budget justifications,
or bureau-wide downsizing, especially those
of significant national or regional impor-
tance, and include closures, consolidations,
and relocations of offices, facilities, and lab-
oratories presented in the budget justifica-
tions. In addition, no agency shall imple-
ment any part of a reorganization that modi-
fies regional or State boundaries for agencies
or bureaus that were in effect as of the date
of enactment of this Act unless approved
consistent with the General Guidelines for
Reprogramming procedures specified herein.
Any such reprogramming request submitted
to the Committees on Appropriations shall
include a description of anticipated benefits,
including anticipated efficiencies and cost-
savings, as well as a description of antici-
pated personnel impacts and funding changes
anticipated to implement the proposal.
General Guidelines for Reprogramming.—
(a) A reprogramming should be made only
when an unforeseen situation arises, and
then only if postponement of the project or
the activity until the next appropriation
year would result in actual loss or damage.
(b) Any project or activity, which may be
deferred through reprogramming, shall not
later be accomplished by means of further
reprogramming, but instead, funds should
again be sought for the deferred project or
activity through the regular appropriations
process.
(c) Except under the most urgent situa-
tions, reprogramming should not be em-
ployed to initiate new programs or increase
allocations specifically denied or limited by
Congress, or to decrease allocations specifi-
cally increased by the Congress.
(d) Reprogramming proposals submitted to
the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations for approval shall be considered ap-
proved 30 calendar days after receipt if the
Committees have posed no objection. How-
ever, agencies will be expected to extend the
approval deadline if specifically requested by
either Committee.
Criteria and Exceptions.—A reprogramming
must be submitted to the Committees in
writing prior to implementation if it exceeds
$1,000,000 annually or results in an increase
or decrease of more than 10 percent annually
in affected programs or projects, whichever
amount is less, with the following excep-
tions:
(a) With regard to the tribal priority allo-
cations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), there
is no restriction on reprogrammings among
these programs. However, the Bureaus shall
report on all reprogrammings made during a
given fiscal year no later than 60 days after
the end of the fiscal year.
(b) With regard to the EPA, the Conferees
do not require reprogramming requests asso-
ciated with the States and Tribes Partner-
ship Grants, or up to a cumulative total of
$30,000,000 from carryover balances among
the individual program areas delineated in
the Environmental Programs and Manage-
ment account. No funds, however, shall be
reallocated from individual Geographic Pro-
grams.
Assessments.—‘‘Assessment’’ as defined in
these procedures shall refer to any charges,
reserves, or holdbacks applied to a budget
activity or budget line item for costs associ-
ated with general agency administrative
costs, overhead costs, working capital ex-
penses, or contingencies.
(a) No assessment shall be levied against
any program, budget activity, subactivity,
budget line item, or project funded by the In-
terior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act unless such assessment
and the basis therefor are presented to the
Committees on Appropriations in the budget
justifications and are subsequently approved
by the Committees. The explanation for any
assessment in the budget justification shall
show the amount of the assessment, the ac-
tivities assessed, and the purpose of the
funds.
(b) Proposed changes to estimated assess-
ments, as such estimates were presented in
annual budget justifications, shall be sub-
mitted through the reprogramming process
and shall be subject to the same dollar and
reporting criteria as any other reprogram-
ming.
(c) The Conferees direct that each agency
or bureau which utilizes assessments shall
submit an annual report to the Committees
which provides details on the use of all funds
assessed from any other budget activity, line
item, subactivity, or project.
(d) In no case shall contingency funds or
assessments be used to finance projects and
activities disapproved or limited by Con-
gress, or to finance programs or activities
that could be foreseen and included in the
normal budget review process.
(e) New programs requested in the budget
should not be initiated before enactment of
the bill without notification to, and the ap-
proval of, the Committees on Appropria-
tions. This restriction applies to all such ac-
tions regardless of whether a formal re-
programming of funds is required to begin
the program.
Quarterly Reports.—All reprogrammings be-
tween budget activities, budget line-items,
program areas, or the more detailed activity
levels shown in this agreement, including
those below the monetary thresholds estab-
lished above, shall be reported to the Com-
mittees within 60 days of the end of each
quarter and shall include cumulative totals
for each budget activity, budget line item, or
construction, land acquisition, or forest leg-
acy project.
Land Acquisitions, Easements, and Forest
Legacy.—Lands shall not be acquired for
more than the approved appraised value (as
addressed in section 301(3) of Public Law 91–
646), unless such acquisitions are submitted
to the Committees on Appropriations for ap-
proval in compliance with these procedures.
Land Exchanges.—Land exchanges, wherein
the estimated value of the Federal lands to
be exchanged is greater than $1,000,000, shall
not be consummated until the Committees
have had a 30-day period in which to examine
the proposed exchange. In addition, the Com-
mittees shall be provided advance notifica-
tion of exchanges valued between $500,000
and $1,000,000.
Budget Structure.—The budget activity or
line item structure for any agency appro-
priation account shall not be altered without
advance approval of the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations.
TITLE I—DEPARTMENT OF THE
INTERIOR
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT
MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND RESOURCES
Bureau of Land Management Directives.—
The Bureau is reminded of the importance of
the directives included in House Report 115–
765 and Senate Report 115–276 not addressed
herein, as well as the new directives in this
explanatory statement, including the front
matter. The Conferees support the innova-
tive use of technology to improve the timeli-
ness and accuracy of permitting decisions
and direct the Bureau to provide a report
within 90 days of enactment as directed by
House Report 115–765. The Conferees reit-
erate the direction related to Chaco Canyon
included in Senate Report 115–276.
Management of Lands and Resources
(MLR).—The agreement provides
$1,198,000,000 for MLR. Within this amount,
the Colorado Basin Salinity Control Pro-
gram is funded at $2,000,000. Unless noted
herein, the Conferees do not accept the pro-
posed funding decreases; specific funding al-
location information is located at the end of
this explanatory statement.
MLR Budget Restructuring.—The Conferees
accept the Bureau’s request to restructure
several budget line items to increase effi-
ciency in the delivery of programs. In fiscal
year 2019, Soil, Water and Air Management
moves into Rangeland Management. Ripar-
ian Management moves into Wildlife and
Aquatic Habitat Management. Within the
new Wildlife and Aquatic Management budg-
et line item, the Conferees maintain specific
funding for Threatened and Endangered Spe-
cies to ensure transparency of funding for
these activities and expect these changes
will improve the Bureau’s ability to report
expenditures and performance as required by
the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Con-
ferees also accept the proposal to consolidate
Hazardous Materials and Abandoned Mine
Lands.
Budget Restructuring Report Requirement.—
The Conferees expect restructuring will im-
prove program delivery and provide better
on-the-ground results for Bureau-managed
lands and direct the Bureau to provide a re-
port with evidence of this improvement
within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
Wild Horse and Burro Management.—The
agreement provides $80,555,000 for wild horse
and burro management. The Conferees fully
recognize the financial and political chal-
lenges of controlling wild horse and burro
populations and note that significant man-
agement changes need to be made within the
near future in order to control costs, im-
prove range conditions, and humanely man-
age wild horse and burro populations. As
such, the Conferees reiterate their apprecia-
tion for the Bureau’s April 26, 2018, report ti-
tled ‘‘Management Options for a Sustainable
Wild Horse and Burro Program’’ but believe
additional analysis is needed as directed by
House Report 115–765. This analysis should be
provided to Congress no later than 180 days
after enactment of this Act. The Bureau is
expected to continue evaluating its internal
policies, procedures, and regulations to re-
duce costs and administrative burdens, as
well as researching and developing appro-
priate, humane protocols for fertility control
methods, including sterilization, and im-
prove its contracting for off-range holdings.
It is incumbent upon the Bureau to request
the funding necessary to address this grow-
ing problem; better management of this pro-
gram now will result in fewer dollars nec-
essary in the future to restore the lands that

wild horses, burros, and other wildlife depend
upon. Therefore, the Conferees expect that
the Bureau will include in its fiscal year 2020
budget request a proposal that outlines its
proposed strategy and the funding necessary
for implementation, including anticipated
out-year estimates. The Conferees continue
the current prohibitions on destruction and
sale authority contained in the bill.
LAND ACQUISITION
(INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
The bill provides $28,316,000 for Land Ac-
quisition and includes a rescission of
$1,800,000 from previously appropriated
Emergencies, Hardships, and Inholdings
funding. The amounts provided by this bill
for projects are shown in the table below,
listed in priority order pursuant to the
project list received for fiscal year 2019. The
Conferees understand that projects on that
list, such as the Upper Snake/South Fork
River Special Recreation Management Area,
meet the criteria for recreational access
funding and should receive full consideration
from the amounts included for recreational
access. Further instructions are contained
under the Land and Water Conservation
Fund heading in the front of this explana-
tory statement.

The agreement provides $106,985,000 for Or-
egon and California Grant Lands to be dis-
tributed as displayed in the funding alloca-
tion table at the end of this explanatory
statement.
RANGE IMPROVEMENTS
The agreement provides $10,000,000 to be
derived from public lands receipts and
Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act lands
grazing receipts.
SERVICE CHARGES, DEPOSITS, AND FORFEITURES
The agreement provides an indefinite ap-
propriation estimated to be $25,850,000 for
Service Charges, Deposits, and Forfeitures.
MISCELLANEOUS TRUST FUNDS
The agreement provides an indefinite ap-
propriation estimated to be $24,000,000 for
Miscellaneous Trust Funds.
UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
The bill provides $1,292,078,000 for Resource
Management. All programs, projects, and ac-
tivities are maintained at fiscal year 2018 en-
acted levels unless otherwise specified below
or in the table at the end of this explanatory
statement. For this and all other Service ac-
counts funded in this bill, the Service is ex-
pected to comply with the instructions and
requirements at the beginning of this divi-
sion and in House Report 115–765 and Senate
Report 115–276, unless otherwise specified
below. Additional details, instructions, and
requirements follow below and in the table
at the end of this division.
Planning and Consultation.—The agreement
includes $3,000,000 to avoid permitting delays
and to achieve compliance with other stat-
utes, which should be apportioned in accord-
ance with workload needs nationwide rather
than by region. In addition, $4,000,000 is pro-
vided for Gulf Coast Restoration activities to
ensure that the Service has the resources
necessary to avoid delays in projects related
to the Deepwater Horizon incident. This is
consistent with the amount provided in fis-
cal year 2018. Because the Conferees have
provided the Service with substantial re-
sources for Gulf Coast Restoration, they ex-
pect the Service to move forward with
project reviews in a timely manner.
Lesser Prairie Chicken.—The Conferees are
concerned that by listing the lesser prairie
chicken (LPC) under the ESA in spite of the
unprecedented level of voluntary conserva-
tion efforts in the habitat area, the Service
significantly reduced the incentive for stake-
holders to pursue future initiatives to pre-
serve the LPC and other species. The Con-
ferees note that if the listing of a species is
viewed as inevitable, stakeholders lose the
incentive to invest in private, voluntary con-
servation efforts. Therefore, the Conferees
direct the Service to collaborate with local
and regional stakeholders on improving vol-
untary solutions to conserve the species with
the goal of avoiding the necessity of listing
the LPC under the ESA.
Recovery.—The agreement includes: a
$2,000,000 general program increase; $1,000,000
to implement the Prescott Grant Program as
authorized by section 408(e) of the Marine
Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1421f–
1(e)); and $6,000,000 for Recovery Challenge
matching grants to enhance and increase
partnerships with agencies and organizations
implementing highest priority recovery ac-
tions as prescribed in recovery plans, and in
particular for genetically-sound breeding,
rearing, and reintroduction programs. Long-
standing partnerships, including for the
northern aplomado falcon, California condor,
and Steller’s eider, should be funded at not
less than $2,500,000, and partner contribu-
tions should be not less than their current
amounts. The remaining funds should be
dedicated to new partnerships and should re-
quire a 50:50 match, which may include in-
kind services. Unless an affected State is a
partner on the project, none of the funds
may be awarded to a project until the
project partners have consulted with such
State. The Service is expected to explore en-
tering into an agreement with the National
Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) for the
purpose of administering the program and
leveraging the funds with corporate and non-
profit contributions, in full consultation
with the Service, and to brief the Committee
within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
None of the funds may be used for indirect
costs.
Five-Year Reviews.—The Service is directed
to complete all five-year reviews within the
period required by law, and, for any deter-
mination on the basis of such review whether
a species should be delisted, downlisted, or
uplisted, promulgate an associated regula-
tion and complete the rulemaking process
prior to initiating the next status review for
such species.
Gray Wolf.—The Conferees recognize the
Service’s recent commitment to work close-
ly with Federal, State, Tribal and local part-
ners to assess the currently listed gray wolf
entities in the Lower 48 States using the best
available scientific information, and if ap-
propriate, publish a proposal to revise the
wolf’s status in the Federal Register by the
end of the calendar year.
Grizzly Bear.—The Conferees direct the
Service to work with ranchers, conservation
groups, local governments, and other local
partners to reduce conflicts between grizzly
bears and livestock. These efforts should
draw upon lessons learned with the Wolf
Livestock Loss Demonstration Program to
improve conservation outcomes while lim-
iting effects to agricultural producers. Not
less than 30 days after the date of enactment
of this Act, and for a duration of not less
than 90 days, the Service and the National
Park Service are directed to re-open the pub-
lic comment period regarding the draft envi-
ronmental impact statement with proposed
alternatives for the restoration of grizzly
bears to the North Cascades Ecosystem. Any
member of the public in attendance at any of
the associated public forums and wishing to
voice their opinion must be afforded the op-
portunity to do so.
Preble’s Meadow Jumping Mouse.—The Serv-
ice is urged to address consultations and per-
mitting of public and private projects re-
lated to the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse
as one of the highest priorities.
Marbled Murrelet.—The Conferees are con-
cerned that the draft Long Term Conserva-
tion Strategy for the marbled murrelet is fo-
cused primarily on inland nesting habitat
when more than 90 percent of the life cycle
of this species is spent in the marine envi-
ronment. The Conferees also recognize that
while the relationship between nesting habi-
tat and marbled murrelet abundance is well
documented, there is comparatively little
known about factors linked to the marine
environment, including environmental con-
ditions, prey availability and bycatch mor-
tality, that may be contributing to recent
population declines in Washington, Oregon,
and California. Therefore, the Conferees urge
the Service to partner with the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to
pursue additional studies to determine the
full range of factors linked to the marine en-
vironment that may affect marbled murrelet
populations and to develop a comprehensive
set of recommendations to address those fac-
tors. In addition, the Service is directed to
work collaboratively with local commu-
nities, elected officials, and other stake-
holders in the development of the final Long
Term Conservation Strategy for the marbled
murrelet.
National Wildlife Refuge System.—The agree-
ment includes a general program increase of
$1,000,000 for Wildlife and Habitat Manage-
ment, and the Conferees encourage the Serv-
ice to prioritize invasive species eradication
activities. The subsistence program is con-
tinued at $2,835,000. In addition, $55,000,000 is
provided for Refuge Maintenance Support.
Refuge Law Enforcement.—Adequate refuge
law enforcement is critical to protect our
natural resources, staff, and more than 53
million visitors at refuges. The Service
should request adequate funding so no refuge
is without law enforcement at any time.
Trapping on Refuges.—The Service website
includes information on trapping on refuges
at https://www.fws.gov/refuges/visitors/trap-
ping.html and has instituted signage at
those refuges. Trapping information for indi-
vidual refuges can be found on their web
pages under Resource Management.
Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.—
The Service is expected to follow the direc-
tive from fiscal year 2018 that prohibits a
caribou hunt on Kagalaska Island and efforts
to remove cattle on Chirikof and
Wosnesenski Islands in the State of Alaska.
Urban Wildlife Refuges.—Funding has been
provided to continue the Urban Wildlife Ref-
uge Partnership program at the fiscal year

promote conservation in urban areas.
Green River National Wildlife Refuge.—The
Service is reminded of the direction included
in Senate Report 115–276 to establish the
Green River National Wildlife Refuge.
Rio Mora National Wildlife Refuge.—The
Conferees expect the Service to continue to
support staffing and educational program-
ming at Rio Mora National Wildlife Refuge
and to continue dialogue with nonprofit and
Tribal partners on the Service’s plan for
long-term operations of the refuge. The Serv-
ice shall brief the Committees within 60 days
of enactment of this Act on the status of the
operations plan.
Migratory Bird Management.—The agree-
ment provides $3,237,000 as requested for
aviation management, which is transferred
to the General Operations activity to more
accurately reflect the program’s responsibil-
ities across the Service.
Law Enforcement.—The agreement includes
$2,000,000 for combating violations of the In-
dian Arts and Crafts Act, and the Service is
directed to brief the Committees within 60
days of enactment of this Act on the pro-
posed distribution of the funds.
International Affairs.—The agreement pro-
vides $15,816,000 for International Affairs
with the expectation that the Service will
spend above the fiscal year 2018 enacted
funding level for Wildlife Trafficking. Arctic
Council Support is continued at $550,000.
National Fish Hatchery System Operations.—
The agreement provides $4,000,000 for Klam-
ath Basin Restoration Agreement activities,
of which at least $3,500,000 is to support
rearing and population monitoring, and of
which $3,000,000 is transferred from Habitat
Assessment and Restoration. None of the
funds may be used to terminate operations
or to close any facility of the National Fish
Hatchery System. None of the production
programs listed in the March 2013 National
Fish Hatchery System Strategic Hatchery
and Workforce Planning Report may be re-
duced or terminated without advance, infor-
mal consultation with affected States and
Tribes.
Aquatic Habitat and Species Conservation.—
The agreement includes $6,000,000 to imple-
ment the Delaware River Basin Conservation
Act, $9,554,000 for the subsistence program,
and $500,000 for the Lake Champlain sea lam-
prey program.
Asian Carp.—The Conferees recognize the
importance of the work conducted by the
Service to combat the serious threat of
Asian carp and provide $11,000,000 for Asian
carp activities, of which $2,000,000 is for con-
tract fishing and deterrents to extirpate
Asian carp, including grass carp. Funding
should be used to control Asian carp in the
Mississippi and Ohio River Basins, including
in Kentucky Lake, Lake Barkley, Tennessee
river systems, and the Ohio River, and to
prevent Asian carp from entering and estab-
lishing in the Great Lakes. The Service
should consider the utility of creating a
dedicated funding source to increase the in-
tensity and geographic scope of efforts to
prevent entry into the Great Lakes.
Cooperative Landscape Conservation.—The
agreement provides $12,500,000 for Coopera-
tive Landscape Conservation to support part-
nerships of Federal, State, Tribal, and other
organizations to develop shared conservation
priorities as outlined in the congressional
budget justifications provided to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations. Any deviation
from that justification must be transparent
and officially presented to the Committees
on Appropriations, and there must be oppor-
tunities for public review and comment be-
fore any changes are instituted. Funding for
Gulf Coast Restoration is continued at
$1,000,000.
General Operations.—The agreement in-
cludes $5,516,000 for annual maintenance
needs of the National Conservation Training
Center (NCTC).
CONSTRUCTION
(INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
The bill provides $55,613,000 for Construc-
tion, including $39,873,000 for the backlog of
deferred maintenance principally at national
fish hatcheries and national wildlife refuges,
and rescinds $1,500,000 from prior year unob-
ligated balances, of which $300,000 was made
available by Public Law 111–8. The Service is
directed to provide a spend plan to the Com-
mittees within 120 days of enactment of this
Act for the deferred maintenance funding.
The detailed allocation of funding by activ-
ity is included in the table at the end of this
explanatory statement. For line-item con-
struction, the Service is expected to follow
the project priority list in the table below.
When a construction project is completed or
terminated and appropriated funds remain,
the Service may use those balances to re-
spond to unforeseen reconstruction, replace-
ment, or repair of facilities or equipment
damaged or destroyed by storms, floods,
fires, and similar unanticipated events.

couraged by programs that leverage public/
private partnerships for land conservation
like the Highlands Conservation Act, which
has a record of more than a 2 to 1 ratio in
non-Federal matching funds. Therefore, the
Conferees include $20,000,000 for the High-
lands Conservation Act Grants and direct
the Service to work with the Highlands
States regarding priority projects for fiscal

The bill provides $2,502,711,000 for the Oper-
ation of the National Park System. All pro-
grams, projects, and activities are main-
tained at fiscal year 2018 levels, unless other-
wise specified below.
For this and all other Service accounts
funded in this bill, the Service is expected to
comply with the instructions and require-
ments at the beginning of this division and
in House Report 115–765 and Senate Report
115–276, unless otherwise specified below. The
Service is directed to submit to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations,
within 60 days of enactment of this Act, an
operating plan for the Operation of the Na-
tional Park System appropriation that in-
cludes any necessary adjustments to the
amounts provided to maintain park oper-
ations of all units budgeted in the fiscal year
2019 request. Such plan shall be subject to
the reprogramming guidelines contained in
this explanatory statement. Additional de-
tails, instructions, and requirements follow

tion; $1,500,000 to continue landscape restora-
tion at newly authorized national parks, as
provided by Public Law 114–113; and a total
of $800,000 to continue cave and karst eco-
system research.
Visitor Services.—The agreement rejects all
of the reductions proposed in the budget re-
quest. The Service is reminded of the direc-
tive in House Report 115–765 with regard to
maintaining fiscal year 2018 funding levels.
Park Protection.—The agreement does not
include a one-time increase provided in fiscal
year 2018 for the replacement of Park Police
aircraft. Annual funding related to new air-
craft is provided under Park Support and in-
cludes a program increase of $1,200,000 to re-
turn the Service to a standard aircraft re-
placement cycle.
Facility Operations and Maintenance.—The
agreement includes $135,980,000 for repair and
rehabilitation projects and $151,575,000 for
cyclic maintenance.
Park Support.—The agreement includes
$10,535,000 of increases requested in the budg-
et addendum, including: $6,225,000 for addi-
tional park rangers; $830,000 for increased
law enforcement training costs; $1,200,000 for
the U.S. Park Police helicopter replacement;
$1,300,000 for public health officers; $150,000
for unmanned aircraft services expertise;
$400,000 for Katahdin Woods and Waters;
$965,000 for new parks such as Ste. Genevieve,
Birmingham Civil Rights, and Freedom Rid-
ers; and $400,000 for Captain John Smith Na-
tional Heritage Trail to manage the new
land acquisition of Werowocomoco. The
agreement also includes $500,000 for the
Semiquincentennial Commission to be ex-
pended in accordance with the United States
Semiquincentennial Commission Act of 2016.
Funding for the Roosevelt-Campobello Inter-
national Park is maintained at the fiscal
year 2018 level. Funding requested for the
agency’s reorganization efforts is provided
subject to the guidance included at the front
of this explanatory statement.
The Conferees note there are concerns re-
garding the Service’s current inventory of
hand-held equipment supporting global posi-
tioning systems. These systems are at end-
of-life and have operating systems that are
no longer supported by the developer. The
Service is directed to brief the Committees
on these issues within 90 days of enactment
of this Act.
External Administrative Costs.—The agree-
ment includes $184,925,000 for external ad-
ministrative costs, including required fixed
costs.
Quagga and Zebra Mussel Control.—The
Conferees remain concerned about the spread
of quagga and zebra mussels in the West and
have provided $3,000,000 for continued con-
tainment, prevention, and enforcement ef-
forts, equal to the fiscal year 2018 enacted
level.
Blackstone River Valley National Historical
Park.—The agreement includes requested
funding for the Blackstone River Valley Na-
tional Historical Park with the expectation
that the Service will continue to make funds
available to the local coordinating entity to
maintain staffing and capacity to assist in
management of the park as authorized in
Public Law 113–291.
Captain John Smith National Historic Trail.—
The Conferees strongly disagree with the
Service’s decision to proceed with manage-
ment changes that affect the Service’s
Chesapeake Bay Office, the Captain John
Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail,
and the Werowocomoco site despite congres-
sional concerns. The Service is directed to
produce the report required by Senate Re-
port 115–276 that details the Service’s legal
authorities to make the change and the steps
it plans to take to ensure that the manage-
ment changes do not weaken the Service’s
commitment to Chesapeake Bay Program
partnerships.
Denali National Park Road.—The Conferees
are particularly concerned about the condi-
tion of the Denali National Park road and di-
rect the Service to follow the guidance con-
tained in Senate Report 115–276 concerning
the road.
Everglades Restoration.—The Conferees note
the progress made toward restoration of the
Everglades ecosystem and continue to sup-
port this multi-year effort to preserve one of
the great ecological treasures of the United
States.
Oklahoma City National Memorial & Mu-
seum.—The Conferees acknowledge the Serv-
ice’s submission of the report required by the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 con-
cerning Federal funds allocated for the Okla-
homa City Memorial. The Service should
continue to work with all interested stake-
holders to determine options for providing
the fully authorized level of $5,000,000 for the
memorial.
Point Reyes National Seashore.—The Con-
ferees note that multi-generational ranching
and dairying is important both ecologically
and economically for the Point Reyes Na-
tional Seashore and the surrounding commu-
nity. These historic activities are also fully
consistent with Congress’s intent for the
management of Point Reyes National Sea-
shore. The Conferees are aware that the
Service is conducting a public process to
comply with a multi-party settlement agree-
ment that includes the preparation of an en-
vironmental impact statement to study the
effects of dairying and ranching on the park.
The Conferees strongly support the inclusion
of alternatives that continue ranching and
dairying, including the Service’s Initial Pro-
posal to allow existing ranch families to con-
tinue ranching and dairying operations
under agricultural lease/permits with 20–year
terms, and expect the Service to make every
effort to finalize a General Management
Plan Amendment that continues these his-
toric activities.
Trestles Historic District.—The Conferees
recognize that Trestles Beach plays a vital
role in the training and readiness of the
United States Marine Corps and note that
amendments to the National Historic Preser-
vation Act included in National Park Service
Centennial Act (P.L. 114–289) modified the
nomination and approval process for the list-
ing of Federal properties on the National
Register of Historic Places. The Conferees
also note the Department has taken the posi-
tion that it does not have jurisdiction to
hear an appeal alleging a failure of the De-
partment of the Navy to nominate the Tres-
tles Historic District to the National Reg-
ister and do not expect the Department to
take any further action on this issue.
NATIONAL RECREATION AND PRESERVATION
The bill provides $64,138,000 for national
recreation and preservation programs and in-
cludes the following additional instructions.
Heritage Partnership Program.—The agree-
ment includes $20,321,000 for the Heritage
Partnership Program. The Conferees con-
tinue to encourage individual heritage areas
to develop plans for long-term sufficiency.
The Conferees commend the Alliance of Na-
tional Heritage Areas, in response to con-
gressional direction, for developing an allo-
cation model that maintains core services of
more established areas while proposing addi-
tional resources to newer areas. The Con-
ferees note this progress and direct the Serv-
ice to work with heritage areas to further
develop consensus toward a sustainable fund-
ing distribution. As this effort continues, the
Conferees expect the Service to distribute
funds in the same manner as fiscal year 2017
with the increase above the enacted level to
be equally distributed to Tier I areas or Tier
2 areas currently receiving the minimum
funding levels of $150,000 and $300,000 respec-
tively.
Natural Programs.—The Conferees maintain
funding for Natural Programs, including the
Chesapeake Gateways and Trails program
and Rivers, Trails, and Conservation, at the
fiscal year 2018 enacted level.
Cultural Programs.—The agreement in-
cludes $25,562,000 for cultural programs, an
increase of $500,000 above the enacted level.
The increase above the enacted level is pro-
vided pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 4451(b) for grants
to nonprofit organizations or institutions for
the purpose of supporting programs for Na-
tive Hawaiian or Alaska Native culture and
arts development at a total program level of
$1,000,000 to be utilized consistent with the
direction outlined in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying Public Law 115–141. This
program is a good example of a multi-state,
multi-organizational collaboration as envi-
sioned under the American Indian, Alaska
Native, and Native Hawaiian Culture and Art
Development Act. Other cultural programs,
including grants to preserve and interpret
Japanese American Confinement Sites, are
continued at their fiscal year 2018 levels.
Grants Administration.—The agreement does
not include the proposed transfer of grants
administration to cultural programs as pro-
posed in the request.
Native American Graves Protection and Repa-
triation Grants.—The agreement supports the
Native American Graves Protection and Re-
patriation Grant Program and maintains
funding at the fiscal year 2018 enacted level.
American Battlefield Protection Program As-
sistance Grants.—Funding is provided at the
fiscal year 2018 enacted level. The Conferees
recognize the importance of public-private
partnerships to maintain the preservation of
America’s battlefields and urge the Service
to give priority to projects with broad part-
ner support. The Conferees continue to en-
courage the timely review and processing of
grants.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION FUND
The bill provides $102,660,000 for the His-
toric Preservation Fund. Within this
amount, $49,675,000 is provided for grants to
States and $11,735,000 is provided for grants
to Tribes. The bill also includes $15,250,000
for competitive grants, of which $750,000 is
for grants to underserved communities and
$14,500,000 is for competitive grants to docu-
ment, interpret, and preserve historical sites
associated with the Civil Rights Movement.
The agreement also includes $8,000,000 for
competitive grants to Historically Black
Colleges and Universities and $13,000,000 for
the Save America’s Treasures competitive
grant program for the preservation of na-
tionally significant sites, structures, and ar-
tifacts.
The agreement continues $5,000,000 for
preservation grants to revitalize historic
properties of national, State, and local sig-
nificance in order to restore, protect, and
foster economic development of rural vil-
lages and downtown areas. Grants shall be
made available to States, local governments,
Tribes, or community or statewide non-prof-
it organizations for the purpose of making
sub-grants to eligible projects. Priority shall
be given to applicants with a demonstrated
capacity for allocating similar awards for
preservation of such sites. To ensure that
limited funds are targeted in the most effec-
tive manner, the Conferees recommend that
the Service give priority to applicants that
cap their administrative costs at no more
than five percent. The Service shall confer
with the House and Senate Committees on

CONSTRUCTION
The bill provides $364,704,000 for Construc-
tion and includes a general program increase
of $127,151,000 above the request to address
longstanding deferred maintenance and
major construction related requirements of
the Service. The Service is directed to pro-
vide, no later than 60 days after enactment
of this Act, an operating plan for the alloca-
tion of funds, including Line Item Construc-
tion projects. Requests for reprogramming
will be considered pursuant to the guidelines
included at the beginning of this explanatory
statement. No funds are provided for project
number 16, entitled ‘‘Rehabilitate Historic
Main Parade Ground Barracks’’ at the Fort
Vancouver National Historic Site. The Con-
ferees have become aware that the proposed
project is intended as part of a future plan to
relocate the Service’s Pacific West Regional
Office from its current location in Cali-
fornia. However, the budget request does not
indicate any such plans, and the Department
subsequently implemented new regional
boundaries for the Service as of August, 2018.
Therefore, it is premature to fund this
project during fiscal year 2019. The Conferees
further note with concern that the Service
decided to move the current regional office
without first consulting stakeholders and
Congress. The Service is reminded that
major organizational proposals like this
should be disclosed as part of the annual
budget proposal so that Congress and the
public have opportunity to vet them.
Gustavus Intertie, Glacier NP.—The Con-
ferees direct the Service to consult regularly
with the City of Gustavus as it issues the
RFP, prospectus, and design/build contracts
for the intertie at Glacier Bay National
Park.
LAND ACQUISITION AND STATE ASSISTANCE
The bill provides $168,444,000 for Land Ac-
quisition and State Assistance. The amounts

CENTENNIAL CHALLENGE
The bill provides $20,000,000 for the Centen-
nial Challenge matching grant program. The
program provides dedicated Federal funding
to leverage partnerships for signature
projects and programs for the national park
system. The Conferees expect these funds to
be used by the Service to address projects
that have a deferred maintenance component
in order to alleviate the sizeable deferred
maintenance backlog within the national
park system. A one-to-one match is required
for projects to qualify for these funds. The
Service is urged to give preference to
projects that demonstrate additional
leveraging capacity from its partners. From
amounts in the Centennial Challenge ac-
count, the Conferees encourage the Depart-
ment to make $5,000,000 available for critical
programs and projects, pursuant to 54 U.S.C.
1011 Subchapter II, subject to terms and con-
ditions outlined in Title VI of Public Law
114–289. The Conferees note that amounts ap-
propriated for the Centennial Challenge are
now supplemented by additional mandatory
revenues from sales of Federal Recreational
Lands Senior Passes, as authorized by the
National Park Service Centennial Act (P.L.
114–289).
UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SURVEYS, INVESTIGATIONS, AND RESEARCH
The bill provides $1,160,596,000 for Surveys,
Investigations, and Research of the U.S. Geo-
logical Survey (USGS, or the Survey). The
detailed allocation of funding by program
area and activity is included in the table at
the end of this explanatory statement. The
Survey is reminded of the guidance and re-
porting requirements contained in House Re-
port 115–765 and Senate Report 115–276 that
should be complied with unless specifically
addressed to the contrary herein, as ex-
plained in the front matter of this explana-
tory statement.
Ecosystems.—The agreement provides
$156,882,000, including a $2,000,000 reduction
for land and water management research ac-
tivities within the status and trends and
fisheries program subactivities. The Survey
provides critical scientific research and data
to land and water managers in priority land-
scapes such as the Arctic, Puget Sound, Cali-
fornia Bay Delta, Everglades, Great Lakes,
Columbia River, and the Chesapeake Bay,
and the Conferees expect this work to con-
tinue at the enacted levels. The agreement
includes $8,800,000 to maintain the current
funding level at the Great Lakes Science
Center.
The agreement maintains the Senate fund-
ing level and direction on white nose syn-
drome, as well as $300,000 for whooping crane
research and $200,000 for research on coral
disease.
The agreement includes $7,600,000 for Asian
carp, of which a total of $2,000,000 is for re-
search on containing and eradicating grass
carp.
The agreement provides a $1,000,000 in-
crease for Cooperative Research Unit (CRUs)
vacancies, including $250,000 for research as
directed in Senate Report 115–276.
The Conferees have included $500,000 for
the continued research transferred from
curation activities.
Land Resources.—The agreement provides
$158,299,000 for the Land Resources program.
Within these funds, Landsat 9 is fully funded
at $32,000,000 and the AmericaView State
grant program receives $1,215,000. The agree-
ment continues funding for the eight re-
gional science centers at the fiscal year 2018
enacted level.
Energy, Minerals, and Environmental
Health.—The agreement provides $111,736,000
for Energy, Minerals, and Environmental
Health, with $9,598,000 included for the new
critical mapping initiative, Three Dimen-
sional mapping, and Economic Empower-
ment Program. The Conferees include
$3,800,000 for the implementation of Secre-
tarial Order 3352 and encourage the Survey
to continue to work on the U.S. domestic
mineral base survey, which would be a com-
plementary tool for the new critical min-
erals initiative. The Survey is reminded to
follow the Senate direction on mapping in
the Arctic mineral belt.
The agreement includes $100,000 within
funds for Mineral Resources to develop a
map showing pyrrhotite occurrences across
the United States.
The agreement provides $12,598,000 for
toxic substances hydrology with increased
funding to understand cyanobacteria and

such reprogramming directives apply to pro-
posed reorganizations, workforce restruc-
ture, reshaping, transfer of functions, or
downsizing, especially those of significant
national or regional importance, and include
closures, consolidations, and relocations of
offices, facilities, and laboratories.
Further, the Agency may not use any
amount of de-obligated funds to initiate a
new program, office, or initiative, without
the prior approval of the Committees. Within
30 days of enactment of this Act, the Agency
is directed to submit to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations its annual
operating plan for fiscal year 2019, which
shall detail how the Agency plans to allocate
funds at the program project level.
Other.—It is noted that the current work-
force is below the prior year levels, there-
fore, the agreement includes rescissions in
the Science and Technology and Environ-
mental Programs and Management accounts
that capture expected savings associated
with such changes. The Agency is directed to
apply the rescissions to reflect efficiency
savings in a manner that seeks, to the extent
practicable, to be proportional among pro-
gram project areas. Amounts provided in
this Act are sufficient to fully fund Agency
payroll estimates, and the Conferees expect
the Agency’s fiscal year 2019 FTE target to
be no less than the fiscal year 2018 levels.
The Conferees understand that the Agency
routinely makes funding payroll require-
ments a top priority and expect the Agency
will continue to do so as it executes its fiscal
year 2019 appropriation and applies the re-
scissions.
The Conferees do not expect the Agency
will undertake adverse personnel actions or
incentive programs to comply with the re-
scissions, nor do the Conferees expect the
Agency will undertake large-scale adverse
personnel actions or incentive programs in
fiscal year 2019. As specified in the bill lan-
guage, the rescissions shall not apply to the
Geographic Programs, the National Estuary
Program, and the National Priorities fund-
ing in the Science and Technology and Envi-
ronmental Programs and Management ac-
counts. The Agency is directed to submit, as
part of the operating plan, details on the ap-
plication of such rescissions at the program
project level.

the EnergySTAR program for both appli-
ances and buildings at the fiscal year 2018 en-
acted level and do not recommend a shift to
fee-based funding, as proposed. The Con-
ferees are concerned that litigation over
non-compliance of voluntary EnergySTAR
efficiency standards, which can be the result
of a standard that has changed, may lead
some participants to avoid participating in
the program. The Conferees also are aware of
the need for products carrying the
EnergySTAR label to achieve the required
efficiency levels to best benefit consumers.
The Conferees direct the Agency to evaluate
how the Agency may balance these interests
to ensure that the EnergySTAR program is
both fair to voluntary participants and reli-
able for consumers and to report back to the
Conferees within 180 days of the enactment
of this Act. The Conferees also fund both
program areas related to stratospheric ozone
at not less than the fiscal year 2018 enacted
level.

why the Agency did not implement the rec-
ommendation, as well as identifying specific
actions the Agency is implementing to ad-
dress the concerns raised in the report.
Lead and Other Hazardous Materials.—The
Agency is directed to follow directives in-
cluded in Senate Report 115–276 regarding
standards for the identification of lead haz-
ards. In addition, within 180 days after enact-
ment, the Comptroller General of the United

ment (HUD) and EPA relating to the re-
moval of lead-based paint and other haz-
ardous materials. The report must include:
(1) a description of direct removal efforts by
HUD and EPA; (2) a description of education
provided by HUD and EPA to other Federal
agencies, local governments, communities,
recipients of grants made by either entity,
and the general public relating to the re-
moval of lead-based paint and other haz-
ardous materials; (3) a description of assist-
ance received from other Federal agencies

companying Public Law 115–141. The Con-
ferees reiterate that, since enactment in
1972, the Clean Water Act (CWA) has regu-
lated effects to navigable waters, while regu-
lation of groundwater has remained outside
of the Act’s jurisdiction. Instead, legislative
history surrounding the CWA indicates that
Congress intended for groundwater pollution
to be regulated through the CWA’s nonpoint
source program and other Federal and State
laws.
Small Refinery Relief.—The Conferees con-
tinue the directive contained in Senate Re-
port 114–281 related to small refinery relief.

nesses in the private sector have reduced
their vehicle fleet costs and improved air
quality by participating in programs that
offer certifications for idle reduction and
fuel efficient driving programs. The Agency
is directed to conduct a cross-agency anal-
ysis to determine which branches of govern-
ment could achieve savings and improve air
quality by engaging in external programs,
including university extension programs
that offer this training.

emission reduction activities deemed nec-
essary for compliance with national ambient
air quality standards and included in a State
Implementation Plan submitted to EPA. Not
later than the end of fiscal year 2019, EPA
should provide a report to the Committees
that includes a table showing how fiscal year
2017 and 2018 funds were allocated. The table
also should include grant recipients and
metrics for anticipated or actual results.
Animas River Spill.—EPA is directed to fol-
low directives included in Senate Report 115–
276 related to the Animas River and the Gold
King Mine spill. In addition, the bill provides
$4,000,000 for fiscal year 2019 for long-term
water quality monitoring of the Animas
River.
Categorical Grants.—The bill provides
$1,077,041,000 for Categorical Grants. Funding
levels are specified in the table at the end of
this division. Within this amount, the Beach-
es Protection program and Radon program
are both maintained at the fiscal year 2018
enacted levels. The Agency shall continue to
allocate radon grants in fiscal year 2019 fol-
lowing the direction in House Report 114–632.
Categorical Grant: State and Local Air Qual-
ity Management.—The bill provides
$228,219,000. The Agency is directed to allo-
cate funding follow the guidance contained
in Senate Report 115–276.
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND
INNOVATION PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The bill provides a total of $68,000,000 for
the Water Infrastructure Finance and Inno-
vation Act (WIFIA) program. Within base
funding in Title II, the bill provides
$10,000,000 for the WIFIA program, and a
Title IV general provision provides an addi-
tional $58,000,000 for the program. By uti-
lizing $5,000,000 in base funds and $3,000,000 in
Title IV funds, the Agency may use up to a
total of $8,000,000 to assist with the adminis-
trative expenses for the program. The re-
maining $60,000,000 in WIFIA funds is pro-
vided to subsidize direct loans, which may
translate into a potential loan capacity
greater than $7,000,000,000 for eligible entities
for water infrastructure projects.
The Conferees encourage the Agency to
prioritize applications for WIFIA financing
for projects that address lead and emerging
contaminants, including PFOA and PFAS.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS—ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION AGENCY
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS AND RESCISSION OF
FUNDS)
The bill continues several administrative
provisions from previous years.
Rescission.—The bill rescinds $139,078,000 in
unobligated balances from the State and
Tribal Assistance Grants account. The Agen-
cy shall calculate the requisite percent re-
duction necessary to rescind such amounts
from new obligational authority provided to
this account, both from the direct appropria-
tion and from amounts provided in a general
provision in Title IV, and apply it across pro-
gram project areas by formula. The Agency
is directed to submit, as part of the oper-
ating plan, detail on the application of such
rescissions by program project area.
TITLE III—RELATED AGENCIES
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
FOREST SERVICE
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR
NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
The bill provides $875,000 for the Office of
the Under Secretary for Natural Resources
and Environment.
Forest Service Accounting, Budgeting, and
Management.—The Conferees appreciate the
Service’s efforts to improve its accounting,
budgeting, and management practices and
look forward to working with the Service,
Office of Budget and Program Analysis,
Under Secretary for Natural Resources and
Environment, and Secretary of Agriculture
to continue these improvements. The Con-
ferees are particularly interested in the
Service’s plan to transition away from Cost
Pools and remind the Service that a plan is
required within 180 days of enactment of P.L.
115–141.
Forest Service Directives.—The Forest Serv-
ice is reminded of the importance of the di-
rectives included in the explanatory state-
ment to accompany P.L. 115–141, House Re-
port 115–765, and Senate Report 115–276 that
are not specifically addressed herein, as well
as the new directives in this statement, in-
cluding the front matter.
Wildland Fire Management.—The Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115–141)
provided a budget cap adjustment for wild-
fire suppression costs and included forest
management reforms. The Conferees remind
the Service and the Secretary of Agriculture
of the multi-year effort to achieve these
budget and legislative changes and expect
that all authorities will be appropriately
used to improve the condition of the Na-
tion’s forests, as well as the ability of the
Service to proactively manage and sustain
them for future generations. The Conferees
also remind the Service of their expectations
for more accurate accounting for wildfire
suppression costs, especially in light of the
availability of the cap adjustment in fiscal
year 2020. The Conferees are hopeful that the
Secretary’s Shared Stewardship initiative
will result in better forest management,
healthier forests, and an increase in the
number of fire-adapted communities.
Report on Partnerships.—Within 180 days of
enactment of this Act, the Conferees request
a detailed report on the funding the Service
has provided to the National Forest Founda-
tion and National Fish and Wildlife Founda-
tion for each of the past 10 fiscal years. The
report also should include information on
the specific projects and activities, other
partners involved, and the Foundations’ ad-
ministrative operations that were supported
by these funds.
Conservation Finance.—The Conferees en-
courage the Service to continue conserva-
tion finance efforts to leverage non-Federal
investments in outcome-focused projects,
promote collaboration with public and pri-
vate sector partners, and utilize new tools to
accelerate the pace and scale of forest man-
agement activities.
Reprogramming.—The Conferees remind the
Service to follow the letter and spirit of the
reprogramming requirements in this explan-
atory statement and direct the Service to
submit requests through the Office of Budget
and Program Analysis.
FOREST AND RANGELAND RESEARCH
The agreement provides $300,000,000 for
Forest and Rangeland Research. This in-
cludes $223,000,000 for base research activities
and $77,000,000 for Forest Inventory and
Analysis. The Service is directed to provide
$3,000,000 to the Joint Fire Science Program
for fiscal year 2019.
The Conferees note the interest of Mem-
bers of Congress, States, forestry and re-
search associations, industry, and research-
ers in the Service’s various research pro-
grams, projects, and activities. The Con-
ferees believe Congress should broadly define
the highest priority research goals, and that
the Service should formulate the specific
programs, projects, and activities to achieve
them. The Conferees expect the Service to
complete the review and restructuring of the
research program, as directed by House Re-
port 115–765 and Senate Report 115–276, prior
to the end of the second quarter of fiscal
year 2019. The Conferees look forward to re-
viewing the Service’s plan for strengthening
its research program and note that they will
adjust the directions regarding forestry re-
search as needed in the future.
The Conferees direct the Service to
prioritize data collection and analysis on
U.S. forests; research to support land af-
fected by wildland fire; post-fire analysis; re-
search to support the National Forest Sys-
tem; and research related to forest products
for fiscal year 2019.
The Service is directed to provide informa-
tion to the Committees regarding the mis-
sion of the Southern Research Station Pine-
ville Research Facility and the viability of
continued wood utilization research at that
site within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
The Service is directed to provide a report
regarding its current and planned research
on issues and risks related to firefighter
health and safety in wildlands and wildland
urban interface within 90 days of enactment
of this Act. The report should include de-
tailed budget information and identify gaps
in knowledge and potential remedies to ad-
dress them.
STATE AND PRIVATE FORESTRY
(INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $335,487,000 for
State and Private Forestry.
Cooperative Forestry Activities.—The Con-
ferees direct the Service to continue focus on
spruce beetle, Emerald Ash Borer, and bark
beetle infestations, which affect forests
throughout the Nation.
The Service is expected to follow the Sen-
ate direction on wood energy technical as-
sistance, herein.
Forest Legacy.—The bill provides $63,990,000
for the Forest Legacy program. This includes
$6,400,000 for program administration and
$57,590,000 for projects. The Service should
fund projects in priority order according to
the updated, competitively selected national
priority list submitted to the Committees
and the directive contained in Division G of
the explanatory statement accompanying
Public Law 115–141, the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2018. The Conferees include a
rescission of $1,503,000 in Forest Legacy
funds. This funding rescission is from cost
savings of some projects and funds returned
from failed or partially failed projects.
The Conferees are concerned with the Serv-
ice’s ability to provide timely information
on project status and available balances and
expect the Service to be able to provide this
information expeditiously moving forward.
Ensuring project recordkeeping is accurate
must be a top priority in fiscal year 2019.
NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM
The agreement provides $1,938,000,000 for
the National Forest System.
Hazardous Fuels.—The agreement provides
$435,000,000 for hazardous fuels management
activities within the National Forest System
account. Included in this amount is $3,000,000
for the Southwest Ecological Restoration In-
stitutes.
Ouachita National Forest.—The Service is
directed to conduct an inventory and evalua-
tion of land generally depicted on the map
entitled ‘‘Flatside Wilderness Adjacent In-
ventory Area’’, dated November 30, 2017, to
determine the suitability of that land for in-
clusion in the National Wilderness Preserva-
tion System.
Gifford Pinchot National Forest.—In lieu of
the directive in House Report 115–765, the
Conferees encourage the Service and all in-
terested parties to work together regarding
the use of all-terrain vehicles in the forest.

Legacy Roads and Trails.—While these
projects are to be addressed as they rank in
priority along with other infrastructure
needs, the Service is directed to continue to
track Legacy Roads and Trails accomplish-
ments, including miles of roads and trails
improved, miles of streams restored, number
of bridges and culverts constructed, and
miles of road decommissioned.
Requested Reports.—The Conferees request a
report regarding options to improve parking
and access to the Cleveland National Forest
within 180 days of enactment of this Act. The
Service should consult with the State of
California, communities surrounding the for-
est, and private partners for their input and
recommendations. The Conferees also re-
quest a report on its efforts to address road
construction and maintenance issues in the
Uwharrie National Forest within 30 days of
enactment of this Act.
Comprehensive Capital Improvement Plan.—
The Service is reminded of the directive in-
cluded in the explanatory statement accom-
panying P.L. 115–141 that required the devel-
opment of a long-term, multi-year plan to
guide needed investments in buildings, facili-
ties, transportation systems, and other in-
frastructure by December 30, 2018. The Con-
ferees look forward to reviewing the plan and
expect the Service to utilize the plan in for-
mulating future budget requests. The annual
budget justification documents should detail
the amounts requested for new construction,
maintenance, decommissioning, and other
activities for the Facilities, Roads and Trails
programs.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN
SERVICES
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES
The bill provides a total of $5,804,223,000 for
the Indian Health Service (IHS), of which
$4,103,190,000 is for the Services account as
detailed below. All programs, projects, and
activities are maintained at fiscal year 2018
enacted levels unless otherwise specified
below. The Service is expected to comply
with the instructions and requirements at
the beginning of this division and in House
Report 115–765 and Senate Report 115–276, un-
less otherwise specified below. Additional de-
tails, instructions, and requirements follow
below and in the table at the end of this divi-
sion.
Staffing for New Facilities.—The agreement
includes $103,931,000 for staffing newly
opened health facilities, which is the full
amount based upon updated estimates pro-
vided to the Committees. Funds for the staff-
ing of new facilities are limited to facilities
funded through the Health Care Facilities
Construction Priority System or the Joint
Venture Construction Program that have
opened in fiscal year 2018 or will open in fis-
cal year 2019. None of these funds may be al-
located to a facility until such facility has
achieved beneficial occupancy status.
Hospitals and Health Clinics.—The agree-
ment provides $2,147,343,000 for hospitals and
health clinics, and includes $36,000,000 for op-
erations and maintenance of village built
and tribally leased clinics, and $4,000,000 for
domestic violence prevention. The Conferees
are aware of ongoing litigation between the
Cherokee Nation and the United Keetoowah
Band of Cherokee Indians. The Conferees are
neutral on this matter and have provided the
request of $1,969,000 for new Tribes. The agen-
cy is expected to consult with both parties
before disbursing funds.
Dental Health.—The agreement provides
$204,672,000 for dental health and includes the
requested transfer of $800,000 from direct op-
erations. The Service is directed to backfill
vacant dental health positions in head-
quarters.
Mental Health.—The agreement provides
$105,281,000 for mental health programs and
includes $6,946,000 to continue behavioral
health integration and $3,600,000 to continue
the suicide prevention initiative.
Alcohol and Substance Abuse.—The agree-
ment provides $245,566,000 for alcohol and
substance abuse programs and includes:
$6,500,000 for the Generation Indigenous ini-
tiative; $1,800,000 for the youth pilot project;
and $2,000,000 to fund essential detoxification
and related services provided by the Serv-
ice’s public and private partners to IHS bene-
ficiaries. The Conferees expect the Service to
continue its partnership with the Na’
Nizhoozhi Center in Gallup, New Mexico, as
directed by the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2017, and to distribute funds provided
for detoxification services in the same man-
ner as in fiscal year 2017. The Conferees be-
lieve that Service and Tribally operated fa-
cility participation in state prescription
drug monitoring programs can help to com-
bat the abuse of drugs like opioids and direct
the agency to provide the report required by
Senate Report 115–276 on this issue.
Opioid Grants.—To better combat the
opioid epidemic, the Conferees have included
an increase of $10,000,000 and instruct the
Service, in coordination with the Assistant
Secretary for Mental Health and Substance
Use, to use the additional funds provided
above the fiscal year 2018 level to create a
Special Behavioral Health Pilot Program
modeled after the Special Diabetes Program
for Indians. This Special Behavioral Health
Pilot Program for Indians shall be developed
after appropriate Tribal consultation and
should support the development, documenta-
tion, and sharing of more locally-designed
and culturally appropriate prevention, treat-
ment, and aftercare services for mental
health and substance use disorders in Tribal
and urban Indian communities. The Director
of the Indian Health Service, in coordination

with the Assistant Secretary for Mental
Health and Substance Use, shall award
grants for providing services, and provide
technical assistance to grantees under this
section to collect and evaluate performance
of the program.
Purchased/Referred Care.—The Conferees
recognize the strong need for Purchased/Re-
ferred Care funding across Indian Country,
particularly in areas that lack Indian Health
Service facilities. The Conferees further rec-
ognize the Service’s continued pro rata allo-
cation of any increases provided for popu-
lation growth and inflation, regardless of
any population growth or cost-of-living dif-
ferences among areas, as documented by the
Government Accountability Office (GAO–12–
466). Consistent with GAO recommendations,
the Conferees encourage the Service to con-
sider allocating any future budget increases
using the allocation formula established in
consultation with the Tribes.
Urban Indian Health.—The agreement pro-
vides $51,315,000 for urban Indian health and
includes a $2,000,000 general program in-
crease. The Service is expected to continue
to include current services estimates for
urban Indian health in future budget re-
quests.
Indian Health Professions.—The agreement
provides $57,363,000 for Indian health profes-
sions and includes bill language allowing up
to $44,000,000 for the loan repayment pro-
gram. The agreement provides an increase of
$195,000 to expand the Indians into Medicine
program to four sites. Funding for the Quen-
tin N. Burdick American Indians into Nurs-
ing Program and the American Indians into
Psychology Program is continued at no less
than the fiscal year 2018 enacted levels.
Maternal and Child Health.—The Conferees
support the hiring of a national maternal/
child health coordinator as a top priority for
the Office of Clinical and Preventive Serv-
ices and await the report required in House
Report 115–765.
CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS
The bill continues language from fiscal
year 2018 establishing an indefinite appro-
priation for contract support costs estimated
to be $822,227,000, which is equal to the re-
quest. By retaining an indefinite appropria-
tion for this account, additional funds may
be provided by the agency if its budget esti-
mate proves to be lower than necessary to
meet the legal obligation to pay the full
amount due to Tribes. The Conferees believe
fully funding these costs will ensure Tribes
have the necessary resources they need to
deliver program services efficiently and ef-
fectively.
INDIAN HEALTH FACILITIES
The bill provides $878,806,000 for Indian
Health Facilities. All programs, projects,
and activities are maintained at fiscal year
2018 enacted levels unless otherwise specified
below.
Staffing for New Facilities.—The agreement
includes $11,302,000 for staffing newly opened
health facilities, which is the full amount
based upon updated estimates provided to
the Committees. The stipulations included
in the ‘‘Indian Health Services’’ account re-
garding the allocation of funds pertain to
this account as well.
Health Care Facilities.—The Conferees re-
main dedicated to providing access to health
care for IHS patients across the system. IHS
is expected to aggressively work down the
current Health Facilities Construction Pri-
ority System list. In addition, within 180
days of enactment of this Act, the Service is
directed to publish the gap analysis directed
by House Report 115–238 so that the Commit-
tees can more accurately determine facili-
ties needs across the IHS system.
Indian Health Care Improvement Act Dem-
onstration Authorities.—The Conferees direct
the Service to provide a report within 180
days of enactment of this Act identifying the
criteria the agency will use for ranking
projects funded through demonstration au-
thorities provided in the most recent reau-
thorization of the Indian Health Care Im-
provement Act should funds become avail-
able in future fiscal years. The Service is en-
couraged to consider as one factor the loca-
tion of existing or proposed facilities and the
distance that patients must travel to receive
the same or similar services.
Health Facilities Requirements in Alaska.—
The Service is directed to work with appro-
priate Tribal organizations and submit a re-
port to the Committees within 180 days of
this Act that includes an assessment of up-
dated facilities needs in the State of Alaska
as well as recommendations for alternative
financing options which could address the
need for additional health care facilities
space suitable to meet the current and fu-
ture health care needs of IHS beneficiaries in
the State.
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL
HEALTH SCIENCES
The agreement provides $79,000,000 for the
National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences. This includes an increase of
$1,500,000 for the Superfund Research Pro-
gram and $151,000 for the Worker Training
Program.
AGENCY FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND DISEASE
REGISTRY
TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL
PUBLIC HEALTH
The agreement provides $74,691,000 for the
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry.
The Conferees direct the Agency to focus
on its core mission of assessing hazardous
exposures and understand the Agency does
not consider the presence or absence of liti-
gation when evaluating the need for a public
health assessment. The Conferees encourage
the Agency to maintain professional and sci-
entific independence regarding its selection
of sites for assessment while following its
statutory mandate to work with commu-
nities.
Areas with High Incidence of Pediatric Can-
cer.—Within 180 days of enactment, ATSDR,
in consultation with other components of
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices (HHS), is directed to submit to the Sen-
ate Appropriations and Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions Committees and House
Appropriations and Energy and Commerce
Committees a report that provides details on
the geographic variation in pediatric cancer
incidence in the United States. Such report
must include: (1) the types of pediatric can-
cer within each of the 10 States with the
highest age-adjusted incidence rate of cancer
among persons less than 20 years old;
(2)geographic distribution of pediatric cancer
types within each such State, in accordance
with Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion guidelines; and (3) an update on current
activities related to pediatric cancer, includ-
ing with respect to carrying out section
399V–6 of the Public Health Service Act (42
U.S.C. 280g–17). In addition, HHS is encour-
aged to conduct public outreach, in collabo-
ration with State departments of health,
particularly in the 10 States with the highest
age-adjusted incidence rate of cancer among
persons aged less than 20 years old, to im-
prove awareness by residents, clinicians, and
others, as appropriate, of possible contrib-
uting factors to pediatric cancer, including
environmental exposures, in a manner that
is complementary of, and does not conflict
with, ongoing pediatric cancer-related ac-
tivities supported by HHS. Finally, the Sec-
retary of HHS is directed to ensure that all
information with respect to patients that is
contained in the reports under this section is
de-identified and protects personal privacy
of such patients in accordance with applica-
ble Federal and State privacy law.

mination of ONHIR when the President de-

H1934 February 13, 2019
DIVISION F—DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED
PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019
In implementing this conference agree-
ment, Federal departments, agencies, com-
missions, and other entities are directed to
comply with the directives, reporting re-
quirements, and instructions contained in H.
Rept. 115–829 (House report) accompanying
H.R. 6385 (House bill) and S. Rept. 115–282
(Senate report) accompanying S. 3108 (Sen-
ate bill) as though stated in this joint ex-
planatory statement, unless specifically di-
rected to the contrary.
This joint explanatory statement, while re-
peating some House and Senate report lan-
guage for emphasis or clarification, does not
negate language in such reports unless ex-
pressly provided herein. Language expressing
an opinion or making an observation in the
House or Senate reports represents the view
of the respective committee unless specifi-
cally endorsed in this joint explanatory
statement. In cases in which the House and
Senate reports provide contradictory direc-
tives or contradictory instructions that are
not addressed in this joint explanatory state-
ment, such directives or instructions are ne-
gated.
Reports required to be submitted pursuant
to the Act, including reports required by this
joint explanatory statement and the House
and Senate reports, may not be consolidated
to include responses to multiple require-
ments in a single report, except following
consultation with the Committees on Appro-
priations.
In lieu of the tables and allocations of
funding contained in the House and Senate
reports, the tables and such allocations con-
tained in this joint explanatory statement
shall guide departments, agencies, commis-
sions, and other entities when allocating
funds.
Section 7019 of the Act requires that
amounts designated in the respective tables
referenced in this joint explanatory state-
ment for funds appropriated in titles III
through V, including tables in title VII, shall
be made available in such designated
amounts, unless otherwise provided for in
the Act, and shall be the basis of the report
required by section 653(a) of the Foreign As-
sistance Act of 1961 (FAA) (the 653(a) report),
where applicable. The section also includes
limited authority to deviate from such speci-
fied amounts and continues language similar
to prior years including exceptions to the ap-
plication of the requirements of such section
for amounts designated in tables included in
this joint explanatory statement for Inter-
national Military Education and Training,
Global Health Programs, and Economic Sup-
port Fund/Global Programs, funds for which
the initial period of availability has expired,
amounts designated by the Act as minimum
funding requirements, and funds made avail-
able for a country pursuant to sections
7043(c), 7047(d), and 7071(b) of the Act.
Proposed deviations from tables in titles I
and II in this joint explanatory statement
are subject to the regular notification proce-
dures of the Committees on Appropriations,
unless an exception or deviation authority is
specifically provided herein.
For the purposes of this joint explanatory
statement, the term ‘‘prior Acts’’ means
prior Acts making appropriations for the De-
partment of State, foreign operations, and
related programs. In addition, any reference
to ‘‘division K of Public Law 115–141’’ means
the Department of State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs Appropria-
tions Act, 2018, and any reference to ‘‘divi-
sion J of Public Law 115–31’’ means the De-
partment of State, Foreign Operations, and
Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2017.
For purposes of the Act and joint explana-

able manner; (3) prioritize the participation
of local organizations in participating as im-
plementers and provide for the training and
mentoring of such organizations; and (4) co-
ordinate and ensure complementarity with
other bilateral and regional programs funded
by the Act and prior Acts, and with other de-
velopment and security programs conducted
by other Federal agencies and international
donors.
Prior to the obligation of funds made
available by the Act for such program, the
Secretary of State and USAID Administrator
shall jointly submit a report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations detailing: (1) the
states potentially eligible for the program;
(2) the requirements of the central govern-
ments for participation in the program and
program conditionality, if any; and (3)

Countering Violent Extremism in Asia.—
USAID’s Regional Development Mission for
Asia shall consult with the Committees on
Appropriations on the design and implemen-
tation of programs to counter violent extre-
mism in Asia, including within, and among,

Section 7072. United Nations Population Fund
(unchanged)
Section 7073. Reorganization and Information
Technology (modified)
Funds made available by the Act are pro-
vided in the amounts necessary for, and for
the purposes of, maintaining the on-board
Foreign Service and Civil Service staff levels
of the Department of State and USAID at
not less than the levels as of December 31,
2017. The conferees assume such levels reflect
minimum necessary hiring, and the Sec-
retary of State and USAID Administrator
are encouraged to work with the Committees
on Appropriations to increase hiring above
such levels, as appropriate. The explanatory
statement accompanying division K of Pub-
lic Law 115–141 contains a similar directive,
with which the Department of State and
USAID have not complied.
The conference agreement assumes suffi-
cient funding for introductory classes for the
Department of State Foreign Service (A–100
classes) at the pre-fiscal year 2017 rate, and
the Secretary of State shall continue such
classes in such manner. The Secretary is di-
rected to report to the appropriate congres-
sional committees not later than 45 days
after enactment of the Act on the schedule
for the A–100 classes.
Pursuant to subsection (a)(1), the notifica-
tion shall include: (1) a detailed description
of, and justification for, the proposed action,
including any policies or procedures cur-
rently or expected to be used to implement
Executive Order 13781; (2) the current organi-
zational chart, showing the operating units
of the respective department, agency or or-
ganization and a brief description of each op-
erating unit; the number of employees for
each operating unit; the proposed new orga-
nizational chart with descriptions of each
new operating unit; and the number of em-
ployees once the proposed reorganization is
complete; (3) an assessment of how the pro-
posed action will improve the efficiency, ef-
fectiveness, performance, and accountability
(including through modernizing information
technology platforms and streamlining ad-
ministrative functions) of the department,
agency, or organization; (4) an analysis of
the impact of any such change on the ability
to advance the national interest of the
United States through diplomacy and devel-
opment, and to conduct adequate monitoring
and oversight of foreign assistance programs,
and any legislative change necessary to im-
plement such proposals; (5) the estimated
cost, including for design, implementation,
facilities, and personnel for fiscal years 2019
and 2020; (6) the estimated timeline to com-
plete the proposed action; and (7) an assess-
ment of any cost savings and efficiencies
achieved through implementation of each
element of the proposed action.
The conferees direct the USAID Adminis-
trator to update, as appropriate and in writ-
ing, the Committees on Appropriations if im-
plementing the recommendations and con-
clusions of the Foreign Assistance Review
(FAR) would affect the information or pro-
posed changes in USAID ‘‘Reorg CNs #1–9’’.
In addition, not later than 60 days after
completion of the FAR, the Secretary of
State and USAID Administrator shall sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Appro-
priations detailing the anticipated impact of
the FAR on Department of State and USAID
programs and operations in future fiscal year
budget requests.
Pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(A), the report
shall include the following information on a
quarterly basis: (1) actual obligations to date
for all implementation costs associated with
‘‘Reorg CNs #1–9’’ by the categories detailed
in USAID’s response to the Committees on
Appropriations on October 30, 2018, to in-
clude the salaries and benefits of United
States Direct Hire employees working di-
rectly on implementation of each reorga-
nization and the source of such funding; (2) a
project status and projected timeline for
each of the reorganizations based on the
milestones and timelines provided to the
Committees on Appropriations on October
30, 2018; and (3) actual and anticipated
United States Direct Hire workforce level
changes by bureau and operating unit as a
result of the reorganizations, including staff-
ing shifts between functions.
Not later than 60 days after completion of
the zero-based budgeting and personnel staff-
ing exercise being conducted in support of
USAID’s transformation initiative, the
USAID Administrator shall submit to the
Committees on Appropriations a detailed re-
port that includes: (1) a summary of the op-
erating and personnel costs, including such
costs that are paid from program funds, of
each operating unit, overseas mission, or
overseas office prior to transformation; (2)
an estimate of such costs for each operating
unit, overseas mission, or overseas office
after transformation; and (3) a comparison of
the total operating cost of the Agency prior
to, and after, transformation detailed by
Overseas Missions costs, Washington Sup-
port costs, and Central Support costs, and
their subcategories.
The USAID Administrator shall regularly
consult with the appropriate congressional
committees and development stakeholders
on efforts to transition nations from assist-
ance recipients to enduring diplomatic, eco-
nomic, and security partners, which shall in-
clude any changes to the guiding principles
and metrics to support such efforts, and on
other matters related to the implementation
plan required by section 7069(b) of division K
of Public Law 115–141.
Not later than 180 days after enactment of
the Act, the Secretary of State and USAID
Administrator shall submit to the appro-
priate congressional committees an updated
implementation plan on country transitions
from assistance, as required by section
7069(b)(2) of division K of Public Law 115–141.
The waiver authority and notification re-
quirement of section 7015(e) of this Act shall
apply to the requirements of paragraph (1) of
this subsection.

ate has directed the submission of a report,

tions. The Department of Transportation
