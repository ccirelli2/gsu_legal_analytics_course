the purpose of debate only.
Mr. Speaker, I would just take a mo-
ment, if I may, to thank the gentleman
from Oklahoma, the distinguished Mr.
COLE. When I came to Washington, I
hoped to meet people who were profes-
sional, thoughtful, dedicated, not only
to this institution but to this country,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10310 December 17, 2019
There was no objection.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, on
Monday the Rules Committee met and
reported a rule, House Resolution 765,
providing for consideration of the Sen-
ate amendment to H.R. 1158, and the
Senate amendment to H.R. 1865, which
will fund the Federal Government
through the fiscal year 2020.
For each measure, the rule provides
for 1 hour of debate equally divided and
controlled by the chair and ranking
member of the Committee on Appro-
priations. The rule also self-executes a
manager’s amendment from Chair-
woman LOWEY to H.R. 1865.
The rule provides the chair of the Ap-
propriations Committee with the au-
thority to insert into the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD such material as she
may deem explanatory of both Senate
amendments not later than December
17, 2019.
Lastly, the rule adopts H. Res. 761, a
bipartisan resolution that permits indi-
viduals to be admitted to the Hall of
the House in order to obtain footage of
the House in session for inclusion in
the orientation film to be shown to
visitors at the Capitol Visitor Center.
Mr. Speaker, these two spending bills
provide funding for the entirety of gov-
ernment operations through the re-
mainder of fiscal year 2020.
I am proud that Members of Congress
from across the Nation have come to-
gether to reach this bipartisan con-
sensus, even in areas where we dis-
agree.
This deal provides certainty for mil-
lions of American families and busi-
nesses that are all fearful of a govern-
ment shutdown. It also represents a
tremendous investment in working
families, our economy, and our na-
tional security.
These bills provide protections for
our representative democracy with $425
million in support for election security
to the various States and $7.6 billion
for the approaching 2020 census.
These appropriations also invest in
our children’s future, with record fund-
ing for Head Start and Child Care &
Development Block Grants, as well as
strong investments in nutrition assist-
ance for children and those in need.
We are also investing billions of dol-
lars in renewable energy alternatives,
environmental protection, and con-
servation to work toward a healthier
planet for our children and our grand-
children.
We are providing a record level of in-
vestment in the health of every Amer-
ican, including more than $41 billion
for the National Institutes of Health.
And, for the first time in more than
20 years, we have provided research
funding to address a major threat to
public health: the gun violence epi-
demic. This package includes $25 mil-
lion for our public health experts at
the Centers for Disease Control and the
National Institutes of Health for fire-
arm injury and mortality prevention
research.
It also provides $1.5 billion in invest-
ment in State-level response to the
opioid epidemic.
These measures fund community
health centers through May 22 of next
year, ensuring they can continue their
vital work across the Nation while
Congress works toward a long-term ex-
tension.
In addition to all this, these bills also
include bipartisan measures to provide
additional mental health services, low-
income home energy assistance, in-
crease the age to buy tobacco to 21 na-
tionwide, increase competition in the
prescription drug market, and more.
As the representative for Rochester,
New York, I am grateful for Congress’
ongoing, strong bipartisan support of
$565 million for the Inertial Confine-
ment Fusion program, including at
least $80 million for the University of
Rochester’s Laboratory for Laser
Energetics, or LLE, which is located in
my district.
This funding will allow the LLE to
continue to cement its place as a
world-class institution and leader in
cutting-edge scientific research.
Mr. Speaker, with these successes in
mind, I am proud to speak in support of
this legislation, and I urge all of my
colleagues to join me in supporting its
passage.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank the gentleman from New York
(Mr. MORELLE) for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes. I also want to
thank him for his very generous re-
marks. The fact that he was noted for
his civility in New York, that is one of
the reasons he was a leader there, and
it is one of the reasons he is becoming
a leader here.
b 0915
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time
as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, we are here at the be-
ginning of what is likely to be a very
eventful week. We are considering two
items today as part of this rule, both of
which are bipartisan, full-year appro-
priations bills.
Today’s bipartisan appropriations
packages are the culmination of many
months of hard work by both parties
and in both Chambers. Though this was
a long road, I am pleased that the ne-
gotiations were ultimately successful. I
have often said that funding the gov-
ernment and keeping it open is one of
the most fundamental duties as Mem-
bers of Congress that we have.
Together, both packages cover full-
year funding for all 12 appropriations
bills. This is significant. By advancing
full-year appropriations, that means
we are not relying on another short-
term continuing resolution. While
funding with the CR is certainly better
than shutting down the government,
doing so also abdicates Congress’ abil-
ity to adjust spending and policies to
reflect the country’s changing needs
and priorities.
It is important to remember that, at
the end of July of this year, Congress
passed and President Trump signed
into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of
2019, which set budgetary levels for fis-
cal years 2020 and 2021. This bipartisan
and bicameral compromise was the re-
sult of a good faith negotiation be-
tween the President and the congres-
sional leadership of Speaker PELOSI,
Majority Leader MCCONNELL in the
Senate, Minority Leader KEVIN MCCAR-
THY in the House, and Minority Leader
Senator SCHUMER in the Senate.
That compromise achieved many
wins for the American people, includ-
ing a significant and desperately need-
ed increase to support and rebuild our
national defense.
Though the budget agreement was
enacted, the authorized spending could
not be realized without full-year appro-
priations. Fortunately, that is exactly
what we have here today. I want to
highlight a few key provisions, Mr.
Speaker.
The bills fulfill the top-line spending
numbers Congress agreed to in the
budget deal earlier this year.
H.R. 1158 provides an increase of $19.5
billion for our armed services over fis-
cal year 2019, which will allow us to
continue rebuilding America’s mili-
tary. The additional funds will enable
us to remedy our readiness crisis, allow
our servicemembers to secure the valu-
able training time they need, and give
those same brave servicemembers the
largest pay raise they have had in a
decade.
On the domestic side, the appropria-
tions package boosts the funding for
the National Institutes of Health by
$2.6 billion. This is the fifth straight
year of sustained increases for the NIH.
The increased funding places the
United States as the unquestioned
global leader in biomedical research,
which will lead to continued efforts to
cure diseases like Alzheimer’s and can-
cer.
The bill also includes a significant
increase for the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, America’s
frontline defense against pandemics,
HIV/AIDS, Ebola, and other deadly dis-
eases.
The bill includes substantial in-
creases for various federally funded
education programs like IDEA, title I,
Impact Aid, and early childhood edu-
cation. There is also a significant in-
crease in funding for Head Start.
Close to my heart are TRIO and
GEAR UP, two programs that help dis-
advantaged students, low-income stu-
dents, or first-generation college stu-
dents to succeed. These programs will
receive a $35 million increase over fis-
cal year 2019, ensuring that still more
students are able to achieve academic
excellence.
We are also increasing spending for
career and technical education by an
additional $20 million.
Perhaps most critically for rural
areas, we are providing a robust in-
crease for a medical student education
program to ensure we are training
more primary healthcare providers who
want to work in rural areas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10311
December 17, 2019
The bill also includes critical tax ex-
tender provisions that have either
lapsed or are due to be reauthorized at
the end of the year. This important
end-of-the-year package ensures that
these important provisions will be
maintained in law, provisions like the
Indian lands tax credit and the Indian
employment tax credit, which are both
of critical importance in my district.
Typical tax credits provided to individ-
uals who have been affected by disas-
ters will also be extended under this
legislation.
I am also pleased that three addi-
tional provisions of ObamaCare are
permanently repealed in these appro-
priations bills: the so-called Cadillac
tax, the medical device tax, and the
health insurance tax. These provisions
served two insidious purposes, driving
up the cost of healthcare and forcing
people to give up good healthcare plans
that they enjoyed. I am thankful that
my friends in the majority finally rec-
ognize this and included these over-
whelmingly bipartisan solutions in the
legislation before us today.
Finally, the bill maintains important
pro-life protections that have been in
previous appropriations bills. The so-
called Hyde and Weldon amendments
remain intact. Maintaining these pro-
tections are important to securing bi-
partisan support for these bills.
Though there is a lot to like in these
bills, Mr. Speaker, there are also some
things I would change if it were solely
up to me. I don’t think any of us here,
Republican or Democrat, would view
either of these bills to be perfect. But
what we have achieved here is a bipar-
tisan compromise.
I think all of us in this Chamber can
be proud of the work we have accom-
plished here, especially in times of di-
vided government and in an ever more
polarized political environment. Find-
ing compromise across party lines and
between Chambers of Congress and the
administration is no small feat. That
we have done so here today is a testa-
ment to the House of Representatives
and a reminder that the things that
unite us are more powerful than those
that divide us.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, there is
a saying in Albany when things go on
for a while that everything has been
said but not by everybody. Apparently,
maybe everything has been said, and
apparently, everybody doesn’t feel the
need to weigh in.
Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. ROY), my friend.
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from Oklahoma and the
gentleman from New York for yielding
time, and I respect the amount of work
they have put into this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I rise, without surprise
to anyone in this room, in opposition
to the legislation.
I keep hearing this phrase: ‘‘this bill
provides.’’ I keep hearing my col-
leagues saying this. But this bill
doesn’t provide anything. The Amer-
ican people provide. This bill borrows,
and it borrows at a time when we can’t
afford to borrow more.
Our Nation is $23 trillion in debt, now
racking up more than $100 million of
debt per hour.
We haven’t figured it all out yet, but
it appears this bill spends $50 billion
more than 2019 spending levels. Don’t
worry, everybody will go back home
and campaign on a balanced budget
amendment that has no prayer of pas-
sage.
This bill is filled with massive policy
changes that we should debate and vote
on individually.
It has a bailout for Big Insurance
cloaked as tax relief.
It embraces the very partial
ObamaCare repeal that Republicans
have argued props up ObamaCare, yet
they now embrace.
The bill changes the tobacco age na-
tionwide, turning federalism on its
head, with nary a whimper from Re-
publicans who like to talk about the
10th Amendment in speeches back
home.
The bill extends the big giveaway to
huge corporations like Boeing in the
form of Ex-Im for 7 years.
The bill funds bureaucrats who wish
to target your Second Amendment
rights.
It funds abortion through ObamaCare
plans.
The biggest problem is, we haven’t
read the bill.
Days like today, everyone declares
bipartisanship. But in this version of
bipartisanship, it is the bipartisan
smell of Christmas jet fumes and ev-
eryone’s desire to get home fueling the
worst kind of bipartisanship, the kind
that says: ‘‘To heck with it, keep
spending money we don’t have and
leave it to our kids and grandkids to
clean up.’’
No one has read the bill. It is a mas-
sive, unreadable, 2,313-page bill filled
with government-expanded goodies and
spending, and it was dropped on us yes-
terday afternoon at 4:30 p.m. My staff
got their first look at 4:30.
The bill is a blatant violation of the
House’s 72-hour rule, a pretty weak
rule requiring that we have at least 72
hours to review legislation—everyone
back home is saying, ‘‘Are you kidding
me?’’—in this case, 2,300 pages.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman
from Texas.
Mr. ROY. Seventy-five years ago this
week, American forces were under
siege from 200,000 German soldiers,
over 1,000 panzers, as Hitler mounted a
counteroffensive in the middle of the
freezing-cold winter at Christmas. Our
boys, no doubt, wanted to get home.
Yet, this Congress surrenders. It sur-
renders to the swamp, mortgaging the
future, the very future those men
fought for.
The President, last spring, about a
massive omnibus, said: ‘‘I will never
sign another bill like this again. I’m
not going to do it again. Nobody read
it. It’s only hours old. Some people
don’t even know what is in it.’’ It was
$1.3 trillion, the second largest ever.
Mr. President, I look forward to your
veto.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, since my
friend is prepared to close, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, the first thing is, I want
to serve notice that, if we defeat the
previous question, I will offer an
amendment to the rule to immediately
bring up the bipartisan bill H.R. 1869,
the Restoring Investment in Improve-
ments Act.
With 288 cosponsors, H.R. 1869 would
ensure that any improvement to the
inside of a commercial building would
be treated in the same way that they
have historically been treated. That
puts capital back in the pockets of job
creators, which can be used to expand
facilities, create new opportunities,
and hire more workers.
H.R. 1869 is a bipartisan solution to a
real problem facing American busi-
nesses. Passage will immediately boost
job growth in communities across the
country by reviving investment in
communities that have been sitting on
the sideline. If we defeat the previous
question, we can pass this bill and send
it on to the Senate today.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to
the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma?
There was no objection.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, while I op-
pose the rule, I urge support for the
two appropriations measures we are
considering today.
Frankly, to be fair, there are many
concerns that my friend, Mr. ROY from
Texas, expressed that I agree with, but
this is the product of real compromise.
Frankly, in that compromise, each side
actually reduced its spending.
The spending in this bill for defense,
while it is a robust $19 billion increase,
is $10 billion less than the President
asked for in his original budget. That
was the compromise on his side. The
spending on the Labor-H bill, while cer-
tainly an increase, is $11 billion less
than my friends introduced in the
original House bill. So there are a lot
of give-and-takes in this.
Frankly, as an appropriator, I would
not be unhappy to see major provisions
like the repeal of ACA taxes and tax
extenders brought under their own leg-
islation here. That would be better.
But repealing those tax increases and
extending those tax extenders are real

victories for the American people and
prevent massive tax increases that,
frankly, bipartisan majorities have op-
posed in this House from the very be-
ginning.
The flaw in the ACA bill was funding
it with things that even my friends on
their side did not support and have not
supported. They are not for the med-
ical device tax. They are not for taxing
people’s insurance plans. They are cer-
tainly not for the taxes on so-called
Cadillac healthcare plans, which are
nothing more than good healthcare
plans that American people and work-
ers have bargained for.
So I consider these, however imper-
fectly achieved, real victories for the
American people, real bipartisan com-
promises.
b 0930
The most important part of this bill
is actually the underlying appropria-
tions process, and there we achieved
what we failed to achieve last year, as
regular governance working for most of
the fiscal year: no government shut-
down, thoughtful increases, and, frank-
ly, reductions in places that, on a bi-
partisan basis, we were able to agree.
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the
two appropriations measures we are
considering today. The two bills will
fully fund the government for fiscal
year 2020 and represent a truly bipar-
tisan and bicameral compromise.
I want to applaud all of the Members
for the work they have accomplished
on these bills which show what we can
do when we set our partisan differences
aside and truly focus on governing our
great Nation together. We will ensure
that the government remains open and
operating for our constituents and will
ensure that the government resources
are going where they are needed.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues,
obviously, to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, but I
urge strong and enthusiastic support
for the underlying legislation, which I
think achieves many victories for the
American people and does so to the
credit of both parties.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, my friend, the late,
great Governor of New York, Mario
Cuomo, once said, ‘‘We campaign in po-
etry and govern in prose,’’ and I think
he foresaw days like today when we
come together in the spirit of com-
promise to accomplish great things for
our communities and for the country.
I want to thank my colleagues for
their support and Mr. COLE’s support of
both Consolidated Appropriations Acts,
and I especially thank Chairwoman
LOWEY, Ranking Member GRANGER, and
all of the Members on the Appropria-
tions Committee, including the distin-
guished gentleman from Oklahoma, for
their tireless work in reaching this bi-
partisan compromise.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the rule and a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the pre-
vious question.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. COLE is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 765

lowing:

Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the
House amendment to the Senate
amendment to H.R. 1158.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, the national secu-
rity appropriations minibus combines
four bills: Defense, Commerce-Justice-
Science, Financial Services and Gen-
eral Government, and Homeland Secu-
rity.
Madam Speaker, I would like to high-
light a few key successes that our car-
dinals have secured: $7.6 billion, $1.4
billion more than President Trump
proposed, to ensure a fair and accurate
2020 Census; $425 million for election

security grants to States, a key pri-
ority for Democrats for a program that
was not funded last year; robust fund-
ing for initiatives to improve the qual-
ity of life of our women and men in
uniform; and a 3.1 percent pay raise for
Federal civilian employees.
b 1115
Unfortunately, the President and
Senate Republicans insisted on funding
a wasteful border wall while simulta-
neously blocking Democratic policies
that would make our immigration sys-
tem more humane. However, I am
pleased that we have established an im-
migration detention ombudsman
tasked with protecting the rights of in-
dividuals in DHS custody.
Madam Speaker, this is not the bill I
would have written on my own, but I
am proud that we have been able to do
so much good in this political environ-
ment. I urge support, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1158, a bill that will pro-
vide funding for the Departments of
Defense; Commerce, Justice, Science;
Financial Services; and Homeland Se-
curity.
While I wish that we had been able to
pass all of the bills by the beginning of
the fiscal year, I am glad we are going
to be able to finish the appropriations
process without having to pass another
continuing resolution. I am also im-
mensely proud of the job that my fel-
low Republicans on the Appropriations
Committee did to bring the bill to the
floor.
The packages we will consider today
will fully fund the government and en-
sure that President Trump has the re-
sources he needs to continue the great
work he is doing on behalf of the Amer-
ican people. This bill will make us
safer by ensuring we have the funding
and tools to protect ourselves at home
and abroad.
The bill will safeguard our financial
system from bad actors, ensure all
Americans have access to a healthy
and robust economy, and it will sup-
port our criminal justice system.
In particular, this bill provides $1.375
billion of new funding for the border
wall, places no restrictions on the
President’s ability to use funds for im-
migration and border enforcement, and
protects the number of ICE beds.
The Defense portion of this package
provides funding to continue to rebuild
the military after years of neglect dur-
ing the Obama administration; gives
our troops a 3.1 percent pay raise, the
largest in a decade; and funds the U.S.
Space Force, a Trump administration
initiative, to ensure the United States
maintains its superiority in space.
The bill provides increased funding
for school safety programs and also re-
tains longstanding Second Amendment
protections that some of my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle wanted to
eliminate.
Plain and simple, this package is
good for America, and I am proud to
support it. I urge my colleagues to join
me in voting in favor of this bill, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 1 minute to the distin-
guished gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
HOYER), the majority leader.
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise
and thank Chairwoman LOWEY and
Ranking Member GRANGER for the hard
work that they have done, and all of
their staff.
The staffs, I know, have been work-
ing around the clock on both sides of
the aisle. I want to congratulate the
staff director for the extraordinary
work and leadership she has shown to
get us to this objective.
I rise in strong support of this legis-
lation, of both of these packages, which
will fund all 12 bills before the end of
the calendar year, unfortunately, not
by the end of the fiscal year.
I would have been very happy to get
all of this done by the end of the fiscal
year, and we did our work in a timely
fashion; but, unfortunately, the Senate
did not pass any of its bills prior to the
end of the fiscal year, and, therefore, it
was impossible to get that done.
I want to thank Senator LEAHY and
Senator SHELBY, as well, for the work
that they have done.
I want to thank all of those who
worked together, focused. There was
some talk, I know, about going into
next year, but this is the right thing to
do. This is what the American people
expect us to be doing.
This will provide our country with
the certainty needed to carry out its
work serving the American people and
to continue making long-term invest-
ments in our national security, public
health, public safety, and economic
growth.
Indeed, the Appropriations Com-
mittee members and staff worked hard
to produce appropriations bills that the
House passed in June, when we passed
bills to fund 96 percent of the govern-
ment by June 26 of this year. Sadly,
the Republican Senate, as I have said,
and the Trump White House failed to
do their jobs for months, necessitating
two short-term delays that brought un-
necessary uncertainty.
As a Member who has served on the
Appropriations Committee for more
than 36 years—although many of those
years I have been on leave—I know how
much work is involved in reaching
agreement on funding bills.
Nobody, not one of the, I guess, 433 of
us who are here, got everything that
they wanted or believes this is a per-
fect bill, but it is a work product wor-
thy of the Appropriations Committee,
the House of Representatives, and this
country. It makes compromises, which
are absolutely essential. It takes a lot
of late hours, caffeine, and placing
trust in colleagues across the aisle to
achieve that objective.
What Appropriations Committee
members and staff have negotiated
with the Senate and White House, as I
said, is not perfect. The chair does not
think it is perfect. The ranking mem-
ber doesn’t think it is perfect. I am
sure there is nobody on either of the
committees who thinks it is perfect,
but it achieves key priorities and will
avert a damaging government shut-
down and give certainty to agencies as
they move forward in the next 9
months of the fiscal year as to what re-
sources they are going to have avail-
able to get their jobs done.
I know there is a lot of weeping and
gnashing of teeth about how awful the
CR is for the Defense Department. I
agree with that, but there ought to be
a lot of weeping and gnashing of teeth
about the adverse effect on nondefense
agencies, because the effect is the
same: uncertainty and an inability to
operate in any kind of regular order
fashion.
This bill does not give President
Trump additional border security fund-
ing over last year, but it does give him
what he had last year. That is a com-
promise. People on my side are not
happy about that; people on Ms.
GRANGER’s side, I am sure, are not
happy about that. But it is a com-
promise, and it does continue critical
investments in fighting poverty and ex-
panding opportunities in communities
across the country.
Specifically, this bill increases fund-
ing for Head Start, National Institutes
of Health, and initiatives to promote
clean energy and a healthier environ-
ment—important victories for those
items and the working Americans we
are fighting to protect every day.
This bill includes funds to secure our
elections against foreign interference
and provides funding to study the ef-
fects of gun violence in our commu-
nities.
Ms. GRANGER mentions it raises the
military pay, but it also raises the ci-
vilians on parity, a policy that we pur-
sued for many, many years. It is good
for our staff. It is good for the Federal
employees, and it makes us competi-
tive in the ability to retain people
whom we need.
It raises the cap for staff pay. Now,
maybe we ought to hide that, but, very
frankly, our staffs are underpaid. The
hours, the talent, the intellect, the
commitment, the patriotism they
bring to their jobs, we don’t com-
pensate them properly.
We are not competitive, certainly,
with the private sector, but we are not
competitive with the executive depart-
ment, and we lost good people. So I ap-
plaud the committee for that action.
This comes just a week after we were
able to secure a victory by extending
paid parental leave for Federal civilian
employees across all agencies in the
annual defense authorization bill.
Critically, these appropriations bills
have buy-in from the administration,
having been negotiated by Secretary
Mnuchin on behalf of the President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10380 December 17, 2019
There is no legitimate reason that
these bills would be vetoed, and my ex-
pectation is that they will not be ve-
toed, so we will pass them through the
House. Hopefully, the Senate will pass
them in the next 72 hours and send
them to the President and he will sign
these bills.
All of us ought to be proud of the fact
that we got that done by the end of the
calendar year.
Again, let me stress, my objective
will be, next year, to get that done by
the end of the fiscal year. I can’t re-
member when we last did that, but I
will tell all of my colleagues that that
will be my intent to set that as an ob-
jective as it was to subject December 20
as the deadline for getting these bills
done.
I strongly urge the President to sign
these bills. Federal employees in my
district and in every congressional dis-
trict in the country deserve better
than to be told to go home without
their paychecks.
Madam Speaker, 800,000 people who
work for us—we are the board of direc-
tors—we told 400,000 of them: You are
not critical. Go home. Stay there. You
can’t come to work legally even if you
wanted to.
And to 400,000, we said: No, you are
critical. Come to work, but, by the
way, we are not going to pay you.
Now, they believed and we did, in
fact, pay them retroactively, but that
ought not to be the way you operate
any small, medium, or large business,
much less one of the largest enterprises
on the face of the Earth—I guess, the
largest enterprise.
So I hope all of my colleagues, Demo-
crats and Republicans, will join me in
voting for these appropriations bills,
these 12 bills, quite frankly, the only
bills that have to pass. There are a lot
of other bills that ought to pass from a
policy perspective, but the government
doesn’t shut down if they don’t pass,
whether it is a tax bill, an environ-
mental bill, whatever bill.
Let’s send a resounding message of
support to make it clear that this is
the bipartisan path forward to avoid a
shutdown and do our jobs for the Amer-
ican people.
Again, I congratulate the chair; I
congratulate the ranking member; and
I am so pleased that they are together.
I join them in asking every Member to
vote for these bills. It is our job. It is
our responsibility. It is our duty.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT).
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I
thank the ranking member, and I also
rise today in support of H.R. 1158, as
the majority leader did, the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act of 2020.
While this bill is not perfect, as it
was also mentioned—and, quite hon-
estly, I have concerns that there is an
ongoing trend toward increased spend-
ing—I will say that division B of this
legislation, the Commerce, Justice,
Science, and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Act, includes assistance that
is critical to law enforcement, the Cen-
sus, and NASA, among other things.
I would like to thank Chairman
SERRANO, and I thank Chairwoman
LOWEY, Ranking Member GRANGER, as
well as our Senate counterparts for
their leadership, their diligence, and
their willingness to come together to
form this meeting of the minds to
bring this FY 2020 bill to the floor and
to fruition.
I also want to thank Mr. SERRANO’s
staff—Mr. Bob Bonner, Jeff Ashford,
Trisha Castaneda, TJ Lowdermilk,
Shannon McCully, Matt Smith, and
B.G. Wright—for their hard work and
the many long days that were, no
doubt, dedicated to helping produce
this legislation. I appreciate their co-
operative spirit in which they worked
with my staff to address so many of the
issues that are in this bill.
And, of course, I also want to thank
my staff for their outstanding work.
b 1130
I want to thank our CJS sub-
committee staff, Stephanie Gadbois
and Kristin Clarkson, for their hard
work, their long hours, and their dedi-
cation over the last year, and espe-
cially the hard work of the last few
weeks in finalizing this bill.
Let me just briefly recap. The bill
has $22.6 billion for NASA. The funding
will help support the President’s
Artemis initiative, which includes
completion and further development of
the Space Launch System to ensure
that it is the United States and not our
adversaries that will control future ac-
cess to space.
In addition to NASA, the bill in-
cludes $7.3 billion to support the 2020
Decennial Census which will be nec-
essary to get an accurate count of all
Americans, including those in hard-to-
count communities. It also includes
critical funding for the Federal law en-
forcement components of the Depart-
ment of Justice, including the FBI, the
United States Marshals Service, and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
arms and Explosives. I am pleased to
say that these funds will also support
Attorney General Barr’s efforts to
fight the scourge of violent crimes and
acts of mass violence.
In support of the valuable efforts of
our local law enforcement partners
back home, this bill also includes $547
million for the Byrne Justice Assist-
ance grants, along with increased re-
sources to eliminate the sexual assault
kit backlog, also fund drug court pro-
grams, and support other vital initia-
tives that fight the opioid epidemic.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentleman from Alabama an
additional 1 minute.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker,
this bill provides funding increases for
the agencies that ensure compliance
with our trade laws, along with pro-
grams that foster American innovation
and competitiveness, not only in our
communities and in each of our States
but around the world.
Finally, I am pleased that this bill
also contains longstanding Second
Amendment protections that were tar-
geted for elimination earlier this year.
So, in closing, I would like to thank,
again, Chairman SERRANO for his great
spirit to work with and how he has led
the Commerce, Justice, Science, and
Related Agencies Subcommittee, and I
wish him the best.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY), who is the
distinguished chairman of the Defense
Subcommittee.
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I
thank the chairwoman for yielding.
I would like to begin by expressing
my appreciation to Ranking Member
CALVERT. Mr. CALVERT continues to be
a tremendous partner in this process,
and he is a joy to work with.
I would also like to express my grati-
tude to the chairwoman, Mrs. LOWEY,
as well as the ranking member, Ms.
GRANGER, and the other members of
the committee. I would like to thank
each of our incomparable staff. This
legislation would not be possible with-
out their intellectual acumen, out-
standing effort, and significant per-
sonal sacrifices.
Division A of the bill provides appro-
priations for the Department of De-
fense and is the result of a negotiated
compromise. Despite our best efforts, I
was very disappointed to recede on cer-
tain provisions of the House-passed
bill, particularly those that restricted
the ability of the administration to re-
program Defense funding for the border
wall and several others that would
have returned some balance to the
oversight relationship between the ex-
ecutive and legislative branches. The
department’s actions in the past year
have fundamentally damaged its rela-
tionship with this committee. With
this agreement, we increase our em-
phasis on oversight as we move for-
ward.
Nevertheless, there is a tremendous
amount of good provided in this bill.
The bill provides more than ample
funding for the Department of Defense
to make major investments in readi-
ness. But our primary focus has been
on the well-being and morale of those
in uniform, their families, DOD civil-
ians, and the Defense communities.
The bill provides the funding nec-
essary to support a 3.1 percent military
pay raise for our women and men in
uniform. This is the largest increase in
base pay since 2010.
The bill provides an additional $110
million for upgrades to DOD childcare
facilities, which I see as just the first
step in addressing the significant
shortfall of quality childcare within
the military services.
The bill provides $315 million above
the request to address public school in-
frastructure requirements on DOD fa-
cilities.

December 17, 2019
The bill provides $1.42 billion for en-
vironmental restoration activities,
$180.5 million above enacted levels for
this year. Additionally, the bill pro-
vides $1.8 billion in natural disaster
funding for repairs and replacement of
equipment at military bases damaged
by natural disasters in eight States, in-
cluding Virginia, Florida, California,
and Georgia.
In closing, I would like to end by re-
minding the Department of Defense
that report language is directive, not
permissive. Actions in direct con-
travention of congressional direction
in the report are absolutely unaccept-
able and must stop.
Again, I thank my colleagues and
staff.
Madam Speaker, I urge support for
the bill.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
California (Mr. CALVERT).
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, the ranking mem-
ber of the Appropriations Committee
has done a tremendous job navigating
all these bills through a very difficult
negotiation in such a short timeframe.
Her steady leadership, experience, and
focus completing this difficult task
was critical to ensuring an end product
that will garner Republican support
and that the President will sign. I also
want to thank Chairwoman LOWEY for
keeping the process on track during
the very difficult political times that
we are in.
I would also like to extend my sin-
cere thanks to my chairman, Mr. VIS-
CLOSKY, from the great State of Indi-
ana. Mr. VISCLOSKY has been a tremen-
dous partner to me and our side of the
aisle throughout this whole process
maintaining the bipartisan nature of
the Defense Subcommittee. He has
been very gracious and accommo-
dating, and I thank him sincerely. I
look forward to continuing to work in
a collaborative manner during the
coming year.
The bill includes $693 billion for the
Department of Defense, including $624
billion in base funds, $70.7 million for
Overseas Contingency Operations, and
$1.8 billion in disaster assistance. In
total, this bill is nearly $19 billion
more than the fiscal year 2019 level.
After thoughtful negotiations be-
tween the House and the Senate, we
have a good, balanced bill that we look
forward to passing in both Chambers
and getting to the President for his sig-
nature.
Our number one priority is to provide
for the Nation’s defense. The world re-
mains a dangerous place. We have got
troops in combat against ISIS, al-
Qaida, and associated forces. Authori-
tarian competitors—especially China
and Russia—are seeking regional domi-
nance and trying to upend the post-
World War II international order.
North Korea continues to modernize its
nuclear weapons capability and means
of delivery. A hostile Iran remains a
threat to Israel and other U.S. part-
ners, as well as our forces in the Middle
East. Instability to our south has pro-
duced conditions that bring people,
which tragically includes unaccom-
panied children, into our Nation ille-
gally.
For all these reasons, we must get
this bill done.
As we all know, operating under con-
tinuing resolutions actually costs more
money and results in delayed capabili-
ties. The department needs stable, pre-
dictable, and timely funding to ensure
it is prepared to meet the threats we
face now and in the feature.
The funding in this bill recognizes
threats of U.S. interests throughout
the world while continuing moderniza-
tion efforts to maintain the peace and
deter our near-peer adversaries.
It also supports the men and women
in the military by addressing quality-
of-life issues that Chairman VISCLOSKY
has championed by including addi-
tional funds to address childcare and
medical care. Of course, we fund the 3.1
percent pay raise and provide addi-
tional funding for medical research.
The bill increases funding for oper-
ations and maintenance to sustain and
improve readiness levels. Funding is
provided for robust procurement of
next generation equipment to ensure
our men and women in uniform always
have the tactical advantage. We also
increase funding for research and de-
velopment to ensure we can meet and
preferably deter near-peer threats.
Madam Speaker, I encourage every-
one to vote for this bill. It is a strong
bill and ensures that our military has
the resources it needs.
I want to thank the staff on both
sides for all their hard work.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY), who is the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Financial
Services and General Government Sub-
committee.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to speak about the Financial
Services and General Government Sub-
committee portion of the appropria-
tions package before us.
Before I begin, I would like to thank
Chairwoman LOWEY, Ranking Member
GRANGER, and Subcommittee Ranking
Member TOM GRAVES for their hard
work and commitment throughout this
process. I would also like to thank staff
on both sides for all their hard work
behind the scenes, particularly my own
staff and the staff of Financial Services
and General Government who don’t put
their names in these things, but we
know and thank Lisa and others. Our
amazing subcommittee staff, in par-
ticular, put in long hours to make this
bill come together.
The FSGG bill provides $23.8 billion
in total discretionary resources for a
broad array of agencies and programs
ranging from the Department of the
Treasury to the Consumer Product
Safety Commission. It is a bill that I
am not only proud of, but one that we
can collectively all be proud of.
My top priority as chairman this
year has been to help States and local
governments secure and protect the in-
tegrity of American elections. That is
why I am proud to have successfully in-
cluded $425 million in funding for the
Election Assistance Commission to
issue a new round of election security
grants to States. This is the first in-
vestment for this purpose since 2018.
Let us be clear, this is not a partisan
matter. We know the Russians inter-
fered in our 2016 elections, and they are
going to be back. It is critical we pro-
vide these funds so election officials
can replace outdated voting equipment
and implement protections to ensure
our election system can withstand fu-
ture attempts of foreign interference.
I am also proud that the bill makes
targeted investments to ensure that
capital and other assistance gets to
small businesses and low-income com-
munities. The bill boosts funding for
the Community Development Finan-
cial Institutions Fund by $12 million,
which helps support affordable housing,
small businesses, and infrastructure in
underserved and rural communities, in
addition to supplying credit to dis-
advantaged communities. The bill also
increases entrepreneurial development
programs at the SBA by $13 million.
We boost funding for the Securities
and Exchange Commission, provide an
increase for the Federal Trade Com-
mission, and include a long overdue in-
vestment in the Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
Another important focus this year is
bolstering assistance to taxpayers, in-
cluding increases for the taxpayer ad-
vocate and tax counseling and assist-
ance programs. For our hardworking
Federal workers, I am thrilled that our
bill includes a 3.1 percent pay increase.
In closing, Madam Speaker, this Fi-
nancial Services appropriations bill is
a result of bipartisan collaboration
among members and hard work from
our staff, and I urge my colleagues to
join me in support of this bill.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN).
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speak-
er, Ranking Member, and Chairwoman
LOWEY, I rise today to lend my strong
support to all of the appropriations
bills that will be before us today, but
specifically as the ranking member on
the Homeland Security Subcommittee
of the Appropriations Committee, I am
here to speak about the Department of
Homeland Security Appropriations
Act, specifically.
As we have heard today from speak-
ers on both sides of the aisle, this is
not an ideal bill, but I think it is a
very good and strong bill. It is a good
bill crafted in a difficult environment—
probably one of the most difficult envi-
ronments I have seen in my almost 10-
year tenure. I tell you, Madam Speak-
er, it is worthy of our support, as are
all the bills here today.

this subcommittee, want to thank
Chairwoman ROYBAL-ALLARD. She is
the head Democrat and we have worked
well together. We don’t view the world
and we don’t view this bill in total
agreement, but we got it done, and
that is very important, again, in these
trying times.
This Homeland Security bill before
us provides nearly $1.4 billion for con-
tinued construction of border barriers
in high-priority areas identified by
Customs and Border Protection and
provides funding for the same level of
detention beds as we had in fiscal year
2019. It also maintains the same trans-
fer and reprogramming authorities.
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is a vast agency and, looking at
the bill beyond the investments in bor-
der and immigration enforcement,
there are so many activities, programs,
and initiatives that we all agree on
across the aisle, across the Capitol, and
really across the great United States of
America. As I have said before, 90 per-
cent of the funding in this bill we all
can agree on.
We have solid investments in our
great United States Coast Guard, and
let’s remember, Madam Speaker, this
is the one branch of the military that
did not get paid during the government
shutdown last year, but the men and
women of the Coast Guard bravely con-
tinued their missions. For the Coast
Guard—the military branch with so
many domestic missions on top of its
contributions to the Nation’s defense—
this bill provides desperately needed
new air and marine assets as well as re-
investing in personnel.
b 1145
We have plus-ups for the Secret Serv-
ice to continue leading law enforce-
ment on national special security
events and protection for all the Presi-
dential candidates.
We have plus-ups for the Cybersecu-
rity and Infrastructure Security Agen-
cy to help keep our government’s IT
system secure, as well as providing for
technical assistance to States, Tribes,
and localities.
We have more than $17 billion for
FEMA disaster relief to ensure that we
are ready for whatever storms hit our
homes plus increases of over $90 mil-
lion for grants to State and local com-
munities to prepare for and mitigate
disasters.
Further, as our loved ones travel
over this holiday season, the bill pro-
vides an increase of over $210 million
for the operations and equipment of
TSA in fiscal year 2020.
Madam Speaker, finally, I thank the
staff who have worked so hard to-
gether. I thank, especially, the staff on
both sides, majority and minority,
Darek, Kris, Bob, Karyn, Mike, Eliza-
beth, Rachel, Victoria, Dena, and Kris-
tin, plus Daniel from my own staff, for
all of their hard work to put together
this good bill.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR),
the chairwoman of the Subcommittee
on Energy and Water Development, and
Related Agencies.
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I ap-
plaud Chairwoman LOWEY and the
ranking member, Ms. GRANGER, for
bringing us to this point today.
I thank the Committee on Appropria-
tions subcommittees being discussed
here now for advancing a conference
agreement that provides critical fund-
ing for Defense, Homeland Security,
Commerce-Justice-Science, and Finan-
cial Services.
H.R. 1158 and the Defense package ad-
dress the priorities of readiness, mod-
ernization, and reform, to deter our
main adversaries of Russia and China.
Chairman VISCLOSKY has crafted a
careful compromise that ensures our
Nation regains the advantage in
hypersonic weapons and many other
areas.
The Homeland Security portion of
the bill also provides important invest-
ments. It places safeguards on the De-
partment of Homeland Security to en-
sure its work is legal, safe, and in the
national interest. The safety of our
homeland is increasingly threatened by
bad actors, both here at home and
abroad, and this bill protects the 2020
election, a top national security pri-
ority.
The bill also provides funding for key
issues at NASA, including for aero-
nautics; for the regional economic de-
velopment program; and for harmful
algal bloom research at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion.
Lastly, the bill provides investments
in our Nation’s credit unions and com-
munity development financial institu-
tions, and it makes critical invest-
ments in election security grants to
harden vulnerable election infrastruc-
ture.
Funding the government and keeping
the lights on used to be a norm. Hope-
fully, we help restore that today. When
the House passes this bill, we will be
restoring the American people’s faith
in our ability to get the job done for
our country.
Madam Speaker, again, I thank
Chairwoman LOWEY for her extraor-
dinary intelligence, leadership, and
good demeanor that made this moment
possible.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS).
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam
Speaker, I rise in support of this pack-
age to fund government operations in
fiscal year 2020. I extend my congratu-
lations to this dynamic duo, the first
time we have ever had females occupy
the chair and ranking member of this
committee and, for that matter, I
guess, any other committee in the
House.
This dynamic duo has produced a
very good document, a very good exer-
cise of the power of the purse of the
Congress granted by the Constitution. I
salute these two and wish them well as
the day progresses.
As a former chair of the full com-
mittee, I know of the extreme patience
that is required in this job that they
are occupying and the difficulty of get-
ting 435 Members in this body, as well
as the other body, the White House,
and the world, together under any
stretch of the imagination, but they
have done that. It is difficult to do, and
we salute them for it. I especially, hav-
ing been there, thank them for the
great patience that they have shown in
putting this bill together.
This first package before us reflects
our commitment to our Nation’s secu-
rity and our military leadership across
the world. The Department of Defense
receives additional resources to sup-
port our warfighters with the best
available technology. We also provide
these brave men and women with a
hard-earned and well-deserved pay
raise.
Within the committee, I have been
particularly focused on keeping the
DOD’s electronic health records on
track, meshing DOD’s medical records
with that of the VA. This bill takes
bold steps in the right direction to en-
sure our servicemembers continue to
receive the best medical care when
they transition out of Active Duty and
into the hands of the VA.
Second, President Trump is rightly
focused on addressing the crisis at our
southern border. This legislation will
support his efforts to end the seem-
ingly unending flow of drugs that found
their way into every American commu-
nity and, practically, every American
home, as well as the violence of the
brutal cartels that profit immensely
from this trade. Nearly $1.4 billion is
included for the border wall, along with
additional resources for the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to hire
more personnel and deploy advanced
technology in this region.
We were also able to eliminate dan-
gerous riders that would have limited
the President’s ability to enforce our
immigration laws while still ensuring a
strong humanitarian response that re-
flects our values as Americans.
This package also continues our mo-
mentum in the fight against opioid
abuse and addiction. With targeted re-
sources for the Department of Justice
and other Federal agencies, the diverse
programs funded in this bill reflect the
holistic strategy that Congress has em-
braced against this problem: enforce-
ment, treatment, education, and pre-
vention, all working in concert, in a
holistic fashion. Drug courts, veterans
treatment courts, and prescription
drug monitoring programs receive ro-
bust support in this first package.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I

dictions together to end this scourge.
Finally, the bill allocates $30 million
within the Economic Development Ad-
ministration for assistance to coal
mining communities that continue to
struggle with the downturn in that in-
dustry. And it maintains all pro-life
and Second Amendment protections
that exist under current law.

is perfect and that represents, for sure,
a tough compromise. But it makes
strong investments to protect our Na-
tion and upholds our values as Ameri-
cans.
The Commerce-Justice-Science divi-
sion of this bill protects children by in-
creasing the Missing and Exploited
Children’s Program funding, but I was
deeply disappointed that the House
language, which would have directed
$40 million specifically for the Internet
Crimes Against Children program at
DOJ, was dropped from the final agree-
ment at the insistence of Senate Re-
publicans. This is inexcusable.
The New York Times just published
an expose detailing the explosion of
child sexual abuse imagery on the
internet. It is incumbent on Congress
to provide adequate support for the
Internet Crimes Against Children task
forces, which were authorized by bipar-
tisan legislation I passed, the PRO-
TECT Our Children Act, in 2008.
The Internet Crimes Against Chil-
dren task forces have successfully res-
cued thousands of children, and their
success is directly attached to the
amount of funding we provide to them
to do investigations.
Notably, the CJS division also re-
stores funding for the Census Bureau as
it gears up for the 2020 Census, pro-
viding $7.6 billion to the Bureau to en-
sure that everyone in the United
States is counted and represented.
CJS also includes $19 million specifi-
cally for research to combat harmful
algal blooms, which have devastated
my State’s coastal ecosystems and
economy.
I am also pleased that the Financial
Services division includes $1.3 million
for local pool safety grant programs.
Drowning is the leading cause of unin-
tentional injury and death for children
ages 1 to 4 in this country, which is
why I sponsored and passed the Vir-
ginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safe-
ty Act to create and fund these grants
in 2007.
Additionally, this bill helps us pro-
tect and secure our democracy with
$425 million for election security sys-
tem grants to States, a vital provision
that will help ensure our election secu-
rity.
The Defense division of this package
invests in our national security and
our Armed Forces, providing $622.7 bil-
lion in base funding, which is an in-
crease of $16.2 billion above the enacted
and $88.7 billion above the President’s
own budget request.
The Defense bill also provides $110
million for peer-reviewed DOD cancer
research funding, a longtime priority
under the leadership of Chairwoman
NITA LOWEY. I am proud and thankful
that the language I sponsored to spe-
cifically include metastatic cancer in
the final agreement is still in the bill.
In total, the Defense division provides
almost $500 million for cancer research.
However, I do want to note that I was
disappointed about how the Homeland
Security division turned out in this
agreement. Chairwoman ROYBAL-
ALLARD put together an excellent
House bill that included restrictions on
the ability to transfer and reprogram
funding for ICE and CBP. The Trump
administration repeatedly violates
congressional intent by shifting fund-
ing to ICE beds and to implement the
dangerous and cruel Migrant Protec-
tion Protocols. Sadly, the bicameral
agreement strips the House guardrails,
though I am glad to see the House bill’s
immigration ombudsman position is
maintained.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Florida.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Speaker, the legislation also
includes my language to require on-de-
mand admission to Members of Con-
gress into DHS facilities so that we can
conduct oversight without the adminis-
tration whitewashing the reality inside
before we arrive. That accountability
is essential.
The American people are counting on
us to enact full-year spending bills that
invest responsibly and provide much-
needed budget certainty.
The bill also prohibits HHS from
turning over immigration information
about potential sponsors of immigrants
to our country. That is also vital to
make sure that our immigrants are
protected and that they have sponsors
who are eligible and don’t live in fear
of having their immigration status
turned over to DHS.
This bill does all of this and more. It
is not perfect, but no compromise ever
is. I am proud, as a member of the Ap-
propriations Committee, to join my
colleagues in support of it.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. MOOLENAAR).
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Madam Speaker, I
thank Chair LOWEY and Ranking Mem-
ber GRANGER for this opportunity to
speak today on this appropriations leg-
islation.
The bill before us right now provides
crucial funding for our Nation’s mili-
tary, giving our soldiers their biggest
pay raise in a decade and providing re-
sources they need to win on the battle-
field.
It is a strong complement to the next
bill coming up today, where we will
fund the Army Corps of Engineers and
pass through Congress historic
progress at the Soo Locks, funding the
construction of a new lock that will be
vital to shipping on the Great Lakes
and for American manufacturing.
American manufacturing is respon-
sible for millions of jobs, and this legis-
lation also supports hardworking men
and women across our Nation with the
Manufacturing Extension Partnership.
b 1200
Constituents across my district have
told me how this program does crucial
work to support the production of
Michigan-made goods.
Another issue I know my constitu-
ents are concerned about is the opioid
crisis and the threat of fentanyl to our
communities. This legislation funds ef-
forts at our Nation’s borders, where of-
ficials have already stopped thousands
of pounds of fentanyl and heroin from
entering our country. The opioid epi-
demic requires a robust effort from all
levels of government, as well as law en-
forcement and medical professionals.
The next bill also helps in this fight,
with record funding for the NIH, which
will support research into nonaddictive
treatments for pain, as well as the
fight against cancer and Alzheimer’s.
Finally, this bill funds Great Lakes
monitoring at NOAA in the Commerce
Department, which, along with the
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative,
does outstanding work to protect our
Great Lakes. The GLRI works with
State and local government, conserva-
tion groups and research universities,
including Central Michigan University
in my district. This year, the GLRI is
receiving $320 million in the legislation
that is coming up next, and I know it
will help protect the Great Lakes for
future generations.
I am grateful for the support for
many of these priorities from our col-
leagues on the House Appropriations
Committee, including leadership on
both sides and, particularly, for my
friend from Ohio, MARCY KAPTUR, who
visited the Soo Locks with me and offi-
cials from the Army Corps this sum-
mer.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR),
a member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee.
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I
want to thank my chairwoman, Mrs.
NITA LOWEY, for all the work that she
has been doing, along with the staff—
fantastic work—and, of course, my col-
league from Texas, also, Ms. GRANGER,
for her and her staff working together
as a team.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10384 December 17, 2019
Madam Speaker, I am speaking on
this bill. As you know, anytime you de-
velop a consensus, there are things
that we might disagree on, but I just
have to say that there are so many
good things that I agree with: the work
that they did for trade, commerce, edu-
cation, healthcare, transportation, in-
frastructure, border security, the mili-
tary, and our veterans.
Just to highlight a couple of things:
$673 million to hire more immigra-
tion judges and support staff;
$7.5 billion increase for the Census
Bureau;
$8 million for the fever ticks, which
is so important for south Texas;
$50 million-plus for the Department
of Defense Impact Aid and $20 million
for the Department of Defense Impact
Aid for Children with Disabilities for
our military bases in Texas and across
the Nation;
$32 million for carbon emissions cap-
ture research, technologies, and stor-
age. We are number one in Texas in en-
ergy, but we want to make sure that
we do it in a safe environmental way;
$135 million for Small Business De-
velopment Centers to make sure that
we emphasize our small businesses; and
Title I Grants to our local schools,
which got $16.3 billion.
The Pell grant, we increased that to
make sure that students have the
money to go to college, and I want to
say thank you for that increase.
On trade, there is money to hire 1,200
CBP officers and ag specialists; and, I
guess, once we pass NAFTA 2.0 later on
this week, we need to have those in-
spectors at the bridges, so I want to
thank the committee for adding that
money.
We also added $13 million to hire
what we call Border Patrol coordi-
nating officers, and those are entry-
level positions so we don’t take Border
Patrol or CBP officers away from their
work; and we can have these new offi-
cers do the humanitarian care.
Now, unfortunately, there is a little
bit of money for the wall, which I don’t
agree with. But I do want to say thank
you for the language that I have asked
for, that is, to make sure that we don’t
construct any fencing in certain areas
of my district: the Santa Ana National
Wildlife Refuge; the Bentsen-Rio
Grande Valley State Park; La Lomita
Historical Park; the National Butterfly
Center; the Vista Del Mar Ranch,
which is SpaceX in Brownsville; and
now we added the historical ceme-
teries. No fence will be built in those
areas.
I also want to thank them for adding
my language on making sure that they
sit down with the local jurisdictions, if
they have to work on the design or the
alignment, so as to mitigate commu-
nity and environmental impact. I want
to thank the committee for adding
that language itself.
So, again, this is a good bill where
both sides got together. I want to
thank Ms. GRANGER and Mrs. NITA
LOWEY and the committee.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL), a member
of the Appropriations Committee.
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, I
thank our illustrious chair for her
great work.
Madam Speaker, later today, the En-
ergy and Water bill will include signifi-
cant funding for a critical bipartisan
environmental issue in my home State
of Florida.
Known as the River of Grass, the Ev-
erglades is a 100-mile-long natural re-
gion of tropical wetlands that is the
main source of water for millions of
Floridians and visitors. It contains one
of Florida’s and America’s most pop-
ular national parks. It is home to hun-
dreds of animal species.
The State of Florida and the Federal
Government are engaged in a long-
term undertaking to restore its natural
flow and improve water quality. This
bill, Madam Speaker, includes $200 mil-
lion for Everglades restoration, the
largest allocation ever by the Federal
Government for this project. It will
help protect south Florida’s magnifi-
cent ecosystem, keep our water safe,
and drive our economy.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN).
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speak-
er, again, I want to thank Chairwoman
LOWEY and Ranking Member GRANGER,
also Ranking Member SIMPSON.
Today, I rise, again, in support of an-
other one of our great appropriations
bills, the Energy and Water and Re-
lated Agencies bill.
As the Speaker knows, I spoke ear-
lier in very fervent support of the
Homeland Security bill. The Energy
and Water bill is robust. It is well-fund-
ed.
I just actually spoke with a member
of the press outside, and the gentleman
asked me, over the past few years, why
the Energy and Water bill had been in-
creased so much. The answer is clear:
It is because Republicans and Demo-
crats in the House and the Senate and
the administrations, including this ad-
ministration as well, understand that
the Nation needs what the Department
of Energy is doing.
Now, obviously, I have a bit of a bias.
I represent, I think, one of the greatest
Department of Energy reservations at
Oak Ridge. We have a national lab. We
have the Y–12 plant. We are building
the uranium processing facility. I
thank the chairwoman for the robust
funding for that great construction
project.
Also, legacy cleanup all across the
United States of America—not only in
Oak Ridge, but in Savannah River; in
Hanford, Washington; in Los Alamos,
New Mexico. Republicans and Demo-
crats and communities are working to-
gether cleaning up legacy waste.
There was a time in America when
we were not as careful—during the Cold
War and prior to and during World War
II—when we manufactured these weap-
ons and there was legacy waste out
there. It is the obligation, I think, of
the Federal Government to clean it up.
It is high time that we do it, and we
are doing it with our funding priorities.
So whether it is our great national
labs—there are 17 of them all across
the United States: the NNSA, the Of-
fice of Science—it hearkens me, again,
at a time when we see a divided nation,
a divided Capitol, that we can come to-
gether in very strong, fervent, and ro-
bust agreement to support this funding
bill for the Department of Energy and
its related agencies. That means our
locks will be funded with the Army
Corps of Engineers and all of our key
DOE functions will continue to be sup-
ported at the highest level.
This keeps America at the forefront.
We lead the world in supercomputing.
We lead the world in materials re-
search. We lead the world in advanced
manufacturing.
So I thank my colleagues for their
robust support of this bill, and I urge
its support with the other bills in this
plan.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
In closing, I would like to take a few
minutes to thank several individuals
who were instrumental in bringing this
package to the floor today.
First, I would like to thank my
friend and our full committee chair,
NITA LOWEY. Though we don’t always
agree, she is respectful of other opin-
ions and always works in good faith
and is a pleasure to work with.
I would also like to thank our Repub-
lican members of the Appropriations
Committee for their hard work to se-
cure as many of our priorities as pos-
sible in this final package.
There were many other Members who
engaged in this process, and their input
was vital in producing a bill that re-
flects input from our Conference and
the constituents they represent.
It was also a pleasure to work with
my Senate Appropriations Committee
colleagues, Chairman RICHARD SHELBY
and Vice Chairman PAT LEAHY. They
are both incredibly tough negotiators.
Finally, and certainly not least, I
would like to thank the staff on both
sides of the aisle in the House and the
Senate who have worked virtually
around the clock for the last month to
bring this bill across the finish line. We
have true professionals working for our
committees, and I think I speak for all
Members when I say just how thankful
we are for their efforts.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
voting in favor of this bill, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I urge
support of the bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I
want to begin by thanking the Ranking Mem-
ber of the Homeland Security Appropriations

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10385
December 17, 2019
Subcommittee, Mr. FLEISCHMANN, for his pro-
fessionalism and partnership in putting this bill
together. I don’t believe either one of us is sat-
isfied with all aspects of the bill, but I am con-
fident that he and our staffs put their best foot
forward in trying to find compromise and reso-
lution.
When excluding major disaster funding and
funding for overseas contingency operations
by the Coast Guard, Division D of H.R. 1158
appropriates $50.5 billion for the Department
of Homeland Security. That total is $1.2 billion
below the budget request and $1.1 billion
above the FY2019 enacted level, including an
increase of $325 million for cybersecurity and
infrastructure security.
This bill significantly enhances oversight of
our immigration and detention enforcement ac-
tivities, including increases of:
$10 million for a new Office of Immigration
Detention Ombudsman to conduct unan-
nounced inspections of detention facilities and
investigate and resolve complaints about mis-
conduct by DHS personnel;
$20 million for the Inspector General for
oversight of detention and enforcement activi-
ties; and
$14 million for ICE’ s Office of Professional
Responsibility to increase the frequency and
rigor of detention inspections.
The bill increases funding for the Office of
Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention,
including $10 million for a grant program to
help communities develop strategies and pro-
grams to prevent targeted violence.
For CBP, while the bill is $43.7 million
below the FY2019 enacted level, it continues
to invest in smart border security technologies,
the hiring of customs officers to facilitate trade
and travel at the border, and humanitarian as-
sistance for migrants in CBP custody.
For ICE, the bill increases resources for Al-
ternatives to Detention to ensure immigrants
can remain in our communities while awaiting
their fair day in immigration court, but does not
increase detention beds above the FY2019
level.
There are no increases to hire new Border
Patrol Agents, or Immigration enforcement
personnel, and no funding above FY2019 for
border barriers.
The bill provides resources for:
TSA to manage increased passenger vol-
ume and to procure advanced detection tech-
nologies to make our airports safer and more
efficient; the Coast Guard to meet increased
mission requirements, including a down pay-
ment on a new Polar Security Cutter to ad-
vance our national interests in the Arctic; the
Secret Service to manage candidate protec-
tion for next year’s presidential election; and
increased resources for FEMA grant pro-
grams, including a total of $90 million for non-
profit security grants.
The bill also includes multiple oversight and
reporting directives related to immigration en-
forcement and detention, and it authorizes
members of Congress to make unannounced
oversight visits to detention facilities.
The other bills included in this minibus also
include priorities I support, including $7.6 bil-
lion for a fair and accurate census; a 3.1%
pay raise for our servicemembers and civil
servants; $425 million for election security
grants; and grant funding to address the sex-
ual assault kit and DNA evidence backlogs.
Unfortunately, the bill does not reclaim
Congress’s constitutional power of the purse.
House and Senate Republicans refused to in-
clude House bill provisions that would have
prevented the President from once again di-
verting other funds to augment appropriated
levels of border barrier and detention bed
funding.
To be clear, this bill is better for the Depart-
ment and for congressional oversight than if
we had turned to the only other alternative, a
year-long Continuing Resolution.
Nevertheless, it is an abdication of congres-
sional authority for this bill to continue allowing
the President to routinely ignore and cir-
cumvent congressional funding decisions.
Despite the many good things in this legisla-
tion, I cannot legitimize ceding that authority
once again to the President by voting for the
bill.
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise in op-
position to the House Amendment to the Sen-
ate Amendment to H.R. 1158, a funding pack-
age that wraps together the FY 2020 Depart-
ment of Defense and the FY 2020 Department
of Homeland Security funding bills. While I
support the other funding bills included in this
package, I am concerned and opposed to the
policies and priorities outlined in the Defense
and Homeland Security bill and will vote No.
I support our men and women in uniform
and ensuring they have the equipment and re-
sources they need to do their jobs. The 3.1%
military pay raise should be applauded.
The best way to support our men and
women is to ensure those funds are being well
spent rather than on things that do nothing to
enhance or security, that we do not need, and
which we cannot afford, but also for Congress
to reassert our authority to prevent dangerous
national security and foreign policy decisions,
that will have consequences for generations.
Among my concerns with the Defense bill is
continued and higher spending for the De-
fense Department with little or no oversight,
especially when it comes to wasteful spending
on overbudget programs. In this bill, we fund
one of the largest military budgets in history,
with little oversight to ensure we are getting
the best bang for the buck. As we have seen
with this capricious President, oversight is es-
sential and necessary.
I am also troubled by the decision to drop
the provision that would call for the repeal of
the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military
Force and for Congress to debate its replace-
ment. Congress’ war power is not self-exe-
cuting and we need to aggressively protect it.
We will never stop open ended war if we
never reconsider the open-ended authoriza-
tions that are feeding them. Yet, I am con-
cerned when you consider this omission com-
bined with the decision to drop key provisions
from the FY 2020 NDAA (that I voted to add
to that bill in the House) such as the provision
ending the 2002 AUMF for Iraq—which is out-
dated and needless. While the FY 2020 NDAA
included a provision providing paid leave to
federal employees, it dropped strong language
barring funding for an unauthorized war with
Iran and ending U.S. involvement in the hu-
manitarian catastrophe in Yemen.
This is the bill that funds the policies and
spending that was authorized in the NDAA
and I will vote NO.
Tomorrow, we’ll have a debate about the
Constitution and our authority, ability, and re-
sponsibility to hold the President accountable.
Well, we need a similar debate when it comes
to war and peace. The Constitution is clear
about Congress’ authority and yet every time
we punt on reasserting our authority to either
approve or disapprove sending our men and
women in uniform to war, we weaken our insti-
tution and our democracy.
Please know I will continue to work with my
colleagues and support legislation to address
the important House-passed provisions that
were left out of this legislation and the final FY
2020 NDAA.
I also oppose the Department of Homeland
Security funding bill. Neither this bill nor the
Defense bill include strong restrictions on the
President’s ability to transfer and move funds
for the border wall or to implement and en-
force his immoral and unlawful immigration
policies. From the terrible family separation
policy, to the remain in Mexico policy, to even
the decision by immigration authorities to ig-
nore the CDC recommendation that those in
detention be provided with flu shots during flu
season. According to media reports, last May,
a 16–year-old Guatemalan boy died in immi-
gration custody after being diagnosed with the
flu. This is just cruel.
I appreciate the work of my colleagues, from
Chairwoman LOWEY to Chairwomen ROYBAL-
ALLARD to add strong oversight provisions to
the bill and to end these harmful and ineffec-
tive immigration policies. Unfortunately, many
of those efforts were not included.
We can do better which is why I will vote
NO.
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I would like to
acknowledge that Division A of H.R. 1158,
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020’s Joint
Explanatory Statement to Division A, provided
an increase to the Industrial Base Analysis
and Sustainment Support program within the
Research, Development, Test and Evaluation,
Defense-Wide account. Specifically, a general
program increase of $10,000,000, a
$12,500,000 program increase for manufac-
turing engineering, a $20,000,000 program in-
crease for machine and advanced manufac-
turing, and a $5,000,000 program increase for
an interdisciplinary center for advanced manu-
facturing systems. These funds will allow the
Department of Defense to leverage existing
public-private-partnerships to establish a U.S.
based manufacturing development platform for
advanced microelectronic system integration,
including anti-tamper heterogeneous integra-
tion and foundational copper-based silicon
interposer technology.
The Industrial Base Analysis and
Sustainment program is dedicated to ensuring
that the Department of Defense is positioned
to more effectively, and efficiently, address in-
dustrial base issues, and support the National
Security Innovation Base. This includes the
ability to proactively mitigate supply chain
vulnerabilities within the global defense indus-
trial base, and to cultivate next generation,
emerging, defense manufacturing and tech-
nology sectors.
Continued U.S. global leadership in micro-
electronics depends on U.S. owned firms op-
erating at the leading edge of advanced logic
technologies and digital memories. The next
generation of electronic devices will require
significantly greater functional density, in other
words, packing functional components to-
gether even more tightly than current tech-
nology allows. This requires technical leader-
ship in microelectronics system integration,

specifically in the microelectronics manufac-
turing areas of integrating heterogeneous de-
vices, stacking memory, logic processing, sen-
sors, communications, and packaging with se-
curity and advanced interconnect methods.
One of the foundational technologies re-
quired for advanced system integration is cop-
per-based silicon interposer technology. This
foundational interposer technology can enable
almost any microelectronic dependent, or
internet of things, system. However, advanced
system integration capabilities have moved
offshore due to cost, and there currently is no
domestic sources that can reliably serve the
low volumes of advanced microelectronics that
the Department of Defense requires.
That is why there is a need for the Industrial
Base Analysis and Sustainment Support Pro-
gram to leverage existing public-private-part-
nerships to establish a U.S. based manufac-
turing development platform for advanced
microelectronic system integration, including
the foundational copperbased silicon inter-
poser technology. This funding increase will
help to accomplish this, and I thank the Chair-
woman for the overall funding increases for
the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment
Support Program within the Research, Devel-
opment, Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide
Account.
I want to express my gratitude and thank
Chairwoman LOWEY, Chairman VISCLOSKY,
and the full Committee for all their work on the
issue.
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I would like to
acknowledge that Division A of H.R. 1158,
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020’s Joint
Explanatory Statement to Division A, provided
an increase to the Trusted and Assured Micro-
electronics program within the Research, De-
velopment, Test and Evaluation, Defense-
Wide account. These funds will allow the De-
partment of Defense to leverage existing pub-
lic-private-partnerships to enable a U.S. based
manufacturing development platform for ad-
vanced microelectronic system integration, in-
cluding anti-tamper heterogeneous integration
and foundational copper-based silicon inter-
poser technology.
I want to express my gratitude to Chair-
woman LOWEY, Chairman VISCLOSKY, and the
full Committee for the inclusion of this funding
increase and for recognizing the urgent need
to invest in trusted foundries, advanced micro-
electronics cybersecurity, and manufacturing
capabilities that will translate our domestic re-
search into fielded capabilities for the
warfighter.
Ensuring quick, reliable, and secure access
to leading-edge microelectronics is often a
challenge. The changing global semiconductor
industry and the increasing sophistication of
U.S. adversaries require us to update our do-
mestic microelectronics security framework.
Continued U.S. global leadership in micro-
electronics depends on U.S. owned firms op-
erating at the leading edge of advanced logic
technologies and digital memories. The next
generation of electronic devices will require
significantly greater functional density, in other
words, packing functional components to-
gether even more tightly than current tech-
nology allows. This requires technical leader-
ship in microelectronics system integration,
specifically in the microelectronics manufac-
turing areas of integrating heterogeneous de-
vices, stacking memory, logic processing, sen-
sors, communications, and packaging with se-
curity and advanced interconnect methods.
One of the foundational technologies re-
quired for advanced system integration is cop-
per-based silicon interposer technology—also
known as heterogeneous integration. This
foundational interposer technology can enable
almost any microelectronic dependent, or
internet of things, system. However, advanced
system integration capabilities have moved
offshore due to cost, and there currently is no
domestic sources that can reliably serve the
low volumes of advanced microelectronics that
the Department of Defense requires. That’s
why this funding is so critical. We must invest
in these advanced integrated capabilities so
we can secure our microelectronic systems
that our service members depend on.
Again, I support disruptive science and tech-
nology that enables a rapid modernization of
our trusted and assured microelectronics sys-
tems. I thank my colleagues for their shared
support.
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I would like to
acknowledge that Division A of H.R. 1158,
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020’s Joint
Explanatory Statement to Division A, provided
an increase to the Defense-Wide Manufac-
turing Science and Technology Program within
the Research, Development, Test and Evalua-
tion, Defense-Wide account. Specifically, a
general program increase of $20,000,000, a
$5,000,000 program increase for manufac-
turing engineering programs, a $10,000,000
program increase for manufacturing innovation
institutes, a $10,000,000 program increase for
advanced manufacturing, and a $14,000,000
program increase for manufacturing cyberse-
curity.
I want to express my gratitude to Chair-
woman LOWEY, Chairman VISCLOSKY, and the
full Committee for the inclusion of joint explan-
atory language to the bill noting the impor-
tance of obtaining advanced microelectronics
manufacturing, in support of the defense in-
dustrial base, from trusted domestic suppliers.
Ensuring quick, reliable, and secure access
to leading-edge microelectronics is often a
challenge. The changing global semiconductor
industry and the increasing sophistication of
U.S. adversaries require us to update our do-
mestic microelectronics security framework by
establishing a comprehensive, public-private
partnership-structured microelectronics cyber-
security center.
This center can provide the defense indus-
trial base with access to manufacturing re-
sources to support antitamper, devices, hard-
ware security, and other evolving new concept
technologies that support trusted and assured
manufacturing, combined with advanced sys-
tem integration and packaging technologies—
known as heterogeneous integration.
The Defense-Wide Manufacturing Science
and Technology Program enables the Depart-
ment of Defense to advance reliable and se-
cure state-of-the-art technologies. The funding
increase provided in this legislation, along with
the increased funding for advanced manufac-
turing, will facilitate America’s innovative, se-
cure, and domestic foundry operations and
greatly contribute to our national defense
through the establishment of a microelec-
tronics cybersecurity center structured as a
public-private partnership.
Again, I thank the Committee for recog-
nizing the urgent need to invest in trusted
foundries, advanced microelectronics cyberse-
curity, and manufacturing capabilities that will
translate our domestic research into fielded
capabilities for the warfighter. I would like to
thank Chairwoman LOWEY, Chairman VIS-
CLOSKY, and the full Committee for all their
work on the issue.
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I would like to
acknowledge that Division A of H.R. 1158,
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020’s Joint
Explanatory Statement to Division A, provided
an increase to the Soldier Lethality Tech-
nology Program within the Research, Develop-
ment, Test and Evaluation, Army account.
Specifically, a general program increase of
$5,000,000.
I want to express my gratitude to Chair-
woman LOWEY, Chairman VISCLOSKY, and the
full Committee for the inclusion of this funding
increase. These funds allow the Army Re-
search Lab to conduct work on a number of
important disruptive science and technology
programs, including millimeter-wave imager
sensor technology needed to improve situa-
tional awareness to our service men and
women.
Ensuring access to low cost imager sensors
to provide leap-ahead capability in urban com-
bat and situational awareness will enable
troops to move, communicate, protect, and
sustain themselves better in any combat envi-
ronment. Such sensors can be used in a re-
connaissance role, with the ability to see in-
habitants within building structures and pro-
vide significant situational insight within dense
urban environments.
Again, I support the modernization of the
U.S. Army and to support disruptive science
and technology. I thank my colleagues for
their shared support.

sional Budget Act of 1974(2 U.S.C. 661a)) of

informed consent of the affected tenants and
use of other available remedies, such as par-
tial abatements or receivership. After dis-

scribed under this section, the contract and
allowable rent levels on such properties shall
be subject to the requirements under section
524 of MAHRAA.
SEC. 213. Public housing agencies that own
and operate 400 or fewer public housing units
may elect to be exempt from any asset man-
agement requirement imposed by the Sec-

Acts for the operation, capital improvement
and management of public housing as au-
thorized by sections 9(d) and 9(e) of the
United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.
1437g(d) and (e)), the Secretary shall not im-
pose any requirement or guideline relating
to asset management that restricts or limits
in any way the use of capital funds for cen-
tral office costs pursuant to section 9(g)(1) or
9(g)(2) of the United States Housing Act of
1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)): Provided, That

funds authorized under section 9(d) for ac-

for assistance with amounts from the oper-
ating fund in excess of the amounts per-
mitted under section 9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2).
SEC. 215. No official or employee of the De-
partment of Housing and Urban Development
shall be designated as an allotment holder
unless the Office of the Chief Financial Offi-
cer has determined that such allotment hold-
er has implemented an adequate system of

funds control procedures and directives. The
Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that
there is a trained allotment holder for each
HUD appropriation under the accounts ‘‘Ex-
ecutive Offices’’, ‘‘Administrative Support
Offices’’, ‘‘Program Offices’’, ‘‘Government
National Mortgage Association—Guarantees
of Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan Guar-
antee Program Account’’, and ‘‘Office of In-
spector General’’ within the Department of
Housing and Urban Development.

of Housing and Urban Development shall, for
fiscal year 2020, notify the public through
the Federal Register and other means, as de-
termined appropriate, of the issuance of a

tice of funding availability (NOFA) for any

Internet at the appropriate Government web
site or through other electronic media, as de-
termined by the Secretary.

gram-related litigation shall be paid from

SEC. 163. CONCERNS OVER PDVSA TRANS-
ACTIONS WITH ROSNEFT.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) In late 2016, Venezuelan state-owned oil
company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (re-
ferred to in this section as ‘‘PDVSA’’),
through a no compete transaction, secured a
loan from Russian government-controlled oil
company Rosneft, using 49.9 percent of
PDVSA’s American subsidiary, CITGO Pe-
troleum Corporation, including its assets in
the United States, as collateral. As a result
of this transaction, 100 percent of CITGO is
held as collateral by PDVSA’s creditors.
(2) CITGO, a wholly owned subsidiary of
PDVSA, is engaged in interstate commerce
and owns and controls critical energy infra-
structure in 19 States of the United States,
including an extensive network of pipelines,
48 terminals, and 3 refineries, with a com-
bined oil refining capacity of 749,000 barrels
per day. CITGO’s refinery in Lake Charles,
Louisiana, is the sixth largest refinery in the
United States.
(3) The Department of the Treasury im-
posed sanctions on Rosneft, which is con-
trolled by the Government of the Russian
Federation, and its Executive Chairman,
Igor Sechin, following Russia’s military in-
vasion of Ukraine and its illegal annexation
of Crimea in 2014.
(4) The Department of Homeland Security
has designated the energy sector as critical
to United States infrastructure.
(5) The growing economic crisis in Ven-
ezuela raises the probability that the
Maduro regime and PDVSA will default on
their international debt obligations, result-
ing in a scenario in which Rosneft could
come into control of CITGO’s United States
energy infrastructure holdings.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) control of critical United States energy
infrastructure by Rosneft, a Russian govern-
ment-controlled entity currently under
United States sanctions that is led by Igor
Sechin, who is also under United States
sanctions and is a close associate of Vladimir
Putin, would pose a significant risk to
United States national security and energy
security; and
(2) a default by PDVSA on its loan from
Rosneft, resulting in Rosneft coming into
possession of PDVSA’s United States CITGO
assets, would warrant careful consideration
by the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the United States.
(c) PREVENTING ROSNEFT FROM CONTROL-
LING UNITED STATES ENERGY INFRASTRUC-
TURE.—The President shall take all nec-
essary steps to prevent Rosneft from gaining
control of critical United States energy in-
frastructure.
(d) SECURITY RISK REPORT.—Not later than
90 days after the date of the enactment of
this Act, the President shall submit a report
assessing the national security risks posed
by potential Russian acquisition and control
of CITGO’s United States energy infrastruc-
ture holdings to—
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations of
the Senate;
(2) the Committee on Homeland Security
and Governmental Affairs of the Senate;

TITLE II—EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
SECURITY AND ENERGY PARTNERSHIP
SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Eastern
Mediterranean Security and Energy Partner-
ship Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 202. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) The security of partners and allies in
the Eastern Mediterranean region is critical
to the security of the United States and Eu-
rope.
(2) Greece is a valuable member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
and a key pillar of stability in the Eastern
Mediterranean.
(3) Israel is a steadfast ally of the United
States and has been designated a ‘‘major
non-NATO ally’’ and ‘‘major strategic part-
ner’’.
(4) Cyprus is a key strategic partner and
signed a Statement of Intent with the United
States on November 6, 2018, to enhance bilat-
eral security cooperation.
(5) The countries of Greece, Cyprus, and
Israel have participated in critical trilateral
summits to improve cooperation on energy
and security issues.
(6) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo par-
ticipated in the trilateral summit among
Israel, Greece, and Cyprus on March 20, 2019.
(7) The United States, Israel, Greece, and
Cyprus oppose any action in the Eastern
Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea that
could challenge stability, violate inter-
national law, or undermine good neighborly
relations, and in a joint declaration on
March 21, 2019, agreed to ‘‘defend against ex-
ternal malign influences in the Eastern Med-
iterranean and the broader Middle East’’.
(8) The recent discovery of what may be
the region’s largest natural gas field off the
Egyptian coast and the newest discoveries of
natural gas off the coast of Cyprus could rep-
resent a significant and positive develop-
ment for the Eastern Mediterranean and the
Middle East, enhancing the region’s stra-
tegic energy significance.
(9) It is in the national security interest of
the United States to promote, achieve, and
maintain energy security among, and
through cooperation with, allies.
(10) Natural gas developments in the East-
ern Mediterranean have the potential to pro-
vide economic gains and contribute to en-
ergy security in the region and Europe, as
well as support European efforts to diversify
away from natural gas supplied by the Rus-
sian Federation.
(11) The soon to be completed Trans Adri-
atic Pipeline is a critical component of the
Southern Gas Corridor and the European
Union’s efforts to diversify energy resources.
(12) The proposed Eastern Mediterranean
pipeline, if commercially viable, would pro-
vide for energy diversification in accordance
with the European Union’s third energy
package of reforms.
(13) The United States acknowledges the
achievements and importance of the Bina-
tional Industrial Research and Development
Foundation (BIRD) and the United States-
Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF)
and supports continued multiyear funding to
ensure the continuity of the programs of the
Foundations.
(14) The United States has welcomed
Greece’s allocation of 2 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP) to defense in accord-
ance with commitments made at the 2014
NATO Summit in Wales.
(15) Energy exploration in the Eastern
Mediterranean region must be safeguarded
against threats posed by terrorist and ex-
tremist groups, including Hezbollah and any
other actor in the region.
(16) The energy exploration in the Republic
of Cyprus’s Exclusive Economic Zone and
territorial waters—
(A) furthers United States interests by pro-
viding a potential alternative to Russian gas
for United States allies and partners; and
(B) should not be impeded by other sov-
ereign states.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10534 December 17, 2019
(17) The United States Government cooper-
ates closely with Cyprus, Greece, and Israel
through information sharing agreements.
(18) United States officials have assisted
the Government of the Republic of Cyprus
with crafting that nation’s national security
strategy.
(19) The United States Government pro-
vides training to Cypriot officials in areas
such as cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and
explosive ordnance disposal and stockpile
management.
(20) Israel, Greece, and Cyprus are valued
members of the Proliferation Security Ini-
tiative to combat the trafficking of weapons
of mass destruction.
(21) The Republic of Cyprus continues to
work closely with the United Nations and re-
gional partners in Europe to combat ter-
rorism and violent extremism.
(22) Despite robust economic and security
relations with the United States, the Repub-
lic of Cyprus has been subject to a United
States prohibition on the export of defense
articles and services since 1987.
(23) The 1987 arms prohibition was designed
to restrict United States arms sales and
transfers to the Republic of Cyprus and the
occupied part of Cyprus to avoid hindering
reunification efforts.
(24) At least 40,000 Turkish troops are sta-
tioned in the occupied part of Cyprus with
some weapons procured from the United
States through mainland Turkey.
(25) While the United States has, as a mat-
ter of policy, avoided the provision of de-
fense articles and services to the Republic of
Cyprus, the Government of Cyprus has, in
the past, sought to obtain defense articles
from other countries, including countries,
such as Russia, that pose challenges to
United States interests around the world.
SEC. 203. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
It is the policy of the United States—

ners and allies to deepen energy security co-
operation among Greece, Cyprus, and Israel
and to encourage the private sector to make
investments in energy infrastructure in the
Eastern Mediterranean region;
(3) to strongly support the completion of
the Trans Adriatic and Eastern Mediterra-
nean Pipelines and the establishment of
liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals across
the Eastern Mediterranean as a means of di-
versifying regional energy needs away from
the Russian Federation;
(4) to maintain a robust United States
naval presence and investments in the naval
facility at Souda Bay, Greece and develop
deeper security cooperation with Greece to
include the recent MQ–9 deployments to the
Larissa Air Force Base and United States
Army helicopter training in central Greece;
(5) to welcome Greece’s commitment to
move forward with the Interconnector
Greece-Bulgaria (IGB pipeline) and addi-
tional LNG terminals that will help facili-
tate delivery of non-Russian gas to the Bal-
kans and central Europe;
(6) to support deepened security coopera-
tion with the Republic of Cyprus through the
removal of the arms embargo on the coun-
try;
(7) to support robust International Mili-
tary Education and Training (IMET) pro-
gramming with Greece and the Republic of
Cyprus;
(8) to leverage relationships within the Eu-
ropean Union to encourage investments in
Cypriot border and maritime security;
(9) to support efforts to counter Russian
Federation interference and influence in the
Eastern Mediterranean through increased se-
curity cooperation with Greece, Cyprus, and
Israel, to include intelligence sharing, cyber,
and maritime domain awareness;
(10) to support the Republic of Cyprus’ ef-
forts to regulate its banking industry to en-
sure that it is not used as a source of inter-
national money laundering and encourage
additional measures toward that end;
(11) to strongly oppose any actions that
would trigger mandatory sanctions pursuant
to section 231 of the Countering America’s
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act
(CAATSA) (Public Law 115–44), to include the
purchase of military equipment from the
Russian Federation;
(12) to continue robust official strategic
engagement with Israel, Greece, and Cyprus;
(13) to urge countries in the region to deny
port services to Russian Federation vessels
deployed to support the government of
Bashar Al-Assad in Syria;
(14) to support joint military exercises
among Israel, Greece, and Cyprus;
(15) to fully implement relevant CAATSA
provisions to prevent interference by the
Russian Federation in the region;
(16) to support efforts by countries in the
region to demobilize military equipment
supplied by the Russian Federation in favor
of equipment provided by NATO and NATO-
allied member countries; and
(17) to strongly support the active and ro-
bust participation of Israel, Cyprus, and
Greece in the Combating Terrorism Fellow-
ship Program.

NEAN ENERGY COOPERATION.

Congress that—
(1) allowing for the export, re-export or
transfer of arms subject to the United States
Munitions List (part 121 of title 22, Code of

prus would advance United States security

lic of Cyprus on other countries, including
countries that pose challenges to United
States interests around the world, for de-
fense-related materiel; and

should fully consider evolving research on
the impact of NTDs on efforts to control
HIV/AIDS when making future programming
decisions, as necessary and appropriate.
(b) GLOBAL PROGRAMMING.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of State
should encourage the Global Fund to take
into consideration evolving research on the
impact of NTDs on efforts to control HIV/
AIDS when making programming decisions,
particularly with regard to female genital
schistosomiasis, which studies suggest may
be one of the most significant cofactors in
the AIDS epidemic in Africa, as necessary
and appropriate.

HEALTH INSTITUTIONS.
(a) FINDING.—Congress finds that the treat-
ment of NTDs, including community- and
school-based deworming programs, can be a
highly cost-effective intervention, and
schools can serve as an effective delivery
mechanism for reaching large numbers of
children with safe treatment for soil-trans-
mitted helminthiases (roundworm,
whipworm, and hookworm) in particular.
(b) UNITED NATIONS.—The President should
direct the United States Permanent Rep-
resentative to the United Nations to use the
voice, vote, and influence of the United
States to urge the World Health Organiza-
tion and the United Nations Development
Programme to—

school-based deworming programs on chil-
dren’s health and education, emphasizing the
cost-effectiveness of such programs;
(3) encourage governments to implement
deworming campaigns at the national level;
(4) consider the designation of a portion of
grant funds of the institutions to deworming
initiatives and cross-sectoral collaboration
with water, sanitation, and hygiene efforts
and nutrition or education programming, as
practicable and appropriate;
(5) encourage accurate monitoring and
evaluation of NTD programs, including
deworming programs; and

TITLE IV—PREVENTING CHILD MARRIAGE
IN DISPLACED POPULATIONS
SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Preventing
Child Marriage in Displaced Populations
Act’’.
SEC. 402. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) According to United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF), 12,000,000 girls marry before
the age of 18 every year.
(2) Early marriage denies children, espe-
cially girls, their right to make vital deci-
sions about their well-being, including relat-
ing to their health, family, and career. Child
brides are less likely to finish their edu-
cation, and are at higher risk for abuse, con-
tracting HIV, and dying while pregnant or
giving birth.
(3) Child marriage also imposes substantial
economic costs to developing countries, im-
peding development and prosperity gains.
(4) Displaced populations are particularly
vulnerable to child marriage, in commu-
nities where poverty, instability, and dis-
placement put pressure on families to marry
children, particularly young girls, off at a
young age.
(5) One United Nations (UN) study found
that child marriage rates were 4 times high-
er among displaced Syrian refugees than
among Syrians before the crisis. This indi-
cates that displacement, instability, and
poverty are driving child marriages.
(6) United Nations agencies, including
UNICEF and the United Nations High Com-
missioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have ac-
knowledged the dangers of child marriage
and taken steps to address its risk in the
populations they serve.
(7) The UN Joint Program on Child Mar-
riage supports this work by building the re-
silience of populations to indirectly prevent
child marriage and by generating new data
and evidence on the prevalence of child mar-
riage in humanitarian and fragile settings.
For example, in Uganda, the UN Joint Pro-
gram on Child Marriage helped 27,000 adoles-
cent girls strengthen critical skills through
school clubs and Go Back to School cam-
paigns, as well as life skills and financial lit-
eracy training.
(8) After the UN Joint Program on Child
Marriage identified Yemen as one of its focus
countries, 65,000 people, of whom 45,000 are
adolescents, were reached with awareness-
raising activities on the harms of child mar-
riage in 2018 alone. As a result, local council
representatives, elders, and community lead-
ers from 6 districts signed a pledge to sup-
port advocacy efforts to end child marriage.
SEC. 403. PREVENTING CHILD MARRIAGE IN DIS-
PLACED POPULATIONS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The President shall direct
the United States Permanent Representative
to the United Nations to use the voice, vote,
and influence of the United States at the
United Nations to call for an adoption of an
agreed upon definition of ‘‘child marriage’’
across United Nations agencies.
(b) STRATEGY.—The President shall direct
the United States Permanent Representative
to the United Nations to use the voice, vote,
and influence of the United States at the
United Nations to call for the development
of a comprehensive strategy to address child
marriage in refugee settlements adminis-
tered by the United Nations. The strategy
should include the following elements:
(1) A mandate to regularly collect and re-
port data related to the number of known or
suspected child marriages taking place in-
side each such settlement.
(2) Protocols for United Nations personnel
regarding prevention and monitoring of child
marriages inside each such settlement.
(3) A description of United Nations pro-
grams administered at such settlements that
include—
(A) physical, mental, and emotional reha-
bilitation and support to children who have
extricated themselves from child marriage;
and
(B) alternatives to child marriage, such as
education initiatives.
(4) Protocols regarding how United Nations
personnel should—
(A) report adults participating in illegal
child marriages in each such settlement; and
(B) monitor the prosecution of such adults
by the authorities of the country in which
the settlement at issue is located.
(c) RESEARCH.—The President shall direct
the United States Permanent Representative
to the United Nations to use the voice, vote,
and influence of the United States at the
United Nations to advocate for the United
Nations and its appropriate agencies to in-
clude, as appropriate, in all of its research
regarding child marriage, the relationship
between child marriage and violence against
girls, including young children and infants.
(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section:
(1) CHILD MARRIAGE.—The term ‘‘child mar-
riage’’ means a formal marriage or informal
union involving at least one person younger
than age 18.
(2) ILLEGAL CHILD MARRIAGE.—The term ‘‘il-
legal child marriage’’ means a child mar-
riage that is illegal under the laws of the
country in which the child marriage occurs.

TITLE VI—COMBATING WILDLIFE
TRAFFICKING
SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Rescuing
Animals With Rewards Act of 2019’’ or the
‘‘RAWR Act’’.
SEC. 602. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) Wildlife trafficking is a major
transnational crime that is estimated to
generate over $10 billion a year in illegal
profits and which is increasingly perpetrated
by organized, sophisticated criminal enter-
prises, including known terrorist organiza-
tions.
(2) Wildlife trafficking not only threatens
endangered species worldwide, but also jeop-
ardizes local security, spreads disease, under-
mines rule of law, fuels corruption, and dam-
ages economic development.
(3) Combating wildlife trafficking requires
a coordinated and sustained approach at the
global, regional, national, and local levels.
(4) Congress stated in the Eliminate, Neu-
tralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act
of 2016 that it is the policy of the United
States to take immediate actions to stop the
illegal global trade in wildlife and wildlife
products and associated transnational orga-
nized crime.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that the Department of State’s re-
wards program is a powerful tool in com-
bating sophisticated international crime and
that the Department of State and Federal
law enforcement should work in concert to
offer rewards that target wildlife traffickers.
SEC. 603. WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING PREVENTION
AWARDS PROGRAM.
Subparagraph (B) of section 36(k)(5) of the
State Department Basic Authorities Act of
1956 (22 U.S.C. 2708(k)(5)) is amended by in-
serting ‘‘wildlife trafficking (as defined by
section 2(12) of the Eliminate, Neutralize,
and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016
(16 U.S.C. 7601(12); Public Law 114–231)) and’’

BUSINESS THROUGH DIPLOMACY
SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Cham-
pioning American Business Through Diplo-
macy Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 702. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) According to the 2017 National Security
Strategy of the United States of America,
‘‘Retaining our position as the world’s pre-
eminent economic actor strengthens our
ability to use the tools of economic diplo-
macy for the good of Americans and oth-
ers.’’.
(2) A November 7, 2018, cable from Sec-
retary of State Michael R. Pompeo to all dip-
lomatic and consular posts—‘‘Boosting Com-
mercial Diplomacy Around the World’’—stat-
ed that ‘‘helping American companies is a
foreign policy priority. . .Promoting broad-
based, responsible, and sustainable economic
growth helps to stabilize regions and creates
new and growing markets for U.S. compa-
nies. A transparent and level playing field
for U.S. investment in these countries
counters real and growing challenges such as
China’s Belt and Road initiative.’’.
(3) In the January–February 2019 issue of
The Foreign Service Journal, Ambassador
Barbara Stephenson, the President of the
American Foreign Service Association,
wrote, ‘‘Foreign Service support for Amer-
ican business. . .is a major reason why the
U.S. Foreign Service was created.’’.

NOMIC INTERESTS.—Each chief of mission to a

relief under this subsection in an appropriate
district court of the United States alleging
that the license holder has declined to pro-
vide sufficient quantities of the covered
product to the eligible product developer on
commercially reasonable, market-based
terms.
(2) ELEMENTS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—To prevail in a civil ac-
tion brought under paragraph (1), an eligible
product developer shall prove, by a prepon-
derance of the evidence—
(i) that—
(I) the covered product is not subject to a
REMS with ETASU; or
(II) if the covered product is subject to a
REMS with ETASU—
(aa) the eligible product developer has ob-
tained a covered product authorization from
the Secretary in accordance with subpara-
graph (B); and
(bb) the eligible product developer has pro-
vided a copy of the covered product author-
ization to the license holder;
(ii) that, as of the date on which the civil
action is filed, the eligible product developer
has not obtained sufficient quantities of the
covered product on commercially reasonable,
market-based terms;
(iii) that the eligible product developer has
submitted a written request to purchase suf-
ficient quantities of the covered product to
the license holder, and such request—
(I) was sent to a named corporate officer of
the license holder;
(II) was made by certified or registered
mail with return receipt requested;
(III) specified an individual as the point of
contact for the license holder to direct com-
munications related to the sale of the cov-
ered product to the eligible product devel-
oper and a means for electronic and written
communications with that individual; and
(IV) specified an address to which the cov-
ered product was to be shipped upon reaching
an agreement to transfer the covered prod-
uct; and
(iv) that the license holder has not deliv-
ered to the eligible product developer suffi-
cient quantities of the covered product on
commercially reasonable, market-based
terms—
(I) for a covered product that is not subject
to a REMS with ETASU, by the date that is
31 days after the date on which the license
holder received the request for the covered
product; and
(II) for a covered product that is subject to
a REMS with ETASU, by 31 days after the
later of—
(aa) the date on which the license holder
received the request for the covered product;
or
(bb) the date on which the license holder
received a copy of the covered product au-
thorization issued by the Secretary in ac-
cordance with subparagraph (B).
(B) AUTHORIZATION FOR COVERED PRODUCT
SUBJECT TO A REMS WITH ETASU.—
(i) REQUEST.—An eligible product developer
may submit to the Secretary a written re-
quest for the eligible product developer to be
authorized to obtain sufficient quantities of
an individual covered product subject to a
REMS with ETASU.

days after the date on which a request under
clause (i) is received, the Secretary shall, by
written notice, authorize the eligible product
developer to obtain sufficient quantities of
an individual covered product subject to a
REMS with ETASU for purposes of—
(I) development and testing that does not
involve human clinical trials, if the eligible
product developer has agreed to comply with
any conditions the Secretary determines
necessary; or
(II) development and testing that involves
human clinical trials, if the eligible product
developer has—
(aa)(AA) submitted protocols, informed
consent documents, and informational mate-
rials for testing that include protections
that provide safety protections comparable
to those provided by the REMS for the cov-
ered product; or
(BB) otherwise satisfied the Secretary that
such protections will be provided; and
(bb) met any other requirements the Sec-
retary may establish.
(iii) NOTICE.—A covered product authoriza-
tion issued under this subparagraph shall
state that the provision of the covered prod-
uct by the license holder under the terms of
the authorization will not be a violation of
the REMS for the covered product.
(3) AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.—In a civil action
brought under paragraph (1), it shall be an
affirmative defense, on which the defendant
has the burden of persuasion by a preponder-
ance of the evidence—

ficient quantities of the covered product
from the license holder—

agents, wholesalers, or distributors was en-
gaged in the manufacturing or commercial
marketing of the covered product; and

(B) that—
(i) the license holder sells the covered
product through agents, distributors, or
wholesalers;
(ii) the license holder has placed no restric-
tions, explicit or implicit, on its agents, dis-
tributors, or wholesalers to sell covered
products to eligible product developers; and
(iii) the covered product can be purchased

cient quantities on commercially reasonable,
market-based terms from the agents, dis-
tributors, or wholesalers of the license hold-
er; or
(C) that the license holder made an offer to
the individual specified pursuant to para-
graph (2)(A)(iii)(III), by a means of commu-
nication (electronic, written, or both) speci-
fied pursuant to such paragraph, to sell suffi-
cient quantities of the covered product to
the eligible product developer at commer-
cially reasonable market-based terms—
(i) for a covered product that is not subject

product, and the eligible product developer
did not accept such offer by the date that is
7 days after the date on which the eligible
product developer received such offer from
the license holder; or
(ii) for a covered product that is subject to
a REMS with ETASU, by the date that is 20

holder received the request for the covered
product, and the eligible product developer

10 days after the date on which the eligible
product developer received such offer from
the license holder.
(4) REMEDIES.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—If an eligible product de-
veloper prevails in a civil action brought
under paragraph (1), the court shall—
(i) order the license holder to provide to
the eligible product developer without delay
sufficient quantities of the covered product
on commercially reasonable, market-based
terms;
(ii) award to the eligible product developer
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of the
civil action; and
(iii) award to the eligible product devel-
oper a monetary amount sufficient to deter
the license holder from failing to provide eli-
gible product developers with sufficient
quantities of a covered product on commer-
cially reasonable, market-based terms, if the
court finds, by a preponderance of the evi-
dence—
(I) that the license holder delayed pro-
viding sufficient quantities of the covered
product to the eligible product developer
without a legitimate business justification;
or
(II) that the license holder failed to comply
with an order issued under clause (i).
(B) MAXIMUM MONETARY AMOUNT.—A mone-
tary amount awarded under subparagraph
(A)(iii) shall not be greater than the revenue
that the license holder earned on the covered
product during the period—
(i) beginning on—
(I) for a covered product that is not subject
to a REMS with ETASU, the date that is 31
days after the date on which the license
holder received the request; or
(II) for a covered product that is subject to
a REMS with ETASU, the date that is 31
days after the later of—
(aa) the date on which the license holder
received the request; or
(bb) the date on which the license holder
received a copy of the covered product au-
thorization issued by the Secretary in ac-
cordance with paragraph (2)(B); and
(ii) ending on the date on which the eligi-
ble product developer received sufficient
quantities of the covered product.
(C) AVOIDANCE OF DELAY.—The court may
issue an order under subparagraph (A)(i) be-
fore conducting further proceedings that
may be necessary to determine whether the
eligible product developer is entitled to an
award under clause (ii) or (iii) of subpara-
graph (A), or the amount of any such award.
(c) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.—A license
holder for a covered product shall not be lia-
ble for any claim under Federal, State, or
local law arising out of the failure of an eli-
gible product developer to follow adequate
safeguards to assure safe use of the covered
product during development or testing ac-
tivities described in this section, including
transportation, handling, use, or disposal of
the covered product by the eligible product
developer.
(d) NO VIOLATION OF REMS.—Section 505–1
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(21 U.S.C. 355–1) is amended by adding at the
end the following new subsection:
‘‘(l) PROVISION OF SAMPLES NOT A VIOLA-
TION OF STRATEGY.—The provision of samples
of a covered product to an eligible product
developer (as those terms are defined in sec-
tion 610(a) of division N of the Further Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2020) shall not
be considered a violation of the requirements
of any risk evaluation and mitigation strat-
egy that may be in place under this section
for such drug.’’.
(e) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—
(1) DEFINITION.—In this subsection, the
term ‘‘antitrust laws’’—
(A) has the meaning given the term in sub-
section (a) of the first section of the Clayton
Act (15 U.S.C. 12); and
(B) includes section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent
that such section applies to unfair methods
of competition.
(2) ANTITRUST LAWS.—Nothing in this sec-
tion shall be construed to limit the oper-
ation of any provision of the antitrust laws.
(f) REMS APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUBSE-
QUENT FILERS.—Section 505–1 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355–
1), as amended by subsection (d), is further
amended—
(1) in subsection (g)(4)(B)—
(A) in clause (i) by striking ‘‘or’’ after the
semicolon;
(B) in clause (ii) by striking the period at
the end and inserting ‘‘; or’’; and
(C) by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(iii) accommodate different, comparable
aspects of the elements to assure safe use for
a drug that is the subject of an application
under section 505(j), and the applicable listed
drug.’’;
(2) in subsection (i)(1), by striking subpara-
graph (C) and inserting the following:
‘‘(C)(i) Elements to assure safe use, if re-
quired under subsection (f) for the listed
drug, which, subject to clause (ii), for a drug
that is the subject of an application under
section 505(j) may use—
‘‘(I) a single, shared system with the listed
drug under subsection (f); or
‘‘(II) a different, comparable aspect of the
elements to assure safe use under subsection
(f).
‘‘(ii) The Secretary may require a drug
that is the subject of an application under
section 505(j) and the listed drug to use a sin-
gle, shared system under subsection (f), if
the Secretary determines that no different,
comparable aspect of the elements to assure
safe use could satisfy the requirements of
subsection (f).’’;
(3) in subsection (i), by adding at the end
the following:
‘‘(3) SHARED REMS.—If the Secretary ap-
proves, in accordance with paragraph
(1)(C)(i)(II), a different, comparable aspect of
the elements to assure safe use under sub-
section (f) for a drug that is the subject of an
abbreviated new drug application under sec-
tion 505(j), the Secretary may require that
such different comparable aspect of the ele-
ments to assure safe use can be used with re-
spect to any other drug that is the subject of
an application under section 505(j) or 505(b)
that references the same listed drug.’’; and
(4) by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(m) SEPARATE REMS.—When used in this
section, the term ‘different, comparable as-
pect of the elements to assure safe use’
means a risk evaluation and mitigation
strategy for a drug that is the subject of an
application under section 505(j) that uses dif-
ferent methods or operational means than
the strategy required under subsection (a)
for the applicable listed drug, or other appli-
cation under section 505(j) with the same
such listed drug, but achieves the same level
of safety as such strategy.’’.
(g) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in
this section, the amendments made by this
section, or in section 505–1 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355–
1), shall be construed as—
(1) prohibiting a license holder from pro-
viding an eligible product developer access
to a covered product in the absence of an au-
thorization under this section; or
(2) in any way negating the applicability of
a REMS with ETASU, as otherwise required
under such section 505–1, with respect to
such covered product.

SEC. 101. MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLANS; POOLED
EMPLOYER PLANS.
(a) QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 413 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding
at the end the following new subsection:
‘‘(e) APPLICATION OF QUALIFICATION RE-
QUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN MULTIPLE EM-
PLOYER PLANS WITH POOLED PLAN PRO-
VIDERS.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in
paragraph (2), if a defined contribution plan
to which subsection (c) applies—
‘‘(A) is maintained by employers which
have a common interest other than having
adopted the plan, or
‘‘(B) in the case of a plan not described in
subparagraph (A), has a pooled plan provider,
then the plan shall not be treated as failing
to meet the requirements under this title ap-
plicable to a plan described in section 401(a)
or to a plan that consists of individual re-
tirement accounts described in section 408
(including by reason of subsection (c) there-
of), whichever is applicable, merely because
one or more employers of employees covered
by the plan fail to take such actions as are
required of such employers for the plan to
meet such requirements.
‘‘(2) LIMITATIONS.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Paragraph (1) shall not
apply to any plan unless the terms of the
plan provide that in the case of any em-
ployer in the plan failing to take the actions
described in paragraph (1)—
‘‘(i) the assets of the plan attributable to
employees of such employer (or beneficiaries
of such employees) will be transferred to a
plan maintained only by such employer (or
its successor), to an eligible retirement plan
as defined in section 402(c)(8)(B) for each in-
dividual whose account is transferred, or to
any other arrangement that the Secretary
determines is appropriate, unless the Sec-
retary determines it is in the best interests
of the employees of such employer (and the
beneficiaries of such employees) to retain
the assets in the plan, and
‘‘(ii) such employer (and not the plan with
respect to which the failure occurred or any
other employer in such plan) shall, except to
the extent provided by the Secretary, be lia-
ble for any liabilities with respect to such
plan attributable to employees of such em-
ployer (or beneficiaries of such employees).
‘‘(B) FAILURES BY POOLED PLAN PRO-
VIDERS.—If the pooled plan provider of a plan
described in paragraph (1)(B) does not per-
form substantially all of the administrative
duties which are required of the provider
under paragraph (3)(A)(i) for any plan year,
the Secretary may provide that the deter-
mination as to whether the plan meets the
requirements under this title applicable to a
plan described in section 401(a) or to a plan
that consists of individual retirement ac-
counts described in section 408 (including by
reason of subsection (c) thereof), whichever
is applicable, shall be made in the same man-
ner as would be made without regard to
paragraph (1).
‘‘(3) POOLED PLAN PROVIDER.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sub-
section, the term ‘pooled plan provider’
means, with respect to any plan, a person
who—
‘‘(i) is designated by the terms of the plan
as a named fiduciary (within the meaning of
section 402(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974), as the plan ad-
ministrator, and as the person responsible to
perform all administrative duties (including
conducting proper testing with respect to
the plan and the employees of each employer
in the plan) which are reasonably necessary
to ensure that—

equal age, and a single life annuity. Such
lifetime income streams may have a term
certain or other features to the extent per-
mitted under rules prescribed by the Sec-
retary.
‘‘(ii) MODEL DISCLOSURE.—Not later than 1
year after the date of the enactment of the
Setting Every Community Up for Retire-
ment Enhancement Act of 2019, the Sec-
retary shall issue a model lifetime income
disclosure, written in a manner so as to be
understood by the average plan participant,

‘‘(I) explains that the lifetime income
stream equivalent is only provided as an il-
lustration;
‘‘(II) explains that the actual payments

in clause (i)(III) which may be purchased
with the total benefits accrued will depend
on numerous factors and may vary substan-
tially from the lifetime income stream
equivalent in the disclosures;
‘‘(III) explains the assumptions upon which
the lifetime income stream equivalent was
determined; and
‘‘(IV) provides such other similar expla-
nations as the Secretary considers appro-
priate.

(i).
In prescribing assumptions under subclause
(I), the Secretary may prescribe a single set
of specific assumptions (in which case the
Secretary may issue tables or factors which
facilitate such conversions), or ranges of per-
missible assumptions. To the extent that an
accrued benefit is or may be invested in a
lifetime income stream described in clause
(i)(III), the assumptions prescribed under
subclause (I) shall, to the extent appropriate,
permit administrators of individual account
plans to use the amounts payable under such
lifetime income stream as a lifetime income
stream equivalent.
‘‘(iv) LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.—No plan fi-
duciary, plan sponsor, or other person shall
have any liability under this title solely by
reason of the provision of lifetime income
stream equivalents which are derived in ac-
cordance with the assumptions and rules de-
scribed in clause (iii) and which include the
explanations contained in the model lifetime
income disclosure described in clause (ii).
This clause shall apply without regard to
whether the provision of such lifetime in-
come stream equivalent is required by sub-
paragraph (B)(iii).
‘‘(v) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The requirement in
subparagraph (B)(iii) shall apply to pension
benefit statements furnished more than 12
months after the latest of the issuance by
the Secretary of—
‘‘(I) interim final rules under clause (i);
‘‘(II) the model disclosure under clause (ii);
or
‘‘(III) the assumptions under clause (iii).’’.

Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1104) is
amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(e) SAFE HARBOR FOR ANNUITY SELEC-
TION.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—With respect to the se-
lection of an insurer for a guaranteed retire-
ment income contract, the requirements of
subsection (a)(1)(B) will be deemed to be sat-
isfied if a fiduciary—
‘‘(A) engages in an objective, thorough, and
analytical search for the purpose of identi-
fying insurers from which to purchase such
contracts;
‘‘(B) with respect to each insurer identified
under subparagraph (A)—
‘‘(i) considers the financial capability of
such insurer to satisfy its obligations under
the guaranteed retirement income contract;
and
‘‘(ii) considers the cost (including fees and
commissions) of the guaranteed retirement
income contract offered by the insurer in re-
lation to the benefits and product features of
the contract and administrative services to
be provided under such contract; and
‘‘(C) on the basis of such consideration,
concludes that—
‘‘(i) at the time of the selection, the in-
surer is financially capable of satisfying its
obligations under the guaranteed retirement
income contract; and
‘‘(ii) the relative cost of the selected guar-
anteed retirement income contract as de-
scribed in subparagraph (B)(ii) is reasonable.
‘‘(2) FINANCIAL CAPABILITY OF THE IN-
SURER.—A fiduciary will be deemed to satisfy
the requirements of paragraphs (1)(B)(i) and
(1)(C)(i) if—
‘‘(A) the fiduciary obtains written rep-
resentations from the insurer that—
‘‘(i) the insurer is licensed to offer guaran-
teed retirement income contracts;
‘‘(ii) the insurer, at the time of selection
and for each of the immediately preceding 7
plan years—
‘‘(I) operates under a certificate of author-
ity from the insurance commissioner of its
domiciliary State which has not been re-
voked or suspended;
‘‘(II) has filed audited financial statements
in accordance with the laws of its domi-
ciliary State under applicable statutory ac-
counting principles;
‘‘(III) maintains (and has maintained) re-
serves which satisfies all the statutory re-
quirements of all States where the insurer
does business; and
‘‘(IV) is not operating under an order of su-
pervision, rehabilitation, or liquidation;
‘‘(iii) the insurer undergoes, at least every
5 years, a financial examination (within the
meaning of the law of its domiciliary State)
by the insurance commissioner of the domi-
ciliary State (or representative, designee, or
other party approved by such commissioner);
and
‘‘(iv) the insurer will notify the fiduciary
of any change in circumstances occurring
after the provision of the representations in
clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) which would pre-
clude the insurer from making such rep-
resentations at the time of issuance of the
guaranteed retirement income contract; and
‘‘(B) after receiving such representations
and as of the time of selection, the fiduciary
has not received any notice described in sub-
paragraph (A)(iv) and is in possession of no
other information which would cause the fi-
duciary to question the representations pro-
vided.
‘‘(3) NO REQUIREMENT TO SELECT LOWEST
COST.—Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to require a fiduciary to select the
lowest cost contract. A fiduciary may con-
sider the value of a contract, including fea-
tures and benefits of the contract and at-
tributes of the insurer (including, without
limitation, the insurer’s financial strength)
in conjunction with the cost of the contract.
‘‘(4) TIME OF SELECTION.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sub-
section, the time of selection is—
‘‘(i) the time that the insurer and the con-
tract are selected for distribution of benefits
to a specific participant or beneficiary; or
‘‘(ii) if the fiduciary periodically reviews
the continuing appropriateness of the con-
clusion described in paragraph (1)(C) with re-
spect to a selected insurer, taking into ac-
count the considerations described in such
paragraph, the time that the insurer and the
contract are selected to provide benefits at
future dates to participants or beneficiaries
under the plan.
Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be
construed to require the fiduciary to review
the appropriateness of a selection after the
purchase of a contract for a participant or
beneficiary.
‘‘(B) PERIODIC REVIEW.—A fiduciary will be
deemed to have conducted the periodic re-
view described in subparagraph (A)(ii) if the
fiduciary obtains the written representations
described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of para-
graph (2)(A) from the insurer on an annual
basis, unless the fiduciary receives any no-
tice described in paragraph (2)(A)(iv) or oth-
erwise becomes aware of facts that would
cause the fiduciary to question such rep-
resentations.
‘‘(5) LIMITED LIABILITY.—A fiduciary which
satisfies the requirements of this subsection
shall not be liable following the distribution
of any benefit, or the investment by or on
behalf of a participant or beneficiary pursu-
ant to the selected guaranteed retirement in-
come contract, for any losses that may re-
sult to the participant or beneficiary due to
an insurer’s inability to satisfy its financial
obligations under the terms of such contract.
‘‘(6) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this sub-
section—
‘‘(A) INSURER.—The term ‘insurer’ means
an insurance company, insurance service, or
insurance organization, including affiliates
of such companies.
‘‘(B) GUARANTEED RETIREMENT INCOME CON-
TRACT.—The term ‘guaranteed retirement in-

pant and the participant’s designated bene-
ficiary as part of an individual account
plan.’’.

methodologies otherwise applicable under

vides make-whole contributions to a closed
class of participants whose accruals under a
defined benefit plan have been reduced or
eliminated,
‘‘(ii) for the plan year of the defined con-
tribution plan as of which the class eligible
to receive such make-whole contributions
closes and the 2 succeeding plan years, such
closed class of participants satisfies the re-
quirements of section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) (deter-
mined by applying the rules of paragraph
(1)(I)),
‘‘(iii) after the date as of which the class
was closed, any plan amendment to the de-
fined contribution plan which modifies the
closed class or the allocations, benefits,
rights, and features provided to such closed
class does not discriminate significantly in
favor of highly compensated employees, and

benefits, rights, or features to a closed class
of participants whose accruals under a de-
fined benefit plan have been reduced or

time of the spin off) and (iii) of subparagraph
(A), as determined for purposes of subpara-
graph (A) or (C), whichever is applicable.

tion to create such closed class is reflected
in formal written documents and commu-
nicated to participants before such date.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 765, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 1 hour
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on Appropriations.
The gentlewoman from New York
(Mrs. LOWEY) and the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will
control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on the House amendment to the Senate
amendment to H.R. 1865.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
This domestic priorities and inter-
national assistance minibus combines
eight appropriations bills: Labor-
Health and Human Services-Education,
Agriculture, Energy and Water Devel-
opment, Interior-Environment, Legis-
lative Branch, Military Construction-
Veterans Affairs, State-Foreign Oper-
ations, and Transportation-Housing
and Urban Development.
b 1215
The Appropriations Committee is for-
tunate to have outstanding cardinals,
and they have done an extraordinary
job negotiating these bills. Because of
their hard work, we have secured
record funding levels for Head Start,
Child Care and Development Block
Grants, and title I schools; hundreds of
millions of dollars in increases for pro-
grams that expand access to housing;
$41.7 billion for lifesaving medical re-
search at the NIH, a $2.6 billion in-
crease and a record level; $25 million
for gun violence prevention research at
the CDC and NIH, which is being fund-
ed for the first time in more than 20
years; strong funding for environ-
mental protection, with $9 billion for
the EPA, $495 million for the Land and
Water Conservation Fund, and robust
investments in clean energy to address
the climate crisis.
Turning to my bill, I am proud that
the State, Foreign Operations, and Re-
lated Programs Subcommittee reached
bipartisan agreement on a robust bill
that rejects the short-sighted, dan-
gerous cuts proposed by the Trump ad-
ministration. Our bill provides $54.7
billion in discretionary funding, which
is $467 million above fiscal year 2019
and $11.3 billion above the request.
To confront today’s global chal-
lenges, from poverty to civil war, from
climate change to violent extremism,
our bill provides strong investments in
security, humanitarian, and develop-
ment assistance; basic education; and
global health programs like HIV/AIDS,
nutrition, TB, and malaria.
It restores the State Department’s
and USAID’s staffing to 2016 levels and
increases funding for many of our crit-
ical partners, like the National Endow-
ment for Democracy, the Global Fund,
the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Inter-
American Foundation, and the U.S. Af-
rican Development Foundation.
Of critical importance, the bill limits
the administration’s ability to redirect
or deviate from congressionally di-
rected spending levels.
Amid all these successes, I must note
how disappointing it is that, in these
negotiations, President Trump and
congressional Republicans refused to
relent on their counterproductive as-
sault on women’s rights and health
programs that provide basic healthcare
to women and families here and around
the world.
Madam Speaker, I joined the Appro-
priations Committee because it is the
best place to give more people a better
chance at a better life. With this bill,
we have lived up to that promise by
making historic investments for the
people. I am so proud that we are able
to do so much good for children and
families across the country and around
the world.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this
important legislation, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I rise today in support of H.R. 1865, a
bill that will provide funding for the

Departments of Labor, Health and
Human Services, and Education; Agri-
culture; Energy and Water; Interior;
the Legislative Branch; Military Con-
struction and the Veterans Adminis-
tration; State and Foreign Operations;
and Transportation and Housing.
This package protects the sanctity of
life and provides vital funding to pro-
mote the health and well-being of all
Americans. In particular, the bill
maintains all prior year pro-life pro-
tections and secures the largest pro-life
victory in a generation by maintaining
the Trump administration’s Title X
Family Planning regulations.
It provides funding to the National
Institutes of Health to continue their
groundbreaking research in the areas
of Alzheimer’s disease and cancer re-
search, including childhood cancers. It
combats the opioid and methamphet-
amine epidemic in this country by pro-
viding funds for prevention, treatment,
recovery, and research into alternative
therapies for pain management.
The bill also includes key provisions
to help Americans in rural areas, such
as significant funding for broadband
programs; support for those farmers
and ranchers around the country se-
verely affected by hurricanes, floods,
drought, and other national disasters
in 2018 and 2019; and promotes eco-
nomic growth and opportunity through
loans for housing, utilities, and busi-
nesses.
Increased funding for the Army Corps
of Engineers is also included in this
package to support navigation and
flood control improvements.
In addition, the bill continues to ad-
vance the Nation’s all-of-the-above so-
lutions to energy independence
through targeted investments in re-
search and development.
Finally, the bill includes several key
wins for the military and veterans, as
well as our diplomats abroad, such as
an increase in funding for military con-
struction and family housing projects;
improved resources for veterans to ad-
dress mental health, suicide, and home-
lessness; and expanded programs for fe-
male veterans.
The bill strongly supports our ally
Israel and fulfills the U.S.-Israel
memorandum of understanding by pro-
viding funding for military assistance
and maintains funding to keep our em-
bassies safe and secure.
Like the package we just debated,
there are many provisions here that
are good for our country. I hope we can
move this bill quickly through the
House and the Senate so the President
can sign it into law before funding runs
out Friday.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the chair-
woman of the Energy and Water Devel-
opment Subcommittee.
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding me
this time. I thank Chairwoman LOWEY
and Ranking Member GRANGER for
bringing these important measures to
the floor.
The Energy and Water division of
this bill makes critical investments in
energy and water systems to sustain
life on Earth, to combat climate
change, to build public water infra-
structure, and to invest in nuclear se-
curity.
I sincerely thank our ranking mem-
ber, Mr. SIMPSON, who has been a truly
constructive, able, and amiable partner
in these efforts.
I thank our subcommittee staff,
these young, gifted, patriotic Ameri-
cans who have worked so hard to put
this bill together: Jaime Shimek,
Angie Giancarlo, Scott McKee, Farouk
Ophaso, Mark Arnone, Mike Brain, and
Marcel Caldwell.
Our bill rejects the President’s short-
sighted proposed cuts that would harm
our Nation’s interests for both today
and tomorrow. Instead, our bill invests
in the future to meet serious national
priorities.
Addressing the needs of the future
both economically and environ-
mentally requires that our Nation be
at the forefront of global innovation.
The Energy and Water division of this
bill moves our Nation forward on that
vital front.
Further, American companies require
advanced means to produce and ship
goods efficiently in a highly competi-
tive and uneven global marketplace.
We seek to advantage them.
Finally, ensuring water and elec-
tricity for millions of Americans seems
fundamental, but there are weighty
new challenges. We provide additional
support to meeting those priorities.
We achieve this by providing $7.65
billion for the Army Corps of Engi-
neers, $652 billion above 2019, likely our
Nation’s premier infrastructure bill for
2020.
We provide $1.66 billion for the Bu-
reau of Reclamation, $110 million
above 2019, for the desertification of
Western States.
We provide $38.6 billion for the De-
partment of Energy, $2.9 billion above
2019. Within the DOE, Department of
Energy, we responsibly fund our Na-
tion’s nuclear deterrent while pro-
viding a significant boost for vital non-
proliferation efforts.
Our bill increases the Department of
Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renew-
able Energy program; ARPA–E, the ad-
vanced research programs; and the Of-
fice of Science to sharpen America’s
edge to invent the future and to ensure
our Nation’s energy leadership, secu-
rity, and independence for generations
to come, as all of our research labs,
both public and private, across our
country are being hacked constantly
by those that seek to steal our patents
and our innovation.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR).
Ms. KAPTUR. In sum, the Energy
and Water division of this bill invests
in innovative programs to yield future
opportunities and jobs.
Our focus is on ensuring future eco-
nomic prosperity. We underpin na-
tional security, and we bolster eco-
nomic security and trade.
Fundamentally, our work together
prepares our country to mitigate,
adapt to, and intelligently manage the
awesome challenges of climate change,
including the significant water events
across our country, including our
Great Lakes region.
Our bill is needed more than ever to
move America forward. We are living
in a pivotal era. I look forward to an-
swering any questions that individuals
may have privately.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS).
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding.
I rise today in support of this second
appropriations package to fund the
government for fiscal year 2020. I espe-
cially want to state my heavy support
for this portion of the bill that funds
the State Department and our foreign
operations around the world.
I thank the distinguished chair, Mrs.
LOWEY, and the ranking member, Ms.
GRANGER, on their masterful work to
shepherd this compromise all the way
through the maze that is the Congress
to this floor where we sit today.
I especially value Chairwoman
LOWEY’s partnership on the State and
Foreign Operations title of this bill,
which she also chairs. She and I may
differ on some issues—in fact, we do
differ on some issues—but on the
whole, this bill represents the prior-
ities of Congress in support of our na-
tional security.
The agreement includes significant
funding to secure our 200-plus diplo-
matic posts around the world, our em-
bassies, consulates, and the like, and to
support critical allies like Israel, Jor-
dan, Egypt, Georgia, and Ukraine. It
will allow us to respond to a growing
threat that China poses to our secu-
rity.
In our own hemisphere, the bill
prioritizes funding for Latin America
as the region continues to face insta-
bility from the crisis in Venezuela, as
well as from the rampant drug problem
and corruption.
The bill also continues vigorous over-
sight of U.S. assistance, denies funding
for the Green Climate Fund, and re-
spects the sanctity of life around the
world.
This package also includes a number
of provisions of critical importance to
my district in southern and eastern
Kentucky.
First, there is a strong commitment
to our coal miners and the commu-
nities where they live. I am exceed-
ingly proud that a bill I cosponsored to
protect our retired miners is also in-
cluded in this bill. It ensures that these

hardworking individuals receive the
healthcare and the pensions that they
have earned. I hope the 100,000 families
impacted by this provision will have
peace of mind heading into this Christ-
mas season.
This bill also provides $115 million
for the Abandoned Mine Lands Pilot
Program, which has been monu-
mentally successful in creating new
economic development opportunities in
Appalachia.
b 1230
This funding is a strong complement
to the Appalachian Regional Commis-
sion, which is robustly funded at $175
million in this package. Within the De-
partment of Agriculture, there is
strong emphasis on rural infrastruc-
ture, including broadband deployment.
I am also proud that my Kentucky
Wildlands National Heritage Area
Study Act is included in today’s pack-
age. I have been proud to work with
Leader MCCONNELL on this initiative to
truly recognize the incredible natural
and historic value of eastern Kentucky.
This legislation will also ensure that
the veterans in our region receive the
care they need and deserve. I advocated
for a new pilot program to provide
transportation assistance for our Na-
tion’s many rural veterans, like those
in eastern Kentucky, and I am grateful
for the seed funding to get that off the
ground.
Finally, nearly $6 billion is provided
for opioid addiction prevention, treat-
ment, and recovery, and research into
alternative therapies for pain manage-
ment. A new loan repayment program
that is funded in the bill will help get
qualified treatment professionals into
underserved communities like ours in
Kentucky.
But I am especially thankful for the
inclusion in this bill of sufficient funds
to help us fight the problem of opioid
addiction, which got its start in my
district some 15 years ago.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding. I urge support of
this bill.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
PRICE), the chairman of the Transpor-
tation, and Housing and Urban Devel-
opment Subcommittee.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong
support of H.R. 1865.
I want to first thank our chair-
woman, NITA LOWEY, and also Ranking
Member KAY GRANGER for their leader-
ship and cooperation. I want to thank
my good friend, MARIO DIAZ-BALART of
Florida, for his collaborative approach.
I couldn’t ask for a better ranking
member and partner in our subcommit-
tee’s work.
The T-HUD section of this bill in-
vests in America’s transportation and
housing infrastructure with a par-
ticular stress on safety, on addressing
the needs of the most vulnerable, and
on mitigating the impacts of climate
change.
It includes $74.3 billion in discre-
tionary funding. That is an increase of
$3.2 billion above the 2019 level, and it
is $15.8 billion above the President’s
budget request.
On the housing side of the ledger, all
Section 8 vouchers are renewed. The
HOME program and Community Devel-
opment Block Grants each receive $100
million in increased funding, and there
is a $95 million increase for public
housing capital expenditures to address
the maintenance backlog.
Vital transportation programs are
also robustly funded, including $1 bil-
lion for BUILD, formerly TIGER,
grants. We provide more than $3 billion
in discretionary resources above au-
thorized levels for highways, transit,
and aviation projects for every State
and territory in this Nation. Amtrak,
competitive rail grant programs, and
port infrastructure also receive strong
funding.
These investments support a renewed
commitment to safety. The FAA re-
ceives additional resources to bolster
aircraft certification, including dedi-
cated funding to hire new safety in-
spectors, engineers, and data sci-
entists. Every State will receive new
funding to repair aging and deficient
bridges. And resources are provided to
address hazards in Federally-assisted
housing, such as carbon monoxide,
radon, and lead.
Vulnerable populations are targeted
in our bill. We prioritized assistance
for them, for example, for the construc-
tion of new housing units for the elder-
ly and disabled, new vouchers for vet-
erans, as well as resources for the
homeless, people with HIV/AIDS, do-
mestic violence survivors, and at-risk
youth.
Finally, I am proud that this legisla-
tion lays the groundwork to integrate
resiliency principles into the full range
of programs under the bill’s jurisdic-
tion. For example, we require in this
bill HUD grantees to think ahead about
storm and hazard mitigation as part of
their planning process.
So, in closing, we are proud of this
bill, and we urge its support. It makes
forward-looking investments while
boosting safety and protecting vulner-
able populations. It will benefit and
serve all American communities, urban
and rural, and lay the foundation for
economic growth and prosperity.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Washington (Ms. HERRERA
BEUTLER).
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.
1865, which includes funding for the
Legislative Branch.
The recommendation for fiscal year
2020 Legislative Branch Division pro-
vides for $5.049 billion. This is a 4.4 per-
cent increase above fiscal year 2019.
The allocation provides the budget
request for the Office of the Congres-
sional Workplace Rights and the Gov-
ernment Publishing Office, as well as
increases for the House of Representa-
tives, Capitol Police, Congressional
Budget Office, Library of Congress,
Government Accountability Office, and
the Open World Leadership Center.
I am really pleased that this bill sup-
ports the Capitol Police, as well as
funding for important Architect of the
Capitol security infrastructure im-
provements to keep the Capitol campus
safe and to keep its visitors safe, its
staff, the Members, and the folks who
work here.
I am also supportive of the funding
that supports the Library of Congress’
Visitor’s Experience enhancements and
other programs that my constituents,
all of our constituents, enjoy regularly,
as well as upgrades to the Capitol com-
plex facilities for visitors and staff
with disabilities, which will make it
easier for the blind and the visually
impaired to access and enjoy the Cap-
itol complex.

Speaker, I appreciate Chairman RYAN’s
cooperation and support on several ini-
tiatives that are important to us and
this institution. I would like to thank
Chairwoman LOWEY and Ranking Mem-
ber GRANGER for their support and
guidance throughout this process.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1865.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. BISHOP), the chairman of
the Agriculture, Rural Development,
Food and Drug Administration, and
Related Agencies Subcommittee.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
the time, and I rise in support of H.R.
1865.
As the chair of the Agriculture,
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee, I am pleased to briefly
highlight the important national prior-
ities addressed in this bill.
From the safety of our food and
medicines, to agriculture research, to
rural development, and nutrition as-
sistance, the programs in this bill
touch the lives of every American on a
daily basis. The strong investments we
make in this bill will improve people’s
lives at home and abroad.
The fiscal year 2020 Agriculture bill
provides $23.5 billion in discretionary
funding, $183 million above the fiscal
year 2019 level. In addition, it provides
the latest estimates for mandatory
programs required by law.
The legislation makes major invest-
ments, totaling almost $3.8 billion, in
our rural communities, including $1.45
billion for rural water and waste pro-
gram loans and $545 million in grants
for clean and reliable drinking water

the Re-Connect grants and loans, an
issue with strong bipartisan support.
The bill funds all of the domestic nu-
trition programs, including SNAP,
WIC, and the Child Nutrition Pro-
grams, sufficiently to meet anticipated
participation in fiscal year 2020.
In addition, it provides $35 million
for the Summer EBT program, $30 mil-
lion for the school kitchen equipment
grants, and $5 million for the school
breakfast expansion grants.
The bill provides $1.8 billion for farm
programs, including $35 million to ad-
dress staffing shortages at county of-
fices to ensure farmers and producers
receive the best possible customer
service.
It also extends and expands disaster
assistance to continue assisting farm-
ers, ranchers, and producers in States
that were devastated by natural disas-
ters, including Hurricane Michael that
devastated my district.
The legislation makes critical invest-
ments in agriculture research by pro-
viding $3.2 billion, a $171 million in-
crease over fiscal year 2019.
We provided record levels of re-
sources for the Food for Peace and
McGovern-Dole programs. These pro-
grams send American commodities all
over the world to address global hunger
and are an essential tool of American
diplomacy.
The Food and Drug Administration
will receive $3.16 billion in discre-
tionary funding, with specific funding
dedicated to fighting rare cancers,
gaining efficiencies for generic drug re-
views, improving response to foodborne
illness outbreaks, and the continued
implementation of the Food Safety
Modernization Act.
The bill funds the Commodity Fu-
tures Trading Commission at $315 mil-
lion, a historic, necessary, and long-
overdue increase.
I am pleased that the bill provides
funding for several programs author-
ized in the 2018 farm bill, including the
1890 National Scholars program.
Finally, Madam Speaker, I would
like to thank Chairwoman LOWEY and
Ranking Member GRANGER for their
historic and effective leadership
throughout the appropriations process.
I would like to also thank the sub-
committee’s distinguished ranking
member, Mr. FORTENBERRY. He has
been a great partner during this proc-
ess.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentleman.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker,
of course I have to give a tremendous
shout out to the hardworking Appro-
priations Committee staff, both major-
ity and minority. They have worked
hard through multiple challenges, and
they have delivered us a good bill, al-
though not perfect, to avoid a govern-
ment shutdown.
Madam Speaker, this is a good bill,
and I urge my colleagues to support it.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON).
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding
time.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1865, the Further Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act for Fiscal
Year 2020, and particularly division C,
the Energy and Water Development
and Related Agencies Appropriations
Act.
Madam Speaker, before I get into the
details of the bill, I would like to
thank several Members involved in this
effort: my chairwoman, MARCY KAP-
TUR, and our Senate partners, LAMAR
ALEXANDER and DIANNE FEINSTEIN. The
four of us have now worked several En-
ergy and Water conferences together,
and I continue to appreciate the
collegiality and determination to ad-
vance national and constituent inter-
ests that my colleagues bring to the
discussions.
Madam Speaker, I would also like to
thank our full committee leadership,
Chairwoman LOWEY and Ranking Mem-
ber GRANGER here in the House and
Chairman SHELBY and Ranking Mem-
ber LEAHY in the Senate, for their lead-
ership and support throughout this
year’s process.
As ranking member of the House En-
ergy and Water Appropriations Sub-
committee, I believe this fiscal year
2020 Energy and Water bill is a good
bill, and I am pleased that so many
House Republican priorities are in-
cluded in this final bill.
First and foremost, the bill strongly
supports our national nuclear security
programs, providing a total $16.7 bil-
lion for the National Nuclear Security
Administration, including weapons ac-
tivities, defense nuclear nonprolifera-
tion, and naval reactors.
Weapons activities specifically is
funded at $12.5 billion, an increase of
$1.4 billion above fiscal year 2019. With-
in this amount, the bill fully funds the
maintenance and modernization of our
nuclear weapons systems, including
each nuclear weapon life extension, al-
teration, and modification program, as
well as activities to rebuild production
capabilities for strategic materials,
such as plutonium pits.
Next, the bill includes substantial in-
vestments in our Nation’s water re-
sources infrastructure. The Corps of
Engineers is funded at a total of $7.65
billion, an increase of $651 million
above last year.
Within this amount, an estimated
$1.63 billion is for the Harbor Mainte-
nance Trust Fund activities. That level
exceeds the annual HMTF target. In
fact, it represents 91.5 percent of the
estimated revenues, compared to the
revenue fiscal year 2020 target of 80
percent established in WRRDA in 2014.
Finally, one of my personal prior-
ities, the bill promotes innovation and
growth in nuclear energy, funding re-
search, development, and demonstra-
tion activities at $1.3 billion, an in-
crease of $160 million above fiscal year
2019.
Within this amount, the bill estab-
lishes a new advanced nuclear reactor
demonstration program. The goal is to
build two demonstration reactors by
the mid-2020s, in a move towards com-
mercializing the next generation of
carbon-free nuclear energy technology
to be deployed here in the United
States and around the globe.
I am also pleased to see several provi-
sions included in other divisions of this
bill. Specifically, the Interior and En-
vironment Appropriations bill includes
many important policies and funding
provisions to ensure that sage grouse
remain off the endangered species list.
The agreement could not be more im-
portant for rural counties thanks to
full funding for PILT and 2 years of
SRS funding.
This agreement is historic because it
will be the first time the Forest Serv-
ice and the Department of the Interior
will have access to budget cap adjust-
ments for wildfire fighting. This allows
wildfires finally to receive equal treat-
ment with other natural disasters and
allows our land management agencies
to focus on prevention efforts to get
ahead of the issue.
In the Agriculture Appropriations
bill, this agreement delivers vital re-
search funding for potatoes, grain, and
other commodities, and it signals an
important step forward for the sheep
station in Dubois, Idaho, and acknowl-
edges the diverse stakeholders who
seek to collaborate and grow future re-
search at the station. I am eager to
continue the momentum to build ca-
pacity at Dubois.

Finally, and probably most impor-
tantly, I thank the staff of all of our
subcommittees, but particularly the
ones I work with on Interior and En-
ergy and Water. They do a tremendous
job for us. They are here on weekends.
They are here during holidays and
other times behind the scenes, actually
putting together these bills. This is a
job we could not do without their sup-
port.
All in all, this appropriations pack-
age, including the Energy and Water
division, is a strong bill that incor-
porates many priorities, and I urge my
colleagues to support it.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO), the distinguished chair of
the Labor, Health and Human Services,
Education, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I
rise to speak about the fiscal year 2020
appropriations bill for the Labor,
Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee.
The Labor-H bill reflects our prior-
ities as a Nation. It touches our con-
stituents at every single stage of their
life, from birth to retirement, for their

health, work, and education. It pro-
vides people with a better chance at a
better life.
For years, the Labor-H bill has been
shortchanged. Now, we are making up
for lost ground. We fought the Senate
to win crucial investments. The result:
a hard-fought, positive bill with a net
increase of 3.5 percent over 2019, or $6.5
billion more for the people of this
country.
I first want to thank Congresswoman
NITA LOWEY, the full Appropriations
Committee chair. Her leadership and
dedication to Labor-H helped to ensure
that this bill could create real oppor-
tunity for people. I thank our ranking
member, KAY GRANGER, for her dedica-
tion and determination. And I ac-
knowledge Congressman TOM COLE, my
partner, the ranking member of the
subcommittee. We have found common
ground over and over again, which is
rooted in our shared values about what
is good for the people of this country.
Let me describe some of the invest-
ments.
Education: $550 million increase for
Child Care and Development Block
Grant; $550 million increase for Head
Start and $25 million increase for pre-
school development grants; $450 million
increase for title I, $400 million in-
crease for special education, and a new
initiative in social and emotional
learning, including $65 million in inno-
vation grants; $93 million increase for
minority-serving institutions and a
$150 increase to Pell grants.
Health: $2.6 billion increase for Na-
tional Institutes of Health and $637
million increase for Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, including to-
bacco prevention, public health data
modernization, and suicide prevention;
full funding for a new HIV initiative to
eliminate new transmissions of HIV
over the next decade; and continued
high funding for State opioid grants.
I am disheartened that the Repub-
licans obstructed us from defending
women’s health from the administra-
tion’s attack on the Title X program.
We will continue that long fight, and
we will win in the near term. All wom-
en’s reproductive health must be on
equal footing.
An incredible win was $25 million for
evidence-based gun violence prevention
research, the first time in 20 years that
we have provided money and resources
to look at research on trying to pre-
vent gun violence. It follows our hear-
ing on gun violence research that was
the first hearing that we had.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut.
Ms. DELAURO. The significance of
the achievement cannot be overstated.
It will save lives.
Labor: $48 million increase for work-
er protection, $30 million increase for
the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act State grants, $25 million in-
crease for Job Corps, and a new $40 mil-
lion grant for community colleges to
train people for in-demand jobs.
For too long, workers and families
have been shortchanged. We fought
hard. We are making up for lost
ground. We can make opportunity real
for people.
Let me thank the staff on this job,
subcommittee staff Robin Juliano, Ste-
phen Steigleder, Jen Cama, Jackie Kil-
roy, Laurie Mignone, Jared Bass, Phil-
ip Tizzani, and Brad Allen; my staff
Letty Mederos, Liz Albertine, and
Caitlin Peruccio; and the minority
staff Susan Ross and Kathryn Salmon.
As I say, our names are on the door,
but they do the work for us.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART).
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker,
I rise to support this bill, and particu-
larly, I want to talk about the trans-
portation and housing portion of it.
Chairman PRICE and I worked with our
Senate colleagues to craft a fair agree-
ment to meet our Nation’s transpor-
tation and housing needs.
The T-HUD discretionary total is
$74.3 billion, which is $1.5 billion below
the House-passed level.
I would note that there are a lot of
pressures in this bill. We required $2
billion above last year just to meet
housing inflation and another $2 billion
just to make up for lost receipts, so
there is a $4 billion hole to start with.
Some tough choices had to be made.
Let me talk about specifics: $2.4 billion
for highway grants, which provides
funding directly to our State DOTs, $1
billion for BUILD grants to help trans-
form communities, and $225 million for
port infrastructure. This bill also em-
phasizes safety, and that is something
we should be proud of.
For HUD, we provide $3.4 billion for
Community Development Block
Grants, a huge priority for Members,
both Democrats and Republicans.
The bill meets our commitment to
provide housing assistance to our most
vulnerable, including the elderly, the
disabled, and our veterans.
I am proudly particularly proud and
pleased that the bill provides $2.8 bil-
lion for homeless assistance grants. I
have seen the results of this program
firsthand. In Miami-Dade County, we,
in essence, effectively eliminated
homelessness among veterans in our
county.
As a final point on the T-HUD bill, I
would note that this agreement drops
all the controversial riders in the bill.
Once again, Chairwoman LOWEY and
Ranking Member GRANGER led us
through difficult negotiations by work-
ing day and night and never giving up,
and we are grateful for their leader-
ship.
Finally, I thank Chairman PRICE for
his friendship and his partnership. He
has been a joy and a delight to work
with, as well as our Senate counter-
parts, Senator COLLINS and Senator
REED.
I am proud of this bill. I think it is a
great bill for transportation and infra-
structure, and also for our housing
needs, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am
very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the
distinguished gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), the chair of
the Interior, Environment, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I
rise in support of this bill. It is the
product of bipartisan negotiations that
reflect compromise and a shared desire
to fund the Federal Government.
The Interior and Environment sec-
tion provides $36 billion, which is $437
million more than last year’s fiscal
year 2019 enacted bill.
We make critical investments in en-
vironmental protection, in Indian
Country, to public land management,
and the arts.
Here are a few highlights: $43 million
for PFAS research to set standards for
clean drinking water and for cleaning
up PFAS; an additional $24 million for
EPA enforcement and compliance ac-
tivities, the first increase in a decade;
the largest increase in a decade for the
National Endowment for the Arts and
Humanities, each funded at $162 mil-
lion; and the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund is at the highest level since
2003, with $495 million in new funding.
The bill enhances the EPA’s ability
to protect human health and the
health of our environment, providing
$9.08 billion, the second-highest level
ever for the agency. An all-time high
for environmental justice funding is in-
cluded at over $10 million.
It also provides record funding for
the endangered species program at a
time when 1 million plant and animal
species are at risk of extinction.
We continue our subcommittee’s non-
partisan approach to issues facing our
Native American brothers and sisters
by investing in programs critical to the
health, safety, and well-being of Native
peoples.
In the bill, we are serious about ad-
dressing the climate crisis and recog-
nize the importance of science in un-
derstanding how our planet is chang-
ing. We prioritize funding by providing
$52 million for renewable energy devel-
opment and $416 million for climate
change research and adaptation activi-
ties, a $30 million increase.
Programs in the Interior bill impact
all of us, preserving our natural and
cultural heritage to ensure the air we
breathe and the water we drink is clean
not only for today but for future gen-
erations.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
support this bill. I wholeheartedly
thank staff on both sides for their help
in making this happen.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY).
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, first of all, let me say how thankful
I am for the leadership of Chairman
BISHOP and, frankly, for the partner-
ship that we have developed over this

past year. It has been truly remark-
able. I also thank Chairwoman LOWEY
and Ranking Member GRANGER for
their intensive effort around this im-
portant piece of legislation, and that of
the staff. This is good for America.
Agriculture, Madam Speaker, is, in
its essence, really essential to the well-
being of our country. The Agriculture
portion of this entire package includes
support for the hard work of our farm-
ers, ranchers, and producers who give
us something that we really all do take
for granted, some of the lowest grocery
prices in the world, as well as protec-
tion for the most vulnerable who are in
the midst of food insecurity and dis-
aster relief for humanitarian causes.
Madam Speaker, in the midst of a
House divided, I would like to say this:
Food is food. A meal brings us to-
gether. Agriculture production is the
basis for economic and social well-
being, and I am very proud of this ef-
fort. We found a reasonable path for-
ward to consensus in meeting the needs
of fellow Members. This cooperation al-
lowed us to fight hard to defend, in a
bipartisan fashion, House Member pri-
orities.
For example, this bill includes fund-
ing streams for the building and re-
building of critical infrastructure need-
ed in our rural communities, from
housing to utilities to economic devel-
opment. Specifically, the bill includes
$555 million for the ReConnect
broadband program we started just 2
years ago. The Senate bill didn’t in-
clude any money for this basic utility,
but we have.
The bill includes an additional $87
million for other rural broadband ini-
tiatives that will help bridge the gap
and create an ecosystem of livability
for telework, telehealth, precision agri-
culture, and a host of beneficial digital
outcomes for rural America.
Beyond food, this bill also includes a
certain level of responsibility for our
Nation’s healthcare policy. We support
initiatives at the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration to enhance blood safety,
stop opioid abuse, reduce generic drug
prices, and further food safety. Contin-
ued investments in generic drug com-
petition will help bring down prices for
the healthcare needs of all of our con-
stituents.
The bill before us maintains a num-
ber of very important provisions, such
as a Buy America requirement for
water and waste infrastructure and
flexibilities for child nutrition pro-
grams. Interestingly, as well, and of
note, the sale of tobacco and vaping
products now moves to 21 years of age.
No bill includes everything you fight
for, but this bill includes a number of
benefits for Americans in our diverse
communities back home.
It supports a number of smaller yet
highly impactful programs, enhancing
nutrition programs for Native Ameri-
cans, supporting the Farm and Ranch
Stress Assistance Network, and the
Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance
Program.
Madam Speaker, let me highlight the
importance of one particular program,
the farm to school program. We are on
the verge of a new movement in this
country, connecting the farm to the
family, the city to the country. People
want to know where their food comes
from, Madam Speaker. Programs like
this will inspire our youth, build new
markets, and uphold the value of agri-
culture to all America.
Madam Speaker, this is a good bill
for all of us, and I urge its support.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr.
RYAN), the chairman of the Legislative
Branch Subcommittee.
b 1300
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to rise in support of H.R. 1865,
in particular, division E, the fiscal year
2020 Legislative Branch appropriations.
My thanks go to full committee
Chairwoman LOWEY and her ranking
member, KAY GRANGER, for putting
this entire bill together, not just this
subcommittee. This has been an amaz-
ing process. I want to thank my minor-
ity counterpart, Representative HER-
RERA BEUTLER, and all who have guided
and supported this bill through.
I am pleased to announce there is a
$213 million increase to the Legislative
Branch appropriations bill, 4.4 percent
above fiscal year 2019. This bill gives
Members and committees the funding
needed to improve their constituent
services and legislative oversight re-
sponsibilities.
With this bill, we have been able to
increase our Members’ representa-
tional allowance, support committee
budgets, and restore funding shortfalls
in the account that pays House health
and retirement benefits.
The bill will allow an increase in in-
tern allowances, from $20,000 to $25,000
per Member office, so that a more di-
verse group can apply without wor-
rying about the financial burden of
working for free.
The bill continues to fund the
Wounded Warrior Program, as well as
the new congressional Gold Star Fam-
ily Fellowship Program.
We have provided first-year funding
for both the Office of Diversity and In-
clusion and the Office of the Whistle-
blower Ombudsman so that Congress
has the tools to encourage greater staff
diversity and to effectively handle
whistleblower complaints.
It also includes sufficient funding to
extend the Select Committee on the
Modernization of Congress.
The bill increases funding for our im-
portant support and oversight agen-
cies: the CBO, the GAO, the GPO, and
the Capitol Police.
Members will be pleased to learn that
our bill provides another $10 million for
the Library of Congress visitor experi-
ence, for a project total of $20 million.
I am pleased that the bill includes a
provision that permits an increase in
the pay levels of senior congressional
staff.
I would also like to just make a com-
ment or two on the broader bill. I
think Speaker PELOSI said this earlier
in the day, and I know Chairwoman
LOWEY said it earlier in the day and in
the last few days.
This appropriations bill, while it
lacks things like the Butch Lewis Act,
where we need to take care of pensions
for some of our workers out in the
country, this bill is about the future.
There are investments in here in so-
cial and emotional learning, healthy
food, the Department of Energy, and
creating an energy incubator fund so
that we can win the economy in the fu-
ture around new forms of energy.
This bill has money in it for new
auto companies, $5 million for the Ad-
vanced Technology Vehicle Manufac-
turing loan program, which will allow
facilities like the one in Lordstown,
Ohio, to refurbish itself to move into
the future.
This is a good bill, and I encourage
people to vote for this bill. This bill
will help America win the future.
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in
support of H.R. 1865—in particular, Division E,
Fiscal Year 2020 Legislative Branch Appro-
priations. My thanks to full Committee Chair-
woman LOWEY, her ranking Member KAY
GRANGER, and my minority counterpart Rep.
HERRERA BEUTLER. They have all guided and
supported me in my first year taking the helm
of the Legislative Branch appropriations sub-
committee. I’d also like to give a nod to our
staff on both sides for their hard work—Faye
Cobb, Sue Quantius, and Jenny Holmes.
I’m pleased that we have the resources to
start on the path to strengthening Congres-
sional operations. Funding in the bill totals
$5.049 billion—$213 million or 4.4 percent
above fiscal year 2019. The bill gives Mem-
bers and Committees the funding needed to
improve their constituent services and legisla-
tive oversight responsibilities.
With this bill, we have been able to increase
the Members Representational Allowance,
support Committee budgets, and restore fund-
ing shortfalls in the account that pays House
health and retirement benefits. Intern allow-
ances will increase from $20,000 to $25,000
per Member office so that a more diverse
group can apply without worrying about the fi-
nancial burden of working for free. The bill
continues to fund the Wounded Warrior Pro-
gram as well as the new Congressional Gold
Star Family Fellowship Program, which was
established this fall.
We have provided first-year funding for both
the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the
Office of Whistleblower Ombudsman so that
Congress has the tools to encourage greater
staff diversity and to effectively handle whistle-
blower complaints. The bill also includes suffi-
cient funding to extend the Select Committee
on the Modernization of Congress. We look
forward to the implementation of their rec-
ommendations.
The bill increases funding for our important
support and oversight agencies—CBO, GAO,
GPO and the Capitol Police.
Members will be pleased to learn that our
bill provides another $10 million for the Library
of Congress Visitors Experience project for a
total of $20 million provided to date. Once de-
veloped, the project will result in better dis-
plays of many of the treasures in the Library’s

collection, clearer communication of the Li-
brary’s mission, and more activities targeted to
children and youth.
Finally, I’m pleased that the bill includes a
provision that permits an increase in the pay
levels of senior congressional staff. We will be
able to slightly increase the salaries of our
most experienced, senior staff. A higher rate
will make the House more competitive to re-
cruit highly skilled employees.
Our bill begins the journey to making Con-
gress more effective. I hope you will join me
in voting for HR. 1865.
Before concluding, I would like to acknowl-
edge with regret the retirement of David
Reich, the staff director of the Appropriations
Legislative Branch subcommittee.
David has a storied history in the budget
and appropriations world, having served here
for decades and for two masters of that
trade—Rep. Martin Sabo and Rep. David
Obey. He headed the staff of multiple appro-
priations subcommittees—Labor, HHS; Finan-
cial Services; and Leg Branch. He also kept a
steady hand on the rudder in the full com-
mittee as committee counsel. In what could be
partisan posts, David has won praise and ad-
miration from both sides of the aisle.
Besides being skilled in parliamentary and
committee procedure, generous, patient, and
self-effacing to a fault, David was always
known for having the quick yet correct answer
to any complex or arcane budget question
thrown his way. David retired from Appropria-
tions once, but was persuaded to return to be
Chairwoman LOWEY’s staff for the Joint Select
Committee on Budget and Appropriations
Process Reform. Following that endeavor, he
agreed to stay on for a time to be sure that
my subcommittee got off to a steady start.
We knew we were on borrowed time with
him and that he was anxious to get back to
his outside pursuits. David left in August and
we are truly sorry to have lost him. Our best
regards to him and his family as he continues
his post-congressional life.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. JOYCE).
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker,
I thank the ranking member for the
time and opportunity to speak today as
the ranking member on the Interior,
Environment, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee.
I also want to thank the chair of the
subcommittee, my friend and fellow
Great Lakes advocate, Congresswoman
BETTY MCCOLLUM. We have worked
tirelessly over the past month to nego-
tiate a reasonable compromise in order
to be able to deliver the product before
you today and avoid a government
shutdown.
While it is not the bill I would have
written and there are things in here
that I might not necessarily agree
with, I do believe that there is more in
this bill that unites us than divides us.
The bill increases America’s invest-
ment in our own abundant energy and
mineral resources. It fully funds the
Payments in Lieu of Taxes program
which is so critical to counties with
Federal lands. It also invests $1.8 bil-
lion for maintenance and construction
of our Nation’s parks and our other
public lands.
This agreement also provides for a 29
percent increase to fight devastating
wildfires that threaten our commu-
nities.
This agreement provides an addi-
tional $392 million for healthcare, law
enforcement, and related programs to
honor our country’s sacred trust and
treaty obligations to the American In-
dians and Alaska Natives.
I am deeply proud of our nonpartisan
efforts in support of these important
programs. But just as important as the
targeted funding increases are the
longstanding policy provisions we have
fought to hold on to and the new poison
pills that we have successfully fought
to eliminate.
For example, we have succeeded in
continuing two provisions blocking the
Green New Deal regulation of green-
house gas emissions from livestock. We
have successfully blocked an attempt
to limit reorganization of the Depart-
ment of the Interior and relocation of
the BLM and EPA offices.
Finally, as a lifelong Ohioan, I want
to highlight the work we did to protect
the Great Lakes, one of the greatest
natural resources and economic
powerhouses in the United States.
They hold 95 percent of the United
States’ fresh surface water. The lakes
also support over 1.5 million jobs and
provide $62 billion in wages, annually.
Protecting the Great Lakes is not a
red issue or a blue issue. Many Mem-
bers of Congress from both sides of the
aisle understand the important role the
lakes play in our lives and the need to
protect them.
My colleague BETTY MCCOLLUM has
been a great partner to work with in
my fight to protect the Great Lakes,
and I am happy to report the con-
ference agreement includes $320 mil-
lion—a $20 million increase—for the
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative,
which helps us provide and address
invasive species like Asian carp, reduce
phosphorus runoff that causes harmful
algal blooms, and protect and preserve
the Great Lakes for future generations.
In closing, I want to thank Chair-
woman LOWEY and Ranking Member
GRANGER for their leadership and the
staffs on both sides of the aisle for
their extremely hard work to get the
annual appropriations bills over the
finish line once again.
I urge all of my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes’’ on this bill.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the distin-
guished chairwoman of the Military
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman
LOWEY for yielding.
I rise in support of this funding pack-
age which includes Military Construc-
tion-Veterans Affairs funding, which I
am privileged to chair, and seven other
appropriations bills.
This package increases funding for
our national priorities and soundly re-
jects President Trump’s unserious and
immoral budget. This package in-
creases funding and makes sure that
our bicameral, bipartisan compromise
that we reached on the Military Con-
struction-Veterans Affairs bill meets
the needs of our servicemembers, sup-
ports our military families, and pro-
vides for our veterans.
I want to underscore that the agree-
ment does not provide any money for
backfilling the funding that President
Trump took—really, stole—from our
military projects after he declared a
fake national emergency for the border
wall, and it also denies advanced back-
filling by the administration for their
next attempt to steal more funding.
There are zero dollars in the Military
Construction-Veterans Affairs legisla-
tion for this wasteful border wall
project.
We secured a solid $1 billion in mili-
tary construction, notably in family
housing improvements, energy resil-
iency, and child development centers.
Further, this agreement fully funds
family housing construction at $1.3 bil-
lion and includes $140.8 million for
costs associated with mold, lead-based
paint, and vermin.
I am disappointed that we could not
get agreements from the administra-
tion to limit the transfer of funds from
all MILCON dollars, but I am pleased
that we were able to prevent vital dis-
aster funding from being transferred in
the future.
The administration needs to think
twice about moving money from con-
gressionally approved projects to fund
a border wall and understand that
there is no back door around Congress’
power of the purse.
I am proud that the bill includes $585
million in funding for gender-specific
care for women for the first time, as
well as additional funding for homeless
assistance programs, whole health, and
mental health and suicide prevention
programs.
As a member of the Energy and
Water Development, and Related Agen-
cies Subcommittee, I am thrilled by
how much this bill invests in water in-
frastructure, clean energy, and eco-
nomic ecosystem restoration—and by
how much this bill helps my home
State of Florida.
The bill includes mine and other Flo-
ridians’ request for full funding for Ev-
erglades restoration at $200 million.
Even more, it fully authorizes the Cen-
tral Everglades Planning Project, a
suite of restoration projects that aims
to fix freshwater flows in south Flor-
ida’s ecosystem.
I am also proud to have helped secure
six new construction starts and fund-
ing to help major ports like Port Ever-
glades, in my district, expand and
adapt to the modern economy.
As a breast cancer survivor, I am
glad that the Labor-HHS-Education di-
vision of the bill includes language
that I sponsored to ensure that young
women have access to coverage for
breast cancer screenings beginning at
age 40.

It also includes $5 million to fund my
EARLY Act legislation for the CDC to
promote breast cancer awareness for
young and at-risk women.
The Foreign Operations division en-
sures that America helps Venezuelans
who are suffering through instability
and economic pain and includes fund-
ing for democracy promotion, human
rights, and civil society programs in
Venezuela.
Finally, I am pleased that the mini-
bus also includes legislation that I
sponsored and worked on with my
south Florida colleagues. The Ven-
ezuela Emergency Relief, Democracy
Assistance, and Development Act will
require greater monitoring and strate-
gies to prevent Russian meddling in
Venezuela’s affairs, a bill I sponsored;
increased humanitarian aid; and re-
strict the exportation of weapons used
to stifle domestic dissent in Venezuela.
I urge all Members to support this
bill.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, I want to thank both leaders,
but I want to thank KAY GRANGER for
her extraordinary support for legisla-
tion that I authored, two bills that are
included in this act. I thank NITA
LOWEY as well, the distinguished chair-
woman.
The first bill is known as the TICK
Act. Twenty-one years ago, in 1998, I
introduced the Lyme Disease Initiative
Act of 1998. Every 2 years, every Con-
gress, with well over 100 cosponsors,
would have a bill that would look to
create a national strategy in com-
bating Lyme disease.
This legislation includes that strat-
egy, and I am deeply grateful for that.
It also is now named after Senator Kay
Hagan, who, sadly, died from a tick-
borne disease in October. But it pro-
vides a national strategy, $150 million
authorization for Lyme research, pre-
vention, and treatment programs, and
enables additional Federal agencies to
step up and coordinate their efforts in
the fight against Lyme.
As we know from the working group,
there are 300,000 new cases every year.
The high-end estimate is 437,000 cases.
Chronic Lyme is a very serious prob-
lem.
The NIH recently came out with
their new strategy, and I am very
grateful to the Trump administration
for doing that because there is no real
detection capability that is reliable, so
the diagnosis is often faulty. There is
also the very real problem that there
are no therapeutics that can deal with
Lyme disease, especially if it is missed
in the beginning from a tick bite.
Madam Speaker, the second bill has
to do with ending neglected tropical
diseases, another one of my bills that
just passed this House on December 3.
We know for a fact that 1.4 billion
people are walking around with hor-
rific worms and parasites which, ter-
ribly, cause death, but also there is a
great deal of morbidity attached to it.
Thankfully, this legislation has that
bill in its entirety in it, so there is no
need to worry about the Senate taking
up this bill. It will become law, and I
am thankful for that.
I had a number of hearings on ne-
glected tropical diseases in Africa and
other places, particularly where there
is a warm environment. People are
walking around with parasites. They
are walking around with dengue and all
of the other diseases, so I am very
grateful for both of those bills.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LEE), a
senior member of the Appropriations
Committee.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, let me thank Chairwoman
LOWEY for yielding, but also for her
tremendous and tireless work, day and
night, on behalf of the American peo-
ple, and also our ranking member, KAY
GRANGER, for her leadership.
I rise in strong support of this domes-
tic and foreign assistance appropria-
tions bill. First, as a member of the
Labor, Health and Human Services,
Education, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee and also the Agriculture,
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee, I am really pleased to
see such a comprehensive bill that
strongly invests in our rural and our
urban communities.
For example, there is $266 million for
the new Ending HIV initiative. This is
new funding. We have an increase of $42
million to historically Black colleges
and universities and a $19 million in-
crease to Hispanic-serving institutions.
These institutions help improve the
higher education of our students of
color; also, an increase in the Healthy
Food Financing Initiative and the Col-
lege Hunger Initiative, which this bill
addresses.
It also includes $65 million for the
Education Innovation Research grants
for computer science for young girls
and students of color and $20 million
for Special Olympics education pro-
grams, which the President’s budget
initially proposed to eliminate.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentlewoman an additional 10
seconds.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, I also want to thank our chair
of the State, Foreign Operations, and
Related Programs Subcommittee for
the increase for our international AIDS
program and for the Global Fund.

Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes the gentlewoman from
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN).
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Madam Speaker, I thank Rank-
ing Member GRANGER for this oppor-
tunity, and I appreciate the hard work
and bipartisan work that the gentle-
woman, Chairwoman LOWEY, and the
leadership have put together to make
this bill a reality.
I rise in strong support of the spend-
ing package for fiscal year 2020 because
it includes several provisions that di-
rectly impact 3.2 million citizens living
in Puerto Rico by providing funding for
the Nutritional Assistance Program, as
well as the Puerto Rico Air National
Guard projects, and the Army Corps of
Engineers, among others.
I am especially pleased that the
agreement provides 2-year funding for
the island’s Medicaid program. The
funding levels included in the bill will
give certainty to the 1.1 million bene-
ficiaries who rely on this program to
meet their healthcare needs, as well as
to put into effect several critical sus-
tainability measures designed to en-
hance the provision of healthcare. This
guarantee of funding for the next 2
years constitutes an important step to-
wards correcting the problems arising
from the chronic underfunding of the
program.
I look forward to continuing this
conversation for a long-term solution
that guarantees citizens in Puerto Rico
a standard of healthcare that we can
expect from a nation as great as ours.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
PELOSI), who is an appropriator. She is
and has been valuable in our discus-
sions of this bill and getting the com-
pletion of these bills in an orderly and
timely way.
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding in
a very gracious and generous way.
More importantly, I want to thank her
for her tremendous leadership as chair
of the Appropriations Committee to
bring a bill to the floor that has shared
values, meeting the needs of the Amer-
ican people. And I want to commend
Ranking Member KAY GRANGER for her
leadership, as well, so that we can have
strong, bipartisan support in meeting
the needs of the American people.
I congratulate Madam Chair for get-
ting all of our bills done this summer.
The gentlewoman worked around the
clock and across the aisle to overcome
any opposition and to craft a strong
appropriation package that we are
bringing to the floor.
As the gentlewoman mentioned, I am
an appropriator, and when I served on
committee I had always said to the ad-
ministration and to others: When left
to their own devices, our appropriators
can get the job done. They have experi-
ence in working in a bipartisan way,
they understand everyone’s concerns,
regional needs, and the rest, and that
we must by the clock get the job done.
I thank the gentlewoman for doing
that and making today possible.
Madam Speaker, this weekend I was
pleased to join a bipartisan delegation
to observe the 75th anniversary of the
Battle of the Bulge. We spent time in
Luxembourg and in Belgium where so
much of that conflict took place. We

met with the leaders of the commu-
nity, the king, the queen, and the arch-
duke; and that was all wonderful.
But what was really important, and
the purpose of our visit was to meet
with our own veterans—now 75 years
later, who are revisiting the site—and
to thank them, to hear their ongoing
stories, and to hear their purpose in
fighting.
Some of them were as young as 18
years old at the Battle of the Bulge. Do
the math. They are in their nineties.
One of them told me he was 20, and one
was 21. The oldest one is 98 years old
now. But all of them were full of vital-
ity and concern about our country as
we go forward. We promised them in a
tribute to their courage, their deter-
mination, and their patriotism that we
know that our responsibility is to build
a future worthy of their sacrifice and
that we also want to always be ready
to meet the needs of our men and
women in uniform today as they pro-
tect and defend democracy and freedom
as our valiant veterans did 75 years
ago.
Mr. CONAWAY was with us on that
trip—a very valued leader on that
trip—and I think you will agree,
Madam Speaker, that America was
truly blessed by the courage of our vet-
erans then and now.
So I am glad that in this legislation
we meet the needs of those who are
providing for our defense and the secu-
rity of our country to make us the
home of the brave and the land of the
free.
I do believe that our success on this
legislation began when working to-
gether we were able to come to an
agreement on the caps in funding to
make sure that although we obviously
all support our national security, we
want to be sure that people understood
that we measure the strength of Amer-
ica not just in our military might but
in the health, education, and well-
being of the American people, and this
part of the legislation does just that.
We will vote on the earlier part and
now on the part that deals with, shall
we say, the health and well-being of
the American people. With this agree-
ment we are investing in the good
health of the American people. We are
protecting the quality of affordable
healthcare of millions as we perma-
nently repeal healthcare taxes and
block the President’s ACA sabotage nu-
clear options by preventing him from
ending silver loading and auto re-en-
rollment.
At the same time we are investing in
innovation and the future of healthcare
with robust funding for the National
Institutes of Health that our distin-
guished colleague, Mr. SMITH of New
Jersey, mentioned, we continue our
leadership to combat the opioid epi-
demic, and we honor our responsibility
to our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico
and the other territories.
Of course, we want more, and, of
course, we need to get more at some
point. But for now we are very pleased
with the fact that we have 2 years’ ade-
quate funding to go forward. Again, I
look forward to preparing further into
the future.
While this legislation does not con-
tain permanent fixes for everything, we
are proud that it lays the groundwork
for further progress to end the finan-
cial catastrophe of surprise billing, to
lower prescription drug costs, and to
extend robust funding for key health
initiatives.
This appropriations package also
achieves critical victories for, as I
mentioned, our national security and
the economic security of the American
people. Our appropriations legislation
makes America safer at home by fund-
ing gun violence research at the CDC
and the National Institutes of Health
for the first time in more than 20
years; and funding election security
grants to protect against foreign at-
tack which the minority, the Repub-
licans, then the majority, refused to do
last year.
These bills make workers and fami-
lies stronger by protecting the pen-
sions of 100,000 coal miners; reauthor-
izing the job-creating Export-Import
Bank; extending the National Flood In-
surance Program; protecting schools,
small businesses, and other pillars of
communities, as well as commercial in-
terests by reauthorizing the Terrorism
Risk Insurance Program and doing so
in a timely fashion; extending key tax
provisions through 2020 that encourage
investments in clean energy, provide
relief for families recovering from dis-
asters, support investment in low-in-
come communities with the low-in-
come housing tax credit, and protect
families facing high medical costs for
the loss of home to foreclosure.
Again, this is very personal. People
always talk about coming to Wash-
ington and having a seat at the table.
The most important seat at the table
for us is the seat at America’s kitchen
table where people talk about their
plans for the future and how they in-
tend to meet their financial obliga-
tions, whether it is the education of
their children, the mortgage on their
house, their medical expenses, or pro-
viding for their own pension future.
Personally and officially, I am proud
that this legislation takes strong ac-
tion to advance the health and well-
being of America’s children. The three
most important issues, in my view, fac-
ing the Congress are the well-being of
our children, our children, our chil-
dren; strengthening Family First Pre-
vention Services; securing record fund-
ing levels for Head Start, Child Care
and Development Block Grants, and
Title I schools; and extending funding
for thousands of schools in rural com-
munities across 41 States because there
is no better investment that Congress
can make than an investment in the
education of our children.
By the way, there is nothing that we
can do that brings more resources to
the Federal Treasury than investing in
education: early childhood, K–12, high-
er education, and lifetime learning
training for our workers.
I also want to acknowledge the im-
portant investment that this legisla-
tion does in IDEA, meeting the needs
of our children with additional chal-
lenges.
In this House our title and job de-
scription are one and the same: Rep-
resentative. Today we must pass this
legislation so that we can meet the
needs of the people whom we are privi-
leged to represent. I know that this is
going to be a strong, bipartisan vote,
and I think that is a very good thing
for the health, the economic security,
and the well-being of the American
people.
I am grateful to Ranking Member
GRANGER, Chairwoman LOWEY, and all
of the leadership of our subcommittees
who made this successful day possible
for us.
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong, bi-
partisan vote on minibus 1 and minibus
2, and, again, a great victory for our
children, our children, our children.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time to
close.
Madam Speaker, this is a strong con-
servative package that provides the
President with the funding and author-
ity he needs. I look forward to passing
these bills through the House and Sen-
ate and getting them to the President’s
desk for his signature before time runs
out on Friday.
Madam Speaker, before I close, I
want to give a special thanks to my
staff director, Anne Marie Chotvacs,
for her tireless work and leadership
throughout the process. Her wisdom
and guidance have been invaluable to
me and all the committee members.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting in favor of
these bills, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, as we close debate
on this important package, I want to
thank the many hardworking staff who
made this possible. While there are too
many to name them all, many thanks
to my staff at the State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs Sub-
committee; my entire committee staff
led by Staff Director Shalanda Young,
Deputy Staff Director Chris Bigelow,
and to the minority staff as well. To
the extraordinary staff in my congres-
sional office, I want to express my ap-
preciation because it is teamwork that
brought us to this point.
Madam Speaker, I urge support for
the bill, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong support of the House Amendment to

for their work in reaching this bipartisan agree-
ment.
Specifically, this legislation provides $540.4
billion and reflects conference agreements for
the FY 2020 Labor-Health and Human Serv-
ices-Education, Agriculture-Rural Develop-
ment-Food and Drug Administration, Energy
and Water Development, Interior-Environment,
Legislative Branch, Military Construction-Vet-
erans Affairs State-Foreign Operations, and
Transportation-Housing and Urban Develop-
ment appropriations bills.
Madam Speaker, in total this appropriations
package provides:
1. $35.9 billion in base defense funding;
2. $484.5 billion in base nondefense fund-
ing;
3. $0.6 billion for defense Overseas Contin-
gency Operations;
4. $8 billion for nondefense OCO;
5. $6.2 billion for defense emergency re-
quirements;
6. $4.6 billion for nondefense emergency re-
quirements, program integrity, and wildfire
suppression; and
7. $0.6 billion for 21st Century Cures Act
funding.
I appreciate the Appropriations Committee
working with me to include the following Jack-
son Lee Amendments in the legislation:
LABOR-HHS
1. Amendment reprogramming $10,000,000
to support greater diversity in the pool of dia-
betes research professionals and patients par-
ticipating in clinical trials.
2. Amendment reprogramming $10,000,000
to support programs providing outreach and
support services targeting college students at
greatest risk of not completing a college de-
gree.
STATE AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS
3. Amendment reprogramming $1,000,000
to combat the practice of Female Genital Muti-
lation.
4. Amendment reprogramming $1,000,000
to combat the poaching and trafficking of en-
dangered species.
AGRICULTURE
5. Amendment increasing funding by
$2,000,000 for the USDA agency that provides
grant research funding for ‘‘1890s Land Grant
Universities,’’ which are 19 Historically Black
Colleges and Universities.
T-HUD
6. Amendment reprograms $10,000,000 to
support urban bicycle and pedestrian safety
programs financed through the National Infra-
structure Investments account.
7. Amendment reprograms Office of Inspec-
tor General account to provide $2 million to in-
vestigate the Department’s delay in releasing
over $5 billion in Hurricane Harvey Disaster
Community Block Grant funds.
Madam Speaker, left to our own devices,
House Democrats clearly could and would
have made many different and better funding
decisions, but this agreement is the best deal
attainable in the circumstances, and impor-
tantly, it responsibly funds the government for
the remainder of the fiscal year.
Coming from a border state, I am very
pleased that this legislation does not provide
the President the billions of dollars he de-
manded for a wasteful, ineffective, and im-
moral concrete wall.
Madam Speaker, the bipartisan agreement
before us rejects the Trump Administration’s
attacks on the environment by blocking the
Administration’s deep cuts to initiatives to pro-
tect clean water, clean air and public lands
and it invests more than $9 billion in the EPA
and Land and Water Conservation Fund.
The agreement reinforces and strengthen
America’s global leadership by rejecting the
Trump Administration’s radical cuts and secur-
ing $9.1 billion in security assistance for allies,
including $3.03 billion for Israel, $5.9 billion for
PEPFAR and $1.7 billion for the Food for
Peace program.
Madam Speaker, I would like to draw par-
ticular attention to provisions in the consoli-
dated appropriations conference report that
are of special interest to my congressional dis-
trict.
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL)

to Senate Amendment to H.R. 1865.
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to clarify the intent of Section
205 of this amendment and thank you for in-
cluding my 60 day disaster relief extension in
the House Amendment to the Senate Amend-
ment to H.R. 1865—Further Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act of 2020, although I cannot
support this bill in its final form.
The language of Sec. 205 of the House
Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R.
1865—Further Consolidated Appropriations
Act of 2020 was originally introduced in my
bill, H.R. 3287—Tax Relief and Expedited As-
sistance for Disasters Act of 2019 (TREAD
Act). This provision provides disaster related
tax relief to those who are victims of a natural
disaster. Specifically, this provision allows for
people to receive a 60 day extension to file
their taxes if there is a federally declared dis-
aster. I want to clarify that this extension is not
limited to the current Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) policy of extending by a declaration for
FEMA Individual Assistance or FEMA Public
Assistance, but may be triggered by any fed-
eral assistance under the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act, as amended, and Related Authorities as
of August 2016. This would include Technical
Assistance to State and Local Governments
for Effective Warnings or any assistance out-
lined in Section 202 of the Stafford Act. Addi-
tionally, this provision does not prevent the
IRS from extending this tax relief beyond 60
days.
Thank you again for including this common
sense provision to assist disaster relief vic-
tims.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I
rise to express my support for the Military
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related
Agencies Appropriations bill, 2020, as it is in-
cluded in H.R. 1865.
The bill includes a total of $11.315 billion for
military construction projects and military fam-
ily housing. This is $1.05 billion above the
FY19 enacted level and includes $1.045 billion
in funding for the Services’ unfunded priority
projects.
At the Subcommittee’s first hearing for the
FY20 appropriations cycle in February 2019,
we heard from the Senior Enlisted leader in
each Service. Each of them testified about the
need to ensure clean, safe and quality hous-
ing and childcare facilities for Servicemembers
and their families. I’m pleased this bill main-
tains the additional $141 million included in
the House-passed bill to help the Services im-
prove oversight of privatized military housing,
as well as the additional $33 million for the
Services to speed up planning and design for
childcare centers where they are most ur-
gently needed.
The bill includes a total of $233 million for
the Energy Conservation and Infrastructure
Resilience Initiative. With this funding, the bill
funds 7 projects on the Services’ unfunded pri-
ority list. The bill also includes nearly $400
million in the Base Closure account to clean
up former military installations. Some of these
installations have PFOS/PFOA contamination
in their drinking water supplies. The bill pro-
vides an additional $60 million for cleanup ef-
forts.
I am thrilled to mention that the bill provides
a total of $67 million for urgent projects at Fort
Hood. This includes $32 million for a new bar-
racks; $18.5 million for a vehicle bridge; and
$16.5 million for the Central Energy Plant.
This is good news for the home of the Army’s
premier heavy armor units and good news for
the surrounding communities. We have a lot to
do to reinvest in Fort Hood and its soldiers, ci-
vilians and families. I am already looking for-
ward to continuing this effort next year.
For the Department of Veterans Affairs, the
bill provides a total of $92 million for Veterans
programs. Recognizing the scourge of Veteran
suicides, the bill includes $9.4 billion, an in-
crease of $20 million above the budget re-
quest, for mental health and suicide preven-
tion programs. It also includes $800 million for
medical and prosthetic research, an increase
of $21 million above FY19, and for the first
time carves out a specific amount of funding
($585 million) for women Veterans’ health
care.
The bill provides a total of $15.3 billion to
fully fund implementation of the MISSION Act
(Medical Community Care) and includes fund-
ing to provide for Veterans now eligible for
benefits and care under the Blue Water Navy
Vietnam Veterans Act. The bill provides $1.5
billion for VA to continue to develop an inter-
operable electronic health record system and
maintains the strong reporting and oversight
guidelines to ensure the efforts stays on track
and on budget. It also includes a new provi-
sion that limits VA’s research that uses ca-
nines, felines, and non-human primates.
The bill includes funding for four agencies
that provide a unique and important service to
the Nation’s Veterans. They are the American
Battle Monuments Commission, the Army’s
National Military Cemeteries and Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery, the Armed Forces Retirement
Home, and the Court of Appeals for Veterans
Claims. While the allocation would not permit
significant funding increases for these agen-
cies, the Subcommittee does continue to sup-
port their unique missions. It is fair to say the
Subcommittee strongly support Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery and its Southern Expansion.
We firmly believe the Cemetery must remain

available into the 2050 timeframe to serve
Veterans.
Importantly, the bill provides more than
$6.22 billion in emergency funding to repair
damage from earthquakes, flooding, hurri-
canes, and tornadoes that affected military in-
stallations in 2018 and 2019. China Lake
Naval Weapons Station, Camp Lejeune, and
Tyndall and Offutt Air Force Bases sustained
significant damage in these storms. Without
this funding, our national security will suffer as
these installations are struggling to fully exe-
cute their missions.
In closing, I would like to thank the Sub-
committee’s Chairwoman for her commitment
to our bill and her willingness to work across
party and regional lines. I also extend my
great appreciation to the Subcommittee’s ma-
jority staff, Matt Washington, Sarah Young,
Jenny Hollrah, Nicole Cohen, and Keihysha
Cenord, as well as the Subcommittee’s minor-
ity staff, Betsy Bina and Kiya Batmanglidj, for
their expertise, generosity, and support for
America’s Servicemen and women and our
Nation’s Veterans.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10603
December 17, 2019
my district have shared with me state-
ments about how SALT is harming
residents in New Jersey’s 11th District.
Mayor Molly Whilesmith of Sparta
said: ‘‘The current trend is to sell the
house and pack the moving truck right
after the youngest child graduates
from high school. The cap makes New
Jersey much less attractive for the av-
erage, hardworking New Jersey fam-
ily.’’
Mayor Keith Kazmark from Wood-
land Park said: ‘‘Fifty-one percent of
Woodland Park taxpayers pay more
than $10,000 in local property taxes,
and that does not include their State
taxes. That is over 1,800 residential
property owners in our town.’’
Mayor Bruce Harris of Chatham Bor-
ough said: ‘‘The average property tax
bill in Chatham Borough is about
$14,100, so 40 percent is no longer de-
ductible. That impacts people’s pock-
ets; it also impacts housing values.’’
Mayor John Kelley, the Borough of
Caldwell, said: ‘‘Caldwell families man-
age their finances and tax liability
closely, and for many years have relied
upon their State income taxes and
Caldwell property taxes to reduce their
Federal income tax through itemized
deductions.’’
f
DMC PROGRAM EXTENSION
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight
the Department of Agriculture’s Dairy
Margin Coverage program.
The Dairy Margin Coverage program,
or DMC program, is a relatively new
voluntary risk management tool for
dairy producers that was authorized in
the 2018 farm bill. It replaces the Mar-
gin Protection Program for dairy.
As everyone in agriculture knows,
the industry is subject to many unpre-
dictable or uncontrollable factors.
This year, weather has left a sizeable
impact on production.
The DMC program exists for inci-
dents like this: for when factors out-
side of our control impact agriculture
yields.
The enrollment period for the DMC
program has been extended through
December 20.
The USDA website has plenty of in-
formation on the program, including a
tool to help select the ideal level of
coverage.
Agriculture is Pennsylvania’s num-
ber one industry, with dairy being the
largest sector. With just a few days left
to enroll, I would like to encourage our
hardworking dairy farmers to take ad-
vantage of the tools at their disposal,
like Dairy Margin Coverage.
f
HONORING PETER FRATES
(Mr. MOULTON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the life of Pete
Frates.
I am reminded of something my min-
ister at Harvard, Peter Gomes, used to
say often: ‘‘The radical news of the
Gospel is not that heaven is a destina-
tion of the faithful. The radical news is
that God wants us to flourish in our
present lives, our earthly existence,
and to do so more in the future than in
the past.’’
Mr. Speaker, Pete Frates flourished,
and even in his darkest days, he looked
to the future. He was the epitome of
strength, leadership, and courage, both
as an athlete and as an advocate.
I have met a lot of inspiring people in
this job, but none more so than Pete.
Because of Pete, we will cure ALS.
Mr. Speaker, to Julie, Lucy, John,
Nancy, Jennifer, and Andrew, thank
you for sharing him with us.
f
COMPELLING, OVERWHELMING,
AND BIPARTISAN
(Mr. BOST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, earlier this
year, Speaker NANCY PELOSI said that
impeachment should be ‘‘compelling,
overwhelming, and bipartisan.’’
Let me tell you that, if you come
from the State of Illinois, you under-
stand what it is to have an impeach-
ment that is compelling, over-
whelming, and bipartisan, and what it
looks like.
And if you are a Member in this
House and you served in Illinois, you
know, because your constituents know
as well.
A decade ago, the Illinois General As-
sembly impeached Governor Rod
Blagojevich. There was clear and con-
vincing evidence of crimes committed
by the Governor.
I served on that bipartisan impeach-
ment committee to recommend im-
peachment, and it was recommended
by the committee 21–0.
After impeachment advanced to the
floor, it passed 114–1, and the one that
dissented was his sister-in-law.
Let me tell you that that was com-
pelling, overwhelming, and bipartisan.
What we have that we are dealing
with here this week is not a crime, and
it is not overwhelming, and it is not
compelling, and it sure isn’t bipartisan.
f
HONORING PETE FRATES: DO NOT
BE AFRAID TO BE GREAT
(Mr. LAMB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I echo the
comments of my colleague from Massa-
chusetts, Mr. MOULTON.
On December 9, the United States
lost a great hero. Peter Frates once
crushed a home run into the bullpen at
Fenway in Boston’s Beanpot Cham-
pionship for his BC Eagles.
But Pete will be remembered for an-
other reason: ALS would go on to rob
him of his physical gifts, but not his
spiritual ones. Pete simply refused to
give up.
He helped launch the Ice Bucket
Challenge, which raised more than $220
million. These funds have already
begun to change the world for ALS pa-
tients. They helped find a new gene
that may open pathways to treatment.
It is said that, in the Bible, God
breaks through to humanity 366 times
to say, ‘‘Do not be afraid,’’ once for
every day and once more in case we
just didn’t get it.
In the Christmas season, we are re-
minded that God sent his most pre-
cious gift to this planet for such a
short time. We don’t know why, but we
do know that he invites others to carry
the message.
Pete was known for telling others,
‘‘Do not be afraid to be great.’’
I cannot think of better words to
close out the year of our Lord 2019 or a
better man for us all to honor.
f
USMCA RATIFICATION IS A GREAT
WIN FOR AMERICA
(Mr. ROUZER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, after
months of delay, the House is on the
cusp of approving the U.S.-Mexico-Can-
ada Agreement, a landmark trade deal
that fulfills President Trump’s promise
to renegotiate and improve NAFTA.
This agreement reduces tariffs,
cracks down on unfair trading prac-
tices, and removes other barriers to
American-grown and -made products.
This is particularly true for many
North Carolina products.
Mexico and Canada are North Caro-
lina’s most important trade partners.
North Carolina exported nearly $10.5
billion in total goods to Canada and
Mexico in 2018, and our agriculture in-
dustry is particularly dependent upon
trade with these two countries as well.
My home State exported more than
$3.5 billion in agriculture products in
2017. Under this agreement, North
Carolina farm families can expect to
export even more.
Ratification of this trade deal means
stability and more prosperity for our
farm families as well as for North Caro-
lina’s economy as a whole.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ambas-
sador Lighthizer and his entire team at
USTR, as well as the fine professionals
at USDA, for their tireless work to
make this achievement possible.
This is a great win for America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H10604 December 17, 2019
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, our
country’s Founders created impeach-
ment so that no President could place
themselves above the law, a crucial
constitutional check of power that en-
sures our country’s security and values
are protected against corruption and
foreign influence in our elections.
As I have weighed this solemn deci-
sion, I have listened to our community,
examined important testimony and
evidence, and studied the drafted arti-
cles.
The President has demonstrated a
pattern of corrupt behavior and abused
his power for his own personal political
gain when he pressured foreign leaders
to conduct investigations against polit-
ical rivals, jeopardizing our country’s
national security and the integrity of
our elections.
The testimony and evidence put forth
led me to a clear conclusion: In order
to uphold my sworn oath, I must vote
to protect the Constitution and will
vote in support of the Articles of Im-
peachment.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
HONORING PETTY OFFICER FIRST
CLASS H. TRAVIS PARKER
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to honor Petty Officer First Class H.
Travis Parker, an American hero who
served in World War II and the Korean
war.
Mr. Parker enlisted in the Navy on
August 26, 1942. He began his service on
the USS Midway during World War II,
flying Consolidated PBY Catalina sea-
planes. He then flew Vought OS2U
Kingfisher floatplanes as a member of
Scouting Squadron VS–62 during the
Korean war. He was stationed on the
USS Monterey.
Petty Officer First Class Parker was
honorably discharged on January 5,
1963, after nearly 21 years of service to
his country.
Mr. Parker became very involved
with A.L. Lotts Elementary School
after his military service. He was con-
sistently present at the school, reading
to children and serving as a mentor for
troubled students throughout the
years.
Mr. Parker also devoted his time and
resources to improving the school and
always took it upon himself to help fix
problems. He purchased school supplies
and even fixed up a classroom after it
was vandalized by hoodlums.
Our country’s heroes are the men and
women of our Armed Forces like Mr.
Parker, not those who throw a baseball
or throw a football. They served and
sacrificed for our freedom.
It is my honor to recognize Petty Of-
ficer First Class H. Travis Parker as
the Tennessee Second District’s De-
cember 2019 Veteran of the Month.
D.C. SHOULD HAVE IMPEACHMENT
VOTE
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, when the
matter of impeaching President Trump
comes to the House floor tomorrow,
the House will vote on its most solemn
matter, except for matters of war and
peace. Yet, more than 700,000 Ameri-
cans who reside in our Nation’s Capital
cannot be recorded.
It is un-American to deny any Ameri-
cans who pay Federal taxes the vote on
any bill. That denial is even more un-
conscionable, considering that D.C.
residents pay the highest Federal taxes
per capita in the United States.
The 23rd Amendment of our Constitu-
tion gave D.C. residents the right to
vote for President and Vice President.
It should follow, as day follows night,
that D.C. residents should have the
vote to remove the President, as well.
Yet another reason, Mr. Speaker, the
House will pass our D.C. statehood bill
this session.
f
HONORING FLORIDA FIRE MAR-
SHAL OF THE YEAR JENNIFER
PIERCE
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
honor the 2019 Florida Fire Marshal of
the Year, Jennifer Pierce.
Pierce currently serves as the fire
marshal of the Clermont Fire Depart-
ment. With over 15 years of fire service
under her belt, she also oversees the
daily operations of the fire prevention
division, which includes reviewing life
safety plans, conducting fire investiga-
tions, and coordinating community re-
lations.
Clermont city manager Darren Gray
highlighted how Fire Marshal Pierce
has provided ‘‘the highest level of serv-
ice to Clermont’s growing list of busi-
nesses, especially working with down-
town’s historic buildings and new busi-
ness owners.’’
In addition to being awarded the Fire
Marshal of the Year title, Pierce was
chosen to serve as the statewide direc-
tor of fire marshals on the Florida Fire
Marshals and Inspectors Association’s
board of directors.
Her leadership and dedication to the
city of Clermont has been exceptional,
and I am confident that we will see
more outstanding contributions from
her in the future.
From the bottom of my heart, I
thank Fire Marshal Pierce and all the
incredible first responders who serve
District 15 and our Nation.
f
CONGRATULATING PIERCE
COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the Pierce
County High School competition
cheerleading squad for winning the 2019
AAA State championship.
Located in the First Congressional
District of Georgia, this is the fifth
straight year that Pierce County has
won the State championship. It is the
seventh time the team has posted a
97.5-point performance.
This year was a unique challenge for
a team that lost nine seniors from the
previous year and had 12 new members
on the 2019 squad. However, they
proved they were up to the challenge
on the State’s largest stage.
Congratulations, Pierce County. You
have made the First Congressional Dis-
trict of Georgia proud.
f
CONGRATULATING CAPTAIN JOHN
SHELSON
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, we are grateful for Captain
John ‘‘JT’’ Shelson for having served
in the Washington office of the Second
Congressional District of South Caro-
lina from the Army for the past year as
a defense fellow.
After graduating from Drexel Univer-
sity, Captain Shelson enlisted in the
Army, attending basic combat training
at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. He
then attended the U.S. Army Officer
Candidate School at Fort Benning,
Georgia, where he was awarded the
Jess Walls Award for commissioning as
the top graduate in his class.
In 2017, Captain Shelson assumed
command of Headquarters and Head-
quarters Company, 1st Battalion, 18th
Infantry Regiment and was deployed to
Eastern Europe in support of Atlantic
Resolve. Captain Shelson has also
served in Afghanistan and Kuwait.
Captain Shelson has been vital to the
office for the past year. He was instru-
mental in repealing the widow’s tax. I
am grateful to him for helping enact
this important legislation for military
families. I am thankful for his commit-
ment to America and wish him all the
best for continued success.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism
with the leadership of President Don-
ald Trump.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10605
December 17, 2019
Representative ROGERS has served
his hometown of Pearl and Rankin
County with honor and integrity for 36
years. In that time, he was appointed
chairman of the Military Affairs Com-
mittee and vice chairman of the Ways
and Means Committee, and he served
as a member of the Management and
the Education Committees, to name a
few.
Earlier this year, Representative
ROGERS was presented the Mississippi
Meritorious Civilian Service Award by
the Mississippi National Guard for his
distinguished career in public service.
Known as a man of wisdom, kindness,
and selflessness, Representative ROG-
ERS has made a positive impact on our
State that will last generations.
I am grateful for the example Rep-
resentative ROGERS has set for those
serving in elected office, and I wish
him many years of happiness in his
much-deserved retirement.
f
RECOGNIZING 41ST ANNUAL
MINNESOTA HMONG NEW YEAR
(Mr. EMMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 60,000 members
of the Hmong community in Minnesota
who recently celebrated their 41st new
year celebration.
My home State is home to one of the
largest Hmong communities in the Na-
tion. They are great neighbors and co-
workers, and they have been an inte-
gral part of the fabric of our State and
culture since the first Hmong family
arrived in 1975.
Although I was not able to partici-
pate in this year’s new year’s cere-
mony, the celebration’s theme of ‘‘Em-
bracing the Present, Inspiring Future
Generations’’ could not be more appro-
priate. Minnesota’s Hmong families
and leaders have worked hard to em-
brace everyone in their surrounding
communities and inspire those inter-
ested in learning more about their rich
heritage and history.
I thank all the Hmong in our great
State of Minnesota for their many
years of friendship with our office and
wish everyone a happy and healthy new
year.

COMMEMORATING THE 100TH
BIRTHDAY OF IRIS BARTLEY
(Mr. COMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to pay special recognition to Ms.
Iris Bartley from my hometown of
Tompkinsville, Kentucky, who re-
cently celebrated her 100th birthday.
While many may begin slowing down
when they reach this incredible mile-
stone, that is not who Iris is. A mother
of 4, grandmother of 14, great-grand-
mother of 30, and great-great-grand-
mother of 7, Iris can still be found
weed-eating at her home and teaching
Sunday school at my church, First
Baptist in Tompkinsville, Kentucky.
An accomplished musician, she is
also known for her famous singing and
guitar playing.
After opening a beauty shop in her
own home in the mid-1940s, Iris was a
hairstylist in Tompkinsville until re-
tiring at the young age of 92.
Born and raised on a farm, she never
forgot the values of hard work, faith,
and family. She has always lived out
those values while also instilling them
in her children and their families.
While I know she still has many good
years left, I, nonetheless, wanted to
take this time to honor Iris for reach-
ing the century mark. I am honored to
represent someone as respected as Iris,
along with the rest of my constituents
in the First Congressional District.

Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate John Ferriola on
his retirement from Nucor Corporation
after more than 28 years with the com-
pany. He has been CEO since 2013 and
has served as chairman of the board
since 2014. In his time with Nucor, he
has worked at facilities in Texas, Ne-
braska, and Indiana, and at the cor-
porate headquarters in Charlotte,
North Carolina.
Nucor takes scrap metal and recycles
it into new steel products in its elec-
tric arc furnaces. When Mr. Ferriola
joined the company in 1991, Nucor was
a small steel company that made less
than $1.5 billion in sales and had just
opened two state-of-the-art steel mills
in Mississippi County, Arkansas. Last
year, Nucor generated $25 billion in
revenue, making it the largest steel
producer in the United States.
I have had the pleasure of working
with Mr. Ferriola on the issues affect-
ing the domestic steel industry, par-
ticularly the need for strong trade en-
forcement to ensure a level playing
field for American steelworkers. He
frequently appeared before the Con-
gressional Steel Caucus to testify on
the state of the American steel indus-
try and has served as chairman of the
board for both the American Iron and
Steel Institute and the World Steel As-
sociation.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
join me today in honoring John
Ferriola for his outstanding career in
the steel industry. I wish him all the
best in his retirement.
f
SUPPORT ABILITYONE PROGRAM
(Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to express my strong
support for the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs Contracting Preference
Consistency Act and the AbilityOne
program.
This vital bill corrects an error made
in previous law to ensure thousands of
blind and visually impaired Americans,
many of whom are veterans, are able to
keep their jobs.
Bosma Enterprises in my district,
which has served Indiana for over 100
years, serves blind and visually im-
paired Hoosiers by giving them mean-
ingful work. These Hoosiers want to
work. They want to be self-sufficient.
They want to contribute to their com-
munity. Many contributed to their
country through their military service,
which actually is where they sustained
injuries causing their blindness or vis-
ual impairment.
But Bosma relies on contracts with
the VA through the AbilityOne pro-
gram to be able to provide those good
jobs to Hoosiers. Sadly, changes in VA
policy and a series of court rulings
threaten the viability of this produc-
tive partnership.
With this important bill, Bosma and
many other AbilityOne employers like
it around the country will continue to
provide meaningful work to those
Americans.
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of this bill, and I urge the Senate to
adopt and take it up.

IMPEACHMENT VOTE IS
SHAMEFUL
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, our Found-
ing Fathers warned us against what is
happening this week on the House floor
when one political party abandons con-
stitutional principles simply for polit-
ical gain.
Tomorrow’s impeachment vote is
shameful and sets a dangerous prece-
dent. Without bringing forward any
evidence of an impeachable offense,
House Democrats have rushed this par-
tisan vote. You cannot impeach a duly
elected President simply because you
don’t like him.
For the past few months, Speaker
PELOSI and House Democrats have been
so obsessed with impeaching President
Trump that they have forgotten to do
their sworn duty, and that is to work
on behalf of the American people.
While I am glad we are finally voting
on the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement this week, the vital trade
deal was used by Democrats as a polit-
ical pawn until after they brought for-
ward their sham Articles of Impeach-
ment.
Americans must question the timing
of the votes this week: a rushed im-
peachment vote, and a much-delayed
trade deal.
So, when the American people ask
me back home, ‘‘What in the world is

f
AMERICANS ARE NOT IN FAVOR
OF IMPEACHMENT
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, our
Democratic colleagues have spent the
last few months claiming there was
clear criminal conduct from the Presi-
dent, but they don’t specifically cite
the crime in their Articles of Impeach-
ment, which we are voting on tomor-
row.
The Intelligence Committee chair-
man, Mr. SCHIFF, said there was clear
extortion, but extortion is not a direct
crime they are accusing the President
of in the articles tomorrow.
The Speaker herself has decided to
use the term ‘‘bribery’’ over the last
few weeks, but that is not explicitly
cited in the articles either.
It seems like my colleagues across
the aisle may have pulled back in ac-
cusing the President of bribery in the
last week, realizing they couldn’t en-
force it.
So what is it then? Collusion, quid
pro quo, or just some vague catchall
charge, which is what we are seeing.
It is clear the American people are
not in favor of this impeachment. Poll-
ing shows that they are moving against
that.
But what about polling? Indeed,
Democrats know this isn’t going to
stick. This is going to be a problem for
them, especially for those in the mod-
erate districts.
Let’s get back to work and do what
needs to be done around here.

CONGRATULATING STATE CHAM-
PION FOOTBALL TEAMS FROM
LOUISIANA’S FIFTH DISTRICT
(Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to congratulate five State champion-
ship football teams from Louisiana’s
Fifth District.
On December 13 and 14, the Louisiana
High School Athletic Association held
its State championship at the Super-
dome in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The Ouachita Christian Eagles won
the division IV State championship.
The Ferriday Trojans won the class 2A
State championship, and the Oak
Grove Tigers won the 1A State cham-
pionship.
In mid-November, the Midsouth As-
sociation of Independent Schools held
its high school football championships.
The Riverfield Academy Raiders won
the 4A championship, and Briarfield
Academy won the 8-man 1A champion-
ship.
These five teams have made their
communities in northeast Louisiana
proud. Please join me in congratu-
lating them on a job well done.

MATERIAL
REVISION TO THE AGGREGATES, ALLOCATIONS,

YEAR 2020
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET,
Washington, DC, December 17, 2019.
MADAM SPEAKER, Pursuant to the Bipar-
tisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA of 2019), Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA), Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), and H. Res. 293 (116th
Congress), I hereby submit for printing in
the Congressional Record a revision to the
aggregates and allocations set forth in the
Statement of Aggregates, Allocations, and
Other Budgetary Levels for Fiscal Year 2020
published in the Congressional Record on
May 3, 2019, as adjusted.
In accordance with these Acts and House
Resolution, this revision includes an allow-
able adjustment for disaster relief pursuant
to section 251(b) of BBEDCA as contained in
the House Amendment to the Senate Amend-
ment to H.R. 1158, the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2020. Additionally, an allow-
able adjustment has been made for Overseas
Contingency Operations pursuant to section

tained respectively in the House Amendment
to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1158, the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 and

ment to H.R. 1865, the Further Consolidated

Accordingly, I am revising aggregate
spending levels for fiscal year 2020 and the

propriations for fiscal year 2020. For pur-
poses of enforcing titles III and IV of the
CBA and other budgetary enforcement provi-
sions, the revised aggregates and allocation
are to be considered as aggregates and allo-
cations included in the budget resolution,
pursuant to the Statement published in the
Congressional Record on May 3, 2019, as ad-
justed.

Wheelock or Raquel Spencer of the Budget

You feed the sparrows and cause the
Sun to rise. You forgive our sins and
provide us with strength for every

f
TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President,
this week marks the second anniver-
sary of the passage of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act—December 2017—when the
biggest tax cut in the history of the
country was passed by the Congress. It
has been very successful.
The reason I come to honor this sec-
ond anniversary is because polls show
that people don’t realize the benefits of
the tax cuts. Some of them even won-
der: Did we get a tax cut?
I have some appreciation for that be-
cause I spent 10 years on an assembly
line in Cedar Falls, IA, and probably if
I got a 50-cent cut every week, I
wouldn’t know until the end of the
year that that added up to $250 more in
my pocket. So under the circumstances
of the working men and women of
America, it might be difficult to know
that.
Studies show a great benefit to the
middle-class families from this tax cut.
Thanks to these historic tax cuts and
reforms, Americans do in fact have
more money in their paychecks and
their pocketbooks. Individuals and
families have more to spend or, if they
want, to save it, and maybe a lot of
people save for retirement.
Small businesses and entrepreneurs
benefit from the tax cut. They have
more to invest in their employees and
in their business operations, and they
probably hire more Americans.
As a result, we have experienced the
longest U.S. economic expansion in his-
tory, higher wages, and historically
low unemployment—the lowest since
1969.
I am proud to say on this 2-year anni-
versary of the tax reform that it has
been a resounding success.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
all signs seem to suggest that later
this week, the House Democrats are fi-
nally going to do what many of them
have been foreshadowing for 3 years
now and impeach President Trump. It
appears that the most rushed, least
thorough, and most unfair impeach-
ment inquiry in modern history is
about to wind down after just 12 weeks
and that its slapdash work product will
be dumped on us over here in the Sen-
ate.
I will have much more to say to our
colleagues and to the American people
if and when the House does move
ahead. As we speak today, House
Democrats still have the opportunity
to do the right thing for the country
and avoid setting this toxic new prece-
dent. The House can turn back from a
cliff and not deploy this constitutional
remedy of last resort to deliver a pre-
determined partisan outcome. This
morning, I just want to speak to one
very specific part of this.
Over the weekend, the Democratic
leader decided to short-circuit the cus-
tomary and collegial process for laying
the basic groundwork in advance of a
potential impeachment trial. The pref-
erable path would have been an in-per-
son conversation, which nonetheless I
still hope to pursue. Instead, he chose
to begin by writing me an 11-paragraph
letter on Sunday evening, delivering it
by way of the news media, and begin-
ning a cable television campaign a few
hours later.
The Democratic leader’s letter is an
interesting document from the very be-
ginning. For example, in the second of
his 11 paragraphs, our colleague lit-
erally misquotes the Constitution.
That error actually aligns with our col-
league’s apparent confusion about
some of the deeper questions. I will
come back to that in a moment.
At first, our colleague’s letter ap-
pears to request that a potential im-
peachment trial adopt similar proce-
dures to the Clinton impeachment trial

SENATE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7060 December 17, 2019
back in 1999. Now, I happen to think
that is a good idea. The basic proce-
dural framework of the Clinton im-
peachment trial served the Senate and
the Nation well, in my view. But the
problem is that while the Democratic
leader notionally says he wants a po-
tential 2020 trial to look like 1999, he
goes on to demand things that would
break with the 1999 model.
In President Clinton’s trial, we han-
dled procedural issues in two separate
Senate resolutions that passed at dif-
ferent times. The first resolution
passed unanimously before the trial. It
sketched out basic things like sched-
uling, opening arguments, and the tim-
ing of a motion to dismiss. Other, more
detailed questions about the middle
and the end of the trial, including
whether any witnesses would be called,
were reserved for a second resolution
that was passed in the middle of the
trial itself. As a matter of fact, we
passed it only after a number of Demo-
crats, including Senator SCHUMER him-
self, voted to dismiss the case. They
got a motion to dismiss before the Sen-
ate had even decided whether to depose
a single witness.
Instead of the tried-and-true 1999
model—start the trial and then see how
Senators wish to proceed—the Demo-
cratic leader wants to write a com-
pletely new set of rules for President
Trump. He wants one single resolution
up front instead of two or however
many are needed. He wants to guar-
antee up front that the Senate hear
from very specific witnesses instead of
letting the body evaluate the witness
issue after opening arguments and Sen-
ators’ questions, like back in 1999.
Very tellingly, our colleague from
New York completely omits any mo-
tions to dismiss the case, like the one
he was happy to vote for himself as a
new Senator back in 1999.
Almost exactly 20 years ago today,
prior to the Senate trial, Senator
SCHUMER said this on television—a di-
rect quote—this is what he said:
Certainly any senator, according to the
rules, could move to dismiss, which is done.
. . . Every day, in criminal and civil courts
throughout America, motions to dismiss are
made. And if a majority vote for that motion
to dismiss, the procedure could be truncated.
That was Senator SCHUMER in Janu-
ary of 1999, but now the same process
that Senator SCHUMER thought was
good enough for President Clinton, he
doesn’t want to afford President
Trump. Go figure.
Look, most people understand what
the Democratic leader is really after:
He is simply trying to lock in live wit-
nesses. That is a strange request at
this juncture for a couple of reasons.
For one thing, the 1999 version of
Senator SCHUMER vocally opposed hav-
ing witnesses—even when the question
was raised after hours of opening argu-
ments from the lawyers, hours of ques-
tions from Senators, and a failed mo-
tion to dismiss. How can he have pre-
judged that he favors live witnesses so
strongly this time before the Senate
even has articles in hand?
Moreover, presumably it will be the
House prosecutors’ job to ask for the
witnesses they feel they need to make
their case. Why does the Democratic
leader here in the Senate want to pre-
determine the House impeachment
managers’ witness request for them be-
fore the House has even impeached the
President? Might he—just might he be
coordinating these questions with peo-
ple outside the Senate?
Here is one possible explanation:
Maybe the House’s public proceedings
have left the Democratic leader with
the same impression they have left
many of us: that from everything we
can tell, House Democrats’ slapdash
impeachment inquiry has failed to
come anywhere near—anywhere near—
the bar for impeaching a duly-elected
President, let alone removing him for
the first time in American history. So
those who have been eagerly hoping for
impeachment are starting to scramble.
Chairman ADAM SCHIFF and House
Democrats actively decided not to go
to court and pursue potentially useful
witnesses because they didn’t want to
wait for due process. Indeed, they
threatened to impeach the President if
they had to go to court at all. That in-
tentional, political decision is the rea-
son why the House is poised to send the
Senate the thinnest, least thorough
Presidential impeachment in our Na-
tion’s history.
By any ordinary legal standard, what
the House Democrats have assembled
appears to be woefully, woefully inad-
equate to prove what they want to al-
lege. Now the Senate Democratic lead-
er would apparently like our Chamber
to do House Democrats’ homework for
them. He wants to volunteer the Sen-
ate’s time and energy on a fishing ex-
pedition to see whether his own ideas
could make Chairman SCHIFF’s sloppy
work more persuasive than Chairman
SCHIFF himself bothered to make it.
This concept is dead wrong. The Senate
is meant to act as judge and jury, to
hear a trial, not to rerun the entire
factfinding investigation because
angry partisans rushed sloppily
through it.
The trajectory that the Democratic
leader apparently wants to take us
down before he has even heard opening
arguments could set a nightmarish
precedent for our institution. If the
Senate volunteers ourselves to do
House Democrats’ homework for them,
we will only incentivize an endless
stream of dubious partisan impeach-
ments in the future, and we will invite
future Houses to paralyze future Sen-
ates with frivolous impeachments at
will.
This misunderstanding about con-
stitutional roles brings me back to
something I raised earlier. The Demo-
cratic leader’s letter to me, by way of
the press, literally misquoted the Con-
stitution. Senator SCHUMER wrote that
we should exercise ‘‘the Senate’s ‘sole
Power of Impeachment’ under the Con-
stitution with integrity and dignity.’’
He attributed to the Senate the ‘‘sole
Power of Impeachment.’’ Well, there is
his problem. That is the role the Con-
stitution gives, actually, to the House,
not to the Senate. It gives it to the
House. Article I, section 2 says: ‘‘The
House of Representatives . . . shall
have the sole Power of Impeachment.’’
It doesn’t sound ambiguous to me.
If my colleague wants to read about
our responsibilities here in the Senate,
he needs to turn to the next page. Arti-
cle I, section 3 says: ‘‘The Senate shall
have the sole Power to try all Impeach-
ments.’’ We don’t create impeachments
over here; we judge them.
The House chose this road. It is their
duty to investigate. It is their duty to
meet the very high bar for undoing the
national election. As Speaker PELOSI
herself once said, it is the House’s obli-
gation to ‘‘build an ironclad case to
act.’’ That is Speaker PELOSI. ‘‘It is the
House’s obligation to build an ironclad
case to act.’’ If they fail, they fail. It is
not the Senate’s job to leap into the
breach and search desperately for ways
to get to guilty. That would hardly be
impartial justice.
The fact that my colleague is already
desperate to sign up the Senate for new
factfinding, which House Democrats
themselves were too impatient to see
through, well, that suggests something
to me. It suggests that even Democrats
who do not like this President are be-
ginning to realize how dramatically in-
sufficient the House’s rushed process
has been.
Well, look, I hope the House of Rep-
resentatives sees that too. If the House
Democrats’ case is this deficient and
this thin, the answer is not for the
judge and jury to cure it over here in
the Senate; the answer is that the
House should not impeach on this basis
in the first place. If the House plows
ahead, if this ends up here in the Sen-
ate, we certainly do not need jurors to
start brainstorming witness lists for
the prosecution and demanding to lock
them in before we have even heard
opening arguments.
I still believe the Senate should try
to follow the 1999 model—two resolu-
tions—first thing’s first. The middle
and the end of this process will come
later.
So I look forward to meeting with
the Democratic leader very soon and
getting our very important conversa-
tion back on the right foot.
(Mr. ROUNDS assumed the Chair.)
f
LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
an entirely different matter, there re-
mains a great deal of outstanding legis-
lation the Senate must complete for
the American people before we adjourn
for the holidays.
I was glad to see yesterday’s over-
whelming bipartisan vote to advance
the conference report to the 59th con-
secutive National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. We moved it in the Senate by
a vote of 76 to 6.

delays threatened a nearly six-decade

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7061
December 17, 2019
tradition of expressing Congress’s bi-
partisan commitment to our national
defense, but with the Senate’s final
vote later today, we will finally put
this vital legislation on the President’s
desk. I look forward to voting to pass
the NDAA today by another over-
whelming bipartisan vote for our serv-
icemembers and the critical missions
they carry out.
Of course, the Senate needs to follow
up the Defense authorization bill with
appropriations measures and funding
our national defense and domestic pri-
orities. Ensuring the Federal Govern-
ment makes careful use of taxpayer
dollars is an uphill battle by definition.
So it is critical that we plan in advance
and deliver clarity for the full year
ahead, rather than careen from one
short-term stopgap to another. This
point is especially crucial for our
Armed Forces. Underwriting the com-
mitments we make to the security of
America’s interests and our allies are
the investments we make in a 21st cen-
tury fighting force.
Our Nation’s top military com-
manders have been crystal clear: This
requires stable and predictable annual
funding. It is as simple as that. As the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General
Milley, put it recently, continuing res-
olutions are ‘‘a very ineffective and in-
efficient use of the taxpayers’ dollars.’’
The Secretary of Defense hasn’t
minced words either: ‘‘Every day that a
CR continues is one less day that we
can invest in future capabilities and fu-
ture technologies.’’
As a simple matter of good govern-
ance, avoiding another stopgap CR is
an important step. So I am encouraged
that the House is preparing to advance
full-year appropriations bills this
week. Obviously, what is actually in
these bills certainly matters. So I am
glad to say the efforts of Chairman
SHELBY, Senator LEAHY, and their
counterparts in the House and White
House negotiators have produced a bi-
partisan package of full-year funding
measures that will make needed in-
vestments in our Nation’s top prior-
ities.
First is a topline increase in funding
that our national defense requires. For
the third consecutive year, President
Trump and Republicans in Congress
will deliver on our commitment to con-
tinue rebuilding America’s military
after nearly a decade of forced belt-
tightening.
As threats to the United States, our
allies, and our interests continue to
emerge and evolve, this work is more
important than ever. America no
longer stands unchallenged in the
international system.
As Russia tests the reach of its med-
dling influence in Europe and the Mid-
dle East, as China invests heavily in re-
shaping the order of the Asia-Pacific
region in its image, a new era of great
power competition demands our atten-
tion and our action.
The defense funding measure the
House will consider today answers
these realities with a significant in-
crease in defense funding. Our com-
manders will have more resources to
modernize force structure, develop cut-
ting-edge weapon capabilities, and en-
sure that American servicemembers re-
ceive the best training, equipment, and
support available. It includes much
needed upgrades to the nuclear force
that backs up America’s strategic pos-
ture, investments in hypersonic tech-
nologies to keep pace with our biggest
adversaries, and renewed commitments
to our servicemembers and their fami-
lies here at home.
But our efforts are about more than
equipping the U.S. military to win a
fight. The funding bill takes a com-
prehensive approach to the security of
the United States and our allies. It will
unlock targeted resources for coun-
tering the creeping influence of author-
itarian powers so military engage-
ments become less likely in the first
place.
I am particularly proud that, thanks
to my own efforts, the legislation mod-
ernizes the reporting requirements of
the Hong Kong Policy Act I sponsored
back in 1992. It expands our support for
democracy in Hong Kong, including
legal support to Hong Kong activists,
and increases the Countering Russian
Influence Fund.
Of course, our work goes beyond de-
fense and foreign affairs. We are talk-
ing about full-year funding for the Fed-
eral Government’s domestic work as
well, for example, big wins for the
President’s agenda to bring more secu-
rity to the southern border. This year’s
funding bills provide another $1.4 bil-
lion for the border wall system plus
more flexibility on location than last
year’s funding. Despite the efforts of
some House Democrats during this
process, Presidential authorities to
transfer necessary funds remain intact.
The bills also fund critical transpor-
tation infrastructure grants and inland
waterways projects. They provide for
our Nation’s continuing fight against
the opioid epidemic and help equip
local authorities and first responders
combating the scourge of addiction na-
tionwide.
I am very proud and pleased that this
legislation also includes Tobacco 21
legislation that I introduced with my
friend from Virginia, Senator KAINE,
this year. Raising the age of pur-
chasing vaping devices and other to-
bacco products to 21 years old nation-
wide will take bold, direct action to
stem the tide of early nicotine addic-
tion upon our Nation’s youth.
In another provision I fought to in-
clude in this legislation, we will secure
the pension benefits of nearly 100,000
coal miners and their dependents in
Kentucky and across the country.
Another key section provides hun-
dreds of millions of dollars more for
election security, another step in the
work by Congress and this administra-
tion to make sure the lapses that took
place on the Obama administration’s
watch in 2016 are not repeated.
The list goes on and on. All manner
of important priorities will benefit this
bipartisan legislation. It is not just
about what these bills will continue, it
is also about what this legislation will
end.
It will take several more big bites
out of the failures of ObamaCare by re-
pealing more of its burdensome taxes.
Already Republicans have repealed the
board that ObamaCare set up to micro-
manage healthcare and zeroed out the
individual mandate penalty. We have
already done that. Now this legislation
the House will pass today will repeal
even more of ObamaCare’s misguided
measures such as the medical device
tax and the Cadillac tax.
So there are two timeless truths
about the appropriations process in di-
vided government. First, neither side
will ever get what they would consider
to be perfect bills, but, second, full-
year funding definitely beats drifting
endlessly from CR to CR. This legisla-
tion we expect the House to send us
today satisfies the important priorities
for the White House, for each of my
colleagues, and for the American peo-
ple. I look forward to supporting it,
and I hope Senators on both sides of
the aisle will do the same.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7062 December 17, 2019
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to address the Sen-
ate as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come
here today to address the current sta-
tus of the National Labor Relations
Board and, in particular, how the
rights of workers are being undermined
by Republican obstructionism. You see,
for decades, Presidents have nomi-
nated—and Democrats and Republicans
in the Senate have confirmed—NLRB
nominees from both parties in order to
ensure the agency can enforce laws
necessary to protect workers’ rights.
Yet, for the first time in the history
of the Board, we are now left with zero
Democratic members on the Board be-
cause of Republican inactions. To say
this is highly problematic is an under-
statement. We will be left with zero
Democrats, because, yesterday, Lauren
McFerran’s term expired. Now, Lauren
McFerran is a dedicated, highly-quali-
fied, and well-respected public servant.
Despite the repeated requests my col-
leagues and I have sent to the White
House, President Trump refuses to re-
nominate Ms. McFerran. Last year, Re-
publicans in the Senate stalled the re-
nomination of another exceptionally
qualified nominee to the NLRB, Mark
Gaston Pearce. How? Just by simply
refusing to hold the vote—instead, al-
lowing that seat to remain empty.
Now, workers are confronted with a
Board made up solely of three Repub-
licans and zero Democrats to serve on
this historically bipartisan agency.
That is simply unacceptable. I get
it—Board members, nominations,
Washington infighting—to many folks,
this may seem like ‘‘inside baseball,’’
but let me explain what this will mean
for everyday people. When workers
stand together to form a union, the
NLRB ensures that the election is fair.
If a worker is fired or unfairly punished
because they want to join a former
union, the NLRB is there and tasked
with protecting their rights. If a com-
pany refuses to negotiate fairly with
unions who are fighting for higher
rates or better benefits or safer work-
ing conditions, it is the NLRB that
safeguards those rights that have
helped build our country’s middle
class.
Quite frankly, the NLRB is a critical
worker protections agency, and work-
ers across the country will suffer be-
cause of the Republicans’ dereliction of
duty, especially as the Republican
NLRB members are now mired in alle-
gations of ethics issues. They are pur-
suing an aggressive rulemaking agenda
that will gut workers’ rights and are
undermining efforts that will enforce
protections for workers. It is clear that
workers in this country today cannot
afford, now, an imbalanced and increas-
ingly partisan NLRB.
By the way, that is just the latest ex-
ample of Republicans standing in the
way of Democratic nominees. I am still
waiting for a Democratic nominee to
the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission after Republicans blocked
the renomination of Chai Feldblum
last year.
I am deeply disappointed by the inac-
tion of the Republicans. I deplore them
to return to the normal process. The
NLRB must not become a playing field
for partisan politics. We need to end
this obstructionism and fill these seats
without any further delay.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic Leader is recognized.
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I just
listened to Leader MCCONNELL’s
lengthy response to my letter pro-
posing the outlines of a fair impeach-
ment trial in the Senate. Leader
MCCONNELL was apparently upset that
I sent him the letter on Sunday, saying
the first step was for the two leaders to
meet and then discuss a resolution.
Well, if we were allowed to show a
video here on the Senate floor of a Re-
publican leader’s appearance on Sean
Hannity’s program last week, it would
expose the fallacy of his argument.
Leader MCCONNELL, unfortunately,
skipped his first step when he began
publicly talking about the rules of a
Senate trial, telling Hannity that he
would be taking cues from the White
House and his idea for how to conduct
a trial long before any conversation—
which he still hasn’t had—with me. My
letter was intended as a good-faith pro-
posal to kick-start the discussions that
Leader MCCONNELL has so far delayed
in scheduling. I still expect we will sit
down and discuss trial parameters de-
spite his public appearances on FOX
News, but let me say this: I listened to
the leader’s speech. I did not hear a
single argument as to why the wit-
nesses I suggested should not give tes-
timony. Impeachment trials, like most
trials, have witnesses. To have none
would be an aberration.
Why is the President so afraid of hav-
ing these witnesses come testify? What
are they afraid the witnesses would
say? I would like to hear Leader
MCCONNELL come to the floor and give
specific reasons why the four witnesses
we have asked for should not testify. I
do not know what they will say. They
are President Trump appointees. They
might have something exculpatory to
say about President Trump, or they
might not, but they are certainly the
four key people who saw exactly what
was going on.
What is Leader MCCONNELL afraid of?
What is President Trump afraid of? The
truth? But the American people want
the truth, and that is why we have
asked for witnesses and documents to
get at the whole truth and nothing but.
This week, the House of Representa-
tives will vote on Articles of Impeach-
ment against the President of the
United States. If these articles pass the
House, the Constitution dictates that
the Senate serve as a court of impeach-
ment. Conducting an impeachment
trial is a tremendously weighty and
solemn responsibility entrusted to us
by our Founders. If such a trial is to
happen, Democrats strongly believe it
must be fair, and the American people
must regard it as fair. A fair trial is
one that allows Senators to get all the
relevant facts and adjudicate the case
impartially.
In the letter I sent to Leader MCCON-
NELL, I proposed a very reasonable
structure for a fair trial. I have sent
that same letter to every one of my
colleagues, Democrat and Republican.
There is a grand tradition in America,
speedy and fair trials. We want both.
The leader seems obsessed with speedy
and wants to throw fair out the win-
dow.
To simply repeat the arguments that
were made in the House and Senate,
when there are witnesses and docu-
ments that could shed light on what
actually happened, why not have them?
Let’s hear a single word of answer to
that. We have heard none. In fact, the
American people want it as well. A poll
today in the Washington Post/ABC says
72 percent of Americans want to hear
these witnesses; 64 percent of Repub-
licans do. The American people are
fair. They don’t want a coverup. They
don’t want concealment. This is
weighty stuff.
The House has put together a very,
very strong case that the President
abused his power and wanted to let a
foreign power interfere in our elec-
tions. That goes to the heart of what
our democracy is and what the Found-
ing Fathers warned against. Now, to
not allow witnesses to come forward
who would be able to discuss what ac-
tually happened—if we don’t have
them, the trial won’t be fair. The four
witnesses we proposed have direct
knowledge of why aid to Ukraine was
delayed, and the administration’s re-
quest for Ukraine to conduct two in-
vestigations for political reasons, they
have direct knowledge of those facts.
We don’t know, as I said, what kind
of evidence they will present. It may be
incriminating. It may be exculpatory.
It may influence how Senators vote. It
may not. But they certainly ought to
be heard. By virtue of their senior posi-
tions in the White House, each witness
we named was directly involved in the
events that led to the charges made by
the House.
We have also proposed subpoenaing
certain records, including emails by
certain key officials that are directly
related to the charges brought by the

December 17, 2019
House. I believe these documents are
also of great importance to making
Senators have the information nec-
essary to make a fully informed deci-
sion, this terribly weighty decision.
The House has built a very strong
case against the President. Maybe that
is why Leader MCCONNELL doesn’t seem
to want witnesses—at least not to
agree to them now. Maybe that is why
the President is afraid, because the
House case is so strong that they don’t
want witnesses who might corroborate
it.
The evidence the House put together
includes public testimony given under
oath by numerous senior officials ap-
pointed by President Trump. These are
Trump appointees we are calling, not
some partisan Democrat.
Some Republican Senators have said
that while the charges are serious,
they haven’t seen enough evidence to
make a decision. That is one of the rea-
sons I proposed subpoenas for these
witnesses and documents—all directly
relevant—from officials who have yet
to testify under oath during any stage
of the House process.
Senators who oppose this plan will
have to explain why less evidence is
better than more evidence. Let me say
that again to every Senator in this
room, Democrat and Republican: Sen-
ators who oppose this plan will have to
explain why less evidence is better
than more evidence, and they are going
to have to explain that position to a
public that is understandably skeptical
when they see an administration sup-
pressing evidence and blocking senior
officials from telling the truth about
what they know.
Let me repeat this Washington Post/
ABC poll I read about in the paper just
this morning. Seventy-one percent of
Americans believe the President should
allow his top aides to testify in a po-
tential Senate trial. Seventy-two per-
cent of Independents and 64 percent of
Republicans—64 percent of Repub-
licans—think President Trump should
allow his top aides to testify in a po-
tential Senate trial—7 out of 10 Ameri-
cans.
The American people have a wisdom,
which seems to be lacking with some of
my colleagues, that a trial without
witnesses is not a trial. It is a rush to
judgment. It is a sham trial.
The American people understand
that a trial without relevant docu-
ments is not a fair trial. Again, it is a
desire not for sunlight but for darkness
to conceal facts that may well be very
relevant.
The American people understand
that if you are trying to conceal evi-
dence and block testimony, it is prob-
ably not because the evidence is going
to help your case. It is because you are
trying to cover something up.
President Trump: Are you worried
about what these witnesses would say?
If you are not worried, let them come
forward. And if you are worried, we
ought to hear from them.
Again, the Republican leader went on
for 15, 20 minutes without giving a sin-
gle argument for why these witness
shouldn’t testify or these documents
shouldn’t be produced—unless the
President has something to hide.
In the coming weeks, every Senator
will have a choice: Do they want a fair,
honest trial that examines all the facts
or do they want a trial that doesn’t let
all of the facts come out?
We will have votes during this pro-
ceeding, should the House send it to
us—when they send it to us. After vot-
ing for it, we will have votes on wheth-
er these people should testify and
whether these documents should be
made public and part of the trial.
The American people will be watch-
ing. They will be watching. Who is for
an open and fair trial? Who is for hid-
ing facts—relevant facts, immediate
facts? Who is for covering up?
I expect to discuss this proposal for a
fair trial with Leader MCCONNELL, but
each individual Senator will have both
the power and the responsibility to
help shape what an impeachment trial
looks like.
In Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton
wondered:
Where else than in the Senate could have
been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified,
or sufficiently independent [to serve as a
court of impeachment]? What other body
would be likely to feel CONFIDENCE
ENOUGH . . . to preserve unawed and
uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality?
My colleagues, Leader MCCONNELL:
Are you, in Alexander Hamilton’s
words, unawed and uninfluenced to
produce the necessary impartiality or
will you participate in a coverup?
Can we live up to Hamilton’s fine
words with dignity, independence, and
confidence to preserve the necessary
impartiality to conduct a fair trial?
That question should weigh heavily
upon every single Senator.
APPROPRIATIONS
Before the week concludes, we must
pass legislation to keep the govern-
ment open and provide appropriations
for the following year. Luckily, over
the weekend, an agreement was
reached between appropriators—House
and Senate, Democrat and Repub-
lican—that would see us achieve that
goal.
I am proud to report that the final
appropriations agreements includes
several important Democratic prior-
ities to help American families.
Democrats have secured more than
$425 million in election security grants,
nearly double the amount Senate Re-
publicans reluctantly supported in ear-
lier legislation.
Democrats have secured an increase
of $550 million in grants to help offset
the cost of childcare for low-income
families.
Democrats have made progress on a
number of fronts to combat climate
change: Record-level funding for clean
energy and energy efficiency programs;
record-level funding to provide clean,
electric buses; and increased funding
for climate change science and re-
search.
For the first time in decades, Demo-
crats have secured $25 million in gun
violence research at the CDC and NIH,
breaking through what had been a ri-
diculous ban on gun violence research.
Medical research, scientific research,
environmental protection, education,
and housing programs will all see sig-
nificant increases in federal support.
Of course, we did not achieve every-
thing we wanted. I am sorely dis-
appointed that we were unable to reach
an agreement on more resources to
clean up PFAS contamination, a toxic
chemical that has plagued too many
communities in my home State of New
York and communities across the
country.
Senate Democrats have done a lot of
hard work on this issue. Our dis-
appointment today will in no way di-
minish our resolve to force Congress to
take action on PFAS next year.
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
Yesterday, the term of National
Labor Relations Board member Lauren
McFerran expired. For the first time in
over 35 years, the Nation’s most impor-
tant labor protection agency is now
without a single Democratic board
member to defend labor rights.
For nearly eight decades, the NLRB
has been the Nation’s top agency fight-
ing for the protection of workers’
rights, including the right to form a
union and collectively bargain for bet-
ter wages, benefits, and safer condi-
tions. Over the past three years, as
President Trump has sought to under-
mine these protections, Democratic
members of the Board have been cru-
cial in pushing back. The NLRB was
designed to be bipartisan, but I fear
that with Ms. McFerran’s departure, an
all-Republican NLRB—without a
strong pro-worker, pro-labor voice—
will not stand in the way of President
Trump’s dismantling of worker protec-
tions, and may even help accelerate it.
The President has claimed to be a
champion for working Americans, but
over the last 3 years, he has shown that
he is anything but. From opposing
minimum wage increases to reversing
rules that protect workers on the job
. . . to nominating people like Eugene
Scalia to the Department of Labor and
Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court,
the President has put powerful cor-
porate interests before workers’ inter-
ests. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans
have stonewalled Democratic nominees
to the NLRB. Working Americans will
remember the record as 2020 fast ap-
proaches.
CHINA
Last Friday, President Trump an-
nounced a temporary, partial trade
agreement with China. After 8 months
of negotiations, it is stunning how lit-
tle this deal achieved for the United
States at such a high cost to American
workers and businesses.
In exchange for a drastic reduction in
our leverage, China has made some
short-term assurances to buy more ag-
ricultural products from us without
real commitments to end its most ra-
pacious trade practices. It appears that

S7064 December 17, 2019
President Trump has ordered a retreat
while declaring victory.
I have been very open about praising
President Trump’s tough stance on ne-
gotiating with China. To succeed in
these high-stakes negotiations, I have
urged the President to stay tough and
not settle for photo ops or weak deals.
I have said that he must be prepared to
walk away if China refuses to make
significant, credible, and enforceable
concessions.
But under this new, temporary deal,
President Trump is selling the farm for
a few magic soybeans. By USTR
Lighthizer’s admission, last week’s
deal fails to make significant progress
on ending China’s worst trade abuses,
like intellectual property theft, forced
technology transfers, illegal dumping,
and more. That is not nearly good
enough. And I worry that President
Trump, by cutting this small, insub-
stantial deal, has made the success of
future, more difficult negotiations
much more doubtful.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from
Kentucky.
S. 1790
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we have
before us today the National Defense
Authorization Act to authorize the
programs and policies of the Depart-
ment of Defense. We will be taking a
vote to finalize this bill shortly.
Our national defense is incredibly
important. It is mandated in the Con-
stitution. Our national defense is argu-
ably Congress’s primary constitutional
responsibility.
I have great respect and honor for
those in uniform who serve. In fact, I
recently introduced a bill to give each
soldier who served in the War on Ter-
ror a $2,500 bonus and, at the same
time, officially end the war in Afghani-
stan. Ending the Afghan war would
save us about $50 billion a year.
Unfortunately, the bill before us does
not end any of our multitude of wars.
The bill before us simply continues the
status quo and throws more money
around the world at conflicts we can’t
even begin to fathom.
Before rubberstamping more money,
it is worth a moment for us to take a
step back and consider two things.
First, we need to ask ourselves whether
borrowing millions of dollars year after
year to fuel our appetite for more mili-
tary spending is a wise policy in the
years ahead.
Second, we need to look at how this
bill has been loaded up to carry things
only somewhat related or not related
at all to national defense.
As I have reminded my colleagues
often, Admiral Mullen, the former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said that the national debt was our
greatest national security threat. His
exact wording was ‘‘the most signifi-
cant threat to our national security is
our debt.’’ That was in 2010.
When he made that remark, our debt
was only $13 trillion. Our debt is now
over $23 trillion. We just keep bor-
rowing and borrowing, and there is no
end in sight.
Under the new budget deal passed by
Republicans and Democrats, we are
borrowing $2.75 billion every day. In
fact, we are borrowing nearly $2 mil-
lion every minute.
We spend more on our military than
the next seven largest militaries com-
bined. Our Defense Department is so
large that it took them a decade to
even figure out how to audit them-
selves. Then they said that the audit
itself would cost over half a billion dol-
lars. But then, last year, they arrived
back at square one. After all that ef-
fort, they said: Well, we just can’t fig-
ure it out. It is too big. We can’t audit
the Army, the Navy, the Marines, or
the Air Force.
We spend so much money that the
Department of Defense literally can’t
keep track of all of it. We don’t have a
great idea of exactly how much we are
wasting because no one can get a grip
on how much is being spent.
A few years ago, the Defense Busi-
ness Board, which is a defense advisory
panel of corporate executives who re-
port to the Secretary of Defense, rec-
ommended that the Department of De-
fense can save $125 billion in adminis-
trative expenses.
According to news accounts, that re-
port scared everyone at the Pentagon,
so they buried the report. They even
tried to keep it away from Congress for
fear that Congress might actually do
something with it, although I wouldn’t
be holding my breath or too worried. I
am not familiar with Congress ever
cutting anything.
We are set to spend $738 billion on
the military this year. That is up $22
billion from last year. Over the past 6
years, military spending has risen over
$120 billion. We say that we are for ac-
countability, efficiency, and savings.
Yet we keep piling good money after
bad. How can we demand better ac-
counting and efficiency when we budg-
et increases every year?
To be clear, I support our national
defense. Supporting our servicemem-
bers is a worthy cause. There are
things in this bill that I do support. I
am a cosponsor of the bill to eliminate
the so-called widow’s tax, and I have
argued that it is the right thing to do.
We should find the money to pay for it.
That is in this bill.
I support returning the 101st Air-
borne at Fort Campbell to its full air
assault capacity with the return of a
combat aviation brigade. That is in
this bill.
I support giving our servicemembers
a pay increase. That is in the bill. But
I take issue when Congress adds other
things to this bill that don’t have any-
thing to do with our military.
This bill would sanction NATO allies
and potentially American energy com-
panies if they have any involvement
with Nord Stream 2 pipeline. This is a
pipeline between Russia and Germany.
The pipeline is basically done. It may
well be completed in the next few
months. The pipeline will be com-
pleted. Yet we want to jeopardize our
relationship with our allies and with
businesses both in Europe and Amer-
ica.
This bill would also drop more sanc-
tions into the middle of the Syrian
civil war, as well as funding for so-
called ‘‘vetted’’ Syrian rebel groups.
All this would do is prolong the Syrian
civil war and, with it, the humani-
tarian suffering and displacement we
have seen in the region. The Syrian
civil war is largely over. I agree with
President Trump that it is time to
come home.
Another problem with our insatiable
appetite for more military spending is
that it requires conservatives to make
bad compromises. If you want $40 bil-
lion in new defense spending, then you
have to give the liberals $40 billion new
domestic spending. If anything, that is
the real nature of today’s bipartisan-
ship: You can have your money as long
as we get our money.
The dirty little secret in Washington
is that there is actually too much com-
promise. Republicans want more mili-
tary spending; Democrats want more
welfare money. And with each new
Congress, Congress always chooses to
spend and borrow more money.
For example, this bill provides a new
mandatory benefit program: paid pa-
rental leave for all Federal employees,
starting next year. The program will
cost over $3 billion forever—and most
of these programs continue to expand
forever. The program will cost $3 bil-
lion a year, and, of course, there is
nothing in the bill that tells how we
are going to pay for it. So we are going
to have paid leave, everybody, but we
are going to borrow the money from
China to give this great benefit.
In essence, today, Congress is simply
saying: Add it to my tab; the deficit be
damned. Regardless of how you feel
about the issue, this represents a bet-
ter benefit than many working Ameri-
cans enjoy, and it has nothing to do
with national defense.
Conservatism is more than sup-
porting military spending at any cost.
We have to do more and make tough
decisions that enable a strong national
defense and a balanced budget.
Many so-called conservatives will
hail this bloated military spending,
but, in truth, there is nothing fiscally
conservative about borrowing money
from China to pay for our military. In
fact, I would argue that borrowing
money to buy more tanks or planes or
to police the far corners of the Earth
actually damages our national secu-
rity.
Some have argued that our military
is hollowed out, exhausted from so
many far-flung conflicts—probably
true. They will argue that we must ex-
pand military spending to meet the
mission.
Perhaps we should entertain the op-
posite argument. Perhaps it is not that
our military budget is too small but

that our military mission is too large.
I, for one, hope for a day when Con-
gress rediscovers that our constitu-
tional mandate is to defend America
first and only to become involved in
war as a last resort and, even then,
America should only become involved
in war when Congress has debated and
done its constitutional duty to declare
war.
Until that day, I will continue to
argue that the only fiscally conserv-
ative, fiscally responsible action is to
vote against expanding the military
budget. I encourage my fellow Senators
to consider that.
I yield back.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank my
colleague for his words. I will add to
that, I hope.
As we approach the end of the first
session of Congress, I think it may be
prudent to look back at some of the
news surrounding the current state of
the Nation’s budgetary affairs. Unfor-
tunately, none of the news is good.
This past summer, Congress passed
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019,
which increased the last 2 years of the
Budget Control Act’s discretionary
funding caps. The Congressional Budg-
et Office tells us that the bill has in-
creased their forecast of the Nation’s
projected deficits by $1.7 trillion over
the next 10 years.
I will be the first to admit that it is
largely due to mandatory programs,
which already have inadequate reve-
nues.
In the fall, we received final tax and
spending data for fiscal year 2019. The
report showed the deficit for the last
fiscal year was $984 billion, even
though revenues were greater than
ever before. Relative to the size of the
economy, that deficit—an estimated 4.6
percent of GDP—was the highest since
2012. This also marked the fourth con-
secutive year the deficit increased as a
share of the economy. These growing
deficits at a time of economic strength
should be a warning sign to all. Yet
hardly a whimper was heard.
In October, our national debt hit the
$23 trillion mark. It was in the papers
for a while, but interest quickly waned.
We simply cannot continue down this
path.
I know the bill before us is well-in-
tentioned, and it contains many pro-
posals that I support. Chairman INHOFE
and Ranking Member REED and our
Armed Services colleagues have
worked hard to deliver the Defense au-
thorization bill, and I commend them
for the work they put into trying to
reach agreement with the House. Un-
fortunately, CBO tells us this bill will
significantly add to our debt both in
the near and long term. This is much
different than the budgetary impact of
the bill the Senate approved earlier
this year.
Ultimately, this bill furthers the
practice of passing legislation while ig-
noring the budget rules of the Senate
and our overspending problem. All of
this borrowing will continue to cost us
increased interest payments and will
hamstring future generations of Ameri-
cans. Congress has the power to correct
course now, and I look forward to
working in good faith with the pro-
ponents of this legislation. Until that
work can be completed, I have to op-
pose it.
Mr. President, the conference report
accompanying S. 1790 would cause a
deficit increase of more than $5 billion
in each of the four consecutive 10-year
periods beginning in fiscal year 2030. A
benefit that isn’t funded, once put in
place, will never be taken away or even
reduced. This increase violates section
3101 of the 2016 budget resolution.
Therefore, I raise a point of order
under section 3101(b) of S. Con. Res. 11,
the concurrent resolution on the budg-
et for fiscal year 2016. Finally, I ask
unanimous consent that this point of
order be debatable until the
postcloture time on the conference re-
port to accompany S. 1790 expires.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to
discuss the fiscal year 2020 National
Defense Authorization Act. After sev-
eral weeks of debate and negotiation,
the House and Senate Armed Services
Committees have completed the con-
ference report, which addresses critical
issues facing our military and our
country’s national security.
I would like to thank Senator
INHOFE, Chairman SMITH, and Ranking
Member THORNBERRY for their thought-
fulness, hard work, and cooperation
throughout the process.
This was not an easy conference.
There were many difficult issues and
differences of opinion that had to be
worked through. I think it is safe to
say that many have misgivings about
one provision or another, but there are
so many other positive provisions that
many will consider a legislative suc-
cesses, in my view. That is the art of
compromise. Overall, it is a very good
conference report that helps the mili-
tary and the American people. Last
week, this conference report passed by
a vote of 379 to 48 in the House, and I
hope it will have the same strong sup-
port in the Senate.
As we consider the conference report,
I would like to highlight several areas
that I am particularly pleased with and
address several items that have been of
concern to some Members.
In accordance with the budget agree-
ment, the NDAA conference report au-
thorizes $658.4 billion for the Depart-
ment of Defense and national security
programs of the Department of Energy,
$71.5 billion for overseas contingency
operations, and $5.3 billion in emer-
gency funding to restore installations
that were damaged by extreme weather
and natural disasters.
The conference report includes a
number of important provisions to sup-
port our servicemembers, their fami-
lies, and the civilian employees of the
Department of Defense who support
them, including a 3.1-percent pay raise
for troops and the authorization of a
number of bonus, special, and incentive
pays to encourage enlistment and reen-
listment in the Armed Forces.
We continue our efforts to eliminate
sexual harassment and assault in our
military. Over the last 12 years, we
have legislated nearly 200 changes in
law to combat sexual assault. In this
conference report, we direct the Comp-
troller General to assess the implemen-
tation and effectiveness of these re-
quirements.
We also include a number of new pro-
visions to continue our fight against
this scourge, including increasing in-
vestigative resources to expedite inves-
tigations, increasing access to Victims’
Legal Counsel and Victim Witness Pro-
gram liaisons to support survivors of
sexual assault, requiring additional
training for commanders, and requiring
more transparency with sexual assault
survivors about the progress of court-
martial and administrative processes.
We also include new provisions to more
effectively address domestic violence
and child exploitation. We cannot rest.
We must continue to insist that we do
all we can to prevent this scourge from
permeating our military forces.
The conference report also includes
the Fair Chance Act, which ensures
that applicants for positions in the
Federal Government and with Federal
contractors are treated fairly by re-
stricting requests for criminal back-
ground information until the condi-
tional offer stage.
As everyone is aware, the conference
report includes 12 weeks of paid paren-
tal leave for the Federal civilian work-
force, an important benefit that will
help the Federal Government recruit
and retain the very best civilian talent.
The conference report authorizes a
number of important Army and Air
Force programs. The final bill supports
funding for 73 UH–6M Blackhawks and
48 AH–64 Apache helicopters in the
Army.
In addition, the conference bill au-
thorizes an additional $75.6 million to
accelerate the Future Long-Range As-
sault Aircraft Program, which is a top
modernization priority for the U.S.
Army. The agreement also fully sup-
ports upgrading 165 Abrams tanks and
includes an additional $249.2 million to
integrate a medium caliber weapon
system onto the Stryker platform.
This was an unfunded armor require-
ment which we were able to meet.
With regard to the Air Force, the
conference report includes $1 billion for
12 additional F–35A aircraft, which was
an unfunded requirement for the Air
Force, as well as $392 million for 4 addi-
tional C–130J aircraft to support in-
creased inter-theater airlift capability.
The bill also includes language that ex-
tends the Department’s authority to
protect critical facilities and assets
from unauthorized operation of un-
manned aircraft.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7066 December 17, 2019
I am pleased the conference agree-
ment includes key provisions and au-
thorizes critical funding that will
strengthen naval readiness and sub-
marine production. This conference re-
port reaffirms that we must maintain a
minimum of 11 aircraft carriers to pro-
tect our national interests around the
world and authorizes the first year ap-
propriations for the midlife refueling of
the USS Harry S. Truman.
It continues the construction of two
Virginia-class submarines per year and
supports the nine-boat multiyear con-
tract, with an option for a tenth boat,
that the Navy and Electric Boat signed
earlier this month.
The report also supports full funding
for the Columbia-class ballistic missile
submarine.
I am particularly pleased that the
conference agreement also authorizes
additional funding to continue to sup-
port the expansion of the submarine in-
dustrial business, as well as workforce
development.
The conference report further bol-
sters maritime sealift and mobilization
by reauthorizing the Maritime Admin-
istration, including authorizing a new
cable security fleet program and re-
quiring the Secretary of the Navy to
seek to enter into a contract for addi-
tional sealift vessels.
Finally, in order to keep our existing
ships ready for deployment, the con-
ference agreement authorizes addi-
tional funding for Navy ship and sub-
marine depot maintenance to ensure
key shipyard availabilities are not fur-
ther delayed due to the existing main-
tenance backlog.
The conference agreement authorizes
full funding for the President’s request
to continue modernizing our nuclear
deterrence and its triad of delivery
platforms, which are rapidly aging out.
This modernization effort began in 2010
and will continue for the next 15 to 20
years. Our ballistic submarines will
begin to age out in the 2030s. Our heavy
bombers will be replaced in the 2040s,
after having served for over 80 years.
And our ICBMs will start to be re-
placed in the 2030s, after having been
on alert 24/7, 365-days a year, for over 60
years.
On the issue of low-yield nuclear
weapons, while I opposed the deploy-
ment of the low-yield submarine bal-
listic missile in last year’s bill and sup-
ported the provision in this year’s
House bill, which again would have
prohibited deployment, that provision
was not included in this year’s con-
ference report. I maintain that this is
one weapon that will not add to our na-
tional security but would only increase
the risk of miscalculation with dire
consequences, and regret the House
provision was not included in the
House report.
Perhaps the most bipartisan topic in
the fiscal year 2020 NDAA was
privatized housing reform. Over 30 pro-
visions were included to help the De-
fense Department reinvigorate its over-
sight of housing companies. Over the
last year, the Armed Service Com-
mittee received hundreds of calls for
help directly from military families.
Their stories of hardship, photos of
substandard home conditions, and re-
ports of nonresponsive customer serv-
ice by the housing companies spurred
this comprehensive package of reforms.
While this will likely not be the last
NDAA to address housing problems,
the fiscal year 2020 bill makes a signifi-
cant first step in several key areas. For
example, we begin by requiring several
standards in the ‘‘tenant bill of
rights.’’
We ensure that DOD has a single in-
dividual in charge of privatized housing
and, in the event housing companies
are found to be responsible for causing
medical problems, there will be a way
for families to be compensated appro-
priately. Families will now be guaran-
teed access to work order systems and
see what kind of home they are inhab-
iting prior to moving in, much like
consumers get a Carfax report before
they buy a used car. Companies must
now disclose their bonus structures,
document a complaint database made
by families online, and are prohibited
from forcing families to sign nondisclo-
sure agreements.
The DOD must also create and imple-
ment a standardized formal dispute
resolution process and a uniform lease
across all installations.
We still have a long way to go as a
Congress to ensure military families
are getting the kinds of quality homes
and living conditions they deserve, but
the fiscal year 2020 NDAA sets every-
one on the right path, and we will con-
tinue to be watching both DOD and the
housing companies.
In another area of importance to the
safety of all families, after too many
years of status quo, the NDAA includes
a number of new authorities and re-
quirements for the DOD to confront its
use of toxic PFAS chemicals. While we
were ultimately unable to reach an
agreement with the House establishing
new regulations through the Safe
Drinking Water Act and other substan-
tial improvements, like cleanup via
CERCLA and declarations of hazardous
substances, the NDAA does make a
number of new changes. For example,
the Department of Defense must phase
out the use of PFAS in firefighting
foams on its installations. The bill re-
stores the National Guard’s access to
defense environmental restoration ac-
counts, presses DOD to enter coopera-
tive agreements with local entities
contaminated by PFAS chemicals, and
extends the ongoing CDC human health
study of PFAS in drinking water.
With respect to countering the con-
tinued threat by ISIS, the bill extends
the train-and-equip programs that un-
derpin our partnerships with the Syr-
ian defense forces and Iraqi security
forces, while ensuring appropriate con-
gressional oversight of the use of such
funds.
Specific to Iraq, the bill also begins
to normalize security assistance to
Iraq by transitioning funding to endur-
ing authorities.
The conference report also includes
the bipartisan Caesar Syria Civilian
Protection Act, which is intended to
help facilitate an end to the conflict in
Syria and hold responsible those who
have perpetrated war crimes. Specifi-
cally, the bill sanctions foreign persons
who knowingly provide significant fi-
nancial, material, or technological sup-
port to or knowingly engage in a sig-
nificant transaction with the Syrian
Government and authorizes the Sec-
retary of State to provide support to
entities conducting criminal investiga-
tions, supporting prosecutions, or col-
lecting evidence against those who
have committed war crimes or crimes
against humanity in Syria.
With regard to Afghanistan, the bill
extends several authorities to train
and equip the Afghanistan National
Defense and Security Forces. It also
authorizes the Department of Defense
to provide support for bottom-up, Gov-
ernor of Afghanistan-led reconciliation
activities and mandates that the Sec-
retary of State, in coordination with
the Secretary of Defense, advocate for
the inclusion of Afghan women in on-
going future negotiations to end the
conflict in Afghanistan. It is in the in-
terest of all parties to forge a nego-
tiated settlement that brings this con-
flict to a close while also protecting
U.S. security interests and basic
human rights.
The bill also includes 4,000 additional
special immigrant visas and the exten-
sion of the SIV Program so we can con-
tinue to honor commitments made to
our wartime allies in Afghanistan.
As recent press reports indicate,
after almost 18 years of combat and ca-
pacity building, Afghan military and
political institutions are fragile, and
the Taliban remains a serious threat.
Moreover, terrorist groups like al-
Qaida and ISIS continue to pose a po-
tential threat to the region and be-
yond. The Armed Services Committee
and other committees of jurisdiction
must undertake a comprehensive eval-
uation of the causes of the current sit-
uation and help facilitate a thoughtful
way ahead.
The conference report also contains a
number of provisions to address the
continuing threat of foreign malign in-
fluence from Russia and others coun-
tries. Deterring and countering this
threat to our democracy is critical
ahead of the 2020 Presidential elec-
tions.
The bill requires an update to our
strategy for countering Russian malign
influence, which needs to be better co-
ordinated across U.S. Government De-
partments and Agencies, and expands
that strategy to cover China, Iran, and
other malign actors.
To guard against malign foreign ac-
tors seeking to gain access to sensitive
information through DOD contractors,
the conference report includes a provi-
sion that I sponsored to enhance re-
quirements for DOD contractors and

subcontractors to disclose beneficial
ownership information, including
whether companies are subject to for-
eign ownership, control, or influence.
The Intelligence authorization bill,
which is part of the conference report,
also includes key provisions to counter
foreign malign influence that have
been of particular interest to me.
First, it authorizes establishing a
Foreign Malign Influence Response
Center, which would bring together all
elements of the intelligence commu-
nity and serve as a primary organiza-
tion for analyzing and integrating in-
telligence on foreign malign influence
to provide a common operating picture
across the government.
The Intelligence authorization bill
also authorizes the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence to facilitate the es-
tablishment of an independent, non-
profit, Social Media Data and Threat
Analysis Center to bring tech compa-
nies and researchers together to ana-
lyze indicators of foreign adversary
threat networks across social media
platforms.
Finally, the conference report au-
thorizes funds for research on foreign
malign influence trends and indicators,
including on foreign weaponization of
‘‘deepfakes’’—that is, videos or other
media that is digitally manipulated by
foreign governments to spread
disinformation.
Turning to Ukraine, the conference
report authorizes an increase in fund-
ing for the Ukraine Security Assist-
ance Initiative to provide critical aid,
including lethal assistance, to this
strategic partner to defend itself
against Russian aggression against its
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
With respect to Turkey, the con-
ference report prohibits Turkey’s par-
ticipation in the F–35 aircraft program
as long as it possesses the Russian S–
400 air defense system. It expresses the
sense of Congress that Turkey’s pur-
chase of the S–400 system triggers con-
gressionally mandated sanctions and
urges the administration to impose
those sanctions, which are long over-
due.
As everyone is aware, this conference
report does create a sixth service with-
in the Air Force for a Space Force. Its
mission will be to deter hostile actions
in space against the United States and
its allies.
I would note that the organization
created in this conference report is far
more robust than was originally passed
in the Senate bill. I believe this bill
may be trying to do too much, too fast,
and will require significant oversight.
That being said, I do believe the atten-
tion we have paid to space and pro-
tecting our national security assets in
space is vitally important. I will con-
tinue to work on this issue in the com-
ing years.
Finally, with respect to substantive
provisions, I would like to touch on an
issue I find very problematic. I am
deeply disappointed that, despite my
strong support, provisions intended to
prohibit U.S. involvement in the civil
war in Yemen, including arms transfers
to the Saudi-led coalition, are not in-
cluded in the conference report. The
civil war in Yemen is the world’s worst
ongoing humanitarian crisis, and the
administration should be playing a
more active and constructive role in
ending the conflict and achieving a sus-
tainable peace.
I strongly support a prohibition on
offensive arms transfers and other of-
fensive support for the Saudi-led coali-
tion and will continue working to stop
the bloodshed and suffering in Yemen.
We must redouble our efforts in sup-
port of the Yemeni people and increase
humanitarian assistance. Iran, al-
Qaida, ISIS, and others continue to
benefit from the chaos of this pro-
tracted conflict, and ending the war is
in the long-term security interests of
both the United States and Saudi Ara-
bia.
Stronger U.S. support for peace talks
can and should set the conditions for
Yemenis to negotiate a durable peace
and for the international community
to begin the difficult but critical work
of restoring stability and basic services
to the people of Yemen. These objec-
tives will remain significant priorities
going forward.
Let me conclude by again thanking
Senator INHOFE for his superb leader-
ship and Chairman SMITH for his superb
leadership of the conference, which is a
very challenging responsibility. They
discharged it with great skill. I also
thank Ranking Member MAC THORN-
BERRY, who was extraordinarily
thoughtful and professional in his de-
portment, and all the conferees for
their bipartisan support throughout
the process. This process has been col-
legial and has been an example of a
strong piece of legislation that address-
es concerns of Members on both sides
of the aisle.
I would also like to thank the staffs
of the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee and the House Armed Services
Committee for all their fine work on
drafting a thoughtful and comprehen-
sive bill. Their diligent work through-
out the NDAA process has been inte-
gral in producing the strong bill before
us today.
Let me say this: They are not identi-
fied enough, in my view. The work they
did and continue to do has been su-
perb—absolutely superb. I want to per-
sonally thank them. Let me thank
John Bonsell, Elizabeth King, Jen
Stewart, and Paul Arcangeli for their
help. They are the staff directors of the
committees in both the House and the
Senate.
If my colleagues would bear with me,
I want to recognize all of our staff
members because they don’t get the
credit they deserve. Beginning alpha-

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the following

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama.
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I want to
first thank Senator INHOFE and Sen-
ator REED and their staff for their
amazing work on this National Defense
Authorization Act. What we are about
to accomplish is truly remarkable, not
only for America but for individuals
and families.
I am rising today as grateful and as
humbled as I could ever imagine being
in this Senate Chamber, but I am also
just the opposite—I am excited like a
kid at Christmas waiting to have the
final passage of this because it means
so much. We are at the finish line,
about to run through the tape in a
race, a marathon that so many folks
thought we could never finish. I am
talking about this momentous and his-
toric National Defense Authorization
Act upon which we are about to vote
and pass in just a few moments.
The NDAA includes so many of our
collective priorities to bolster the de-
fense of our Nation, to modernize our
military, and to take care of our serv-
icemembers and their families. But in-
cluded very deep within this incredibly
thick piece of legislation is a provision
that has been repeatedly introduced
over the past 18 years, but it has never
gotten across that finish line. I am
speaking about the Military Widow’s
Tax Elimination Act.
For the past four decades, the mili-
tary widow’s tax has prevented sur-
viving military spouses from receiving
the full benefits they are owed by the
U.S. Government. Legislation to repeal
this unfair law has been repeatedly in-
troduced in Congress for the last 18
years, but money and budgets and
points of order have always won out
over the commitment we have made to
these families.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7068 December 17, 2019
When I introduced it with my friend
and colleague Senator COLLINS earlier
this year, we knew it was going to be
an uphill battle. We knew that the
fight had been going on for so long and
that we faced a steep climb, but we
took a great deal of strength and moti-
vation from the impacted widows
themselves who have fought and advo-
cated for this bill for nearly two dec-
ades. They have been a regular pres-
ence on Capitol Hill, asking year after
year for Members of Congress to lend
an ear to their cause. I was heart-
broken when one of them told me they
felt like they were easy to brush off be-
cause they were ‘‘just a bunch of little
old ladies.’’
I was heartbroken when Cathy Mil-
ford said every time she came up here
it was like digging up her husband and
burying him all over again.
After 18 years without success, yet
all the while being told how supportive
Members of Congress are for their serv-
ice and sacrifice, time and time again,
you could see how disheartening that
might be when they would go home
emptyhanded.
So when I told them this was the
year—Senator COLLINS and I had made
it our mission that this was going to be
the year we were finally going to get
this done—there were more than a few
of them who were skeptical, but they
were, of course, always optimistic.
We knew we had to fight harder than
ever before if we were going to be suc-
cessful. We had to make our case that
this injustice could no longer stand. As
we did, one by one, Senators and Mem-
bers of the House joined this cause
with us. By summertime, in this body,
we had earned an unprecedented num-
ber of Senators’ support for this bill.
Today, as we are about to vote, there
are over three-fourths of the U.S. Sen-
ate who have cosponsored this legisla-
tion. Think of that. In such a partisan
time as we live in right now, in this
moment, three-fourths of the U.S. Sen-
ate has voiced their support.
Because of the momentum we built,
this is the year, this is the day, we will
finally honor the commitment we
made to these families who have given
everything to our country. This is the
year, this is the day, we will let our ac-
tions speak louder than words, the year
we finally put our money where our
mouth is when it comes to honoring
our servicemembers and their families.
This is the year, this is the day, we fi-
nally repeal the widow’s tax once and
for all.
It is, to be candid, difficult to articu-
late what it means to me to be able to
help bring this legislation across the
finish line for these surviving spouses.
Their strength, their devotion, and
their grit have made this all possible.
Their loved ones gave what Abraham
Lincoln called ‘‘the last full measure of
devotion’’ to our country, and the con-
tinued commitment to that devotion
by their surviving spouses is a daily re-
minder of why I am here, why we are
all here.
In their own way, these widows have
also fought to advance the ideals and
values of the Nation we all love so
much. Instead of becoming bitter or
jaded when learning of this injustice,
these incredible women worked to
make things right. Year after year,
they would gather in Washington to
meet with Members of the House and
the Senate to beg Congress to right
this wrong, only to be told that as un-
fair as this may be, eliminating the
widow’s tax would just cost us too
much. For 18 years, they were told it
could never get done, but they never
ever gave up.
It kind of reminds me of a movie that
was one of my favorite movies years
ago called ‘‘Network,’’ in which the
late actor Peter Finch starred as a
somewhat crazed newscaster who was
so fed up with the state of affairs in
this country that he implored all those
watching to go to their windows and
throw open the windows and just yell:
‘‘I’m mad as hell, and I’m not going to
take it anymore,’’ and they did.
That is essentially what these wid-
ows did as well. Year after year, they
screamed that they were not going to
take it anymore, and they built mo-
mentum that led to this historic vote
today.
I am so glad this fight is finally com-
ing to an end. I am going to miss their
regular visits and their friendship. I
truly hope they know how much it has
meant to me and my staff as well. My
staff has been all in. Everybody has
been so dedicated and so passionate
about getting this across the finish
line.
I am deeply grateful to Senators
INHOFE and REED, who have been crit-
ical to this effort to get this done.
Without them, it would not have been
possible. For their support, I am truly
appreciative.
More important, I am especially
grateful to my partner in all of this,
Senator COLLINS, whose deeply held
commitment was vital to our success.
Today we will celebrate the end to
our four-decades-old fight. We will take
stock in this great achievement to-
gether, but tomorrow we must turn our
attention to the next big issue because
there are so many others who need our
help, our attention, and our courage to
do the right thing.
For now—for now we can celebrate
because today those military spouses
who had once proclaimed they were
mad as hell and not going to take it
are watching this proceeding with a
more joyous feeling. These widows are
watching in the quiet of their homes,
perhaps in the Gallery, many of them
grasping a photograph of their loved
ones, their late husbands, but they all
have tears in their eyes, saying to each
other and to us in this body: Thank
you because now I am happy as hell
that I don’t have to take it anymore.
I assure my colleagues that right
now their spouses, those who gave the
ultimate sacrifice for this country, are
watching from that heavenly perch
above, standing at full attention, and
saluting the Members of this Congress
and saying: Thank you. Thank you for
recognizing the ultimate sacrifice I
made for this country. Thank you be-
cause you have demonstrated a com-
mitment to me and my service, and
with that final commitment from you,
the commitment I made to my loved
ones, the commitment to care for them
even after I am gone, has finally been
fulfilled, and I can truly rest in peace.
To my colleagues in the Senate, by
your vote today, you are doing so much
more than modernizing our military
providing for the Nation’s defense. By
your vote today, you are returning
their salute—the salute to those brave
servicemembers who gave their all in
service to this country.
Folks, this is a really, really big deal,
and I salute all the Members of this
body for their efforts.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am
delighted to join my friend and col-
league from Alabama, Senator JONES,
to urge support for the final passage of
the National Defense Authorization
Act, which finally—finally—contains
repeal of what is commonly called the
military widow’s tax.
I want to commend Chairman INHOFE
and Ranking Member REED for includ-
ing this important provision in the bill
and for their excellent job in crafting
the legislation overall.
This significant bill contains numer-
ous provisions critical to our national
security and important to the great
State of Maine, but right now I want to
join my colleague Senator JONES in
celebrating and highlighting one long-
fought-for provision, and that is the re-
peal of the Survivor Benefit Plan and
Dependency and Indemnity Compensa-
tion offset, commonly referred to as
the military widow’s tax.
Let me explain exactly what the
problem is. Many military retirees pur-
chase, with their own money, a form of
insurance called the Survivor Benefit
Plan. If they subsequently die of a
military-connected illness, their sur-
viving spouse qualifies for a depend-
ency and indemnity compensation ben-
efit from the VA.
Unfortunately, these two programs
are offset dollar for dollar for our mili-
tary families. This makes no sense.
The retirees are paying for this extra
insurance with their own money.
The NDAA will finally remedy this
inequity, this burdensome unfairness,
and it will permit as many as 67,000
surviving spouses, including more than
260 in Maine, to begin collecting the
full survivor benefits they are entitled
to once it is fully phased in.
The average offset to the SBP
amounts to more than $11,000 per year.
That is a significant amount of money
that a widow or widower needs to help
support their families and themselves.
I would like to again recommend and
thank Senator JONES for his strong ad-
vocacy and unceasing leadership, as

well as the countless military spouses
and veteran advocates, the veteran
service organizations that helped push
this effort over the finish line this
year.
This year, these dedicated advocates
helped Senator JONES and I secure a
record number of cosponsors to our bill
to repeal the widow’s tax—78 Senators
and 383 House Members.
As Senator JONES was mentioning,
that is phenomenal and shows the
strong bipartisan support to correct
this unfairness.
Often I am reminded by military
commanders of the saying that you re-
cruit the soldier, but you retain the
family. We have an obligation to make
sure we are taking care of our military
families who have sacrificed so much.
I urge all of our colleagues to support
final passage of the NDAA and to fi-
nally put an end to the military wid-
ow’s tax.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the vote
we are talking about is to waive the
budget point of order that was raised
by Senator ENZI. If the budget point of
order is not waived, the NDAA—which
I believe is the most significant vote
we pass every year; it has passed for 58
consecutive years—will be referred
back to committee. So that is really
what is at stake here.
The budget point of order on the
NDAA is primarily caused by three
provisions: first, repealing the widow’s
tax phased in over 3 years. We have
been talking about that. That is part of
this point of order; secondly, giving
visas to Afghans who work closely with
the U.S. military during the war; and,
third, allowing military servicemem-
bers to file claims for medical mal-
practice.
Now, all three provisions have sig-
nificant bipartisan support. The wid-
ow’s tax, as was just stated, has 76 co-
sponsors in the Senate, 383 in the
House.
A vote in this Chamber in late Sep-
tember to instruct conference on the
widow’s tax passed 94 to 0. You might
keep that in mind. Anyone who talks
now about opposing it actually voted
for it back in September.
Now, as I mentioned in my remarks
last night, I started working to repeal
the widow’s tax after being inspired by
one of my personal heroes, a young
lady named Jane Horton.
I can remember back in September of
2011, I was in a little town north of
Tulsa, OK—Collinsville, OK—and I was
up there talking to people, the normal
type of thing we do, going around
speaking with our constituents, and I
recall that is when I first met Jane
Horton. She lived in Collinsville.
After I had visited for a while with
the group, I commented that I am the
chairman of the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee, and I am going to be
going to Afghanistan in this next week.
She said that her husband, Chris Hor-
ton, was also right at that moment in
Afghanistan. I made the statement:
Well, let’s find out where he is, and I
did. I checked into it and arranged to
go by to see him as I left for Afghani-
stan, but I didn’t see him because on
September 9, 2011, Chris Horton was
killed in action.
Now, after all of Jane’s sacrifices in
losing her husband in the line of duty,
it seemed unimaginable to me that she
should have to deal with the further
pain of a dollar-for-dollar offset in her
benefits as a Gold Star spouse. So we
have worked with Jane and the other
Gold Star spouses for a long time to
figure out how we can do this in a re-
sponsible way. That hasn’t been talked
about so far, but we did it. So it has
happened over a period of time.
Similarly, supporting the Afghan
partners who sacrificed so much to
help us help their country has long
been a bipartisan priority. Everyone
involved in this conference, including
the Department of Defense, recognized
the importance of fixing the medical
malpractice issues in a commonsense
fashion.
I understand my colleagues’ con-
cerns. We have worked hard to make
each of these provisions fiscally re-
sponsible, and we will continue to do
that.
There is a document, which nobody
reads anymore, called the Constitu-
tion. The Constitution says that our
top priorities here should be defending
America. That is what we are supposed
to be doing. Each of these provisions
enables us to better defend America
and allows us to take up this bill and
actually pass it for the President to
sign.
So I urge you to vote to allow this
bill to move to final passage so that we
can send this legislation to the Presi-
dent’s desk, where he said he would
sign it immediately, and he will. By
doing so, it will send a clear message to
our troops and adversaries that this
body is serious about America’s na-
tional security.
VOTE ON MOTION TO WAIVE
Mr. President, pursuant to section
904 of the Congressional Budget Act of
1974 and the waiver provisions of appli-
cable budget resolutions, I move to

and applicable budget resolutions for

NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as I have
reminded you all many times, this is
the 59th straight year we will be pass-
ing the NDAA, the National Defense
Authorization Bill. It has passed for all
these years in a row because we all
know just how important it is. It is the
most important thing we do around
here. We are building on nearly six dec-
ades of bipartisan support for our
troops and national security.
This year, I am glad to say, it is no
different. We all came together to
produce a conference report that is
good for all of America. The House
passed it overwhelmingly; the Senate
passed it overwhelmingly. We voted for
it overwhelmingly yesterday. And the
President says he will sign it imme-
diately. I am grateful to the President
for understanding the importance of
this bill.
This bill means everything for our
national security. Every American ben-
efits from a strong national defense.
Their lives, their livelihoods, their
freedoms are all because we fight to
protect them.
When I go around my State of Okla-
homa, people think we have the best of
everything militarily. We have the best
people. We have the best soldiers, sail-
ors, marines, and airmen. There is no
doubt about it. But we can do better
when it comes to giving them the best
equipment and the best training. That
is what this bill does. It does that. The
backbone of a strong national defense
is the force—the men and women who
lay their lives on the line each and
every day.
When I travel around, I like to take
some time to meet with the enlisted
guys in the mess halls. You can learn
more from them than you can learn
from some of the brass. They are the
ones who really know what it is that
we can do to effectively build a strong
national defense. We get to hear what
they are worried about. We get to hear
how we can support them.
They need the training and equip-
ment that makes them the most fear-
some fighting force in the world. This
bill does that. They need a safe roof
over their heads and over the heads of
their families, and this bill does that.
They need to know that they have the
full support of the U.S. Government
throughout their service. This bill does
that. At the end of the day, we have
the best military in the world because
of our people. We take care of them,
and that is what this bill is all about.
We are here today because of the
brave men and women who wear and
have worn the uniform. We are safe and
prosperous and free because of them.
That is what this bill is all about.
The Senate just passed the Defense
authorization bill for the 59th year in a
row. There isn’t much left around here
that has that kind of longevity. It is a
testament to the importance of the
bill.
It is also a testament to the hard
work of the staff. They worked tire-
lessly to bring this conference report
to the floor. I want to take just a mo-
ment to recognize and thank everyone
who made this bill possible, starting
with the Armed Services Committee
staff, especially the staff directors,
John Bonsell for the majority and Liz
King for the minority. They are the
ones who provided the leadership be-
hind the scenes. They did most of the
work.
Then there is my partner, Senator
JACK REED. We are a real team. We
know how to do things and have
learned over the years how to do things
right. I couldn’t praise him more. In
fact, we had a lot of obstacles this year
that we didn’t have before. If it hadn’t
been for Senator REED and the staff
working on it, we wouldn’t have pulled
this thing off.
A few minutes ago, Senator REED
read the names of all of the members of
the Armed Services Committee. I want
to go ahead and get those in my state-
ment here also.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the names of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee staff that were listed
by Senator REED be placed in the
RECORD in my statement.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
My staff from the Senate Armed Services
Committee:
John Wason, Tom Goffus, Stephanie Barna,
Greg Lilly, Rick Berger, Marta Hernandez,
Jennie Wright, Adam Barker, Augusta
Binns-Berkey, Al Edwards, Jackie Kerber.
Sean O’Keefe, Tony Pankuch, Brad Patout,

Jonathan Epstein, Jorie Feldman, Creighton
Greene, Ozge Guzelsu, Gary Leeling, Kirk
McConnell, Maggie McNamara, Bill

Seraphin, Fiona Tomlin.
Mr. INHOFE. Again, I want to thank
my personal staff, office staff, and floor
staff.
We need to pivot to our next task at
hand: funding the Department of De-
fense. This puts financial resources be-
hind all of the policies we just ap-
proved today.
Our military leaders have told the
Armed Services Committee over and
over again—and I have repeated this
several times—that stable, predictable,
on-time funding is the most important
way Congress can support our national
defense. It is now 21⁄2 months into the
new year, and we got it done.
To all of my fellow Members here, I
thank you again for your support of
the national defense authorization bill.
Merry Christmas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7071
December 17, 2019
diligent worker for the people of North
Dakota. He has served our State in
many different capacities. He served as
tourism director and did a tremendous
job promoting our State, promoting
tourism, and, really, promoting the
beauty and the history of our State in
a way that brought a lot of national at-
tention and really made a difference in
terms of tourism for our State.
He also served our State as economic
development director, something that
is certainly near and dear to my heart.
I have always believed that job cre-
ation is job one, and so, to me, that is
the engine that drives the car. KEVIN
served as the economic development di-
rector under Governor Schafer, my
predecessor, and, again, did a fantastic
job. He knows the importance of sup-
porting our farmers and our small busi-
nesses, the energy industry, and all the
things that really make our State go,
and he has been a huge part of helping
to create an environment in our State
that, from a tax and a regulatory envi-
ronment, has been very supportive of
the growth and development of our
economy and all aspects of our econ-
omy—as I say, from ag to energy, to
technology, to manufacturing and
throughout the small business world—
and, like me, he is a true champion for
small business. We are big believers
that small business is what makes this
economy go. Whether it is North Da-
kota or the United States of America,
it is small business that makes our
economy go.
As Governor, I had the opportunity
to appoint KEVIN to our State’s public
service commission in 2003, and he fol-
lowed that and ran and was elected to
the PSC by the people of North Dakota
and served as the public service com-
missioner for the State until 2012. Cer-
tainly, in that role he was a big part of
the growth and development of our
State.
Back in 2000, when I started as Gov-
ernor, we produced less than 100,000
barrels of oil a day. Today, we now
produce more than 1.5 million barrels
of oil a day. The only State that pro-
duces more oil than North Dakota is
Texas, and KEVIN was a big part of
building that climate where the indus-
try just developed amazing tech-
nologies and this whole shale play
came to be. Of course, now the United
States is the largest producer of oil and
gas in the world.
So he truly understands that you
have to help to promote that kind of
economic development, but, at the
same time, there is a reasonable role
for regulation and things have to be
done right and well and with good envi-
ronmental stewardship.
Prior to joining me in the Senate,
KEVIN served for three terms in the
House of Representatives, where we
worked together on many of our
State’s priorities. We share the same
beliefs in not only our great State but
in this great country, and we certainly
had a tremendous working relationship
in the House and now, of course, I am
pleased to have him as a colleague in
the Senate.
We both served as members of the
farm bill conference committee a year
ago and were able to put in place a
strong farm bill for our farmers and
ranchers.
We both work to rein in regulation,
as I said, to grow our economy, and to
support our military. He is a member
of the Armed Services Committee and
also the Veterans’ Affairs Committee
and has already passed a resolution
supporting our veterans with his Battle
of the Bulge resolution, which has been
passed by this body.
These are just a few of the things
that he has already done as a Member
of the U.S. Senate.
He has been a dedicated public serv-
ant for the people of North Dakota. He
is also a very devoted family man. He
and his wife Kris have three sons—
Isaac, Ian, and Abel—and two daugh-
ters—Rachel and Annie. They are the
proud grandparents of five. Now, I have
him by one. I have six, but this is a
competition. So we will see where it
ends up.
He has a great family and has been a
great partner in the Senate, and, of
course, I look forward to continuing to
work with him.
Again, I am very pleased today to in-
troduce Senator KEVIN CRAMER for this
speech.
I yield the floor.

ator from North Dakota.

MAIDEN SPEECH
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, a
very special thanks to my senior Sen-
ator, my great friend, and our former
Governor, Senator JOHN HOEVEN.
In fact, as he went through much of
my speech for me, I thought to myself:
Why, this is kind of like when I played
high school basketball in Kindred, and
we would be ahead by 20 points and the
coach would get me off the bench and
say: Go in and try not to screw this
thing up. That is a little bit how I feel
right now, but I thank him for the very
kind introduction. Most of it was true.
The idea of a maiden speech a year
into your first term may seem a little
odd, but I actually kind of like the
idea. It gives me a year’s worth of op-
portunity to reflect, which creates
greater clarity about the future and vi-
sion.
The first thing I want to say to all of
my colleagues here is thank you for
being so welcoming—and I mean all of
them. What they say about the Senate
and the collegiality of it is very true.
It is not just true. It is really impor-
tant, and it is something worth pre-
serving.
I can honestly say that out of the 99
that I have met, I love every one, indi-
vidually and collectively, and appre-
ciate all they have meant to me.
Kris and I have been married for 33
years. We have five children together,
and I am going to talk about one in
particular in a little bit.
Our children range in ages from 12 to
38, and that is too long of a story to ex-
plain, but we love and are proud of all
of them.
Our five grandchildren are a little
closer in range. They range from 1 to 7,
and we love every single one of them—
Lyla, Beau, Nico, Chet, and Willa—
with all the love any grandparent could
come with and with all the love that
God has for us.
I think it is important for people to
know I am a child of God and a fol-
lower of Jesus, and it informs every-
thing that I do, both at home and here
and throughout life.
I think it is important to know a lit-
tle bit about where you come from. I
was raised by loving parents. My dad
was a rural electric lineman who never
once complained about going out in a
storm to get the lights back on for the
farmers of our area. My mother was an
elder care giver when she wasn’t pump-
ing gas at the local Farmers Union sta-
tion. They did whatever they needed to
do to help us kids and to provide for
our family. We never felt like we need-
ed anything because we didn’t. We were
loved, and we were well cared for and
had great examples of culture and work
ethic and values that are North Dako-
tan.
I think it is important to understand
where a person comes from, but I want
to fast forward a little bit to this last
year. I said I was going to talk a little
bit about one of our sons. It was a
tough campaign. A lot of people think
that North Dakota is this bright red
State and that everyone who runs
there who is Republican wins. While
that certainly has been the trend, I
think it is sort of important for people
to know that I am the first Republican
in my lifetime to hold the seat that I
hold right now for the people of North
Dakota. In fact, the names of the pre-
vious Senators in this lineage are in
this desk that I stand at.
So it was a tough campaign. I got
into the race late. I really didn’t aspire
to be a Senator. I liked the House of
Representatives and still do, but the
call came and I answered it.
But what made the year so tough—
and, fortunately, it was shorter than
most campaign years in the U.S. Sen-
ate—is that I got in late. So it was a
short year, but in the middle of the
campaign, in the early part of the cam-
paign, our 35-year-old son Isaac became
very ill. He suffered from alcohol-in-
duced liver disease, and we spent a
good month and a half in the middle of
an already short campaign at his bed-
side in intensive care both in Bismarck
and in Rochester at the Mayo Clinic. I
say that because it was perhaps one of
the hardest 6 or 7 weeks of my life, the
deepest valley of my life, but it was
also one of the most instructive and in-
forming. It was as informing as all
those years in North Dakota in the
State office helping Senator HOEVEN—
then-Governor HOEVEN—build this dy-
namic economy.
Those several weeks with my son
probably prepared me as well for this

job as any. I got to see our healthcare
industry up close. I got to know more
about addiction and mental illness and
how tragic it is and how devastating it
can be and how consequential not deal-
ing with it actually is. It robs people of
life. It is not just an inconvenience. So
it was instructive in those senses, but
more than that, I got to learn about
our community.
I heard from thousands of Americans
who watched this very public tragedy
play out in the public arena because of
the very public job I was seeking, and
my faith in mankind was enhanced. My
faith in God was strengthened—learn-
ing that the sufficiency of His grace is
more than adequate not just for salva-
tion but for life, and it makes every-
thing shall we say clearer for me
today.
Senator HOEVEN raised the subject of
some of my committee assignments,
and I wanted to speak to that for a
minute because he is a very important
part, as you can tell, of my public life
and career. While I stand on the shoul-
ders of former Governor and former Ag-
riculture Secretary Ed Schafer—JOHN
and I both served with him in economic
development when JOHN was president
of the bank in North Dakota—it was
JOHN HOEVEN who gave me my first en-
tree into elected office at the Public
Service Commission in North Dakota
and worked with me. Then, of course, I
had the opportunity to serve with him
as he sat on the farm bill conference
committee when I served in the House
of Representatives.
When I had that very first important
meeting with Leader MCCONNELL to
talk about what committees I wanted
to be on in the Senate, realizing that I
was coming from the House, where I
only served on only one—I served on
the Energy and Commerce Committee.
It is an important committee, a big
committee, but it was only one com-
mittee. Here, I would serve on three or
four or, as it turns out, five. The first
thing I did was look at Senator
HOEVEN’s committee assignments, and
I wanted to assess how I could com-
plement where he serves. He served on
the Agriculture Committee and the En-
ergy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee. It made sense to me, with my
environmental and regulatory back-
ground, to serve on the Environment
and Public Works Committee, where
both agriculture and energy develop-
ment are greatly impacted. Whether it
is environmental policy or land policy,
regulations that I think serve as a bit
of a taking of farmers’ land are every
bit as important as the revenue they
receive through safety net programs.
So I sought and received that.
With respect to the Banking Com-
mittee, JOHN talked a little bit about
that and my role as an economic direc-
tor in the State of North Dakota. I
have always liked macroeconomics,
and it has intrigued me how financial
and economic policy go together. But
as interesting as the Federal Reserve is
to me, and it is, and as important as
the Export-Import Bank is to me, and
it is, it is really the community bank—
like the bank Senator HOEVEN comes
from and whose family started and was
building in North Dakota, the local
credit unions, the farm lenders—that is
what drives me more than anything in
the Banking Committee.
The Veterans’ Affairs Committee is a
great committee, and it is something
that I could never have imagined aspir-
ing to or being involved with. But I do
know that JOHN and I love veterans.
North Dakota is home to only 750,000
people, but 52,000 of them are veterans.
In North Dakota, patriots sign up at a
rate four times the national average.
So public service in the form of wear-
ing the military uniform is really big
and really important in our part of the
country.
I had an opportunity for a number of
years to chair the Rough Riders Honor
Flight in North Dakota, where we
raised the money and organized the
trips for about 500 World War II vet-
erans to come see the memorial built
in their honor. What a moving experi-
ence that was.
Before servicemembers return from
duty, of course, they serve, and that is
why we should be working to give them
the best resources we can, which is why
today is an appropriate day for this
maiden speech, because it is also a day
we passed a very important National
Defense Authorization Act to provide
the tools and the things our military
men and women need to be the domi-
nating force for good in the world. It is
an honor to serve them.
I am the very first member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee
from North Dakota. I didn’t know that
when I sought that committee assign-
ment to complement my Veterans’ Af-
fairs assignment, but I am honored to
do it. The reason I sought that one is
because again, going back, Senator
HOEVEN is a defense appropriator. I
thought, how can I best look out for
North Dakota’s assets? And the Armed
Services Committee seemed like the
right place to be.
I also believe that North Dakota’s as-
sets are perfectly positioned for the fu-
ture of warfighting. So I am very
grateful today for the passage of the
National Defense Authorization Act
and for the opportunity to serve on the
Armed Services Committee.
We have Air Force bases in both
Minot and Grand Forks. Their histories
are similar, but their new missions are
very different. In Minot, we have two-
thirds of the nuclear triad and the B–52
bombers that carry those impressive
bombs and, of course, the interconti-
nental ballistic missiles, which are
being replaced now by the ground-
based strategic deterrent. The mod-
ernization of our nuclear triad in this
NDAA is very important to our State,
and I am honored to have been a part
of seeing it through to completion.
We also have a very important space
radar station in Cavalier—something
very few people know about. Very few
people in North Dakota are aware of
that space station in Cavalier. Yet it is
a very important asset. Now, as we
launch this sixth service, the Space
Force, again, we will see very impor-
tant opportunities for North Dakota.
We also have an excellent National
Guard—both Army and Air Force Na-
tional Guard—that does important
work not just locally—and they do
great work locally—but around the
globe. Every Member here can attest to
the power of their National Guard. Our
ISR systems over in Fargo, flying the
UABs—it is just remarkable, what they
do and what they contribute to the na-
tional defense, our Air National Guard
in Fargo, the 119th Wing, the Happy
Hooligans.
The Grand Forks Air Force Base—as
I said, a base that was similar in its
founding to Minot—is now a UAB base,
a global hot base where they do impor-
tant ISR work. Again, in the future of
warfighting, the importance of good in-
telligence is so critical, and the airmen
in Grand Forks are second to none in
carrying out that mission.
Again, the strategic pick of my as-
signments was designed to complement
Senator HOEVEN’s and serve the good
people of North Dakota.
I will spend a little bit of time talk-
ing about my service in the House of
Representatives because it is the Peo-
ple’s House. I love the People’s House.
Senator THUNE from South Dakota
served in the House of Representatives,
and he knows what it is like to be the
only Member from an entire State. It
has its opportunities and its chal-
lenges.
I used to say to students who came to
visit: If you want to know what Amer-
ica looks like, go to the House of Rep-
resentatives, sit upstairs, look down,
and you will see 435 people who are just
like 700,000 others—just like each one
of them.
The diversity of our country is per-
fectly demonstrated in the House. I ab-
solutely loved that, but I also knew
how hard it was, because if I could get
my colleagues from South Dakota, Wy-
oming, Montana, and Alaska to go
along with me, I would have five votes.
That is almost 10 percent of California.
That is a lot of relationship building to
get things done. Yet I love it. There are
still things about the House that I
watch and love. There are things lately
I watch and I wonder, but there are a
lot of things I love about the House.
The Founders knew exactly what they
were doing when they created it.
To come here and be one of two, to be
a Member of the U.S. Senate, which is
the equalizer for our legislative Cham-
bers—our Founders really knew what
they were doing. To have an oppor-
tunity to work with you all to provide
a level playing field for the people of a
smaller State has been truly, truly
marvelous.
I will not elaborate on my years as
tourism director and economic devel-
opment director or even on the Public
Service Commission because Senator

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7073
December 17, 2019
HOEVEN has done a good job on that. I
would just say this: The thing that I
learned more than anything on the
Public Service Commission, even
though—I carried the pipeline port-
folio; sited the original Keystone Pipe-
line; sited thousands of miles of trans-
mission lines, electric, gas, oil; carried
the coal portfolio in reclamation; and
worked with the Department of the In-
terior on those issues that are very im-
portant to our State. What I learned
more from all of that than even big-
time economics or engineering or en-
ergy security—as important as those
lessons were over the 10 years I served,
the thing I learned the most was how
important the people are. In the wis-
dom of the Midwest, the laws required
that whether you were raising some-
body’s utility rates, siting a pipeline or
transmission lines, siting a refinery or
a coal-fired powerplant or a wind farm,
you had to hold a hearing in the com-
munity where the investment was tak-
ing place. In other words, you couldn’t
hide behind the pillars of the State
capitol; you had to go to them and
make it easy for them to come to you.
I learned from the people of the prai-
ries of North Dakota about not just life
in general but how to site a pipeline. It
was a farmer in Walsh County who said
about the Keystone Pipeline at an open
meeting: I don’t know much about lay-
ing pipelines, but personally, I would
try to avoid that quarry you are going
through.
So some very high-paid engineers
moved the pipeline away from the
rocks and into better soil.
It was the mayor of Park River who
came to a committee meeting and said
to me: I don’t know much about pipe-
lines, but you are going right through
the aquifer that serves the municipal
water supply of my community. I think
it would be better to move it.
So I paid engineers to move it away
from the aquifer.
Through the collective wisdom of the
people of North Dakota and the indi-
vidual wisdom of many of the individ-
uals of North Dakota, I learned that
was something not to be taken for
granted or wasted, which is why, in my
service in the House and here in the
Senate, I spend so much time holding
townhalls of all types—so I wouldn’t
rob myself of the value and the benefit
of the collective wisdom of the people I
serve.
I am so grateful to Senator HOEVEN.
He is a skilled and accomplished lead-
er. He works tirelessly—you all know
that—on behalf of the people of North
Dakota. He is relentless in his pursuit
of things for North Dakota. He has
been a great friend and mentor. I am
thankful for his partnership and his
willingness to work with me in the fu-
ture, as he did when I was on the Pub-
lic Service Commission.
As we go forward, I do have a couple
of thoughts about some challenges. As
I talked about this accessibility issue,
this opportunity we have particularly
in small States to know the people we
work for really well and for them to
have the opportunity to know us really
well and to collect their wisdom, I fear
a little bit that the lessons learned
from being so close to the people are
lost in this town—not so much by
Members of Congress, but I am a fer-
vent advocate of the administration
and their officials getting out to our
small towns and into the towns of
North Dakota and other towns
throughout our country.
It is an area where I think the Trump
administration has excelled beyond
anybody. In fact, I believe this Presi-
dent to be the most accessible Presi-
dent probably since Abraham Lincoln,
who used to hold office hours right in
the White House, where people could
come in off the street and have an au-
dience with him. And I am not just
talking about rallies. I am talking
about a President who visits the State
to speak with leaders at roundtables
and a Vice President who comes to our
military installations to meet with the
airmen.
We have an Agriculture Secretary
who has been to North Dakota—what,
three or four times, JOHN?—not just to
talk to the very important leaders of
the Farm Bureau and the farmers
union and the commodity groups, but I
am talking about the farmers who get
their fingers dirty. We have a Com-
merce Secretary who, in the middle of
negotiating with China, came to North
Dakota to talk to those farmers about
the impact of tariffs on their markets;
a Veterans Affairs Secretary who stud-
ies the alternative treatments being
advanced and made available in Fargo;
an EPA Administrator who lets North
Dakotans continue to lead the way on
promoting good waters of the United
States policy; an Air Force Secretary
who understands air capabilities be-
cause she has seen them firsthand; an
Interior Secretary who came to listen
to the concerns of farmers and actually
changed the direction of certain regu-
lations as a result of farmers pointing
out how their personal property rights
were being stolen by the Federal Gov-
ernment; and a NASA Administrator
who observed the first ever university
space program at the University of
North Dakota.
The list goes on and on, and I will
spare you from it, but I think it is an
important lesson and testament to how
good this country can be and how much
better it can be if we listen to the peo-
ple in the heartland. All of this is why,
in addition to bringing people of influ-
ence to my State so hopefully they can
be influenced by it, I am concerned
about the sheer magnitude of our bu-
reaucracy.
This week, we are going to hopefully
pass a $1.5 trillion discretionary budget
or appropriations, but I worry about
the people who are going to manage
that $1.5 trillion being so out of touch
with real, everyday Americans.
You can call it whatever you want.
Some people call it the deep-state, out-
of-control bureaucracy, misguided but
well-intentioned public servants,
power-hungry civil employees, what-
ever you call it. I call it unelected bu-
reaucracy that has codified corruption
in many cases. They turned their own
interpretation of guidelines into infal-
lible laws, placing the creation and im-
plementation of their policies and
processes above the needs of the Amer-
ican people whom we serve and the
elected leaders that send them there.
I had experienced it many times in
the 6 years I had been in the House, but
I experienced it multiple more times in
the Senate. Whether this comes from a
place of self-preservation or self-impor-
tance, I believe it has to come to an
end.
A defining part of my tenure since
the day I arrived until the day I leave
will be to take on a bureaucracy that I
believe has run rampant. There are sev-
eral Cabinet officials and agencies that
can attest to that statement already.
I am not unreasonable about it, I
don’t think. I don’t intend to be, but,
Madam President, I am passionate
about it. As I have made clear, I do not
believe in the abolition of government.
But I do think government needs to be
more responsive to the people that pay
for it. We ought to be giving the people
a government that is worth their in-
vestment.
I aim as my highest goal at the high-
est level to return the focus of the Fed-
eral Government back to the people. I
have listened to so many well-inten-
tioned bureaucrats explain their proc-
ess, explain their system, explain their
traditions and rarely do they talk
about a human being on the other end
of all of that, so I am committed to
doing what is best for the people of this
country with a very keen focus on the
750,000 North Dakotans whom I com-
mitted my life to serving. Their indi-
vidual and collective wisdom, along
with their values, as old-fashioned as
they may seem to some, is our con-
tribution to a great nation. They would
want me to say to all of you, Merry
Christmas and Happy Holidays.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota.
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I
would just like to say how much I ap-
preciate Senator CRAMER, the working
relationship that we have, not just
here but a working relationship that
goes back many, many years. As you
can tell, he speaks very well, but what
comes through is not only his commit-
ment to his family and his faith, but
his commitment to the people of North
Dakota and his commitment to the
people of this country.
It doesn’t matter what issue he is
working on. He takes the time to listen
to everybody, and he is always willing
to explain where he is coming from and
why he comes to the conclusion he
does. But there is no question, he loves
his faith; he loves his family; he loves
his State; and he loves this country.
Thank you, Madam President.
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

f
REMEMBERING BRIGADIER GEN-
ERAL JAMES KEMP MCLAUGHLIN
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I
rise today to honor the legacy of a
member of our greatest generation, the
founder and first commander of the
West Virginia Air National Guard, a
World War II veteran, an American
hero, and a friend of both of ours, re-
tired Brig. Gen. James Kemp
McLaughlin.
He was born on December 7, 1918, in
Braxton County, to James and Almira
McLaughlin. Kemp was a staunch lead-
er with unparalleled patriotism, and
his devotion to God, State, and country
was unmatched. Gayle and I were hon-
ored to call him a friend, and I know I
join so many when I say that West Vir-
ginia has lost a shining star. He is
dearly missed.
Ever since the historic beginning of
our State, we have never failed to an-
swer our country’s call. No demand has
been too great, no danger too daunting,
and no trial too threatening. Kemp
took part in some of the most impor-
tant battles of World War II. Following
his education at West Virginia Univer-
sity, Kemp joined the U.S. Air Corps at
age 23, shortly before the attacks on
Pearl Harbor, the day of his birthday.
He flew nearly 40 B–17 Flying For-
tress bomber missions during the war,
including support for the troops on the
beaches of Normandy in 1944. In 1934,
Kemp led a 350-plane attack on a fac-
tory in Germany, a raid that became
known as Black Thursday. On too
many occasions, Kent’s planes would
be so damaged that it was a miracle he
made it back safe.
His actions were instrumental in not
only destroying Nazi efforts, but as one
of the ‘‘Mighty’’ 8th Air Force in Eu-
rope, he was also instrumental in de-
veloping what is known as air superi-
ority, a vital factor in deciding the
outcome of a modern conventional war.
He paved the way for all citizen airmen
who strive to follow in his footsteps.
Kemp completed 39 combat missions
during World War II and was awarded
the Distinguished Flying Cross four
times. His vast experience aided him
years later when he was asked to lead
the Air National Guard’s 167th Fighter
Squadron in Charleston, WV. When
that squadron moved to Martinsburg,
Charleston’s Guard unit became the
130th Airlift Wing.
Throughout the rest of his extraor-
dinary life, Kemp continued to pay
homage to his fallen comrades and
serve his community. He served as
Kanawha County commissioner and as
a member of the West Virginia House
of Delegates. He is a legend here in
West Virginia and was one of the most
selfless people that I have ever had the
pleasure of calling a dear friend.
As Governor, my most honored titled
was that of commander-in-chief of the
Guard. I have seen firsthand how the
Air National Guard protects the citi-
zens of West Virginia when we are in
our most desperate hour of need and
how they protect our country when
called upon to serve at the command of
the President of the United States. The
integrity of our Guard is due in large
part to Kemp’s legacy of excellence and
his commitment to seeing our Guard
and our home State flourish.
When visitors come to West Virginia,
I jump at the chance to tell them we
are home to the most hard-working
and patriotic people in the Nation. We
have fought in more wars, shed more
blood, and lost more lives for the cause
of freedom than most any other State.
We have always done the heavy lifting
and never complained.
We have mined the coal and forged
the steel that built the guns, ships, and
factories that have protected and con-
tinue to protect our country to this
day. I am so deeply proud of what West
Virginians like Kemp have accom-
plished and what they will continue to
accomplish to protect the freedoms we
hold dear. We have every reason to be
proud and to stand tall knowing that
West Virginia is the reason Americans
sleep peacefully at night.
Kemp is survived by his children,
Laura, Mary, and Kemp, Jr., and their
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
I know he and Constance, his lovely
wife of nearly 50 years, are looking
down on each of you and all of us with
a smile.
West Virginia is great because our
people are great—Mountaineers who
will always be free. We are tough, inde-
pendent, inventive, and honest, our
character shaped by the wilderness of
our State—its rushing streams, its
boundless blue skies, its divine forests,
and its majestic mountains. We are
West Virginians. Like the brave, loyal
patriots who made our State the 35th
star on Old Glory, our love of God and
country and family and State is
unshakeable.
I know that 20, 50, or another 156
years from now, that will always re-
main the same. That legacy laid the
groundwork for heroes like Kemp
McLaughlin, and now, he serves as an
inspiration to all who wish to follow in
his footsteps and live a life filled with
patriotism, service, faith, and family.
There are so few of our American he-
roes left from Kemp’s generation. It is
our responsibility and privilege to en-
sure that their service and sacrifice is
never forgotten. The sun will never set
on Kemp’s legacy of service, his gen-
erosity, his love for his family, and his
devotion to God, our home State, and
our beautiful country.
I know with the condolences of my-
self and you, Madam President, that we
will always remember and keep Kemp
in our prayers.
Thank you, and God bless.
I yield the floor.

HONORING MASTER TROOPER WIL-
LIAM MODEN, CORPORAL DANIEL
GROVES, SERGEANT JOSHUA
VOTH, KEN JONES, TRAVIS
DAVIS, AND TROY JACKSON
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I
rise to give thanks to the brave men
and women of law enforcement in Colo-
rado and across the country. Every hol-
iday season, I am reminded of the sac-
rifice that these brave officers make in
order to make sure that everybody’s
holiday season is enjoyed safely and
that every day is enjoyed safely and se-
curely.
Across the United States this year,
115 law enforcement officers have paid
the ultimate sacrifice in the line of
duty. In Colorado, we honor those who
lost their lives this year. Master
Trooper William Moden was killed ear-
lier this year when he was struck by a
vehicle as he was investigating a crash.
He served the Colorado State Patrol for
12 years. Corporal Daniel Groves was
also killed by a passing vehicle while
assisting another driver during the
blizzard last winter. Corporal Groves
also served the Colorado State Patrol
for 12 years.
Unfortunately, I also come to the
floor to honor three other brave men
and women—you can see them here—
who have given their lives just this
past month. Sergeant Joshua Voth
served the Colorado Department of
Corrections and was stationed at the
Canyon City Correction Facility. He
was killed this month when an issue
with the boiler caused an explosion.
Sergeant Voth was 28 years old and
leaves behind his wife and three chil-
dren. He served at the Canyon City fa-
cility for 3 years and helped teach in-
mates valuable skills to help smooth
the plan to rehabilitation.
We also lost other beloved members
of our first responder community. They
need to be remembered and honored as
well. Ken Jones, a member of the Sum-
mit Fire and EMS, was killed on De-
cember 7 while responding to a fire at
Copper Mountain. Ken served in that
department for 20 years and was known
by his colleagues as ‘‘a firefighter’s
firefighter.’’ Travis Davis, the deputy
chief of operations for Summit Fire
and EMS, remembers him as an ‘‘Oak’’
and said everyone in the organization
learned something in Ken’s steady and
calm demeanor. We thank Ken and his
family for two decades of service and
send our sincerest thoughts to all those
who knew him.
I also would like to recognize Troy
Jackson, a former assistant chief of op-
erations for the South Metro Fire Res-
cue, who passed away just yesterday
morning after a battle of what is be-
lieved to be job-related cancer. Chief
Jackson was first hired in 1990 and
served nearly three decades before
stepping away in 2016 due to his health.
He was open about his battle with can-
cer, in hopes that he could teach other
firefighters how to avoid these risks.
We thank Chief Jackson for his serv-
ice and send our thoughts and prayers

Each one of these officers and fire-
fighters we lost this year was a neigh-
bor or loved one, a member of the com-
munity, and an extraordinary Colo-
radan who gave their life to protect
their communities. While we remember
those whom we lost this year, we must

f
TRIBUTE TO OFFICER MICHAEL
LOHMAN
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, in
August, I was fortunate to award Offi-
cer Michael Lohman of the Greeley Po-
lice Department with the Congres-
sional Badge of Bravery for his heroic
actions apprehending the driver of a
stolen vehicle in 2017.
While at the driver-side window of
the vehicle, the driver pulled a gun on
Officer Lohman, who immediately en-
gaged with the driver to take the weap-
on. The driver pulled Officer Lohman
into the vehicle and began accel-
erating, dragging him along the street.
Officer Lohman kept his cool and was
able to pull the suspect from the vehi-
cle while it was still moving and appre-
hended him with the help of other offi-
cers.
These actions saved the lives of any-
one in the path of that vehicle, as well
as the life of his partner who was at
the passenger side of the vehicle when
the gun was pulled. These actions give
our communities peace of mind, know-
ing that heroes like Officer Lohman
continue to keep all of us safe. But we
know every brave action doesn’t get
the recognition that it deserves.
Every day, there are law enforcement
and first responders who act with com-
plete selflessness. They do this not to
seek recognition or praise, but simply
because it is what they were called to
do.
Jamie and I would like to send our
thanks to the families of our law en-
forcement and first responders. Every
day these men and women say goodbye
to their loved ones, unsure of what that
day will hold for them. I am sure these
goodbyes are much more difficult dur-
ing the holiday season, but without the
love and support of those at home, the
jobs of law enforcement and our first
responders would be that much more
difficult. We thank them for their con-
tinued sacrifice.
RECOGNIZING THE U.S. CAPITOL POLICE
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I
would also like to take a moment to
say thanks to the men and women of
the U.S. Capitol Police. They work
long hours to ensure that Members of
the staff and Members themselves are
able to carry out their duties safely.
On top of that important duty, they
also protect the public who comes to
visit to express their opinion, to ex-
press their right to assemble and free
speech in the Capitol and beyond, not
only to tour this beautiful Capitol
Building, but to make sure their
thoughts are heard on our Nation’s pol-
icy issues.
I know every one of my colleagues
will join us in expressing our gratitude
to law enforcement and first respond-
ers not only in Colorado, but across
this Nation this holiday season. They
will give up time with their own fami-
lies to make sure that others are safe.
To all those who defend that thin
blue line, thank you, and God bless.
You have my enduring support. May
you all have a happy and blessed holi-
day season.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi.
TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY ISAKSON
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, today I rise for the opportunity
to commend Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON
on his retirement from the U.S. Sen-
ate.
I am a relatively new Member to the
Senate, but I think we all remember
the first time we ever walked onto the
Senate floor. I know I certainly do be-
cause that is the day I met Senator
JOHNNY ISAKSON.
With both of us being from the
South, I knew we would probably have
a lot in common, a similar view on life,
and a heart for the South, but it didn’t
take me long to learn that JOHNNY has
a universal heart.
I am guilty of the expression, ‘‘Noth-
ing is special until you make it spe-
cial.’’ JOHNNY has such a generous gift
of making things special. He has the
gift of making everyone around him
feel special. His heart and his attitude
sees the best in people and yet goes fur-
ther to let them know how much they
mean to him.
He exemplifies being a leader, an
encourager, and an investor of people.
He is never too busy to ask how you
are doing or to ask about your family.
Common courtesy sometimes isn’t al-
ways that common anymore, but I as-
sure you it is with JOHNNY ISAKSON.
His brilliance is unquestionable. His
ability to articulate what is important
to him is just simply amazing. He can
deliver a message that not only ex-
presses his concern but also has an-
swers and solutions based on his expe-
rience and his tremendous wisdom.
He is the gentle calm in a tremen-
dous storm. He has the words of wis-
dom when so many are bewildered. He
is the guiding light in the darkest
times. He provides the needed laugh in
times of tension and the voice of rea-
son in times of uncertainty. His love is
deep, and his compassion is true.
He knows how to be a friend. He was
a born leader and has the ability to
capture opportunities and turn them
into successes. My world has been en-
hanced and enriched by this wonderful
and precious human being.
JOHNNY learned a long time ago that
the joy of living comes in giving. You
know when a person has in his heart
that joy, that wasn’t put there by the
world.
When I think about the true states-
men I have met in my brief time in the
Senate, I will certainly have ‘‘Georgia
on My Mind.’’
Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Florida.
VENEZUELA
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to speak again today about
the crisis in Venezuela—a defining
human rights issue of our time.
Nicolas Maduro is starving his own
people, and innocent children are
dying. It is a genocide right here in our
hemisphere. Every day that passes, the
situation in Venezuela grows more
dire.
The United States and all freedom-
loving countries around the world must
do more. As Governor, I strictly pro-
hibited the State of Florida, including
all State agencies, from investing in
any company that did business with
Maduro’s repressive regime.
I am grateful for the bipartisan sup-
port this bill has received, and I spe-
cifically thank Senator ROSEN for her
leadership and for joining me in this ef-
fort.
We must never give up on the fight
for freedom, and I look forward to all
of my colleagues joining me in support
of the people of Venezuela.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent to address the Senate in Span-
ish.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
(English translation of the statement
made in Spanish is as follows:)
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I stand with
the people of Venezuela and will always
fight for freedom and democracy in
Latin America.
I understand my colleague has an ob-
jection. I am disappointed, but I look
forward to working with him to ad-
dress his concerns.
Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.

APPROPRIATIONS
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I
rise to highlight several key parts of
the appropriations package the Senate
will be considering later on this week.
First, I want to point out some statis-
tics. Ninety-two thousand of our coal
miners are counting on us to protect
their pensions. Thirteen thousand coal
miners are counting on us to protect
their healthcare benefits. This week,
we will have a chance to do just that.
I am very proud to have worked with
our leader, Senator MCCONNELL, Sen-
ator MANCHIN, Senator PORTMAN, and
others to introduce and champion the
Bipartisan American Miners Act. I ap-
preciate that my counterpart on the
House side, Congressman DAVID MCKIN-
LEY, has worked consistently and tire-
lessly on this bill in the House, along
with our other Representatives from
West Virginia, ALEX MOONEY and
CAROL MILLER. Most of all, I appreciate
the West Virginian miners and their
families who have traveled to Wash-
ington to advocate for their promised
benefits and for their communities. I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7076 December 17, 2019
stood outside the Capitol with thou-
sands of coal miners and their families
several years ago in seriously suffo-
cating heat, as DC can heat up during
the summer, to rally in support of
those benefits. Miners have come to
Washington in the snow and in the
rain. Their camouflage shirts have
stood out around the Capitol as they
worked tirelessly to educate us about
the critical need for action. You have
probably seen them in the halls. No one
should be surprised by their dedication
and commitment because our West Vir-
ginian miners have answered the call
throughout their careers. Their hard
work provided the electricity and the
steel that has powered our American
economy.
The time has come to protect those
retirement benefits these miners have
earned. The Bipartisan American Min-
ers Act will secure both pension and
healthcare benefits for those hard-
working men and women.
I want to thank the United Mine
Workers of America and their presi-
dent, Cecil Roberts, for his work and
their work in advocating for our min-
ers. More than 25,000 miners from all of
West Virginia’s 55 counties will have
received payments from their pension
benefits last year.
More than 5,600 West Virginians min-
ers are at risk of losing their
healthcare benefits if we fail to act. Al-
most $200 million in pension benefits
were paid from this fund to West Vir-
ginians last year. The loss of those
funds would certainly have harmed the
retirees themselves, no doubt, but also
the local businesses they patronize
across the State and their commu-
nities.
As one West Virginian wrote to me
just last night, ‘‘My father is a retired
miner from Marion County who will be
turning 80 in January. This will give
him and my mother some long overdue
and well deserved peace of mind. They
have been worrying unduly throughout
the last several months.’’
Thousands of miners in West Virginia
and elsewhere in coal country will have
a merrier Christmas when this bill be-
comes law later this week. I ask my
colleagues to join me in supporting
this critical legislation.
There are a number of other reasons
to support the appropriations bills we
will be considering in the next several
days. I wanted to highlight one that
can have a significant impact on my
State of West Virginia.
I was proud to ensure that in the
transportation and infrastructure title
of the appropriations bill, we fund the
Appalachian Development Highway
System at $100 million. That will help
us as we work to continue the last re-
maining enormous project in our State,
Corridor H.
I have also advocated for action to
address our structurally deficient
bridges. In my State, we have a lot of
hills and a lot of valleys, and we have
a lot of bridges. Almost 20 percent of
our West Virginia bridges are classified
as structurally deficient. I think it is a
universal statistic in the country. This
bill takes the absolutely necessary step
to provide funding for over $1.15 billion
to fund highway bridge projects of
which West Virginia is eligible for $50
million.
Roads and bridges have a huge eco-
nomic impact on our communities and
our quality of life, everything we do
every day. I am proud we have included
these important investments.
As chairman of the Homeland Secu-
rity Appropriations Subcommittee, I
want to address items included in our
subcommittee’s funding bill as well. A
little over a year ago, I stood here to
talk about the increasing crisis at our
southern border. When I spoke to you
then, apprehensions at our southern
border were 30 percent higher than
they were the year before, and they
were much higher than they are today,
as I speak. The crisis was not limited
to the realm of illegal immigrants be-
cause fentanyl seizures were up 115 per-
cent, along with other illicit narcotics:
heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine,
marijuana. Thanks to the leadership of
the President and also this Congress
the situation has improved.
We should also recognize the im-
proved coordination with Mexico and
partnerships with other countries that
have helped curb the flow of those en-
tering our country illegally. Though
the situation has improved, it is far
from being solved. Frankly, we are one
ruling away from an activist judge who
could create the flows of those trending
upward again.
As such, I am proud to say that the
homeland security title in the package
we are considering this week provides
funds and resources to continue the
good work we have been pursuing to
stem the tide of illegal immigration.
Twice I have seen firsthand on the bor-
der—the southwest border—the chal-
lenges we face—and, yes, the progress
we have made.
This bill supports the work of the
men and women of the Department at
CBP, ICE, HSI, the Coast Guard, and
many others who are daily standing
watch on our borders, on our coasts,
and on our computer networks.
This bill invests in personnel, par-
ticularly by creating a new position:
Border Patrol processing coordinators.
This was a particular interest of mine
after talking to numerous people at the
Department and while visiting the bor-
der, describing the frustration they felt
as agents and officers. This funding
provided for these processing coordina-
tors will return 240 of our border agents
to the frontlines to enforce our immi-
gration laws, which is what they are
trained to do.
In regard to physical barriers, we
provide the enacted level of $1.37 bil-
lion. The only thing similar to last
year is the amount of money provided
because the flexibility we provide the
Department is a significant change and
a significant improvement.
The bipartisan fiscal year 2017 appro-
priations bill required our Customs and
Border Protection to provide us with a
comprehensive Border Security Im-
provement Plan. I was going to bring it
with me today, but, to be honest with
you, I left it in my office. The funds we
provide this week will enable the De-
partment to follow that plan.
While passage of our Senate bill
would have been ideal, a continuing
resolution would have had a dev-
astating effect on homeland security.
The bill we are going to pass will help
us take another step forward in secur-
ing our border.
I am so very proud of the men and
women who work at the Department of
Homeland Security, and I was able to
meet quite a few. The crisis they faced
when I spoke here last year was a real
one. Through their dedication and ef-
forts, so much progress has been made,
and I look forward to speaking to you
a year from now about what we have
been able to accomplish with the re-
sources and tools we can provide them
with this bill.
There are many other vital provi-
sions across our appropriations bill, in-
cluding a 3.1-percent pay increase for
our troops and significant increases in
funding for our veterans for the MIS-
SION Act, increasing funding for com-
bating the opioid epidemic, expanding
our rural broadband, and researching
cures for diseases.
One of those diseases hit many of us
and has hit me quite personally; that
is, Alzheimer’s. Research for Alz-
heimer’s is, I think, absolutely essen-
tial, and we are increasing that.
I commend all my colleagues who
worked to put together the bipartisan
appropriations bills. I congratulate
Senator SHELBY, in particular, and
Senator LEAHY for working together,
and I look forward to voting for these
bills later in the week.
With that, I yield back.

jority whip.
f
TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, De-
cember 22 will mark an anniversary,
the second anniversary of the signing
of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Tax re-
form was a big priority for Repub-
licans. We wanted to help American
families by reducing their tax burden
and spurring the kind of economic
growth that would result in better jobs
and better wages.
At the end of 2017, we passed the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act. We cut tax rates for
American families, doubled the child
tax credit, and nearly doubled the
standard deduction. We lowered tax
rates across the board for owners of
small and medium-sized businesses,
farms and ranches. We expanded busi-
ness owners’ ability to recover the cost
of investments made in their busi-
nesses, which frees up cash they can re-
invest into operations and their work-
ers, and we lowered our Nation’s mas-
sive corporate tax rate, which up until
January 1 of 2018 was the highest cor-
porate tax rate in the developed world,

and we brought the U.S. international
tax system into the 21st century so
American businesses are not operating
at a competitive disadvantage next to
their foreign counterparts.
Over the last 2 years, tax reform has
done exactly what we intended. It has
allowed American families to keep
more of their hard-earned money, and
it has helped spur wage growth and in-
crease the availability of good jobs for
American workers.
For 2018, the average family of four
with an income of $75,000 saw a tax cut
of more than $2,000. On top of that,
company after company responded to
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by issuing
bonuses, improving benefits, or in-
creasing wages. At least 100 utility
companies around the country an-
nounced plans to cut utility rates for
consumers.
Then, of course, there is the eco-
nomic growth that the law has spurred.
A whopping 266,000 jobs were created in
November, smashing expectations and
bringing the average monthly job cre-
ation for 2019 to a strong 180,000 jobs
per month. Job creation since Presi-
dent Trump was elected has exceeded
the Congressional Budget Office’s 2016
preelection prediction by more than 5
million jobs. The unemployment rate
is at a 50-year low and has been at or
below 4 percent for an incredible 21
straight months. The year 2019 has also
seen record-low unemployment rates
for African Americans, Asian Ameri-
cans, Hispanic Americans, Americans
with a disability, Americans without a
high school diploma, and veterans. For
20 straight months, there have been
more jobs available than Americans
looking for work.
Meanwhile, wages for American
workers are growing steadily. Wage
growth has been at or above 3 percent
for 16 straight months. Before the start
of this streak, the last time wage
growth had reached 3 percent was more
than a decade ago. Income inequality
has declined. The poverty rate has fall-
en to a 17-year low. The list goes on.
Those are a lot of numbers and per-
centages, but they all boil down to one
thing, and that is that American fami-
lies are doing better. Thanks to Repub-
lican economic policies, fewer Ameri-
cans are having to choose between a
car repair and a doctor’s bill. More
Americans are able to put away money
each month for their retirement or
their children’s education. There are
more good jobs available for Americans
looking for work.
Of course, there is still more work to
be done. Our farm economy, for exam-
ple, is not doing as well as the economy
as a whole. Passing policies that will
bring relief to our farmers and ranch-
ers and expand markets for their prod-
ucts is a priority of mine.
But 2 years on from the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, we can celebrate the fact
that millions of American families are
bringing home more money in their
paychecks and have access to better
jobs and better opportunities. Pre-
serving and building on those accom-
plishments is a Republican priority.
Unfortunately, our Democratic col-
leagues are more likely to suggest tax
hikes than preserving the tax cuts that
have brought so much economic
progress over the past couple of years.
Democrats opposed the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, despite the fact that many of
the ideas included were the product of
both Republican and Democratic pro-
posals. They objected to it, and they
fought it because they were determined
not to work with this President.
Two years on, Democrats would still
like to pretend the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act didn’t help American families, de-
spite the reams of statistics on the eco-
nomic progress we have made and the
fact that an estimated 90 percent of
middle-class families received a tax
cut. After all, if Democrats acknowl-
edged that tax cuts have made life bet-
ter for families, it would be even hard-
er for them to defend the massive mid-
dle-class hikes that would be needed to
fund their socialist proposals like
Medicare for All and the Green New
Deal. It is unfortunate the Democrats
are so opposed to policies that have
made life better for millions of Ameri-
cans.
I am proud of all we have achieved
for American families with the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act. I will continue to
work with my colleagues to keep our
economy growing and to expand oppor-
tunities for Americans even further.

f
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I am
glad to finally be here today, talking
about the final conclusions we have
reached on the appropriations bill gen-
erally but, specifically, the Labor and
Health and Human Services and Edu-
cation appropriations bill.
We are now a bipartisan Congress,
with Democrats in control on one side,
Republicans on another. On this side,
of course, we always have to have 60
people to go forward on these bills. We
generally have had to have a bill here
that would appeal to enough Demo-
crats or enough Republicans to make
this happen, but we have come to the
conclusion of what is normally the
hardest bill to negotiate. It is about 30
percent of all the spending after you
take defense off the table. Defense is
half of the discretionary spending; then
you have 11 other bills that have the
other half of that spending.
This bill has 30 percent of that half.
It has lots of things that you could
argue about and, frankly, lots of things
that you would just say ‘‘If we can’t all
be happy about this, we won’t move
forward,’’ which would mean you
wouldn’t move forward.
This is a bill where Senator MURRAY
and I and Congressman COLE and Chair-
man DELAURO on the other side had to
decide if we were going to have a bill or
not, and we decided we were going to
have a bill. We decided at the end of
the process, with some help from oth-
ers, that we wouldn’t have things in
the bill that hadn’t traditionally been
there.
This is the place where much of the
language that we debate in the appro-
priations bills occurs—what can hap-
pen and what can’t happen. Things like
the Hyde amendment have been in the
appropriations bill for a long time, and
it is in this one.
Other things that have not been
there in the past are not there, and
that was one of the things that allowed
us to move forward.
Again, we had one body controlled by
a different party, and we had to come
to a bipartisan consensus, and I think
we have.
There were lots and lots of competing
programs, some of which we are all for,
but maybe our priorities are different.
In fact, it could be that we just have
more priorities on one side than on the
other. But these programs range from
workforce training to early childhood
education to infectious disease control.
That is a pretty big span of things to
try to come to a conclusion on.
Then, from our colleagues, we had
7,800 different requests—not nec-
essarily requests that would be consid-
ered ‘‘I want you to spend this money
in my State’’ but 7,800 requests that
said ‘‘We think this program should be
increased’’ or ‘‘This program should be
decreased.’’
So with all of those requests and that
broad span, we came together with a
bill that I am going to vote for tomor-
row and look forward to voting for to-
morrow. It is not exactly the bill I
would have done if I had been doing it
by myself, but by the very definition of
both democracy and the Congress, you
don’t get to do these by yourself.
The bill, which will reflect the prior-
ities of both sides of the aisle and both

sides of the Capitol, invests in those
priorities. We expand medical re-
search—something that has been one of
the things at the top of my list as the
chairman of this committee. This is a
moment when medical research is so
critical, when we know so much more
than we did about the human genome,
so much more than we knew about
immunotherapy just 5 or 6 years ago.
This is a topic that wasn’t on the radar
screen of treatments. Now, for many
cancers, it is one of the first things you
think about: Does it work if we get this
person’s body focused in a way that it
fights back this cancer that is trying
to overcome it? Often, that produces a
great result now that wouldn’t have
been happening 5 or 6 years ago.
The opioid epidemic is one that we
deal with in this bill.
Investing in high-quality early child-
hood care and early childhood edu-
cation and education generally are in
this bill—trying to make college more
affordable with things like Pell grants
that not only work for people who
don’t have the income to do this with-
out some help, our government has de-
cided, but also now work year round
for about the third year, when, once
you get started, you can keep on going
if you have a pattern that is working.
We spent a lot of time in the last
year talking about what to do in this
growing economy, where more jobs are
available than people looking for work.
What do we do to better match the peo-
ple looking for work with the jobs
available? More importantly, how can
we anticipate that that will happen in
the future?
For the fifth straight year, after 12
years of no increase, the National In-
stitutes of Health in this bill will get a
significant increase, an additional $2.6
billion, which increases them in the
last 5 years over 40 percent—again, at a
time when this investment can mean
so much to so many people.
We specifically targeted the invest-
ment toward Alzheimer’s disease. Alz-
heimer’s and dementia are the things
that taxpayers pay the most on in
order to help, and taxpayers don’t pay
nearly all of the costs that families
have with Alzheimer’s and dementia.
The President’s Childhood Cancer
Data Initiative is here. Precision medi-
cine, combating foreign threats to re-
search, addressing the facilities back-
log on the campuses, all of those are
here.
Our investments in NIH are making a
difference for families and making a
difference, we hope, for the future.
That NIH-based research has helped
raise life expectancy. It has vastly im-
proved the quality of life for many
Americans. It has lowered healthcare
costs. It has very dramatically decided,
in some healthcare situations, either
how invasive you need to be or how
much pain has to be involved in getting
you headed in another direction but
also, by the way, on the opioid front,
understanding that the complete elimi-
nation of pain is not necessarily a good
thing unless you are sure you are going
to be able to deal with that pain medi-
cine and that moment later.
The bill fully funds the President’s
request to do everything we can in the
next 10 years to eliminate the HIV epi-
demic. It would have been hard to
imagine 5 years ago or 10 years ago
saying that we would be in sight of a
vaccine and eliminating HIV as an epi-
demic problem in our country.
We spend money on that, but we have
fully funded what the President and
others believe would be necessary to
achieve that goal. We spend $20 billion
a year right now on direct health ex-
penditures on HIV prevention and care.
Our goal in the next 10 years will be to
reduce the number of new infections of
HIV by at least 90 percent every year.
Third, this bill, the fiscal year 2020
bill, continues our commitment to the
opioid epidemic, providing money to do
that, providing money for prevention,
for education, for research, and for
treatment, as well as recovery pro-
grams.
In this bill we put new flexibility in
for the opioid epidemic to where those
things you may go to after you have
become addicted to opioids, like meth,
can also qualify for the kinds of help
that people need if they are trying to
escape their addiction to pain medica-
tions or other things that they have be-
come critically linked to.
This bill includes new and substan-
tially expanded investments in Head
Start, in high-quality early childhood
care; programs that provide more flexi-
bility to school districts to use the lim-
ited resources they have, whether that
is title I, if you are a school person and
know what that means, or title II, sup-
porting effective instruction State
grants; IDEA, the ability to help people
with disability education issues; Im-
pact Aid in communities that have sig-
nificant Federal investments in mili-
tary bases or a national forest or
things like that. These are all things
we deal with in this bill. We also target
STEM education, including the focus
on computer science.
We are also trying to bring focus for
young people to make them more
quickly understand what the options
are out there. Clearly, the college path
that has been so pervasive in the last
two decades isn’t the right path for ev-
erybody. And even if it is the right
path for everybody, if it doesn’t hurt to
go to college—I am the first person in
my family to graduate from college. If
it doesn’t hurt to go to college, it
might not necessarily get you a job un-
less you know what job it is you are
thinking about as you put your college
life together. Even that might not give
you the job that you really would like
to do. So part of what we are trying to
do here is to connect people earlier
with the opportunity to do that. If they
do go to college, we are increasing Pell
grants for the third year in a row by
about 2.5 percent. We are increasing
programs—the so-called TRIO Pro-
grams—for people who haven’t had
members of their family go to college
before, to help them get ready for col-
lege, get them thinking about what
they need to do to be the first person in
their family to go to college, to help
them figure out how to stay in college,
because nobody in their family can
give them the exact advice they might
need on how to stay in college, and how
they can get prepared to get a job out
of college and avoid the kinds of loans
they cannot afford to pay back.
There is something I call lost equity.
I have talked to so many people in the
last 2 years who are about 28 years old,
and over and over again, the story was
so similar. They went to college for a
year or a semester and then held a se-
ries of jobs that were not too hard to
get but didn’t lead anywhere. They
were landscapers or Uber drivers or
bartenders or whatever else, with no
sense that that was a career and not
the underpinnings they would like to
have. Then finally, in their
midtwenties, somebody tells them or
they figure out on your own that they
have to have something that can sup-
port them the way they would like to
be supported and help them with a fam-
ily, might have retirement and cer-
tainly has benefits. We are trying to do
what we can to be sure that focus
comes earlier as they begin to think
about what they like to do and what
they find fulfilling.
Let’s talk about the jobs that are out
there, whether it is STEM education or
health services. Let’s talk about the
difference between a nurse practitioner
and being a doctor. Let’s talk about
the difference between being a doctor
and a specialist. Let’s talk about where
the job opportunities are in physical
therapy, occupational therapy, or
health tech. All of those things are a
way to a great career if you know what
you are doing.
If you missed that launching point, if
you missed those 10 years, that lost
decade, it is pretty hard to ever catch
up to your schoolmates who under-
stood what they wanted to do and
maybe had no more resources or capac-
ity than you, but they had an extra 10
years on you in preparing for the ca-
reer they would like to have and the
work they would like to do and where
that might lead them.
The President really has been focus-
ing on apprenticeship programs. An ap-
prenticeship is a good way to learn
firsthand and see firsthand what you
want to do, whether it is an apprentice-
ship program or community college or
traditional college or skills you learn
in the military that you should be able
to immediately transfer into a private
sector, nonmilitary opportunity. We
need to spend some time and some
money on that, and this bill does.
The bill continues to try to do what
we can to be looking carefully at re-
ducing fraud, reducing waste, and see-
ing that tax dollars are being spent
properly, and a lot of them are spent
right here in this bill. We prioritize

programs that really will provide ben-
efit to, we hope, large groups in our
country.
The bill reflects compromises on
both sides. The people of this country
send 100 different people to the Senate
and 435 different people to the House to
vote and to make decisions that reach
conclusions. This bill does that. All 12
of these bills we will vote on sometime
in the next 3 days do that. They allow
us to defend the country and to meet
the obligations that people have asked
the government to look at for them
and hopefully do that in a way that

BATTLE OF THE BULGE
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
come to the floor today to mark the
75th anniversary of the epic Battle of
the Bulge. It was an incredible battle
in World War II. To quote British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill, this
was ‘‘the greatest American battle of
the war.’’
It was an incredible privilege to join
veterans this past weekend at the 75th
anniversary ceremonies in Luxembourg
and Belgium. Remember, it was 75
years ago. The youngest among these
veterans, if they went into the service
at the age of 18, would, as of today, be
93 years old.
The World War II Memorial in Wash-
ington pays special tribute to the 16
million Americans who served and es-
pecially to the 400,000 who gave their
lives for our freedom. There are two
flagpoles at that memorial, and at the
base of these flagpoles are the words
‘‘Americans came to liberate, not to
conquer, to restore freedom and to end
tyranny.’’ In winning World War II,
this generation gave their all to ensure
that we continue to live in freedom.
These heroes didn’t return home until
the war was over.
This weekend, we recognized a num-
ber of veterans who are still with us
who helped win the pivotal Battle of
the Bulge. For these soldiers, the bru-
tality of the battle came in the bitter
cold of winter. They battled the ele-
ments—wet snow, intense cold, and
freezing fog. Every one of them suf-
fered from hyperthermia, trench foot,
frostbite, and illness. They shivered in
their foxholes. They shivered from frig-
id conditions and maybe some from
fright. I speak with deep appreciation
and admiration and awe for their ef-
forts, their excellence, and their re-
markable endurance.
The battle began on December 16,
1944. That is when Germany launched a
surprise attack on the Allied forces in
Europe. The Allied troops were gen-
erally outnumbered by more than three
to one. In addition to the harsh weath-
er, they faced treacherous terrain.
Still, GEN Dwight David Eisenhower
spoke with confidence. He said:
‘‘United in this determination and with
unshakable faith in the cause for which
we fight, we will with God’s help go
forward to our greatest victory.’’ The
Germans sought to divide and destroy
the Allies, but it was the Allies who ul-
timately crushed the German Army.
The Bulge was one of the most pun-
ishing battles in the history of the U.S.
military. Most of the 650,000 Allied
troops were Americans. From Decem-
ber 16, 1944, to January 29, 1945, the
Americans suffered 75,482 casualties;
8,407 were killed. The brave soldiers
who fought in this brutal battle saved
the free world.
Every soldier was a hero, and every
soldier has a story to tell. My father,
CPL John Barrasso, was one of those
heroes. He reported to duty to the
Pennsylvania Army National Guard in
1941, 4 days after the Japanese at-
tacked Pearl Harbor. He didn’t return
home for 4 years.
He was a gun crewman in the 108th
Field Artillery Battalion of the 28th In-
fantry Division. He wore on his arm
the red keystone patch. The Germans
called the patch the Bloody Bucket, re-
ferring to the ferocity of its fighters.
He was one who landed at Omaha
Beach, but he was always clear to point
out that he wasn’t there on that very
first day. That is how humble these
men are. He landed in Normandy in
July of 1944. They beat back the Ger-
man Army through France and then
into the fiercest battle of them all. In
combat for nearly 200 days, they fought
against 45 of the 90 German Army divi-
sions. He was awarded five Bronze
Stars.
I have with me my dad’s dog tags
from World War II, along with his mili-
tary prayer book. On the front it says
‘‘My Military Missal.’’ On the back
cover is a rosary, and there is a cross,
as well as the beads, and you could
work your way through the beads in
your hand in your pocket in a foxhole,
praying the rosary, as many of them
did. I would point out that these beads
are very well worn. My father was a
man who always put his family, his
faith, and his country first.
On this, the 75th anniversary of the
Battle of the Bulge, we honor the he-
roic and selfless efforts of our Allied
forces. Their triumph over evil speaks
to the core strengths of courage, char-
acter, and commitment.
We will forever give thanks for all of
our World War II veterans and their
families. We will never forget those
who made the ultimate sacrifice. And
we will always remember the valiant
Allied forces who saved the free world.
In closing, I want to wish everyone—
especially our dedicated men and
women in uniform—a very Merry
Christmas, a Happy Holidays, and a
Happy New Year.
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO NEWELL HARWARD
Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I
rise today to honor the extraordinary
service of one of Utah’s most dedicated
county commissioners, Mr. Newell
Harward. He has served Wayne County
for the past 7 years, but he has taken
on responsibility well beyond that, ad-
vocating for rural Utah with honor and
distinction as chairman of the Six
County Association of Governments.
Newell has had an esteemed career and
life of service to family, country, and
God.
Growing up on the family farm in
Loa, UT, Newell gained an early appre-
ciation for the value of community,
family, and hard work. He also devel-
oped a spirit of adventure, later serving
a mission abroad in Scotland and join-
ing the Wayne County Flying Club.
As the founder of Harward and Rees
Construction, Newell is also an entre-
preneur whose craftsmanship is lit-
erally built into Utah’s infrastructure.
His company has undertaken every-
thing from city water projects, designs
at Lake Powell, to a new bridge over
Hell’s Backbone in Southern Utah.
Newell is perhaps most widely known
as a public servant who was elected to
serve as Wayne County commissioner.
After 4 years, Newell considered step-
ping down due to illness, but he was
undeterred. With a writing campaign,
Newell Harward was reelected in a
landslide. In October of this year, the
President welcomed Newell to the
White House to recognize him for his
lifelong advocacy on behalf of rural
Americans.
A true appreciation for Newell’s life
of service would be incomplete without
recognizing his unwavering faith and
service to the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. Newell has served in
three bishoprics, as bishop of a large
ward, and in the stake presidency. As a
loving father to Kelly, Lynette, Sarah,
Shonna, Carol, and Travis, a grand-
father to 18, and a great-grandfather to
3, Newell has left an indelible mark on
Wayne County, the great State of
Utah, and indeed our Nation.
All of us should strive to live our
lives as Newell does, with an over-
whelming love of family and commu-
nity, an enduring faith, and a bound-
less spirit of adventure.
Newell, Gloria, and their family con-
tinue to be in our prayers as they fight
health challenges with great courage.
May God bless the Harward family.

f
BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL
REFORM ACT
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to dis-
cuss the Bipartisan Congressional Re-
form Act I introduced with Senator
WHITEHOUSE and many of my col-
leagues.
Last month, the Senate Budget Com-
mittee approved our legislation—that
is the Senate Budget Committee—by a
vote of 15 to 6, marking the first major
legislation reported by the committee
on a bipartisan basis in nearly 30 years.
I am pleased that 21 Senators have now
joined Senator WHITEHOUSE and me as
cosponsors of this bill.
Since I became chairman of the
Budget Committee, we have had more
than a dozen hearings on budget proc-
ess reform. We have met with budg-
eting experts, including some out-
standing State officials, and we have
listened to insights and concerns
shared by colleagues on both sides of
the aisle. Along the way, we collected a
lot of good ideas that we tried to incor-
porate into our bill, and I thank all
those who contributed.
Now, this legislation will not solve
all of our fiscal challenges. It does,
however, represent a good-faith, bipar-
tisan effort to reform our budget proc-
ess in a way that encourages long-term
planning, realistic and responsible
budget assumptions, and the end to the
brinksmanship surrounding our Na-
tion’s statutory debt limit.
This bill will also make evident what
needs to be done next. I think we
struck a pretty good balance. The Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et says the bill ‘‘would improve trans-
parency and accountability in the
budget process’’ and would ‘‘make the
budget resolution into a more effective
governing tool.’’
According to the Concord Coalition,
which was founded by some Democrats,
‘‘This legislation would move the budg-
et process in a very positive direction.’’
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the letters from the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et and the Concord Coalition be printed
in the RECORD at the conclusion of my
remarks.
The reason I am giving the speech is
to clarify some misunderstandings of
other groups that were commenting on
most of the original version of the bill
before amendments from both parties
were adopted in committee.
I will not detail all the reforms in
this bill now, but I would like to high-
light a handful of key elements of the
bill and hopefully clear up some mis-
understanding about it.
First of all, our bill tries to ensure
that we have better information on
which to base budgets. Imagine this for
a moment. It would require better in-
formation on which to base budgets
and more active engagement from the
tax-writing and each of the spending
committees to ensure that every cor-
ner of the Federal budget is scrutinized
and that budgets are realistic.
It would also require the Congres-
sional Budget Office and the Govern-
ment Accountability Office conduct
portfolio reviews of Federal spending
and tax expenditures to improve the ef-
ficiency and effectiveness of Federal
programs.
Here is what that means: It means
grouping projects regardless of which
Cabinet Department has jurisdiction so
we can see all that we are doing.
Use housing, for instance. We have
160 programs under 20 agencies. I can
only see 5 reasons—not 160—and they
should all be under one jurisdiction,
not several Cabinet jurisdictions. So,
currently, nobody is in charge of set-
ting goals or seeing if they are effec-
tive. We are paying multiple adminis-
trators to argue over jurisdiction rath-
er than results—160 of them.
Secondly, our bill would reorient the
budget process from a yearly to a bian-
nual cycle. Right now, under the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974, Congress
is supposed to approve a budget resolu-
tion each year that sets discretionary
spending levels and provides fiscal pa-
rameters for a legislation brought to
the Senate floor.
The budget resolution can also pro-
vide special instructions through a
process called reconciliation. What
that means is that instructions are
given to authorizing and tax-writing
committees to develop legislation to
achieve hopeful and specific budgetary
targets. For a variety of reasons, this
process has not worked very well in re-
cent years. Instead, Congress resorts to
passing a series of 2-year deals that set
discretionary spending limits rather
than approving the budget.
I need to explain that word ‘‘discre-
tionary.’’ Out of all the Federal dollars
spent, Congress only votes on about 30
percent of the money spent each year.
Seventy percent of the spending is on
autopilot. That is mandated to be
spent. Discretionary spending is the
little amount that Congress actually
votes on.
Under our bill, Congress would ap-
prove a budget resolution in the first
year of a biennium that would, among
other things, provide appropriators 2
years of discretionary spending totals,
similar to a practice in recent years.
Leadership, not the Budget Committee,
has been negotiating these 2-year
spending deals.
Thirdly, the bill would make signifi-
cant reforms to the content of the
budget resolution. Discretionary spend-
ing totals would be included in the res-
olution text, where individual Members
could amend them. Mandatory spend-
ing totals would be broken up by budg-
et function so we could see trends in
portfolios of Federal spending.
Here is something really new. The
budget resolution would also be re-
quired to include a target ratio of debt-
to-gross domestic product, or GDP,
which is generally viewed as the best
measure of the country’s ability to
repay its debt. The hope is that by fo-
cusing on our debt-to-GDP target, we
could put our country on a glide slope
toward a more sustainable fiscal fu-
ture. Under the reform bill, that glide
slope can be cutting spending, raising
revenue, or both.
Fourth, the bill would provide a
mechanism to conform our country’s
statutory debt limit to the levels in
the resolution. This will help incor-
porate the debt limit into our fiscal
planning and provide a powerful incen-
tive to ensure that the targets set in
the resolution are attainable.
Neither side relishes voting to in-
crease the debt limit, as it is easy fod-
der for political opponents. Yet there is
nearly universal agreement that de-
fault would be unacceptable. Our bill
tackles this issue in a way that it
maintains the debt limit as a tool to
ensure fiscal responsibility, while re-
moving the brinksmanship surrounding
the potential default.
Fifth, our bill would provide a means
to initiate reconciliation in the second
year of the biennium if Congress isn’t
living by its fiscal plan. There has been
a lot of confusion about this process, so
let me take a moment to explain it.
As I just mentioned, under our bill,
each budget resolution would include 2
years’ worth of discretionary spending
levels and a debt-to-GDP target for the
final year of the budget. That means
each new Congress would set its own
spending levels and debt targets in its
budget agreement, and it would not be
bound by the targets established by its
predecessors.
If, in the second year of the bien-
nium, the Congressional Budget Office
finds that Congress is not on track to
meet its debt-to-GDP target, then a
special reconciliation process is made
available. This is akin to what can al-
ready be done under current law if you
pass a budget resolution in the second
year of Congress, but because we are
giving appropriators 2 years of discre-
tionary spending levels upfront, we cre-
ated a new process in the second year if
Congress misses its fiscal goals. Con-
trary to a misconception that has been
circulated, however, there is nothing
automatic about this process.
Before reconciliation can proceed,
the Senate Budget Committee, which
will be renamed the Committee on Fis-
cal Control and the Budget, would need
to approve a resolution providing def-
icit-reducing reconciliation instruc-
tions to one or more committees.
That resolution, which would be
amendable, would then be considered
by the full Senate. We have added pro-
tections to ensure that Senators have
the ability to offer amendments and
have built in flexibility for unforeseen
realities, including economic down-
turns. We also applied the existing bur-
den rule to this process, which means
it cannot be used to make changes to
Social Security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7081
December 17, 2019
Senators could offer amendments to
reduce the amount of the deficit reduc-
tion called for or they can decide they
don’t want to proceed with this process
at all. If they do decide to move for-
ward with this special reconciliation,
each committee that received an in-
struction would then report legislation
within its jurisdiction to reduce the
deficit. The instructions themselves
could not dictate what particular pro-
grams are to be included in the rec-
onciliation legislation. That is left up
to the authorizing and the tax-writing
committees that have specific policy
expertise. One thing the instructions
could not do is increase the deficit.
After each committee approves its
instructions, all the recommendations
would then be sent to the Committee
on Fiscal Control and Budget, where,
again, they would need to be approved
and reported to the full Senate. After
that step, the legislation would come
to the floor, where it could be subject
to unlimited amendments, giving every
Senator another opportunity to sup-
port, amend, or oppose the legislation.
Each of these steps affords the Mem-
bers the opportunity to have their
ideas incorporated into the special rec-
onciliation or to try to stop it alto-
gether.
In addition, a similar process would
have to play out in the House of Rep-
resentatives, and the final bill would
have to be signed by the President be-
fore any policy changes could be en-
acted.
In general, our legislation does not
attempt to prescribe House procedures.
That is in deference to the House and
the constitutional prerogative of each
Chamber of Congress to develop its own
rules.
I have heard some concerns that this
sets up a one-sided bet that could dic-
tate spending cuts over revenue in-
creases because only the House of Rep-
resentatives can initiate revenue meas-
ures. That was never my intention, and
during the Budget Committee markup
to our legislation, a substitute amend-
ment that Senator WHITEHOUSE and I
drafted was adopted that would allow
the Senate to deem a revenue measure
approved by the House as a special rec-
onciliation vehicle. I look forward to
working with the House on addressing
the procedural issues.
The intent of our special reconcili-
ation process is to force a conversation
about our growing debt and deficits,
not to dictate what the outcome of
that conversation will be.
As the Committee for a Responsible
Federal Budget said, the criticisms
that this bill is somehow a threat to
low-income programs ‘‘is largely mis-
placed.’’ As the group said, ‘‘The tool
would not automate any changes to
spending or revenue, but would instead
establish a process to consider deficit
reduction measures. These measures
would have to pass the Senate and the
House and be signed by the President
(a veto override system is also pos-
sible). Unlike current reconciliation
rules, which have been used to pass def-
icit-finance tax cuts, this process is
limited to deficit reduction and could
help policymakers agree to new rev-
enue and to reforms to improve
healthcare programs. And long-term
deficit reduction can easily co-exist
with near-term measures to counter a
recession.’’
Finally, our bill would prioritize
budget transparency. It would give the
Senate new budget enforcement tools,
and it would remove one of the dis-
incentives to bringing the budget to
the floor by fixing the process known
as vote-arama.
In developing our legislation, I spe-
cifically set out to establish a process
that would allow us to be thoughtful
and deliberate in our fiscal decision
making, while avoiding the automatic
spending cuts over the last decade,
known as sequestration.
Under this bill, sequestration is gone.
Our bill would not tilt the scales to-
ward one party, ideology, or policy.
Rather, it aims to create a neutral
process to guide Congress in making
reasoned budget decisions. Each Con-
gress will decide what fiscal policy
changes may be necessary, whether
that means less spending, more rev-
enue, or a combination of the two.
We cannot be content to bury our
heads in the sand as our more than $23
trillion debt grows unchecked, swal-
lowing the opportunities of future gen-
erations. If you, like me, want to see
Congress get back to actual budgeting
and tackling the difficult fiscal issues
that we all need to be addressed, then,
please join me in supporting the bill. If
you have suggestions on how to make
it better, I want to hear them. We are
always open to new ideas, and I think
we have demonstrated it.
With that, I recognize my colleague,
who helped to work on this bill. In ad-
dition to working on this bill, he was
on the special committee for the Budg-
et. It was a joint effort between the
House and the Senate, and many of the
ideas he brought to this bill from that
committee.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
COMMITTEE FOR A RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL
BUDGET
ENZI-WHITEHOUSE BUDGET PROCESS BILL
INCLUDES IMPORTANT REFORMS
Nov. 21 2019—Budget Process
The Senate Budget Committee recently
marked up and reported bipartisan legisla-
tion to reform the budget process. The Bipar-
tisan Congressional Budget Reform Act, in-
troduced by Chairman Mike Enzi (R–WY) and
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D–RI), would
improve transparency and accountability in
the budget process. It would make the budg-
et resolution into a more effective governing
tool by making it easier for policymakers to
choose fiscal targets and stick with them.
That, we hope, would mean putting the debt
on a more sustainable path. The Senate
Budget Committee approved the legislation
by a vote of 15 to 6, and it currently has 19
bipartisan cosponsors in the Senate.
While there may be room to make im-
provements and adjustments to the bill and
some amendments were adopted in com-
mittee, the legislation is a thoughtful, real-
istic, and helpful approach to improve the
budget process on a bipartisan basis. Con-
gress should build on and enact some version
of this proposal.
What’s in the Bipartisan Congressional Budget
Reform Act?
The Bipartisan Congressional Budget Re-
form Act is the result of years of effort,
building on several past proposals including
those from Chairman Enzi, Senator White-
house, the recent Joint Select Committee on
Budget and Appropriations Process Reform
(JSC), and even our own Better Budget Proc-
ess Initiative recommendations.
The proposal would incorporate debt-to-
Gross-Domestic-Product (GDP) targets into
the budget resolution and the budget proc-
ess, adopt biennial budgeting while keeping
annual appropriations, link debt limit in-
creases and discretionary spending caps to
passage of a budget resolution, and add
transparency requirements such as including
interest costs in Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) scores.
A brief summary of the bill is available
from the Senate Budget Committee.
How Might the Fiscal Targets in the Bipar-
tisan Congressional Budget Reform Act Im-
prove Fiscal Outcomes?
A key aspect is expanding the fiscal goals
included in the budget process. Specifically,
budget resolutions would set targets for the
ratio of debt held by the public to Gross Do-
mestic Product (GDP). Congress would set
these targets in a joint budget resolution
every odd-numbered year, and the Congres-
sional Budget Office (CBO) would evaluate
adherence to the target in even-numbered
years. Adopting a budget resolution would
automatically spin off debt-limit-increase
legislation to be signed by the President as
well as a special reconciliation process in
some cases. Setting fiscal goals is an incred-
ibly important first step toward achieving
long-term sustainability, and integrating
them into the budget resolution could give
current members more ownership of those
objectives and hopefully strengthen their on-
going commitment to meeting fiscal targets.
The proposal goes further than simply set-
ting goals. It would establish a new, deficit-
reduction-only reconciliation process if
needed to achieve the debt-to-GDP levels
agreed to in the earlier budget resolution.
Under this process, the Senate Budget Com-
mittee, renamed the Committee on Fiscal
Control and the Budget, would report a sim-
ple resolution with reconciliation instruc-
tions to the full Senate, where it would be
open for amendments. If approved by the
Senate, it would instruct applicable commit-
tees to produce deficit-reducing legislation
to achieve compliance with debt targets.
Senate procedures for regular reconciliation
legislation would apply to the new reconcili-
ation process, including the Byrd Rule that,
among other provisions, prohibits changes to
Social Security. When marking up the legis-
lation, however, many members expressed a
desire to understand this process more com-
pletely before floor consideration.
While some have criticized this new tool as
a threat to low-income programs, we believe
this concern is largely misplaced. The tool
would not automate any changes to spending
or revenue, but would instead establish a
process to consider deficit reduction meas-
ures. These measures would have to pass the
Senate and the House and be signed by the
President (a veto override is also possible).
Unlike current reconciliation rules, which
have been used to pass deficit-financed tax
cuts, this process is limited to deficit reduc-
tion and could help policymakers agree to
new revenue and to reforms to improve

health care programs. And long-term deficit
reduction can easily co-exist with near-term
measures to counter a recession.
What other provisions might improve fiscal out-
comes?
In addition to improving outcomes through
this special reconciliation, the bill would es-
tablish a new pathway for a bipartisan budg-
et resolution, previously championed by Sen.
Whitehouse during the JSC last year and in-
troduced separately as S. 63, the Bipartisan
Budget and Appropriations Reform Act of
2019. A majority of both parties in the Sen-
ate Budget Committee and at least 15 mem-
bers of the minority party on the Senate
floor would be needed for a budget resolution
to qualify for this new pathway. Under it,
subsequent appropriations legislation would
be easier to consider on the Senate floor, and
the budget resolution would automatically
spin off legislation with enforceable caps on
discretionary spending in addition to in-
creasing the debt limit. This process could
help the parties to work together toward
reasonable deficit reduction measures. Fold-
ing the debt limit and spending caps into the
bipartisan pathway for the budget resolution
would also reduce opportunities for isolated
brinkmanship.
Other aspects of the bill—like asking CBO
to estimate interest costs associated with
legislation and restricting phony spending
cuts known as changes in mandatory spend-
ing programs (CHIMPs)—could also improve
budget outcomes. Adopting portfolio budg-
eting is another positive step, as it would
provide a more holistic review of major pro-
gram areas regardless of the committees of
jurisdiction and thus help lawmakers coordi-
nate related authorities.
To be sure, the Bipartisan Congressional
Budget Reform Act would not fix the debt di-
rectly, nor does it include actual deficit re-
duction. Through improvements in the over-
all budget process, it would give lawmakers
more opportunities to think seriously about
the consequences of high and rising debt as
well as more ability to budget comprehen-
sively and mindfully.
What amendments have been proposed?
The Bipartisan Congressional Budget Re-
form Act was introduced on Oct. 31 and was
ordered reported by the Senate Budget Com-
mittee on November 6. During the markup,
the committee made the following changes:
A manager’s amendment by Chairman Enzi
to enhance the consensus-oriented aspects
for special reconciliation.
An amendment by Senator Pat Toomey
(R–PA) to create a new point of order in-
tended to deter the use of the Crime Victims
Fund to increase unrelated spending through
CHIMPs.
An amendment by Senator Tim Kaine (D–
VA) to add tax expenditures to the scope of
portfolio budgeting.
An amendment by Senator Chris Van Hol-
len (D–MD) to restrict the ability of the
President to use rescission authority near
the end of fiscal years and to increase re-
lated reporting requirements.
In addition, the following amendments
were considered but not adopted:
An amendment by Senator David Perdue
(R–GA) to align the fiscal year with the cal-
endar year. An amendment by Senator Ron
Wyden (D-OR) to remove the new reconcili-
ation process to enforce debt-to-GDP tar-
gets.
An amendment by Senator Jeff Merkley
(D–OR) to require CBO to provide informa-
tion on the distributional impacts of legisla-
tion. Nonetheless, Chairman Enzi pledged to
work with Senator Merkley and other mem-
bers to obtain the information they seek.
Lawmakers must continue to improve the
budget process, which has contributed to
many years of inaction on a budget resolu-
tion and even more missed deadlines. Process
reforms alone cannot create the political
will to have a functioning budget, but they
may allow latent political will to accomplish
more. This bill offers thoughtful ideas to
make the process more effective and to im-
prove the framework for lawmakers to con-
sider budget matters more comprehensively.
[From the Concord Coalition, Nov. 6, 2019]
THE CONCORD COALITION PRAISES BIPARTISAN
SENATE BUDGET REFORM PLAN
WASHINGTON.—The Concord Coalition said
today that a new budget process reform bill
co-sponsored by Senate Budget Committee
Chair Mike Enzi (R–WY) and Budget Com-
mittee member Senator Sheldon Whitehouse
(D–RI) proposes reforms that would address
some of the most vexing problems plaguing
the current budget process.
The Bipartisan Congressional Budget Re-
form Act is also co-sponsored by Senators
Grassley (R–IA), Kaine (D–VA), Crapo (R–ID),
King (I–ME), Graham (R–SC), Coons (D–DE),
Barrasso (R–WY), Blunt (R–MO), Johnson (R–
WI), Perdue (R–GA), Kennedy (R–LA),
Cramer (R–ND), and Braun (R–IN).
‘‘This legislation comes at a time when the
budget process is clearly broken and partisan
tensions run high. Senators Enzi, White-
house and their fellow co-sponsors are buck-
ing both of these trends and demonstrating a
timely and exemplary standard of leader-
ship,’’ said Robert L. Bixby, executive direc-
tor of The Concord Coalition.
Among the proposed reforms are moving
the budget to a two-year cycle, setting debt-
to-GDP targets in the budget resolution and
establishing a special enforcement process
for these targets, creating a mechanism for
conforming the debt limit to the budget res-
olution levels, and enhancing reporting re-
quirements to promote transparency. It
would also establish a new procedural option
to encourage budget resolutions with sub-
stantial bipartisan support.
‘‘The co-sponsors understand that budget
process reform is not a panacea for the mon-
umental fiscal challenges we face as a na-
tion, nor is it a substitute for making real
choices on taxes and spending,’’ Bixby cau-
tioned. ‘‘But creating a process that mini-
mizes short-term brinkmanship and re-
focuses attention on long-term planning
would help facilitate a discussion about how
best to address these challenges. This legis-
lation would move the budget process in a
very positive direction.’’
Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
thank Chairman ENZI. I am delighted
to join Senator ENZI on the floor today
to talk about our bill. An enormous
amount of work has gone into pre-
paring for it, including, I want to say,
more than a dozen hearings that Chair-
man ENZI led in the Budget Committee
to build the factual predicate for the
work we were doing.
I will, as the Chairman has men-
tioned, also drop a word of appreciation
to Chairman WOMACK and Chairman
LOWEY, who ran the Select Committee
on Budget and Appropriations Process
Reform, which gave us a chance to
work through some more of these
issues.
The fundamental problem we are try-
ing to address is that, in the Senate, no
committee actually looks at the def-
icit, the debt, and the borrowing in any
kind of a comprehensive way. In the-
ory, the Budget Committee is supposed
to, but in practice, the Budget Com-
mittee has become two things: one, a
vehicle for the majority to drive a po-
litical budget limited to appropriated
spending through, with no bipartisan
compromise. We have seen over and
over how that has ended up. It has
never been of any use. Even if you get
it done, you break through the budget
by getting to 60 votes, and we do most
things around here by getting to 60
votes. It is a fence that is basically a
line painted on the ground. It is a fence
with no fence to it.
Moreover, we do reconciliation. That
is usually a way to bust around the
budget. Both parties have used it. The
Republicans have used it for the so-
called tax reform. We used it for one
segment of the Affordable Care Act.
That is what the Budget Committee is
boiled down to—a partisan proposal on
appropriations that means nothing and
a vehicle for getting around the 60-vote
filibuster on a regular basis through
reconciliation. That is it. There is no
serious look that is taken at the debt
or at the deficit.
What does this bill do? It does some
things for which there is very broad
agreement. First of all, it was pretty
much unanimous that the way you
look at debt is in terms of a debt-to-
GDP ratio, and this takes us down that
path. Second, you have to do the arith-
metic correct. You don’t get to a prop-
er debt-to-GDP ratio unless you look
at the things that add up to the deficit,
which are appropriated spending,
healthcare spending, revenues, and tax
spending.
For one quick word on tax spending,
for 2018 the latest report I saw was that
we spent $1.4 trillion going out the
back door of the Tax Code. That is
more than we spend on Social Security.
That is more than we spend on Medi-
care and Medicaid combined. That is
more than defense and nondefense dis-
cretionary spending combined. You
can’t not look at tax spending and still
have your math right. We address
those.
We provide a reasonable timeframe
to get to a debt-to-GDP target and
some warnings about whether or not
you are on that glide slope. There was
pretty much unanimous consent agree-
ment among all of our witnesses in the
committee and in the select committee
that that was the logical way to ad-
dress debt and deficit.
There are also some sidebar things
that are important that we get rid of
here, such as, we move to biennial
budgeting, which I think has broad bi-
partisan support. We deal with what I
call ‘‘the bear trap in the bedroom’’—
the debt ceiling—which is a very dan-
gerous thing if you should ever step on
it and trigger it. To disarm that bear
trap is very valuable to our efforts, and
we do that.
Vote-arama is one of the most
undistinguished, useless, humiliating,
and embarrassing spectacles that the
Senate presents. We solved, I believe,
vote-arama.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7083
December 17, 2019
So that is a pretty good package of
good, useful reforms to get going in the
right direction.
There is a very significant concern,
mostly on my side of the aisle, about
the special reconciliation process. In
this bill you alternate between regular
reconciliation and a special reconcili-
ation process, and then, in the next bi-
ennial cycle, back to regular reconcili-
ation and then special reconciliation.
There is concern that the special rec-
onciliation process might be used to
jam things we don’t like through—
things like cuts to Medicare, things
like very one-sided spending cuts that
don’t address the problem of tax spend-
ing.
We need to work to solve that. I
pledge to Chairman ENZI that I will put
my best efforts to try to come up with
a way where we can get through that
problem and move on to passing this
bill, which I think will be very signifi-
cant and very valuable once we iron
out what I think is probably, actually,
the last real gasp that we have in
terms of objection to it.
I will also add that the bipartisan
pathway that we have been working on
for when the two parties can come to-
gether and agree to those things is in
there. If we really want to do this in a
bipartisan pathway, that is in this bill.
I appreciate very much that Chairman
ENZI included that in the bill. That
provision passed the bicameral select
committee unanimously—Republicans,
Democrats, House Members, Senators,
unanimously. That is a pretty good
base to work off of.
I will close by quoting a phrase that
I have heard usually from business
folks from time to time. That is that in
business, ‘‘debt doesn’t matter, until it
does.’’ But then it is the only thing
that matters. At the moment, with in-
terest rates where they are and with
the world situation the way it is, one
can make the case that debt doesn’t
matter. But when the day comes that
it does matter, when interest rates pop
up and the cost of servicing our debt
begins to squeeze out other priorities,
it gets very hard to go back and try to
solve that problem then.
This is the kind of problem you have
to head off in advance. So to the extent
we can solve in a sensible way dealing
with our debt and deficit during the
calm period when debt doesn’t matter,
we will position ourselves to avoid the
calamity that can come when it is the
only thing that matters.
I pledge to use my best efforts to try
to bring my side into agreement on
this bill and to try to find a measure
that solves our concern about what I
think is really the only point of signifi-
cant disagreement in this bill, which is
what is behind the special reconcili-
ation process, what mischief that
might be got up to. I think if we can
defang this, we can move forward.
Again, much appreciation to Chair-
man ENZI for his extraordinary leader-
ship in the budget committee on this
subject. I am determined to try to get
this done in this Congress while he is
with us to see it through.
I yield the floor.

f
DEBBIE SMITH REAUTHORIZATION
ACT OF 2019
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I stand
proudly before this body today in sup-
port of the passage of the Debbie Smith
Act of 2019. Since its enactment in 2004,
the Debbie Smith Act has been renewed
twice with overwhelming bipartisan
support. With the tireless work of Sen-
ator CORNYN and Senator FEINSTEIN, we
will renew this vital piece of legisla-
tion for a third time today.
I want to thank Senator CORNYN very
much for being such a diligent leader
on behalf of this act.
The Debbie Smith Act removes one of
the most substantial and burdensome
roadblocks to survivors of sexual vio-
lence achieving the justice they de-
serve. I have told many people about
the time I volunteered when I was a
young woman in Iowa State Univer-
sity. I volunteered for a crisis hotline
and a woman’s shelter. The type of
work I was able to volunteer for at
that time was responding with a beeper
to crisis calls at the hospital for
women who had been through a rape.
That, in itself, is very difficult, but the
follow-on work that has to be done can
often be just as difficult if evidence is
not processed timely.
The Debbie Smith Act does this by
providing funding for crime labs that
process DNA evidence and by strength-
ening the national DNA database used
to help solve these horrific crimes. In
addition, this bipartisan bill supports
audits of evidence awaiting analysis at
law enforcement agencies and charges
the Justice Department with the task
of developing national testing guide-
lines.
We all know the criminal justice sys-
tem isn’t designed to be fair to sur-
vivors of sexual violence, and it is not
easy on them. It certainly is not a
comfortable process.
Coming forward as a survivor is not
the end. It is just the beginning. That
is why it is so important that this Con-
gress, with Senator CORNYN’s leader-
ship, and our criminal justice system
support survivors of sexual violence by
funding the availability of DNA evi-
dence to help bring these predators to
justice.
Again, I thank the Senator for his
diligent work on this. The bipartisan
Debbie Smith Act helps to bring us to
the end that our survivors need and
they deserve. Thank you for your lead-
ership.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me
thank the Senator from Iowa for her
leadership on so many issues, including
this one. Obviously, through her work
on the Judiciary Committee, where we
both serve and from where this impor-
tant piece of legislation emanated, this
has been a long journey. Unfortu-
nately, the politics of the day seem to
have slowed almost everything up that
we are trying to do.
In particular, I also want to recog-
nize the good work of the Senator from
Iowa on the reauthorization of the Vio-
lence Against Women Act. I am a proud
cosponsor of the legislation she is lead-
ing on. My hope is that after the fever
breaks, sometime after the first of the
year—I keep hoping for that moment—
we will get back to the nonpartisan re-
authorization of the Violence Against
Women Act. In the meantime, I am
happy to join the Senator on the floor
and to talk about the importance of
the Debbie Smith Act and to celebrate
its imminent passage.
Since 2004, the Debbie Smith Act has
been the guiding force behind our Na-
tion’s effort to eliminate the rape kit
backlog. Just so everybody under-
stands, at one point there was a report
that there were as many as 400,000 of
these forensic kits, which are used to
collect DNA evidence following sexual
assault, sitting in evidence lockers and
police stations or in labs and which re-
mained untested.
Once we are reminded of the impor-
tance of this evidence and how power-
ful it is to enable law enforcement offi-
cials to identify an attacker with al-
most complete precision and accuracy,
the importance of making sure these
kits were tested becomes all that more
obvious.
Since 2011, the Debbie Smith Act has
helped Texas—my State alone—reduce
its backlog of unsubmitted rape kits by
approximately 90 percent.
The benefits don’t stop there,
though. The primary goal of this pro-
gram is to reduce the rape kit backlog
and identify attackers—people who
commit sexual assaults.
Processing this evidence can also as-
sist investigations in other unrelated
crimes because perpetrators do leave
their DNA in other places other than
just in the crime of sexual assault.
Once this evidence is tested, it is
uploaded into the FBI’s DNA database
called CODIS. This is similar to a
criminal fingerprint database and can
help identify and convict people who
commit other crimes as well.
For the civil libertarians among us—
and I would like to consider myself one
of them—this evidence is also very
powerful in discounting or disquali-
fying potential perpetrators from sus-
picion because if, in fact, DNA of some
other person is identified, it obviously
is by exclusion of the other person who
may be suspected but who will thereby
be exonerated.
According to the National Institute
of Justice, 72 percent of the hits in the
FBI database system are the direct re-
sult of Debbie Smith Act funding. The
benefits of this law cannot be over-
stated, and it is time once again—past
time, really—to reauthorize this crit-
ical program. The Debbie Smith Act of

2019 will reauthorize important funding
that supports testing this DNA evi-
dence so we can continue to reduce and
eliminate the rape kit backlog and en-
sure that it will not grow again in the
future.
This legislation also supports impor-
tant training for law enforcement, cor-
rectional personnel, forensic nurses,
who are the ones who actually collect
the DNA evidence using these forensic
kits, as well as other professionals who
assist victims of sexual assault.
The process of getting this legisla-
tion through both Chambers of the
Congress has not been easy. I have to
say I appreciate all of the advocates
who fought tirelessly with us every
step of the way to bring us to this mo-
ment on the precipice of passing this
reauthorization. I want to particularly
recognize the folks at RAINN who are
consistently remaining above the polit-
ical fray and always putting survivors
first.
This legislation would not have been
possible without its namesake, Debbie
Smith, and the countless other sur-
vivors—people like Lavinia Masters,
Carol Bart, and others—who continue
to lend their voices to this fight. It is
not easy for a woman to come forward
and say: I was a victim of sexual as-
sault, and I don’t know who my
attacker was, but I will go through this
intrusive examination in order to as-
sist law enforcement in making an
identification and prosecuting the
case. The fact is, if we don’t catch
these predators, they will commit fur-
ther acts of sexual violence over and
over again until they are finally
caught and kept behind bars.
If you have not had the chance to
meet survivors and hear their stories,
you must because the survivors I have
met and worked with over the years in
Texas are truly inspiring. I am glad we
can finally get this bill passed on their
behalf.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of H.R. 777,
which was received from the House.

f
FEDERAL INTELLIGENCE
SURVEILLANCE ACT
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I under-
stand the majority leader will be here
soon, and when he does come, I will be
glad to yield to him. In the meantime,
I want to talk about last week’s report
from the inspector general of the De-
partment of Justice on the FBI’s coun-
terintelligence investigation into the
Trump campaign and its contacts with
Russia in 2016.
This is a very long report. It is more
than 400 pages long, and it outlines a
series of errors—17, all counted—made
by the FBI under the leadership of Di-
rector James Comey.
It is important for people to realize
that all these mistakes were made in a
previous administration and not under
the leadership of FBI Director Chris
Wray, and they don’t reflect, in my
view, the actions of the rank-and-file
FBI agents. But it is a serious matter,
and we need to get to the bottom of it,
and we need to take corrective action.
The report details a pattern of con-
cerning behavior by those who were
charged with protecting and defending
the United States, and it raises a lot of
red flags.
Last week, the inspector general tes-
tified before the Judiciary Committee.
I told him at that time—and I think it
bears repeating—that as an ardent sup-
porter of law enforcement and our in-
telligence community, I worry that the
mistakes and the intentionally mis-
leading conduct undertaken by some
leaders in the FBI under the previous
administration will undermine the
public’s confidence in what is a very
sensitive but important area, like for-
eign intelligence surveillance.
We rely on the men and women of the
FBI to identify and counter threats to
our national security, all the while
protecting incredibly sensitive infor-
mation and the privacy of American
citizens. It requires a tremendous
amount of trust from the American
people, and I am afraid that some of
the information that surfaced in this
report puts that trust in jeopardy.
The inspector general detailed a
number of truly disturbing and alarm-
ing facts about how this investigation
was conducted, especially when it
comes to the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act, otherwise known as
FISA.
FISA is a means whereby FBI agents
can go to the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Court and show probable
cause that an American citizen is an
agent of a foreign power. Obviously,
these are very, very sensitive inves-
tigations, and the sort of authority
that is given to the FBI under these
circumstances is very intrusive. In my
view, it is entirely justified and nec-
essary when, in fact, you are pro-
tecting the United States from very
real counterintelligence matters. But
the inspector general identified 7 mis-
takes in the initial Carter Page foreign
intelligence surveillance application
and 10 additional ones in 3 renewals.
These were not typos or misspelled
words; these were misrepresentations
meant to deceive the court so they
would issue a foreign intelligence sur-
veillance warrant.
To make matters worse, even as new
exculpatory information came to light
on Carter Page, this information was
not shared with the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Court—informa-
tion that they would have found rel-
evant in considering whether the FBI
and the U.S. Government had met their
required showing.
I asked the inspector general whether
he believed that if the court knew what
we know now, would the court have
ever issued the FISA warrant in the
first place? He perhaps wisely said he
was not in a position to predict what
the judges may or may not do, but he
said he knew they wouldn’t sign a war-
rant if they were told that all of the in-
formation was not included and cer-
tainly not if they were lied to, as oc-
curred here in the Carter Page foreign
intelligence surveillance warrant. As a
former judge myself, I think that is ab-
solutely accurate.
But that begs the question, What is
the FISA Court going to do about this?
We know what we need to do because
already the FBI Director has indicated
that there are a number of areas where
he believes this whole process needs to
be reformed in order to restore public
trust in the integrity of this process.
I was interested to see a report in the
New York Times that is dated today at
4:55 p.m. entitled ‘‘Court Orders FBI to
Fix National Security Wiretaps After
Damning Report.’’
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that following my remarks, this
article be printed in the RECORD.
Take a step back from this scenario
and think more broadly about how this
type of behavior may play out in a
criminal proceeding. For example,
imagine you are a judge and you find
out that you were lied to by the pros-
ecution, that you were presented with
information that was not only incor-
rect but intentionally fabricated to
help build their case. What would you
do? Well, depending on the scenario,
the court may hold that individual in
contempt of court. The judge may de-
cide to throw out some of the evidence
or the entire case and possibly—prob-
ably—refer that lawyer to disciplinary
proceedings, where that lawyer would
be in jeopardy of losing his or her law
license. These are remedies that exist
if these sorts of actions happen during
ordinary court proceedings, and I be-
lieve they are probably available to the

Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court should the court decide to take
that kind of action.
I note that in this article I have at-
tached and I referred to earlier, the
court has now given the FBI a January
10 deadline to come up with a response
to what the court is asking about.
Of course, the court, I am sure, had
to be troubled by what it saw as not
only the sloppy work but the inten-
tional misrepresentation and outright
lies used by the FBI in this instance to
get this foreign intelligence surveil-
lance warrant against Carter Page—as
well they should be concerned.
But the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Court is different from ordinary
courts. It handles cases that are crit-
ical to our national security, full of
highly sensitive, largely classified in-
formation, and these same sorts of
remedies that you might use in an or-
dinary court may or may not apply.
The way I see it, if we don’t take cor-
rective action—if the FBI doesn’t take
corrective action, if Congress doesn’t
undertake a review of this whole FISA
process—we will be in danger of losing
this ability to investigate or to collect
intelligence to keep our country safe.
The only way that happens currently is
if the public trusts Congress and the
FISA Court to enforce the laws and
rules to make sure that privacy inter-
ests of American citizens are ade-
quately protected, and only based upon
an extraordinary showing—an evi-
dentiary showing by the Government
that a FISA warrant is warranted
should that be ordered by the court.
All of that is at risk unless, I believe,
reform is undertaken and the court
takes corrective action in whatever
means it thinks appropriate to punish
those who misled it in issuing these
four FISA warrants for Carter Page.
This whole episode, I believe, sets a
very dangerous precedent. If these
agents and lawyers are able to break
every rule to investigate a political
campaign of an American President
and are facing no consequences, what is
to stop others from doing that in the
future? If they can use the awesome
power of the Federal Government to in-
vestigate a Presidential campaign and
someone who later became President,
what chance do ordinary Americans
have of making sure that the rules will
be applied to them and that their pri-
vacy will be respected?
We have to have accountability for
these errors and these intentionally de-
ceptive representations. We can’t have
people like that working at the FBI
who are charged with supporting our
national security. We can’t allow that
to continue or to happen again.
We need to see that adequate dis-
ciplinary measures are undertaken by
the FBI, perhaps by the court itself,
while Congress looks at what we can do
to reform this whole FISA procedure to
make sure things like this do not hap-
pen in the future.
I was glad to see, in his report, the
inspector general said that his office
has initiated a full audit to look into
the FBI’s compliance with FISA proce-
dures across the board.
He also noted that the FBI’s National
Security Division Assistant Attorney
General had sent a letter to the FISA
Court in July of 2018, outlining some of
the errors made in the Carter Page
FISA applications and saying that DOJ
lawyers will be supplementing that in-
formation based on the inspector gen-
eral report that the inspector general
testified on last week.
As we look for ways to prevent this
type of abuse from happening in the fu-
ture, we need to hear from the FISA
Court what it believes is appropriate
discipline and appropriate measures it
needs to take to protect the integrity
of their proceedings and to stop things
like this from happening in the future.
All of this would be critical not only to
find what went wrong but also what
Congress does or does not need to do to
protect the integrity of this process.
FISA—the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act—is absolutely critical to
our national security, and we must not
only protect the integrity of the proc-
ess but restore the American people’s
trust in it.
I know this isn’t something that can
be solved overnight, but I am com-
mitted to working with all of our col-
leagues here in Congress, as well as the
Justice Department and the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court, to try
to do what we need to do to prevent
these failures from ever happening
again.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From The New York Times, Dec. 17, 2019]
COURT ORDERS F.B.I. TO FIX NATIONAL
SECURITY WIRETAPS AFTER DAMNING REPORT
(By Charlie Savage)
In a rare public order, the secretive For-
eign Intelligence Surveillance Court re-
sponded to problems with the eavesdropping
on a former Trump campaign aide uncovered
by an inspector general.
A secretive federal court accused the F.B.I.
on Tuesday of misleading it about the fac-
tual basis for wiretapping a former Trump
campaign adviser and ordered the bureau to
propose changes in how investigators seek
permission for some national security sur-
veillance.
In an extraordinary public order, the pre-
siding judge on the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Court, Rosemary M. Collyer, gave
the F.B.I. a Jan. 10 deadline to come up with
a proposal. It was the first public response
from the court to the scathing findings re-
leased last week by the Justice Department’s
independent inspector general about the
wiretapping of the former Trump adviser,
Carter Page, as part of the Russia investiga-
tion.
‘‘The frequency with which representations
made by F.B.I. personnel turned out to be
unsupported or contradicted by information
in their possession, and with which they
withheld information detrimental to their
case, calls into question whether informa-
tion contained in other F.B.I. applications is
reliable,’’ Judge Collyer wrote.
The court ‘‘expects the government to pro-
vide complete and accurate information in
every filing,’’ she added.
While the inspector general, Michael E.
Horowitz, debunked the claims by President
Trump and his allies that senior F.B.I. offi-
cials were part of a political conspiracy, his
investigation also exposed a litany of errors
and inaccuracies by which case agents cher-
ry-picked the evidence about Mr. Page as
they sought permission to eavesdrop on his
calls and emails.
The order specifies no particular reforms
for the bureau’s policies for seeking permis-
sion to wiretap people under the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. But it
indicated that the court will weigh in on
whether the F.B.I.’s proposals are sufficient.
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing
last week about the report’s findings, the
chairman of the panel, Senator Lindsey Gra-
ham, Republican of South Carolina, ad-
dressed the FISA court directly, telling the
judges that they needed to take steps to pre-
serve political support for the national secu-
rity surveillance system.
‘‘The FISA system, to survive, has to be re-
formed;’’ Mr. Graham said. ‘‘To the FISA
court: We’re looking to you to take correc-
tive action. If you take corrective action,
that will give us some confidence that you
should stick around. If you don’t, it’s going
to be hurtful to the future of the court, and
I think all of us are now thinking differently
about checks and balances in that regard.’’
Mr. Horowitz is scheduled to testify about
the report again on Wednesday at a hearing
before the Senate Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee.
Mr. Horowitz suggested several changes.
He recommended that the F.B.I. overhaul
the forms used to ask the Justice Depart-
ment to submit a FISA request or renewal to
ensure they identify any information that
cuts against suspicions about a target; sur-
face any reasons to be skeptical about an in-
formant whose information is included; and
require agents and supervisors to reverify
factual assertions repeated from prior appli-
cations when they seek renewals.
In a statement issued when the report was
released, the F.B.I. director, Christopher A.
Wray, said he accepted Mr. Horowitz’s find-
ings and embraced the need to make
changes. He said he was ordering ‘‘concrete
changes’’ to ensure that that FISA process
was ‘‘more stringent and less susceptible to
mistake or inaccuracy.’’
Among the other ideas floated by reform
proponents, including the American Civil
Liberties Union: appointing a third party to
critique the government’s cases for wire-
tapping people, at least in sensitive inves-
tigations, or allowing defense lawyers with
security clearances to see the government’s
evidence presented to the FISA court on
those rare occasions when it is used to pros-
ecute a suspect.
Mr. Horowitz has already begun an audit of
other, unrelated FISA applications to see
whether there is a broader pattern of prob-
lems in how the F.B.I. is portraying the evi-
dence about suspects. Another possibility for
reform is that going forward, the bureau’s
general counsel could oversee recurring au-
dits of a random sampling of FISA applica-
tions, so that case agents will always have to
take into account that someone may later
second-guess their work.
In his report, Mr. Horowitz scrutinized the
four applications that the Justice Depart-
ment submitted between October 2016 and
June 2017 to wiretap Mr. Page, whom F.B.I.
agents suspected might be a conduit between
the Trump campaign and Russia during its
covert operation to manipulate the 2016 pres-
idential election.
The review uncovered a deeply dysfunc-
tional and flawed process riddled with inac-
curacies and material omissions. Investiga-
tors highlighted facts that made Mr. Page
look suspicious while failing to mention po-
tentially exculpatory ones, and when they

sought to renew the wiretap, they failed to
correct earlier statements whose credibility
had since come under serious question, the
report found.
Justice Department lawyers who deal di-
rectly with the FISA court passed that mis-
leading portrait onto the judges. While Mr.
Horowitz’s findings placed most of the direct
blame on a handful of case agents and their
supervisors who worked directly with the
raw evidence, his report also blamed senior
officials for permitting a culture in which
such actions could happen.
The report said Mr. Horowitz’s investiga-
tors had found no evidence that political bias
against Mr. Trump was behind the prob-
lems—as opposed to apolitical confirmation
bias, gross incompetence or negligence. But
the inspector general said the explanation
the F.B.I. offered—that the agents had been
busy with other aspects of the Russia inves-
tigation, and the Page FISA was a minor
part of those responsibilities—was unsatis-
factory.
Congress enacted FISA in 1978 to regulate
the government’s use of domestic surveil-
lance for national-security investigations—
those aimed at monitoring suspected spies
and terrorists—as opposed to ordinary crimi-
nal cases. The law sets up a special court,
made up of 11 sitting district court judges
who are selected to serve staggered terms by
the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and
decide whether the evidence shows a target
is probably a foreign agent.
In 2018, government records show, the
court only fully denied one of 1,080 final ap-
plications submitted under FISA to conduct
electronic surveillance. However, the court
also demanded unspecified modifications to
119 of those applications before approving
them. There were 1,833 targets of FISA or-
ders, including 232 Americans, that year.
National-security wiretaps are more secre-
tive than ordinary criminal ones. When
criminal wiretap orders end, their targets
are usually notified that their privacy has
been invaded. But the targets of FISA orders
are usually not told that their phone calls
and emails have been monitored, or that
their homes or businesses have been
searched.
And when people are prosecuted for crimes
based on evidence derived from ordinary
criminal wiretaps, the defendants and their
lawyers are usually allowed to see what the
government told judges about them to win
approval for that surveillance, giving them
the opportunity to argue that investigators
made mistakes and the evidence should be
suppressed.
But defense lawyers, even those with secu-
rity clearances, are not shown FISA applica-
tions for their clients. As a result, there is
no prospect of second-guessing in an adver-
sarial court setting to keep F.B.I. agents
scrupulous about how they portray the evi-
dence when seeking to persuade FISA judges
to sign off on putting a target under surveil-
lance.
In the absence of that disciplining factor,
the Justice Department and F.B.I. have de-
veloped internal procedures that are sup-
posed to make sure that the evidence pre-
sented in FISA applications is accurate and
includes any facts that might undercut the
government’s case. But that system failed in
the Page wiretaps, Mr. Horowitz’s report
showed.
At the Senate hearing, one of the rare
areas of agreement between Republicans and
Democrats was the need for change to the
FISA system. Senator Richard Blumenthal,
Democrat of Connecticut, who has unsuc-
cessfully proposed legislation to tighten re-
strictions on national-security surveillance
in the past, said he welcomed the moment.
‘‘I hope my Republican colleagues who
have been so vocal and vehement about the
dangers of potential FISA abuses will join
me in looking forward and reform of that
court,’’ Mr. Blumenthal said, adding: ‘‘I hope
that we can come together on a bipartisan
basis to reform the FISA process.’’
f
NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know
this year is rapidly coming to a close,
and we are all anxious to join our fami-
lies for the holidays.
The impeachment frenzy, though, has
almost completely engulfed the Cap-
itol, particularly on the House side, for
the past few months and has made it
very difficult, if not impossible, for
Congress to get much of its work done;
hence, the last-minute rush to get
things done that we should have done
weeks and perhaps months earlier.
One of the victims of this impeach-
ment mania has been the National De-
fense Authorization Act, and I am glad
we finally were able to pass that today.
For the last 58 years, the NDAA—the
national defense act—has passed with
broad bipartisan support. But this
year, things took a little different
turn. While we maintained historical
norms here in the Senate and passed
the bill by a vote of 86 to 8, our House
Democratic colleagues took a com-
pletely different route. They managed
to come up with a bill that was so par-
tisan that not a single Republican
voted for it in the House.
A party-line vote in the House may
not be newsworthy, but a party-line
vote on the national defense authoriza-
tion bill is.
Fortunately, after months of nego-
tiations, Senator INHOFE, chairman of
the Armed Services Committee, and
Senator REED, the ranking member,
were able to work with their House
counterparts to reach a compromise on
the bill, as I said, that passed earlier
today.
This legislation is vitally important
because it will give our commanders
the predictability they need, as well as
the troops the resources they have
earned.
It also authorizes $400 million for
military construction projects in
places like Texas and 90 new F–35 Joint
Strike Fighters that are made in Fort
Worth.
Overall, the NDAA will strengthen
our national security, and it will ben-
efit all of our servicemembers and
their families and our military bases,
including those in Texas.
So I just want to say that I appre-
ciate the hard work of Chairman
INHOFE and Senator REED, the ranking
member, and all of our colleagues on
the Armed Services Committee on both
sides of the Capitol and look forward to
it being signed by the President, hope-
fully, without further delay.
This was a critical step to strengthen
our Nation’s military, but it is only
part of our duty to provide our troops
with the resources and training and the
equipment they need to succeed. Now
we need to take care of the defense ap-
propriations bill, which has now been
passed by the House and which will be
coming over here to the Senate soon
and which I expect we will act on by
Thursday.
Sadly, though, this has also fallen to
the wayside while our Democratic col-
leagues in the House have worked tire-
lessly to try to remove the President
from office. We are in the posture of
having to do that this week only be-
cause the agreement that was made
last August on spending caps was
walked away from by our Democratic
colleagues in the Senate, and it has
taken us all this time to get back to
where we thought we were in the Au-
gust timeframe.
Despite the deal reached over the
summer to keep the appropriations
process free from poison pill riders, our
friends across the aisle have tried to
force liberal wish list items into the
bill.
Thanks to Senator INHOFE, that has
largely been avoided. I must also thank
MAC THORNBERRY, the ranking member
on the House side.
We have also managed to avoid a gov-
ernment shutdown, but the process has
certainly not been pretty. We have
been forced to pass two short-term
funding bills, which have kept the
trains running but failed to provide the
predictability we thought we were
going to get into the future once the 2-
year budget deal was agreed upon last
August.
So I am happy in one sense that the
deal was finally reached to avoid a gov-
ernment shutdown, and I am in the
process of reviewing these huge funding
packages that total about $1.4 trillion.
Let me just say that I also appreciate
the hard work of our friend from Ala-
bama, Chairman SHELBY, and our col-
leagues on the appropriations commit-
tees for their work to keep the doors
open and to keep our commitments to
our men and women in uniform.
I am hopeful we will be able to act
before this funding expires this Friday.
I yield the floor.

Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, I rise
today to talk about the importance of
a vote we took earlier on the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2020.
This bill delivers on the needs of the
warfighter today and invests in capa-
bilities we must have for the future.
I also fought for and secured huge
wins for the Grand Canyon State. As
home to 10 military installations, Ari-
zona plays a key role in many missions
critical to our Nation’s defense. Our bi-
partisan legislation highlights the in-
credible contributions that Arizona
bases, citizens, and industry make to
support our military each and every
day.
Since I have been in Congress, I led
the fight to stop the A–10 from being
mothballed, and this bill continues to
secure resources needed to modernize

the A–10, based at Davis-Monthan Air
Force Base.
We also succeeded in funding a new
hangar and barracks at Marine Corps
Air Station Yuma and additional F–35s
at Luke Air Force Base and Yuma for
training and deploying the next gen-
eration of F–35 pilots.
I also secured funding to upgrade the
Barry Goldwater training ranges and
many other Arizona initiatives.
The annual defense bill is about pro-
tecting the people who protect us. This
year’s bill reiterates to the men and
women of our military that we have
their backs. It provides the highest pay
raise in a decade and protects military
families from greedy contractors who
provide their tenants dangerous and
unlivable base housing. These contrac-
tors, who act more like slumlords than
landlords, will now be required to im-
plement a tenant bill of rights.
We also give military families more
power in filing disputes and fund addi-
tional housing office personnel to en-
sure families have advocates on base.
I am particularly pleased to see 17 of
my 18 reforms to combat sexual assault
in the military are also included in this
bill. Earlier this year, I disclosed that
I, too, am a survivor of military sexual
assault. After I did, I charged the top
leaders at the Pentagon to imme-
diately identify ways to improve the
investigation process and support to
victims.
My provisions increased the number
of personnel investigating sexual as-
sault cases and ensure a victim has ac-
cess to a special victims’ counsel with-
in 72 hours of reporting an assault.
These and my other improvements
share the goal of getting justice for
victims sooner.
The greatest disappointment in an
otherwise bipartisan bill is the lack of
backfill funding for military construc-
tion projects.
After unprecedented obstruction by
Democrats on border security funding,
some resources were diverted to border
security projects under authorities le-
gally granted to the President by Con-
gress.
I hear from my constituents all the
time in our pro-military and southern
border State: We can and must secure
our border and fund our military. Life
is full of difficult choices. This
shouldn’t be one of them for any Mem-
ber on either side of the aisle.
The Senate voted in a landslide, bi-
partisan way, 86 to 8, to fund effective
military construction projects in this
bill—in the Senate version of this bill.
Then, during conference negotiations,
Democrats refused to fully fund these
projects due to political games sur-
rounding border security.
Think about that for a minute. They
didn’t like the President diverting the
resources to secure our border, so they
decided to take it out on our military
by refusing to backfill funding.
Our military deserves better. The
American people deserve better.
Nevertheless, one of Arizona’s fiscal
year 2019 projects at Fort Huachuca
was stalled for unforeseen environ-
mental issues at the construction site,
so it wasn’t ready to spend the fiscal
year 2019 funds that we approved for it.
This funding would have been diverted
to some other purpose in any other
year. It could have been funded in fis-
cal year 2020, but the Democrats re-
fused to support that. The earliest the
project will be ready to start is next
summer.
The Secretary of the Army has as-
sured me that this project will be in
the budget for fiscal year 2021, which
starts 91⁄2 months from now, following
the completion of this environmental
cleanup. I will continue to fight for the
funding for Fort Huachuca and resolve
to work hand-in-hand with the Army
until this project is complete.
Finally, I have to note that this is
the first NDAA that this body has
passed in decades without Senator
John McCain. I think I speak for Mem-
bers of the Armed Services Committee
and this entire Senate when I say that
we have felt his absence deeply this
past year. While he may not have been
physically with us, it still has the fin-
gerprints of his leadership, grit, and ul-
timate dedication to servicemembers
and military families.
His memory has propelled us to se-
cure lasting, meaningful reforms for
the men and women who serve, wheth-
er in uniform, as a family member, or
in a supporting civilian role.
This is the 59th consecutive annual
defense bill that has been passed. It re-
mains a shining example, for the most
part, of what we can accomplish when
we work together to protect Americans
and support our troops.
It was my privilege to bring home
these massive wins, working with my
colleagues on the Armed Services Com-
mittee, for our troops and for the great
State of Arizona.

f
NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I sup-
port the fiscal year 2020 National De-
fense Authorization Act. The final,
conferenced version of this bill reflects
a compromise. As with any com-
promise, there are things I support and
things I wish the final bill had in-
cluded.
Of great significance is the inclusion
in this bill of a provision providing 12
weeks of paid parental leave for all
Federal employees. There are Federal
employees in every corner of this coun-
try, including in Vermont. We lead by
example when we say that the Federal
Government will support new parents,
who will now be able to be home with
their new child in those important first
days. I hope that this example is one
that can be replicated throughout our
workforce.
The fiscal year 2020 NDAA includes
important wins for servicemembers,
their families, and our national secu-
rity as well. I am pleased that at long
last we have successfully introduced a
phase-out of the so-called Widows’ Tax.
This bill mandates gender integration
for Marine Corps training, makes much
needed progress in addressing the use
and after effects of open-air burn pits,
and demands new standards for micro-
electronics supply chains, so we know
our technology is working for us.
Closer to home, the bill authorizes
$30 million to construct a new Army
Mountain Warfare School in Jericho.
This is important to Vermont and to
the Nation. This major construction
project will allow the Vermont Army
National Guard, one of the Nations’
few mountain battalions, to better ful-
fill their mission of training soldiers
from the Guard, Reserves, and Active
Duty to accomplish their mission in
cold, rugged terrain. Vermont is an
ideal training ground because its
mountains and climate are chal-
lenging, but still allow training
throughout the year for all levels of ex-
pertise. That training is important to
the Army because mountain skills re-
quire the ability to move from one
place to another when major obstacles
are in the way, something valuable
anywhere the Army operates.
The bill includes an important meas-
ure based on an amendment I filed as
well to improve condolence payment
authorities for civilians who are killed
as a result of U.S. military operations.
We have included funds for this purpose
for years through the appropriations
process, but very few payments have
been made and record keeping has
often been poor. The new provisions in
this bill aim to improve the process
and increase its use, so that when civil-
ians are harmed in war, their families
are not left economically destitute as
well.
I am disappointed that this bill does
not include measures that were adopt-
ed by the House of Representatives to
repeal authorizations for the use of
force that were adopted nearly two dec-
ades ago. We simply must have a de-
bate in Congress about our ongoing en-
gagement around the world that relies
on these AUMFs.
I wish the final agreement had in-
cluded a hazardous substance designa-
tion for the dangerous chemicals
known by their abbreviations PFAS
and PFOA, nor was a sufficient author-
ization included that would support the
cleanup of these chemicals. The NDAA
also includes authorization of the
President’s Space Force, which I be-
lieve increases bureaucracy at the ex-
pense of our real priorities.
Nonetheless, I believe this is a good
bill that supports our troops, and for
that reason, I support its passage.
f
VOTE EXPLANATION
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I
wish to state for the record that al-
though an important engagement in
Oregon kept me from being present in
the Capitol to participate in the clo-
ture vote on this year’s National De-
fense Authorization Act, NDAA, I
would have voted nay had I been
present.
I am pleased that the NDAA would
phase out the reduction of survivor
benefit plan annuities to ensure that
the families of our fallen
servicemembers receive the Federal
support they need and deserve; would
guarantee 12 weeks of paid family leave
for Federal employees; fence funds for
the introduction of new Intermediate-
Range Nuclear Forces, INF; limit nu-
clear cooperation agreements under
section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy
Act with countries that lack safe-
guards; and support the legally-binding
and verifiable limits of the New
START Treaty as being in the national
security interest of the United States.
However, other aspects of the bill are
cause for serious concern, outweighing
these strong points, and must not be
overlooked.
I am deeply concerned by this legis-
lation’s failure to prohibit funds for
unauthorized war with Iran. There is
no doubt that war with Iran would be a
reckless, disastrous mistake. Yet the
President has made a number of impul-
sive, provocative public statements
that risk escalating tensions. Congress
must protect its authority to declare
war, and that means no blank checks
to the administration for an unauthor-
ized war with Iran.
It is also unthinkable that the final
NDAA does not prohibit funds for intel-
ligence support to the Saudi-led coali-
tion in a war that has caused a cata-
strophic humanitarian crisis in Yemen.
Communities have crumbled as a result
of this conflict, and an acute cholera
outbreak and famine have killed more
than 85,000 children under the age of 5.
The United States has no place sup-
porting, prolonging, or being complicit
in this war’s widespread civilian cas-
ualties.
In addition, I am concerned that the
NDAA does not prohibit funds for the
deployment of a low-yield warhead on a
submarine-launched ballistic missile.
The use of this powerful and aggressive
tool could drastically increase the risk
of instigating a destabilizing nuclear
arms race.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7090 December 17, 2019
Here at home, the final NDAA con-
ference report removed provisions to
address PFAS water contamination.
More than 16 million Americans cur-
rently drink water contaminated with
PFAS chemicals, which can affect
every major organ in the human body
and put humans at higher risk of a
wide variety of health conditions and
complications including liver and kid-
ney damage and thyroid disease. The
decision to reject remedies to this ur-
gent public health issue in the NDAA is
deeply disturbing and completely unac-
ceptable.
Finally, this NDAA does not include
adequate safeguards to ensure account-
ability for wasteful defense spending.
At a time when America far outspends
every other nation in the world mili-
tarily, while working families are grap-
pling with stagnant wages and rising
costs of living, it could not be more im-
portant that the Pentagon and its con-
tractors are accountable to American
taxpayers. We should be doing far more
to scrutinize defense spending and to
evaluate whether we could maintain a
strong military while redirecting badly
needed funding to the American peo-
ple’s priorities on health care, housing,
education, and infrastructure.
Mr. President, I wish to state once
again that I would have voted nay had
I been present. I look forward to work-
ing with all of my colleagues to resolve
these critical issues in future bills and
to advance the health, safety, and well-
being of all Americans.

TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY ISAKSON
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President,
I rise today to recognize my colleague
and friend, Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON,
for a lifetime of service to our Nation
that started with his time as a
loadmaster in the Georgia Air National
Guard, to his tenure in the Georgia
General Assembly, to his years of pub-
lic service in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and the U.S. Senate.
With JOHNNY’s retirement, the Sen-
ate is losing a truly great leader; a
man of courage, whose dedication to
this country has inspired me more
times than I can count; a man of
honor, who has worked tirelessly for
the veteran community; and a man of
compassion, who I am so grateful to be
able to call a dear friend.
We will never be able to fully thank
JOHNNY for all he has done for the rest
of us, but today, I want to try. JOHNNY,
thank you for being there for me at
Walter Reed when I was a Wounded
Warrior, just home from combat.
Thank you for being by my side last
spring, a decade and a half later, on my
first trip back to Iraq.
Thank you for always being there
when it matters the most, for being
such an incredible advocate for our vet-
erans, for giving the absolute best
birthday and holiday presents, and for
showing what it means to lead a life
guided by integrity, a life defined by
service.
You have made our Nation stronger
and our Union more perfect. You will
be missed every time this Chamber is
gaveled into session.

JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT
Mr. BURR. Madam President, this
explanation reflects the status of nego-
tiations and disposition of issues
reached between the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence and
the Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence for the Damon Paul Nelson and
Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence
Authorization Act for Fiscal Years
2018, 2019, and 2020. This bill is named
after two dedicated staffers—Matthew
Young Pollard of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence and Damon
Paul Nelson of the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence—
whose contributions to America will
have an enduring, positive impact on
our national security.
The explanation shall have the same
effect with respect to the implementa-
tion of this act as if it were a joint ex-
planatory statement of a conference
committee. The explanation comprises
three parts: an overview of the applica-
tion of the annex to accompany this
statement, unclassified congressional
direction, and a section-by-section
analysis of the legislative text.
I ask unanimous consent that the
Joint Explanatory Statement for the
Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew
Young Pollard Intelligence Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and
2020 be printed into the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
DAMON PAUL NELSON AND MATTHEW YOUNG
POLLARD INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT
FOR FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2019, AND 2020
The following is the explanation of the
Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew Young Pol-
lard Intelligence Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020 (hereinafter,
‘‘the Act’’).
This explanation reflects the result of ne-
gotiations and disposition of issues reached
between the House Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Sen-
ate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI)
(hereinafter, ‘‘the Agreement’’). The expla-
nation shall have the same effect with re-
spect to the implementation of the Act as if
it were a joint explanatory statement of a
conference committee.
The explanation comprises three parts: an
overview of the application of the annex to
accompany this statement; unclassified con-
gressional direction; and a section-by-sec-
tion analysis of the legislative text.
PART I: APPLICATION OF THE CLASSIFIED ANNEX
The classified nature of U.S. intelligence
activities prevents the HPSCI and SSCI (col-
lectively, the ‘‘congressional intelligence
committees’’) from publicly disclosing many
details concerning the conclusions and rec-
ommendations of the Agreement. Therefore,
a classified Schedule of Authorizations and a
classified annex have been prepared to de-
scribe in detail the scope and intent of the
congressional intelligence committees’ ac-
tions. The Agreement authorizes the Intel-
ligence Community (IC) to obligate and ex-
pend funds not altered or modified by the
classified Schedule of Authorizations as re-
quested in the President’s budget, subject to
modification under applicable reprogram-
ming procedures.
The classified annex is the result of nego-
tiations between the congressional intel-
ligence committees. They reconcile the dif-
ferences between the congressional intel-
ligence committees’ respective versions of
the bill for the National Intelligence Pro-
gram (NIP) for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and
2020. The Agreement also makes rec-
ommendations for the Military Intelligence
Program (MIP) and the Information Systems
Security Program (ISSP), consistent with
the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2020, and provides certain direc-
tion for these two programs. The Agreement
applies to IC activities for Fiscal Year 2020.
The classified Schedule of Authorizations
is incorporated into the bill pursuant to Sec-
tion 5102 of Subdivision 1. It has the status of
law. The classified annex supplements and
adds detail to clarify the authorization lev-
els found in the bill and the classified Sched-
ule of Authorizations. The congressional in-
telligence committees view direction and
recommendations, whether contained in this
explanation or in the classified annex, as re-
quiring compliance by the Executive Branch.
PART II: SELECT UNCLASSIFIED CONGRESSIONAL
DIRECTION
Unclassified Direction related to Subdivi-
sion 1 of the Act relates to Fiscal Year 2020.
Unclassified Direction related to Subdivision
2 originated in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.
The term ‘‘Committees’’ refers to both SSCI
and HPSCI.
UNCLASSIFIED DIRECTION RELATED TO
SUBDIVISION 1
Plans for Operations During Government Shut-
downs by All Elements of the Intelligence
Community.
The Committees have an active interest in
the impact of government shutdowns on the
intelligence mission. Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A–11, Section 124,
outlines how agencies are supposed to plan
for operations during government shut-
downs, and Section 124.2 provides that agen-
cies must share those plans with OMB. Addi-
tionally, Section 323 of the Intelligence Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 requires
the Office of the Director of National Intel-
ligence (ODNI), the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA), and IC elements within the
Department of Defense (DoD) to share those
same plans with specified congressional com-
mittees, including the congressional intel-
ligence committees.
These requirements, however, omit IC ele-
ments that are not separate ‘‘agencies’’ for
the purposes of OMB Circular A–11, Section
124, and are not ODNI, CIA, or elements
within the DoD for the purposes of the IAA
for Fiscal Year 2014. As a result, no such re-
porting requirement currently exists for IC
elements within the Departments of Justice,
Treasury, Energy, State, and Homeland Se-
curity. For that reason, when portions of the
federal government were shut down between
December 2018 and February 2019, the Com-
mittees had little to no insight into the ef-
fects of the shutdown on these and other im-
portant segments of the IC.
Therefore, the Committees direct IC ele-
ments within the Departments of Justice,
Treasury, Energy, State, and Homeland Se-
curity to submit to the congressional intel-
ligence committees—on the same day as the
host department’s issuance of any plan for a
government shutdown—the number of per-
sonnel in their respective elements that will
be furloughed.
Program Manager-Information Sharing Envi-
ronment Review.
Section 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and
Terrorism Protection Act of 2004 (IRTPA)
created a Program Manager-Information
Sharing Environment (PM-ISE), adminis-
tered from within the ODNI, to better facili-
tate the interagency sharing of terrorism-re-
lated information. Section 1016 also des-
ignated the PM-ISE as a presidentially-ap-
pointed position. Section 6402 of Subdivision
2 of the Act amends the IRTPA, so that the
PM-ISE is subject to appointment by the Di-
rector of National Intelligence (DNI), not the
President. Since the establishment of the
PM-ISE, the Federal government has created
entities, procedures, and processes to address
directly the mandate for improved terrorism
information sharing. Accordingly, the Com-
mittees find it appropriate to reconsider the
future of the PM-ISE’s mission.
Therefore, the Committees direct the
ODNI, in consultation with appropriate Fed-
eral departments, agencies, and components,
within 180 days of enactment of this Act, to
conduct a review of the PM-ISE’s terrorism
information sharing mission, associated
functions, and organizational role within the
ODNI and provide findings and recommenda-
tions on the future of the PM-ISE to Con-
gress.
Leveraging Academic Institutions in the Intel-
ligence Community.
The Committees encourage the DNI and
the Director of the DIA to ensure that IC ele-
ments continue to forge tighter partnerships
with leading universities and their affiliated
research centers in order to enhance mutual
awareness of domestic and international
challenges, leverage subject matter experts
from higher education in a manner that uses
cutting edge technologies and methods, and
bolsters the recruitment of top-notch, di-
verse, and technically proficient talent into
the IC’s workforce.
The Committees further believe that IC-
sponsored academic programs such as the In-
telligence Community Centers for Academic
Excellence (IC-CAE) should work closely
with educational institutions that offer
interdisciplinary courses of study and learn-
ing opportunities in national and inter-
national security; geopolitical affairs, inter-
national relations and national security;
interdisciplinary courses of study in the cul-
ture, history, languages, politics, and reli-
gions of major world regions; foreign lan-
guage instruction; computer and data
science; or cybersecurity.
The DNI shall ensure that such programs
are facilitated via the streamlining of the se-
curity clearance process for graduating stu-
dents from such universities who receive of-
fers of employment from IC elements, pro-
vide for the temporary exchange of faculty
and IC professionals, including as visiting
fellows, and technical training opportunities
for faculty, students, and IC personnel.
Therefore, the Committees direct all IC
agencies to support the IC-CAE effort by
tracking recruits and new hires who have
graduated from IC-CAE-designated institu-
tions, promptly reporting these numbers to
the office in charge of IC-CAE implementa-
tion, and increasing all IC agencies’ efforts
to recruit from such institutions.
Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information
Facilities.
The Committees remain concerned about
impediments for companies with appro-
priately cleared personnel being able to per-
form work for government entities and the
effects of these impediments on IC access to
innovative products and services. For exam-
ple, businesses without access to a Sensitive
Compartmented Information Facility
(SCIF), which includes many small busi-
nesses and non-traditional contractors, find
it difficult to perform classified work for the
IC. Construction and accreditation of SCIF
spaces may be cost-prohibitive for small
business and non-traditional government
contractors.
Additionally, SCIF construction timelines
often exceed the period of performance of a
contract. A modern trend for innovative and
non-traditional government contractors is
the use of co-working space environments.
Additionally, public and private entities are
partnering to create emerging regional inno-
vation hubs to help identify technology solu-
tions and products in the private sector that
can be utilized by the DoD and IC. These in-
novation hubs currently produce an agile,
neutral, but largely unclassified, develop-
ment environment.
Therefore, the Committees direct the ODNI
to submit a report to the congressional intel-
ligence committees on:
1. Processes and procedures necessary to
build, certify, and maintain certifications
for multi-use sensitive compartmented fa-
cilities not tied to a single contract and
where multiple companies can securely work
on multiple projects at different security
levels;
2. Analysis of the advantages and disadvan-
tages of issuing DoD Contract Security Spec-
ification (DD Form 254s) to Facilities’’ as op-
posed to Contracts’’;
3. Options for classified co-use and shared
workspace environments such as innovation,
incubation, catalyst, and accelerator envi-
ronments;
4. Pros and cons for public, private, govern-
ment, or combination owned facilities that
can operate at different classification levels;
and
5. Any other opportunities to support com-
panies with appropriately cleared personnel
but without effective access to a neutral
SCIF.
Inclusion of Security Risks in Program Manage-
ment Plans Required for Acquisition of
Major Systems in the National Intelligence
Program.
Section 5305 of Subdivision 1 of the Act
adds security risk as a factor for the DNI to
include in the annual Program Management
Plans for major system acquisitions sub-
mitted to the congressional intelligence
committees pursuant to Section
102A(q)(1)(A) of the National Security Act of
1947 (50 U.S.C. 3024(q)(1)(A)). The Committees
are increasingly concerned with the security
risks to IC acquisitions. The Joint Explana-
tory Statement accompanying the Intel-
ligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017
directed updates to Intelligence Community
Directive 731, Supply Chain Risk Manage-
ment, and Committee leadership has engaged
senior industry representatives about the
threats to the national security industrial
base posed by adversaries and competitors,
including China. Over the past few years, the
Department of Defense has been elevating se-
curity as a ‘‘fourth pillar’’ (to complement
cost, schedule, and performance) in review-
ing defense acquisitions, embodied in the
Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence’s
‘‘Deliver Uncompromised’’ initiative.
Section 5305 of the Act extends that focus
to the IC, requiring the annual Program
Management Plans to include security risks
in major system acquisitions, in addition to
cost, schedule, and performance. The Com-
mittees recognize that security can be ap-
plied across a number of areas (facilities,
personnel, information, and supply chain)
and may vary by program, to appropriately
ensure system integrity and mission assur-
ance.
Therefore, for the purposes of imple-
menting section 5305 of the Act, the Commit-
tees direct the Director of National Intel-
ligence, with the Director of the National
Counterintelligence and Security Center, to
develop parameters for including security
risks (and risk management measures) in the
annual Program Management Plans to assist
congressional oversight.
Intelligence Community Public-Private Talent
Exchange.
The Committees fully support section 5306
of Subdivision 1’s implementation in accord-
ance with applicable federal ethics laws, reg-
ulations, and policies.
Expansion of Scope of Protections for Identities
of Covert Agents.
Section 5303 of Subdivision 1 of the Act re-
moves temporal and geographic limitations
on the definition of ‘‘covert agent’’, as that
term was defined by Section 606 of the Intel-
ligence Identities Protection Act of 1982,
P.L. 97–200 (Jun. 23, 1982) (IIPA).
Such limitations originally carved out of
the IIPA unauthorized disclosures of certain
kinds of classified identity information—
those generally involving persons who have
not served or acted abroad in the last five
years—on grounds that such disclosures are
generally less harmful to national security,
and therefore undeserving of IIPA protec-
tions. But experience since then has proven
otherwise. With the benefit of experience,
the Committees have concluded that any dis-
closure of currently classified identity infor-
mation, without regard to the location or
recency of the activities of the person whose
information is disclosed, can risk serious
harm to national security. That being the
case, such disclosures should potentially
present a basis, under appropriate cir-
cumstances, for prosecution under the IIPA.
The Committees wish to stress, however,
that the change does not imply any en-
hanced risk of IIPA liability for journalists.
In the thirty-seven years since enactment,
the statute has never been used to prosecute
members of the media. In fact, prosecutors
have charged violations of the IIPA in only
two cases, both of which involved unauthor-
ized disclosures by former federal govern-
ment employees of classified information ob-
tained during their employment. The Com-
mittees view this spare record, so far as tra-
ditional newsgathering and publication is
concerned, as reflecting the heavy, con-
straining influence of the First Amend-
ment’s Press Clause. Journalists continue to
this day to report aggressively on intel-
ligence matters.
The IIPA’s enforcement history also re-
flects the narrowness of Section 601(c), a pro-
vision which some have interpreted to expose

traditional journalists to the risk of liability
under the statute. But in the Committees’
view, that provision does not cover respon-
sibly investigating and reporting news in the
public interest. There is a high burden for
conviction under Section 601(c). It requires a
prosecutor to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt, among other things, that a defendant
engaged in a ‘‘pattern of activities’’: a series
of acts with the common purpose or objec-
tive of identifying and publicly exposing cov-
ert agents. Such conduct entails ‘‘engag[ing]
in a purposeful enterprise of revealing covert
identities’’ or being in the ‘‘business of nam-
ing names,’’ as the Conference Report to the
IIPA put it in 1982. H.R. Rep. No. 97–580, at 9
(1982).
Traditional news gathering and publica-
tion—including on abuses of power, viola-
tions of law and civil liberties, and other
controversial activity—does not require, or
even typically involve, such conduct. Indeed,
as the Conferees illustrated the point:
The reporters who have investigated the
activities of Wilson and Terpil, former CIA
employees who allegedly supplied explosives
and terrorist training to Libya, would not be
covered even if they revealed the identity of
covert agents if their pattern of activities
was intended to investigate illegal or con-
troversial activities, and not to identify cov-
ert agents. Similarly, David Garrow would
not be within the scope of the statute even
though he purported to give the identity of
covert agents in his book, ‘‘The FBI and
Martin Luther King, Jr.: from ‘Solo’ to Mem-
phis.’’ His intent presumably was to explain
what drove the FBI to wiretap Martin Lu-
ther King and not to identify and expose cov-
ert agents.
H.R. Rep. No. 97–580, at 10. The same holds
true for traditional, responsible journalists
today. Even after amendments made by the
Act, their work does not risk liability under
the revised IIPA.
Furthermore, section 5303 has no effect on
what information may be withheld under the
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552
(FOIA). Section 5303 expands the universe of
‘‘covert agents’’ whose classified relation-
ship with the United States Government is
protected by the criminal law. All of the peo-
ple protected by the expanded ‘‘covert
agent’’ definition have a relationship with
the United States government that is al-
ready classified. If an individual’s relation-
ship with the government is classified, it
may be withheld under FOIA. Consequently,
even before passage of section 5303, identi-
fying information for all of the individuals
covered by the IIPA expansion could already
have been withheld under FOIA’s (b)(1) ex-
emption for national security information.
In general, when justifying withholding
under FOIA information that tends to iden-
tify covert agents, agencies should use (b)(1)
classification exemptions, not (b)(3) exemp-
tions regarding the IIPA and other statutes.
5 U.S.C. §§ 552(b)(1), (3).
Section 5303 is not intended to—and does
not—affect Congress’ authority to oversee
the IC. Section 5303 is not intended to—and
does not—affect the protections afforded to
whistleblowers to disclose violations of law
and waste, fraud, and abuse to Inspectors
General or to Congress.
Intelligence Community Cooperation with the
Government Accountability Office.
The Committees believe the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) adds significant
value to the Committees’ oversight efforts.
For example, the GAO’s designation in 2018
of the government-wide Personnel Security
Clearance process to its high-risk list of fed-
eral areas needing reform to prevent waste,
fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, was im-
portant to the Committees’ efforts to legis-
late on security clearance reform, including
in this Act. The Committees expect that all
IC elements will fully and promptly comply
with requests from the GAO made to support
studies requested by, or of interest to, the
Committees.
Clarification of Death Benefits for Survivors of
Central Intelligence Agency Personnel.
The Committees concur with the Executive
Branch that section 5341 of Subdivision 1 of
the Act shall apply retroactively from the
date of enactment of this Act.
Intelligence Community Leave Policies.
The Committees find it imperative that
the federal government, to include the IC, re-
cruit, hire, and retain a highly qualified
workforce. That depends in part on offering
federal personnel a competitive benefits
package—including with respect to parental
leave and related benefits. Toward that end,
the Committees strongly believe the federal
government must align such benefits to the
fullest extent possible with those of leading
U.S. private sector companies and other in-
dustrialized countries.
In furtherance of that objective, the Com-
mittees in their respective bills supported a
provision to provide twelve weeks of paid pa-
rental leave to all IC employees. The Com-
mittees further support the succeeding pro-
vision in the National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 that pro-
vides government employees, to include
those in the IC, with twelve weeks of paid
administrative leave in the event of birth of
a child, or the placement of a child for pur-
poses of adoptive or foster care. This is con-
sistent with, and supersedes, provisions that
were contained in the House-passed and Sen-
ate-passed Intelligence Authorization Acts
for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Impor-
tantly, that NDAA provision does not modify
or otherwise affect the eligibility of an IC
employee for benefits relating to leave under
any other provision of law, to include the
provisions of the Family and Medical Leave
Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq.
Moreover, so far as concerns the provi-
sion’s implementation, the Committees di-
rect the DNI, within 180 days after enact-
ment of this Act, to provide a briefing for
the Committees on how each element of the
IC will implement 5 U.S.C. section 6382(d)(2),
as provided by this Act.
Transfer of National Intelligence University.
The Committees have been closely watch-
ing the evolution of how the IC provides for
advanced intelligence education. The De-
fense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has hosted
an intelligence college since 1962, which has
been academically accredited since 1983.
When the ODNI was created in the Intel-
ligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention
Act of 2004, ODNI created a separate Na-
tional Intelligence University (NIU) under
its auspices as a complement to DIA’s intel-
ligence effort. In response to a report from
the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board
that accused the ODNI of being inadequately
focused, the ODNI in 2011 transferred the NIU
to DIA’s intelligence college and rebranded
the new combined institution as NIU.
Pursuant to the Joint Explanatory State-
ment to the Intelligence Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2017, an independent panel of-
fered alternative governance models to en-
hance NIU, to include a more prominent role
for ODNI. In parallel, analyses of DIA by the
Secretary of Defense and the HPSCI during
the 115th Congress concluded that DIA would
benefit from moving NIU elsewhere in the IC.
The Committees believe transferring NIU
to ODNI is now appropriate if certain condi-
tions, contained in section 5324 of Subdivi-
sion 1 of the Act, are met. The Committees
believe that clear commitment from the DNI
and Principal Deputy DNI is critical to NIU’s
success at ODNI. The Committees look for-
ward to working with ODNI and DoD on the
successful transfer of NIU.
Associate Degree Program Eligibility.
The Committees are concerned that stu-
dents enrolled in, or who have graduated
from, Associate Degree programs have insuf-
ficient opportunities to gain employment in
the IC. Therefore, the Committees direct the
ODNI to submit a report to the congressional
intelligence committees on how to expand
the number of opportunities for students
pursuing or having earned an Associate De-
gree eligible for IC academic programs. The
Committees also direct the ODNI to make
information about these academic programs
publicly available.
Exposing Predatory and Anticompetitive For-
eign Economic Influence.
The Committees are concerned about the
significant threat posed by foreign govern-
ments that engage in predatory and anti-
competitive behaviors aimed to undercut
critical sectors of the United States econ-
omy. Therefore, the Committees direct the
DNI, in consultation with the Assistant Sec-
retary of the Treasury for Intelligence and
Analysis, to submit to the congressional in-
telligence committees a report identifying
top countries that pose a substantial threat
to the United States economy regarding
technology transfer issues, predatory invest-
ment practices, economic espionage, and
other anticompetitive behaviors. The report
shall be submitted in unclassified form to
the greatest extent possible, but may include
a classified annex.
Furthermore, the DNI, in consultation
with the Department of the Treasury and
other agencies that the Director deems ap-
propriate, shall submit a report to the con-
gressional intelligence committees assessing
the costs and benefits of requiring a foreign
person or entity that invests in the United
States (and is subject to the jurisdiction of a
country that poses a substantial threat to
the United States economy) to submit an-
nual disclosures to the Federal Government.
Such disclosures would include all invest-
ments that the foreign person or entity made
in the United States during the preceding
year; the ownership structure of the entity;
and any affiliation of the entity with a for-
eign government. The report should detail
how such information could be used by the
IC and other elements of the Federal govern-
ment working to identify and combat foreign
threats to the United States economy, and
the appropriate scope and thresholds for
such disclosures. The report shall be sub-
mitted in unclassified form, but may include
a classified annex.
Increasing Data Security.
The Committees are aware the IC faces
challenges while trying to balance mission
and enterprise needs with IT modernization,
including the migration of data and applica-
tions to the cloud. With this in mind, the
Committees encourage the IC to identify and
utilize technologies that increase the secu-
rity posture of data and workloads and re-
duce cyber risks.
The Committees further recommend that:
1. IC elements identify, develop, and imple-
ment tools for bi-directional data migration
and division interoperability between data
center and cloud environments;
2. These tools include, but are not limited
to, encryption of data while both at rest and
in motion, and micro-segmentation of net-
works and workloads; and
3. IC elements prioritize shifting resources
towards automation as a way to respond
more quickly to cyber threats.

Anonymous Annual Survey Regarding Work-
place Climate.
IC elements obtain mission-critical infor-
mation from the results of anonymous, an-
nual surveys of their employees, on issues re-
lated to workplace climate and retention. As
necessary as they are to the elements’ own
activities, survey results are also vital to the
Committees’ continuing oversight of ele-
ments’ efforts to address workplace climate
and retention issues, and to propose legisla-
tive and other remedies where appropriate.
The need for reliable information is espe-
cially acute with respect to sexual harass-
ment and discrimination, given that—estab-
lished policy and legal protections notwith-
standing—an employee may fear that di-
rectly raising concerns about such matters
risks exposing the employee to retaliatory
personnel, security clearance, or other ac-
tions. The anonymous survey affords the ele-
ment, and the Committees, a mechanism for
inquiring further about the extent of this
well-documented chilling effect against re-
porting; and about the effectiveness (or not)
of ongoing programs to uncover and root out
sexual harassment, discrimination, and
other illegal and/or inappropriate activities
at the workplace.
Therefore, the Committees direct that no
later than 180 days after enactment of this
Act, the DNI must certify in writing to the
congressional intelligence committees that:
1. At least once a year, each element of the
IC submits a survey to its employees regard-
ing workplace climate and retention mat-
ters, and affords employees completing such
surveys the option to remain anonymous;
2. Such survey includes questions regard-
ing employees’ experiences with sexual as-
sault, discrimination, harassment, including
sexual harassment, and related retaliation,
including, at a minimum, the questions cov-
ering the following topics:
a. Have you witnessed sexual harassment
or sexual assault?
i. Did you report it?
ii. If not, why not?
b. Have you experienced sexual harassment
or sexual assault?
i. Did you report it?
ii. If not, why not?
c. Have you experienced retaliation for re-
porting harassment, discrimination, or sex-
ual assault?
i. Have you faced retribution for taking
leave for family, medical, or other personal
reasons?
ii. Did you fear retribution for taking
leave?
3. Each element includes in its survey
questions regarding the job series, position,
age, gender, race or ethnicity, field, and job
location at the time of the survey’s comple-
tion;
4. Each element tracks employees’ re-
sponses according to job series, position, age,
gender, race or ethnicity, field, and location
at the time of the survey’s completion; and
5. Each element reports the results of its
survey annually to the congressional intel-
ligence committees.
Report to Congress on the Representation of
Women and Minorities in the Workforce.
The Committees continue to strongly sup-
port IC efforts to identify, recruit, and retain
a highly diverse and highly qualified work-
force—including, in particular, its efforts to
increase the representation within elements
of the IC of women and minorities.
This is a data driven exercise. Bolstering
and adjusting IC workforce diversity pro-
grams depends in part on the Committees’
regularly obtaining current, detailed, and re-
liable information, and about specific mat-
ters relevant to the broader subject of work-
force diversity—such as rates and areas of
promotion of women and minority employ-
ees. However, some elements may produce
such information only from time to time;
others may make regular submissions to the
Committees but include only general infor-
mation.
Therefore, the Committees direct that
every six months, the head of each element
of the IC shall submit to the Committees a
written report that shall include, at a min-
imum:
1. The total number of women and minori-
ties hired by that element during the report-
ing period and a calculation of that figure as
a percentage of the agency’s total hiring for
that period;
2. The distribution of women and minori-
ties at that element by grade level and by
job series in the element’s total workforce
during the reporting period, together with
comparisons from the immediately preceding
two years;
3. The number of women and minorities
who applied for promotion at the element
and the final number selected for promotion
during the reporting period;
4. The proportion of the total workforce of
the element occupied by each group or class
protected by law, as of the last day of the re-
porting period;
5. The numbers of minorities and women
serving in positions at the element requiring
advanced, specialized training or certifi-
cation, as well as the proportion of the work-
force those groups occupy; and
6. To the extent that such element deploys
civilian employees to hazardous duty loca-
tions, the number of women and minority
employees who departed government service
subsequent to a deployment undertaken by
an employee in the previous two years.
Report on Geospatial Commercial Activities for
Basic and Applied Research and Develop-
ment.
The Committees direct the Director of the
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
(NGA), in coordination with the DNI, the Di-
rector of the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA), and the Director of the National Re-
connaissance Office (NRO), within 90 days of
enactment of this Act, to submit to the con-
gressional intelligence and defense commit-
tees a report on the feasibility, risks, costs,
and benefits of providing the private sector
and academia, on a need-driven and limited
basis—consistent with the protection of
sources and methods, as well as privacy and
civil liberties—access to data in the posses-
sion of the NGA for the purpose of assisting
the efforts of the private sector and aca-
demia in basic research, applied research,
data transfers, and the development of auto-
mation, artificial intelligence, and associ-
ated algorithms. Such report shall include:
1. Identification of any additional authori-
ties that the Director of NGA would require
to provide the private sector and academia
with access to relevant data on a need-driven
and limited basis, consistent with applicable
laws and procedures relating to the protec-
tion of sources, methods, privacy and civil
liberties; and
2. Market research to assess the commer-
cial and academic interest in such data and
determine likely private-sector entities and
institutions of higher education interested in
public-private partnerships relating to such
data.
NRO Contracting Restrictions.
The Committees continue to be very con-
cerned that NRO imposes unnecessary con-
tractual restrictions that prohibits or dis-
courages a contractor from contacting or
meeting with a congressional intelligence
committee or intelligence committee Mem-
ber offices. Therefore, the Committees direct
NRO to remove all restrictions that impacts
contractors from contacting or meeting with
the congressional intelligence committees or
member offices in all current and future con-
tracts to include pre-coordination with exec-
utive branch agencies.
Enhancing Automation at the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.
The Committees strongly support efforts
to leverage commercial advances in automa-
tion of imagery such as electro-optical, in-
frared, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI),
Full Motion Video (FMV), and Synthetic Ap-
erture Radar (SAR) products to reduce man-
ual processing and improve information flow
to users. However, the Committees are con-
cerned that NGA does not dedicate adequate
resources to integrate new automation tech-
niques, which have resulted in years of re-
search into the issue, but limited operation
gains during day-to-day imagery processing.
Therefore, the Committees direct NGA,
within 90 days of enactment of this Act, to
brief the congressional intelligence and de-
fense committees on an updated plan to re-
duce manual processing of imagery such as
electro-optical, infrared, WAMI, FMV, and
SAR to improve information flow to users.
The briefing shall also address:
1. NGA’s strategy to leverage commercial
advances;
2. The various GEOINT automated exploi-
tation development programs across the Na-
tional System for Geospatial-Intelligence,
and the associated funding and specific pur-
pose of said programs;
3. Any similar efforts by government enti-
ties outside the National System for
Geospatial-Intelligence of which NGA is
aware; and
4. Which of these efforts may be duplica-
tive.
Redundant Organic Software Development.
The Committees are concerned that NGA
is developing software solutions that are
otherwise available for purchase on the com-
mercial market. This practice often in-
creases the time it takes to deliver new ca-
pabilities to the warfighter; increases the
overall cost of the solution through expen-
sive operational and maintenance costs; and
undermines the U.S. software industrial
base.
Therefore, the Committees direct NGA,
within 60 days of enactment of this Act, to
brief the Committees, to identify all NGA
developed software programs and explain
why they are being developed organically in-
stead of leveraging commercially available
products.
Critical Skills Recruiting for Automation.
Although cutting edge sensors have pro-
vided the IC and Department of Defense with
exquisite imagery, full motion video (FMV),
and wide area motion imagery (WAMI), in-
telligence analysts are unable to keep pace
with the volume of data being generated.
This demands a transformation in the way
the intelligence enterprise processes, orga-
nizes, and presents data. For that reason, the
Committees fully support the NGA’s efforts
to attract, recruit, and retain a highly com-
petent workforce that can acquire and inte-
grate new data automation tools.
Therefore, the Committees direct NGA,
within 60 days of enactment of this Act, to
brief the congressional intelligence and de-
fense committees on NGA’s efforts to recruit
critical skills such as mathematicians, data
scientists, and software engineers that pos-
sess critical skills needed to support NGA’s
objectives in automation.
Common Sensitive Compartmented Information
Facility.

eral major impediments to companies per-

like the NRO. For example, businesses with-
out ownership of a SCIF find it very difficult
to perform classified work. Additionally,
these small businesses are challenged with
basic obstacles such as becoming aware of
classified work opportunities because it is
difficult to obtain access to the IC’s and
DoD’s classified marketplaces such as the
Acquisition Resource Center (ARC). Con-
struction and accreditation of SCIF spaces is
cost-prohibitive for small business and non-
traditional government contractors. Addi-
tionally, construction timeline often exceeds
the period of performance of a contract.
A modern trend for innovative and non-
traditional government contractors is the in-
creased use of co-working space environ-
ments. Additionally, public and private enti-
ties are partnering to create emerging re-
gional innovation hubs to help identify tech-
nology solutions and products in the private
sector that can be utilized by the IC and
DoD. These innovation hubs currently
produce an agile, neutral, but largely unclas-
sified development environment.
Therefore, the Committees direct the DNI,
within 90 days of enactment of this Act, to
brief the congressional intelligence commit-
tees on the following:
1. Steps necessary to establish new ‘Com-
mon SCIFs’ in areas of high demand;
2. What approaches allow for SCIF spaces
to be certified and accredited outside of a
traditional contractual arrangement;
3. Analysis of the advantages and disadvan-
tages of issuing Department of Defense Con-
tract Security Specification (DD Form 254s)
to ‘‘Facilities,’’ as opposed to ‘‘Contracts’’;
4. Options for classified co-use and shared
workspace environments such as: innova-
tion, incubation, catalyst, and accelerator
environments;
5. Pros and cons for public, private, govern-
ment, or combination owned classified neu-
tral facilities; and
6. Any other opportunities to support those
without ownership of a SCIF effective access
to a neutral SCIF.
Improving Use of the Unclassified Marketplaces.
Another area where the Committees have
become aware of major impediments for
companies to perform work for agencies and
organizations like the NRO are unclassified
marketplaces such as the Acquisition Re-
source Center (ARC). Instead of posting data
to unclassified marketplaces, unclassified
NRO postings often refer to the classified
side for critical yet unclassified information.
If the NRO is serious about embracing com-
mercial innovation, unclassified market-
place postings should remain on the unclas-
sified side.
Therefore, the Committees direct NRO,
within 90 days of enactment of this Act, to
brief the Committees on options for improv-
ing the unclassified marketplace process.
Satellite Servicing.
No later than one year after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the DNI, in consulta-
tion with the Secretary of Defense, shall
jointly provide the to the congressional in-
telligence and defense committees a briefing
detailing the costs, risks, and operational
benefits of leveraging commercial satellite
servicing capabilities for national security
satellite systems. The briefing shall include
the following:
1. A prioritized list, with a rationale, of
operational and planned assets of the Intel-
ligence Community that could be enhanced
by satellite servicing missions;
2. The costs, risks, and benefits of inte-
grating satellite servicing capabilities as
part of operational resilience; and
3. Potential strategies that could allow fu-
ture national security space systems to le-
verage commercial in-orbit servicing capa-
bilities where appropriate and feasible.
Commercial RF Mapping and SAR.
U.S. commercial companies are now offer-
ing space-based geolocation and geospatial
intelligence (GEOINT) analysis of radio fre-
quency (RF) emitters as well as synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) products. These compa-
nies can identify, locate, and analyze pre-
viously undetected activity, providing new
insights for U.S. national security and de-
fense. The IC currently has contracts that le-
verage commercial electro-optical satellites,
however it does not have a program in place
to take full advantage of these emerging
commercial space-based RF GEOINT and
SAR capabilities.
Therefore, the Committees direct the NRO
and NGA to brief the Committees on how it
will leverage these commercial companies in
Fiscal Year 2020 and beyond, to include fund-
ing for, as well as testing and evaluation ef-
forts.
Commercial Remote Sensing.
The Committees support efforts to estab-
lish a light-touch regulatory structure that
enables the rapidly evolving commercial
space-based imagery, RF sensing, and radar
industry markets to promote U.S. leadership
in these areas. However, the Committees
also support the needs of the U.S. Govern-
ment to protect both IC and DoD personnel
and assets. The Committees believe there
can be a balance that supports both national
security interests and the promotion of U.S.
innovation and leadership.
Therefore, the Committees direct the DNI,
in consultation with the Secretary of De-
fense, to brief the Committees within 60 days
of the date of enactment of the Act, on ef-
forts that help address this balance and
which streamline the IC and DoD involve-
ment in the rapidly evolving U.S. commer-
cial space-based imagery, RF sensing, and
radar industries.
Deception Detection Techniques.
The U.S. Government does not have suffi-
cient security screening capabilities avail-
able to determine deception in individuals
that intend to harm the United States. The
polygraph has been an effective investigative
tool to detect deception, but the cost and
time required to administer a polygraph ex-
amination is a major cause for security
clearance backlogs, and often limits the fre-
quency of periodic examinations to every 5–
7 years. Entities within DoD and the IC in-
cluding DIA, Special Operations Command,
NGA, Defense Counterintelligence and Secu-
rity Agency, U.S. Air Force and others have
expressed a desire to begin piloting new sys-
tems such as ocular deception detection sys-
tems. However, progress is being hindered by
DoD Directive 5210.91 and ODNI Security
Agent Directive 2, which direct some over-
sight of new deception detection tech-
nologies to the DoD National Center of
Credibility Assessment (NCCA), which does
not have sufficient budget or other resources
to expeditiously evaluate non-polygraph
technologies.
Therefore, the Committees direct the DNI
in coordination with the DoD to provide the
congressional intelligence and defense com-
mittees with a briefing on what steps they
are taking to ensure pilot programs are es-
tablished to evaluate these new technologies
to help reduce our backlog, improve effi-
ciency, and reduce overall cost. Pilot pro-
grams shall evaluate current and emerging
technologies to efficiently and rapidly verify
the accuracy and truthfulness of statements
of candidates for employment within the
DoD/IC, including for interim security clear-
ances, for periodic screening of cleared DoD/
IC personnel, to screen foreign national col-
laborators and contractors overseas to pre-
vent ‘‘Green-on-Blue’’ attacks, for immigra-
tion screening and for other purposes.
List of Foreign Entities That Pose a Threat to
Critical Technologies.
The Committees direct the DNI, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of Defense, to
identify, compose, and maintain a list of for-
eign entities, including governments, cor-
porations, nonprofit and for-profit organiza-
tions, and any subsidiary or affiliate of such
an entity, that the Director determines pose
a threat of espionage with respect to critical
technologies or research projects, including
research conducted at institutions of higher
education.
Maintenance of this list will be critical to
ensuring the security of the most sensitive
projects relating to U.S. national security,
such as defense and intelligence-related re-
search projects. The initial list shall be
available to the head of each qualified agen-
cy funding applicable projects and will in-
clude the following entities already identi-
fied as threatening: Huawei Technologies
Company, ZTE Corporation, Hytera Commu-
nications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision
Digital Technology Company, Dahua Tech-
nology Company, and Kaspersky Lab. The
DNI and the Secretary of Defense, or a dele-
gate from each agency, shall brief the find-
ings to the congressional intelligence and de-
fense committees no later than 180 days after
the enactment of the Act.
Protection of National Security Research.
The Committees believe that institutes of
higher learning, laboratories, and other enti-
ties and organizations play critical roles in
advancing national security within the U.S.
science and technology ecosystem that is
charged with delivering the best capabilities
to the warfighter in the near, mid, and long-
term. The Committees understand that near-
peer competitors such as China and Russia
attempt to exploit and benefit from the open
and collaborative global research environ-
ment created by the Reagan Administra-
tion’s National Security Decision Directive
189 on the National Policy on the transfer of
Scientific, Technical and Engineering Infor-
mation. This directive established that the
products of ‘‘fundamental research’’—defined
as ‘‘basic and applied research in science and
engineering, the results of which ordinarily
are published and shared’’—should remain
unrestricted.
The Committees are also aware that aca-
demia is not always kept apprised by the
interagency of a complete picture of poten-
tial activities and threats in the research
community, such as improper technology
transfer, intellectual property theft, and
cyber-attacks directly attributed to nation-
state governments. Elsewhere in this bill and
report, the Committees include measures to
promote increased information sharing
across the interagency and with academia.
Therefore, the Committees direct the Sec-
retary of Defense to provide the congres-
sional intelligence and defense committees,
within 90 days of enactment of the Act, a re-
port listing Chinese and Russian academic
institutions that have a history of improper
technology transfer, intellectual property
theft, cyber espionage, or operate under the
direction of their respective armed forces or
intelligence agencies. The report should be
in unclassified form, but may contain a clas-
sified annex.
Investments in Scientific and Technological In-
telligence.
The Committees remain interested in the
continued efforts of the DoD to improve sci-
entific and technological intelligence (S&TI)
capabilities and tradecraft across the De-
fense Intelligence Enterprise (DIE). The
Committees recognize S&TI is critical to
strategic competition with near-peer com-
petitors by ensuring comprehensive under-
standing of adversary capabilities and abil-
ity to inform development of joint force

fifth-generation advanced weapons systems
and other emerging technologies.
Therefore, the Committees direct the
USD(I) in collaboration with the Director of
the DIA, to provide a briefing to the Com-
mittees and the congressional defense com-
mittees within 75 days of enactment of the
Act, on the alignment of current and planned
DIE S&TI investments and activities to DoD
operational and strategic requirements.
The briefing shall also include information
on how the DoD will continue the matura-
tion of S&TI capabilities and tradecraft
across the DIE.
Intelligence Support to Defense Operations in
the Information Environment.
The Committees support DoD efforts to
improve capabilities and tradecraft to oper-
ate in the information environment. The
Committees are concerned about the Defense
Intelligence Enterprise’s (DIE) ability to
provide the information operations commu-
nity with all-source intelligence support,
consistent with the support provided to oper-
ations in other domains.
Therefore, the Committees direct the
USD(I), in coordination with the Joint
Staff’s Director for Intelligence and the DNI,
to provide a briefing to the congressional in-
telligence and defense committees within 30
days of enactment of the Act, on intelligence
support to information operations. The brief-
ing should include standardized defense in-
telligence lexicon for intelligence prepara-
tion of the battlefield for information oper-
ations, efforts to develop a process to ensure
the full scope of emerging defense informa-
tion operations threat requirements are
structured to be addressed through the en-
tirety of DIE capabilities, and how the DIE
perceives the future of defense operations in
the information environment.
The briefing shall also include a descrip-
tion of how the IC, through the National In-
telligence Priorities Framework, will ac-
count for a more dynamic use of defense in-
telligence capabilities to augment and en-
hance support to DoD operations in the in-
formation environment.
ROTC IC Recruitment Trial Program.
The Senior Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps (ROTC) program, with units or affili-
ates at approximately 1,600 U.S. colleges and
universities, is DoD’s largest commissioning
source, providing approximately 6,500 new
active duty officers to the military each
year.
Officer candidates enrolled in ROTC pro-
grams must meet all graduation require-
ments of their academic institutions, enroll
in military, naval, or aerospace education
courses, and attend summer military train-
ing, making them ideal candidates for IC
placement. Currently, ROTC cadets only
have the option to utilize their training by
joining one of the military services. The
Committees believe the government can find
cost savings and provide a wider range of op-
portunities to ROTC recruits by leveraging
the ROTC’s existing training program for the
IC.
Therefore, the Committees direct the
USD(I), in coordination with ODNI, to con-
duct a feasibility study on creating a path-
way for ROTC recruits to find employment
in the IC, on a reimbursable basis. The study
should examine:
1. Pros and cons of instituting an ROTC IC
recruitment pipeline;
2. Approximate reimbursement cost per re-
cruit; and
3. Legislative requirements for program
execution.
The Committees direct that the study re-
sults be submitted via report to the Commit-
tees and the congressional defense commit-
tees within 90 days of enactment of the Act.
Explosive Ordinance Disposal Intelligence.
The Committees are concerned that the ex-
pertise of Explosive Ordinance Disposal
(EOD) personnel is not adequately acces-
sible and therefore, not sufficiently utilized
by the Defense Intelligence Enterprise and
IC to provide the combatant commands with
the required intelligence to identify, combat,
and deter violent extremism and other asym-
metric threats.
Explosive ordnance includes all munitions,
improvised explosive devices, devices con-
taining explosives, propellants, nuclear fis-
sion or fusion materials, biological, and
chemical agents. The primary consumer of
this information are military tactical explo-
sive ordnance disposal units that employ the
data for threat identification and neutraliza-
tion. However, the required analysis to de-
termine appropriate render-safe capabilities
requires operational and strategic intel-
ligence to process and analyze the data, and
data management processes to promulgate
the resulting information. The Committees
believe DoD should modernize the processes
and procedures to more comprehensively
track, manage, and coordinate the capability
and capacity of EOD intelligence within the
IC and the DIE to support all levels of
render-safe capabilities.
Therefore, the Committees direct the
USD(I), in coordination with the ODNI, to
provide a briefing to the congressional intel-
ligence and defense committees within 120
days of enactment of the Act on the capa-
bility and capacity of EOD intelligence ex-
pertise across the DIE and IC. The briefing
shall include:
1. An assessment of the coordination and
integration of defense and national intel-
ligence capabilities against EOD intelligence
requirements, to include a mitigation strat-
egy to address any identified gaps or defi-
ciencies, information-sharing challenges, or
any other impediments to integration of
EOD expertise across the defense and intel-
ligence communities; and
2. An assessment of the technical skills
needed to address EOD intelligence require-
ments, while identifying any gaps or defi-
ciencies in current personnel hiring and
training structures, and a long-term plan to
develop proficiency of EOD intelligence ex-
pertise in the defense and intelligence com-
munities.
Information-Sharing Arrangements with India,
Japan, and the Republic of Korea.
International alliances and partnerships
are critical to the pursuit and sustainment
of the United States national security objec-
tives, built upon foundations of shared val-
ues and intent. The Committees recognize
the importance of the DoD sharing informa-
tion with international allies and partners in
support of the planning and execution of the
National Defense Strategy, as allies and
third-party international partners enhance
strategic stability across the Department’s
purview while increasing effectiveness of op-
erations. The Committees believe the mecha-
nisms to share information across the ‘‘Five
Eyes’’ alliance continue to mature through
established exercises, exchange of personnel,
and virtual data sharing, while that coopera-
tion is potentially less robust with third-
party partners.
The Committees support the roles and con-
tributions of third-party partners such as
India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and
recognizes their ongoing contribution toward
maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-
Pacific region. The Committees are inter-
ested in understanding the policies and pro-
cedures governing the collaboration and in-
formation sharing with India, Japan, the Re-
public of Korea, and the ‘‘Five Eyes’’ allies,
and whether opportunities exist to strength-
en those arrangements.
Therefore, the Committees direct the
Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence
(USD(I)), in coordination with the ODNI, to
provide a briefing to the congressional intel-
ligence and defense committees within 60
days of enactment of the Act, on the bene-
fits, challenges, and risks of broadening the
information-sharing mechanisms between
India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the
‘‘Five Eyes’’ allies.
Transitioning the Function of Background In-
vestigations to the Department of Defense.
Executive Order 13869 transitions the back-
ground investigation functions of the Fed-
eral Government from the Office of Per-
sonnel Management (OPM), National Back-
ground Investigations Bureau, to the DoD,
Defense Counterintelligence and Security
Agency. The Committees recognize the im-
portance of ensuring timely and efficient
background investigations to overcome
workforce staffing challenges of cleared indi-
viduals across the whole of government and
private sector, and to vet personnel who
come into contact with the Department’s
personnel, installations, and technology. The
Committees are aware of the temporary es-
tablishment of the Personnel Vetting Trans-
formation Office in the OUSD(I) to manage
the transition of this activity from OPM to
the Department and improve the processes
and procedures related to vetting personnel
for clearances across the whole of govern-
ment and private sector.
However, the Committees are concerned
about the potential risks to personnel man-
agement and mission such a transfer may
present, and believes that appropriate pro-
tections of civil liberties and privacy must
be prioritized throughout the transition,
through the implementation of modern and
efficient vetting measures. The Committees
recognize the Department’s leadership,
through sharing best practices with ODNI, in
reforming the vetting process using modern
techniques such as continuous evaluation,
and expects regular updates on the Depart-
ment’s progress in addressing the current
background investigations backlog.
Therefore, the Committees direct the
USD(I), in coordination with the Director of
the Defense Counterintelligence and Secu-
rity Agency, to provide a briefing to the con-
gressional intelligence and defense commit-
tees within 90 days of enactment of the Act,
on how the DoD will transfer the background
investigation mission and establish an effec-
tive personnel vetting capability to provide
for the security of the Department, while
maintaining the civil liberties and privacy
protections of personnel under consideration
to receive a clearance.
Joint Intelligence Operations Center Staffing.
The Committees recognize the evolving
operational and strategic priorities of the
DoD will impact Defense Intelligence Enter-
prise capabilities and resources. The Com-
mittees recognize the ongoing efforts by the
USD(I) to comply with direction specified by
the John. S. McCain National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law
115–232) to reduce and prevent imbalances in
priorities and mitigate against insufficient
or misaligned resources within the Defense
Intelligence Enterprise.
While the Committees support the efforts
by the USD(I) to create efficiencies across
the Defense Intelligence Enterprise organiza-
tions, to include the Service Intelligence
Centers and combatant command Joint Op-
erations Intelligence Centers, and enable
those elements to plan and posture staffing
requirements accordingly, the Committees
are concerned that the shifts in current and
future resourcing lack coherence to support
the global mandate of the Department.
Therefore, the Committees direct the
USD(I), in coordination with DIA, to provide

actment of the Act on how the OUSD(I) and
DIA are managing resourcing requirements
to the combatant command Joint Intel-
ligence Operations Centers to meet current
and future needs of the combatant com-
manders and DoD.
China’s Biological Weapons Program.
The Committees remain interested in en-
suring the Defense Intelligence Enterprise is
providing timely, accurate, and effective in-
telligence to support information needs of
the DoD, and are aware of a recent GAO re-
port on long-range emerging threats facing
the United States that highlighted potential
pursuit by near-peer competitors of biologi-
cal weapons using genetic engineering and
synthetic biology.
Therefore, the Committees direct the
USD(I), in coordination with the Director of
the DIA, to provide a briefing to the congres-
sional intelligence and defense committees
within 30 days of enactment of the Act with
an assessment of China’s current and pro-
jected biological weapons program, the risks
presented to the joint force, and the mitiga-
tion strategies to protect U.S. military
forces against said threats.
Machine-assisted Analytic Rapid Repository
System Government Accountability Office
Review.
The re-emergence of great power competi-
tion will stress DIA’s ability to provide
foundational military intelligence for the IC
and warfighters. As such, the Committees
are supportive of DIA’s intent to replace the
Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB)
with the Machine-assisted Analytic Rapid
Repository System (MARS).
However, the Committees are concerned
that MARS’s development and procurement
will entail a complex and extensive trans-
formation that will impact the DIA’s deliv-
ery of foundational military intelligence.
Therefore, the Committees direct the GAO
to provide a report to the congressional in-
telligence and defense committees within
one year of enactment of the Act that de-
scribes:
1. The envisioned users and customer base
and how they will use MARS;
2. An assessment of the transition plan
from MIDB to MARS with input from cur-
rent and historic MIDB users, as well as cus-
tomers;
3. An assessment of the resources nec-
essary to fully implement MARS, to include
funding and personnel implications;
4. An assessment of DIA’s acquisition
strategy for MARS to include the use of any
rapid acquisition or prototyping authorities;
and
5. The challenges DIA has identified that it
will face in transitioning from MIDB to
MARS and whether its migration plans are
sufficient for addressing these challenges.
The Committees expect DIA’s full coopera-
tion with the GAO study.
Update on the DIA Strategic Approach.
In September 2018, the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA) adopted a Strategic Approach
to enhance workforce development, improve
foundational military intelligence data man-
agement, address perennial intelligence
issues and realign roles and missions. Im-
provements in these issue areas will enhance
the Agency’s ability to support both the Na-
tional Security Strategy and National De-
fense Strategy.
The Committees support the DIA’s initia-
tive to improve those structures it assesses
are critical to providing warfighters the in-
formation needed to prevent and, if nec-
essary, decisively win wars, such as intel-
ligence on foreign militaries’ capabilities.
Therefore, the Committees direct DIA to
provide quarterly briefings, beginning 45
days after enactment of the Act, to the con-
gressional intelligence and defense commit-
tees on its efforts to enhance workforce de-
velopment, improve foundational military
intelligence data management, address pe-
rennial intelligence issues, and realign roles
and missions.

UNCLASSIFIED DIRECTION RELATED TO
SUBDIVISION 2
Management of Intelligence Community Work-
force.
The Committees repeat direction from the
Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2017 that IC elements should build, de-
velop, and maintain a workforce appro-
priately balanced among its civilian, mili-
tary, and contractor workforce sectors to
meet the missions assigned to it in law and
by the president. Starting in Fiscal Year
2019, the Committees no longer authorize po-
sition ceiling levels in the annual Schedule
of Authorizations.
The Committees look forward to working
with the ODNI as it develops an implementa-
tion strategy and sets standards for work-
force cost analysis tools.
Countering Russian Propaganda.
The Committees support the IC’s role in
countering Russian propaganda and other ac-
tive measures. The Committees are com-
mitted to providing the appropriate legal au-
thorities, financial resources, and personnel
necessary to address these hostile acts. The
Committees specifically find that language
capabilities are important to the IC’s efforts
in countering Russia’s hostile acts. The
Committees encourage the IC to commit
considerable resources in the future to bol-
stering officers’ existing Russian language
skills, recruiting Russian language speakers,
and training officers in Russian, in par-
ticular key technical language skills. This
effort will require strategic planning both in
recruiting and rotating officers through lan-
guage training. The Committees expect to
see these priorities reflected in future IC
budget requests.
Protection of the Supply Chain in Intelligence
Community Acquisition Decisions.
The Committees continue to have signifi-
cant concerns about risks to the supply
chain in IC acquisitions. The Committees en-
courage the Supply Chain and Counterintel-
ligence Risk Management Task Force rec-
ommendations to support continued efforts
to develop an open, interoperable informa-
tion security-sharing platform to enable
real-time cross-domain sharing for the IC to
effectively share and analyze information on
supply chain, cybersecurity vulnerabilities,
and counterintelligence risks.
The report to accompany the Intelligence
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 di-
rected the DNI to review and consider
changes to Intelligence Community Direc-
tive (ICD) 801 (‘‘Acquisition’’) to reflect the
issuance of ICD 731 (‘‘Supply Chain Risk
Management’’) in 2013 and the issues associ-
ated with cybersecurity. It specifically rec-
ommended the review examine whether to:
expand risk management criteria in the ac-
quisition process to include cyber and supply
chain threats; require counterintelligence
and security assessments as part of the ac-
quisition and procurement process; propose
and adopt new education requirements for
acquisition professionals on cyber and supply
chain threats; and factor in the cost of cyber
and supply chain security. This review was
due in November 2017, with a report on the
process for updating ICD 801 in December
2017. The report was completed on June 18,
2018.
As a follow-on to this review, the Commit-
tees direct DNI to address three other con-
siderations: changes in the Federal Acquisi-
tion Regulation that may be necessary; how
changes should apply to all acquisition pro-
grams; and how security risks must be ad-
dressed across development, procurement,
and operational phases of acquisition. The
Committees further direct the DNI to submit
a plan to implement necessary changes with-
in 60 days of completion of this review.
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency use of
VERA and VSIP Authorities.
The Committees encourage the use by the
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
(NGA) of Voluntary Early Retirement Au-
thority (VERA) and Voluntary Separation
Incentive Program (VSIP) offers to meet fu-
ture goals of building a workforce more at-
tuned to automation of data production, au-
tomation of analytic processes, and estab-
lishment of development and operations
(DevOps) software development processes.
Therefore, the Committees direct the NGA
to report to the Committees, within 120 days
of enactment of the Act, on its use to date of
VERA and VSIP incentives, to include how
they have been used to develop an acquisi-
tion cadre skilled in ‘‘DevOps’’ software de-
velopment processes, as well as a plan for
further use of these incentives. The report
should specify metrics for retooling its
workforce, including how it measures data
literacy and computational skills in poten-
tial hires, and an accounting of the numbers
of new hires who have met these higher
standards.
Report on Engagement of National Reconnais-
sance Office with University Community.
The Committees recognize that the surviv-
ability and resiliency of United States sat-
ellites is critically important to the United
States intelligence and defense communities.
While the NRO engages with the university
community in support of basic research and
developing an education workforce pipeline
to help advance new technologies and
produce skilled professionals, it can do more
in this regard to focus on space surviv-
ability.
Therefore, the Committees direct the NRO
to report, within 120 days of enactment of
the Act, on NRO’s current efforts and future
strategies to engage with university partners
that are strategically located, host secure
information facilities, and offer a strong en-
gineering curriculum, with a particular focus
on space survivability and resiliency. This
report should provide a summary of NRO’s
current and planned university engagement
programs, levels of funding, and program re-
search and workforce objectives and metrics.
The report should also include an assessment
of the strategic utility of chartering a Uni-
versity Affiliated Research Center in this do-
main.
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Facili-
ties.
Consistent with section 2401 of the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2019, the Committees authorize the
President’s request for $447.8 million in Fis-
cal Year 2019 for phase two construction ac-
tivities of the Next National Geospatial-In-
telligence Agency West (N2W) facility in St.
Louis, Missouri. The Committees are pleased
that the second phase of this $837.2 million
project was included in the Fiscal Year 2019
President’s budget.
Clarification of Oversight Responsibilities.
The Committees reinforce the requirement
for all IC agencies funded by the NIP to re-
spond in a full, complete, and timely manner
to any request for information made by a
member of the congressional intelligence
committees. In addition, the Committees di-
rect the DNI to issue guidelines, within 90
days of enactment of the Act, to ensure that
the intent of section 501 of the National Se-
curity Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3091) is carried
out.
Clarification on Cooperation with Investigation
on Russian Influence in the 2016 Election.
The Committees continue to reinforce the
obligation for all IC agencies to cooperate in
a full, complete, and timely manner with the
Committees’ ongoing investigations into
Russian meddling in the 2016 Presidential
election and cooperation with the declas-
sification process.
Supervisory Feedback as Part of Continuous
Vetting Program.
The Committees direct the DNI to review
the results of ongoing pilot programs regard-
ing the use of supervisory feedback as part of
the periodic reinvestigation and continuous
vetting process and report, within 180 days of
enactment of the Act, on the establishment
of a policy for its use across the IC.
National Security Threats to Critical Infrastruc-
ture.
The Committees are aware of significant
threats to our critical infrastructure and in-
dustrial control systems posed by foreign ad-
versaries. The sensitive nature of the infor-
mation related to these threats make the
role of the IC of vital importance to United
States defensive efforts. The Committees
have grave concerns that current IC re-
sources dedicated to analyzing and coun-
tering these threats are neither sufficient
nor closely coordinated. The Committees in-
clude provisions within this legislation to
address these concerns.
Framework for Cybersecurity and Intelligence
Collection Doctrine.
The Committees direct the ODNI, in co-
ordination with appropriate IC elements, to
develop an analytic framework that could
support the eventual creation and execution
of a Government-wide cybersecurity and in-
telligence collection doctrine. The ODNI
shall provide this framework, which may
contain a classified annex, to the congres-
sional intelligence committees, within 180
days of enactment of the Act.
This framework shall include:
1. An assessment of the current and me-
dium-term cyber threats to the protection of
the United States’ national security systems
and critical infrastructure;
2. IC definitions of key cybersecurity con-
cepts, to include cyberespionage, cyber theft,
cyber acts of aggression, and cyber deter-
rence;
3. Intelligence collection requirements to
ensure identification of cyber actors tar-
geting U.S. national security interests, and
to inform policy responses to cyber-attacks
and computer network operations directed
against the United States;
4. The IC’s methodology for assessing the
impacts of cyber-attacks and computer net-
work operations incidents directed against
the United States, taking into account dif-
fering levels of severity of incidents;
5. Capabilities that the IC could employ in
response to cyber-attacks and computer net-
work operations incidents, taking into ac-
count differing levels of severity of inci-
dents;
6. A policy and architecture for sharing cy-
bersecurity-related intelligence with govern-
ment, private sector, and international part-
ners, including existing statutory and other
authorities which may be exercised in pur-
suit of that goal; and
7. Any necessary changes in IC authorities,
governance, technology, resources, and pol-
icy to provide more capable and agile cyber-
security.

S7098 December 17, 2019
Inspector General of the Intelligence Community
Role and Responsibilities.
The position of the Inspector General of
the Intelligence Community (IC IG) was
codified by the Intelligence Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2010. Among other
things, the IC IG’s statutory purposes in-
clude ‘‘conduct[ing] independent reviews in-
vestigations, inspections, audits, and reviews
on programs and activities within the re-
sponsibility and authority of the Director of
National Intelligence;’’ keeping the Commit-
tees fully and currently informed of signifi-
cant problems and deficiencies; and leading
efforts of inspectors general within the IC.
The Committees have included provisions
intended to strengthen the IC IG’s role. The
Committees will insist on full cooperation
from the Director, ODNI offices, as well as
those of inspectors general across the IC, in
ensuring that the IC IG’s prescribed func-
tions are carried out to the fullest extent
possible. The Committees further reiterate
Congress’s intent that the IC IG is obligated
to identify and inform the Committees of
significant problems and deficiencies ‘‘relat-
ing to’’ all intelligence programs and activi-
ties.
The Committees also remain seriously con-
cerned about the undermining of protections
and rights afforded to whistleblowers within
the IC and the level of insight congressional
committees have into the handling of lawful
disclosures. Without exception, the Commit-
tees must be made aware of lawful disclo-
sures made to any inspector general within
the IC, consistent with provisions added to
Title 50 by sections 5331–5335 of Subdivision 1
of the Act; and of all lawful disclosures made
pursuant to ICWPA and Title 50 procedures,
which Intelligence Community personnel in-
tend to be submitted to the Committees. The
Committees underscore in the strongest
terms that all elements of the IC are obli-
gated, as a categorical matter, to comply
with both existing law as well as direction
provided elsewhere in the Act and this Ex-
planation, with respect to inspector general
and whistleblower matters.
Space Launch Facilities.
The Committees continue to believe it is
critical to preserve a variety of launch range
capabilities to support national security
space missions, and encourage planned
launches such as the U.S. Air Force Orbital/
Sub-Orbital Program (OSP)-3 NRO–111 mis-
sion, to be launched in 2019 on a Minotaur 1
from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at
Wallops Flight Facility. In the Intelligence
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, the
Committees directed a brief from the ODNI,
in consultation with the DoD and the U.S.
Air Force, on their plans to utilize state-
owned and operated spaceports, which lever-
age non-federal public and private invest-
ments to bolster United States launch capa-
bilities and provide access to mid-to-low or
polar-to-high inclination orbits for national
security missions.
The Committees direct that the ODNI sup-
plement this brief with how state invest-
ments in these spaceports may support infra-
structure improvements, such as payload in-
tegration and launch capabilities, for na-
tional security launches.
Acquisition Research Center Postings.
The Committees support a flexible NRO ac-
quisition process that allows the NRO to
choose the most appropriate contracting
mechanism, whether for small research and
development efforts or large acquisitions.
The NRO’s Acquisition Research Center
(ARC), a classified contracting and solicita-
tion marketplace that NRO and other agen-
cies use, enables this flexible acquisition
process for classified efforts.
The Committees direct the NRO, within 60
days of enactment of the Act, to brief the
congressional intelligence and defense com-
mittees on options for modifying ARC post-
ing procedures to ensure fair and open com-
petition. Those options should include ensur-
ing that unclassified NRO solicitations are
posted on the unclassified FEDBIZOPS
website, and identifying ways to better uti-
lize the ARC to encourage contract opportu-
nities for a more diverse industrial base that
includes smaller and non-traditional compa-
nies.
Ensuring Strong Strategic Analytical
Tradecraft.
The Department of Homeland Security’s
(DHS’s) Office of Intelligence and Analysis
(I&A) has taken steps to improve the quality
of its analysis, to identify its core cus-
tomers, and to tailor its production to meet
customer needs. The Committees concur
with I&A’s implementation of analytic
standards and review mechanisms that have
improved the tradecraft behind I&A prod-
ucts. The bedrock of these efforts has been
the development of a yearly program of anal-
ysis (POA) and key intelligence questions,
which are essential tools for providing a
roadmap and boundaries for the office’s pro-
duction efforts.
Therefore, the Committees direct the Of-
fice of I&A to continue to prioritize, develop
and hone its strategic intelligence capabili-
ties and production, including the annual de-
velopment of a POA. Within 90 day of enact-
ment of the Act, and on an annual basis
thereafter for two years, I&A shall brief the
congressional intelligence committees on
the development and execution of its POA.
These briefings should provide an overview
of the POA, how customer needs have been
incorporated into the POA, and an update on
execution against the POA.
Cyber/Counterintelligence Analysis.
DHS’s Office of I&A’s Counterintelligence
Mission Center analysis focuses on counter-
intelligence threats posed by foreign tech-
nology companies and fills a gap in IC intel-
ligence production. Advanced technologies
are increasingly ubiquitous and necessary to
the function of modern society. Con-
sequently, the scope of the threats from
countries intent on using these technologies
as a vector for collecting intelligence from
within the United States will continue to ex-
pand. The Office of I&A is positioned to con-
duct a niche analysis critical to national se-
curity that combines foreign intelligence
with domestic threat information.
The Committees strongly support I&A’s
Counterintelligence Mission Center’s contin-
ued focus on these topics and the increased
resources dedicated to this analysis in Fiscal
Year 2019. Therefore, the Committees direct
the I&A, in coordination with ODNI, to pro-
vide an update within 90 days of enactment
of the Act on its recent analytic production
related to counterintelligence threats posed
by foreign technology companies, including
a review of the countries and companies that
present the greatest risks in this regard.
Intelligence Support to the Export Control Proc-
ess.
The Committees have significant concerns
that China poses a growing threat to United
States national security, due in part to its
relentless efforts to acquire United States
technology. China purposely blurs the dis-
tinction between its military and civilian ac-
tivities through its policy of ‘‘military-civil-
ian fusion,’’ which compounds the risks of di-
version of United States technology to the
Chinese military.
The Committees conclude that the United
States Government currently lacks a com-
prehensive policy and the tools needed to ad-
dress this problem. China exploits weak-
nesses in existing U.S. mechanisms aimed at
preventing dangerous technology transfers,
including the U.S. export control system,
which is run by the U.S. Department of Com-
merce’s Bureau of Industry and Security
(BIS). The Committees have specific con-
cerns about the lack of adequate and effec-
tive IC support to BIS’s export license appli-
cation review process and believe more ro-
bust IC support could have prevented many
of the ill-advised technology transfers that
have occurred in recent years.
Therefore, the Committees directs the DNI
to submit a plan, within 120 days of enact-
ment of the Act, to describe how the IC will
provide BIS with, at a minimum, basic but
timely analysis of any threat to U.S. na-
tional security posed by any proposed ex-
port, re-export, or transfer of export-con-
trolled technology. The plan shall include
detailed information on the appropriate or-
ganizational structure, including how many
IC personnel would be required, where they
would be located (including whether they
would be embedded at BIS to coordinate IC
support), and the amounts of necessary fund-
ing. In formulating the plan, the DNI should
study the ‘‘National Security Threat Assess-
ment’’ process that the National Intelligence
Council uses to inform the actions of the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States. The DNI shall submit the
plan to the congressional intelligence com-
mittees in classified form.
Social Media.
The Committees encourage the IC, notably
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to
both continue and enhance its efforts to as-
sist in detecting, understanding, and warn-
ing about foreign influence operations using
social media tools to target the United
States. Additionally, within the scope of the
IC’s authorities, and with all necessary pro-
tections for U.S. person information, the
Committees encourage the IC to augment
and prioritize these ongoing efforts.
Trade-Based Money Laundering.
Threats to our national security posed by
trade-based money laundering are con-
cerning. Therefore, the Committees direct
the DNI, within 90 days of enactment of the
Act, to submit a report to the congressional
intelligence committees on these threats, in-
cluding an assessment of the severity of the
threats posed to the United States’ national
security by trade-based money laundering
conducted inside and outside the United
States; an assessment of the scope of the fi-
nancial threats to the U.S. economy and fi-
nancial systems posed by trade-based money
laundering; a description of how terrorist fi-
nancing and drug trafficking organizations
are advancing their illicit activities through
the use of licit trade channels; an assessment
of the adequacy of the systems and tools
available to the Federal Government for
combating trade-based money laundering;
and a description and assessment of the cur-
rent structure and coordination between
Federal agencies, as well as with foreign gov-
ernments, to combat trade-based money
laundering. The report shall be submitted in
classified form with an unclassified sum-
mary to be made available to the public.
Expansions of Security Protective Service Juris-
diction of the Central Intelligence Agency.
The Committees direct the CIA, in connec-
tion with the expansion of its security pro-
tective service jurisdiction as set forth in
section 6413 of Subdivision 2 of the Act, to
engage with Virginia state and local law en-
forcement authorities to ensure that a
memorandum of understanding, akin to
those in place at other agencies setting forth
the appropriate allocation of duties and re-
sponsibilities, is in effect.

Unauthorized Disclosures of Classified Informa-
tion.
The Committees are concerned by the re-
cent widespread media reports that purport
to contain unauthorized disclosures of classi-
fied information. Protecting the nation’s se-
crets from unauthorized disclosure is essen-
tial to safeguarding our nation’s intelligence
sources and methods. An unlawful disclosure
of classified information can destroy sen-
sitive collection capabilities and endanger
American lives, including those individuals
who take great personal risks to assist the
United States in collecting vital foreign in-
telligence.
Federal law prohibits the unauthorized dis-
closure of classified information, but en-
forcement is often lacking or inconsistent.
Accordingly, the Committees desire to bet-
ter understand the number of potential un-
authorized disclosures discovered and inves-
tigated on a routine basis. Moreover, the
Committees have little visibility into the
number of investigations initiated by each
IC agency or the number of criminal refer-
rals to the Department of Justice. Accord-
ingly, section 6718 of Subdivision 2 of the Act
requires all IC agencies to provide the con-
gressional intelligence committees with a
semi-annual report of the number of inves-
tigations of unauthorized disclosures to jour-
nalists or media organizations, including
subsequent referrals made to the United
States Attorney General.
Additionally, the Committees wish to bet-
ter understand the role of IGs within ele-
ments of the IC, with respect to unauthor-
ized disclosures of classified information at
those elements.
Therefore, the Committees direct the IC
IG, within 180 days of enactment of the Act,
to provide the congressional intelligence
committees with a report regarding the role
of IGs with respect to investigating unau-
thorized disclosures. The report shall ad-
dress: the roles of IC elements’ security per-
sonnel and law enforcement regarding unau-
thorized disclosures; the current role of IGs
within IC elements regarding such disclo-
sures; what, if any, specific actions could be
taken by such IGs to increase their involve-
ment in the investigation of such matters;
any laws, rules or procedures that currently
prevent IGs from increasing their involve-
ment; and the benefits and drawbacks of in-
creased IG involvement, to include potential
impacts to IG’s roles and missions.
Presidential Policy Guidance.
The Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG)
dated May 22, 2013, and entitled ‘‘Procedures
for Approving Direct Action Against Ter-
rorist Targets Located Outside the United
States and Areas of Active Hostilities’’ pro-
vides for the participation by elements of the
IC in reviews of certain proposed counterter-
rorism operations. The Committees expect
to remain fully and currently informed
about the status of the PPG and its imple-
mentation.
Therefore, the Committees direct ODNI,
within five days of any change to the PPG,
or to any successor policy guidance, to sub-
mit to the congressional intelligence com-
mittees a written notification thereof, that
shall include a summary of the change and
the specific legal and policy justifications
for the change.
Centers for Academic Excellence.
The Committees commend the commit-
ment demonstrated by the program man-
agers of the IC’s Centers for Academic Excel-
lence (IC-CAE), IC agencies that sponsored
CAE interns, and all other personnel who
contributed to the inaugural edition of the
CAE Internship Program in summer 2017.
The Committees expect the IC-CAE Pro-
gram to build on this foundation by showing
measurable, swift progress, and ultimately
fulfilling Congress’s intent that the Program
serve as a pipeline of the next generation of
IC professionals.
Therefore, the Committees direct that the
IC take all viable action to expand the IC-
CAE Program by increasing, to the fullest
extent possible:
1. The number and racial and gender diver-
sity of IC-CAE interns;
2. The number of IC-CAE academic institu-
tions and their qualified internship can-
didates participating in the IC-CAE Pro-
gram; and
3. The number of IC elements that sponsor
IC-CAE interns.
Report on Violent Extremist Groups.
Violent extremist groups like ISIS con-
tinue to exploit the Internet for nefarious
purposes: to inspire lone wolves; to spread
propaganda; to recruit foreign fighters; and
to plan and publicize atrocities. As a former
Director of the National Counterterrorism
Center (NCTC) has stated publicly:
[W]e need to counter our adversaries’ suc-
cessful use of social media platforms to ad-
vance their propaganda goals, raise funds, re-
cruit, coordinate travel and attack plans,
and facilitate operations. . . . Our future
work must focus on denying our adversaries
the capability to spread their messages to
at-risk populations that they can reach
through the use of these platforms.
Section 403 of the Intelligence Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required the
DNI, consistent with the protection of
sources and methods, to assist public and
private sector entities in recognizing online
violent extremist content—specifically, by
making publicly available a list of insignias
and logos associated with foreign extremist
groups designated by the Secretary of State.
The Committees believe the IC can take ad-
ditional steps.
Therefore, the Committees direct the Di-
rector of NCTC, in coordination with other
appropriate officials designated by the DNI,
within 180 days of enactment of the Act, to
brief the congressional intelligence commit-
tees on options for a pilot program to de-
velop and continually update best practices
for private technology companies to quickly
recognize and lawfully take down violent ex-
tremist content online. Such briefing shall
address:
1. The feasibility, risks, costs, and benefits
of such a program;
2. The U.S. Government agencies and pri-
vate sector entities that would participate;
and
3. Any additional authorities that would be
required by the program’s establishment.
South China Sea.
The South China Sea is an area of great
geostrategic importance to the United
States and its allies. However, China’s con-
troversial territorial claims and other ac-
tions stand to undercut international norms
and erode the region’s stability. It is thus
imperative the United States uphold respect
for international law in the South China
Sea. Fulfilling that objective in turn will re-
quire an optimal intelligence collection pos-
ture.
Therefore, the direct the DoD, in coordina-
tion with DNI, within 30 days of enactment
of the Act, to brief the congressional intel-
ligence and defense committees on known in-
telligence collection gaps, if any, with re-
spect to adversary operations and aims in
the South China Sea. The briefing shall iden-
tify the gaps and whether those gaps are
driven by lack of access, lack of necessary
collection capabilities or legal or policy au-
thorities, or by other factors. The briefing
shall also identify IC judgments that assess
which intelligence disciplines would be best-
suited to answer the existing gaps, and cur-
rent plans to address the gaps over the Fu-
ture Years Defense Program.
Policy on Minimum Insider Threat Standards.
Executive Order 13587 and the National In-
sider Threat Task Force established min-
imum insider threat standards. Such stand-
ards are required for the sharing and safe-
guarding of classified information on com-
puter networks while ensuring consistent,
appropriate protections for privacy and civil
liberties. The Committees understand there
are policies in place to attempt implementa-
tion of such standards; however, the Com-
mittees have found that several elements of
the IC have not fully implemented such
standards. Therefore, given the several high-
profile insider threat issues, the Committees
emphasize the importance of such minimums
by statutorily requiring the DNI to establish
a policy on minimum insider threat stand-
ards, consistent with the National Insider
Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for
Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs,
and IC elements should expeditiously estab-
lish their own policies and implement the
DNI guidance.
Further, referring to the directive lan-
guage found in the committee report accom-
panying H.R. 5515, the Fiscal Year 2019
NDAA reported by the House Armed Services
Committee (HASC), the Committees direct
the Chief Management Officer to provide a
briefing to the congressional intelligence
and defense committees, no later than 90
days after enactment of the Act, on the out-
comes of its cost and technical analyses re-
quired by this report, and the DoD’s efforts
to implement enterprise-wide programs and
policies for insider threat detection, user ac-
tivity monitoring, and cyber-attack detec-
tion and remediation.
Intelligence Community Information Technology
Environment.
The Committees remain supportive of the
goals of Intelligence Community Informa-
tion Technology Environment (IC ITE) and
the importance of the common, secure shar-
ing infrastructure it creates. The Commit-
tees further understand that the path to im-
plement a complex, technical environment
such as IC ITE needs to be sufficiently flexi-
ble and agile. However, the Committees re-
main concerned with the lack of consistency
and substance in previous reports and brief-
ings on IC ITE. Therefore, section 6312 of
Subdivision 2 of the Act requires a long-term
roadmap, business plan, and security plan
that shall be reported to the congressional
intelligence committees at least quarterly
with additional notifications as necessary.
Intelligence Community Chief Financial Officer.
The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of
1990 mandated best practices for decision-
making and accountability, as well as im-
proved decision-makers’ access to reliable
and timely financial and performance infor-
mation. The CFO Act, as amended, requires
that the chief financial officers of 24 depart-
ments and agencies ‘‘report directly to the
head of the agency regarding financial man-
agement matters.’’ Section 6404 of Subdivi-
sion 2 of the Act brings the ODNI in line with
the best practices implemented in the CFO
Act.
Intelligence Community Chief Information Offi-
cer.
As codified in 44 U.S.C. 3506(a)(1)(A), each
federal agency head is responsible for ‘‘car-
rying out the information resources manage-
ment activities to improve agency produc-
tivity, efficiency, and effectiveness.’’ Accord-
ingly, section 6405 of Subdivision 2 of the Act
expresses the Committee’s intent to empha-
size the importance of the IC Chief Informa-
tion Officer (CIO), as defined in 50 U.S.C.

IC CIO to report directly to the DNI.
Central Intelligence Agency Subsistence for Per-
sonnel Assigned to Austere Locations.
Section 6411 of Subdivision 2 of the Act
permits the Director of the CIA to allow sub-
sistence for personnel assigned to austere lo-
cations. Although the statute does not define
‘‘austere,’’ the Committees believe that uti-
lization of this authority should be minimal.
Therefore, within 180 days after the enact-
ment of the Act, the CIA shall brief the Com-
mittees on the CIA’s definition of ‘‘austere’’
and the CIA regulations in place governing
this authority.
Collocation of Certain Department of Homeland
Security Personnel at Field Locations.
The Committees support DHS I&A’s intent
to integrate into operations across the
broader DHS enterprise. Accordingly, section
6434 of Subdivision 2 of the Act requires I&A
to identify opportunities for collocation of
I&A field officers and to submit to the Com-
mittees a plan for their deployment.
Limitations on Intelligence Community Ele-
ments’ Communications with Congress.
Effective oversight of the IC requires
unencumbered communications between rep-
resentatives of the agencies, members of
Congress, and congressional staff. The Com-
mittees direct the DNI not to limit any ele-
ment of the IC from having interactions with
the congressional intelligence committees,
including but not limited to, preclearance by
the DNI of remarks, briefings, discussions of
agency resources or authorities require-
ments, or mandatory reports to the DNI on
conversations with the Committees.
Intelligence Community Support to the National
Vetting Center.
On February 6, 2018, the President issued
National Security Policy Memorandum
(NSPM)-9, ’’Presidential Memorandum on
Optimizing the Use of Federal Government
Information in Support of National Vetting
Enterprise.’’ The memorandum directs the
DHS, in coordination with the ODNI and
other agencies, to establish the National
Vetting Center. The memorandum also re-
quires agencies to ‘‘provide the Center access
to relevant biographic, biometric, and re-
lated derogatory information.’’ It further di-
rects DNI, in coordination with the heads of
relevant IC elements, to ‘‘establish a support
element to facilitate, guide, and coordinate
all IC efforts to use classified intelligence
and other relevant information within the IC
holdings in support of the center.’’ The Com-
mittees wish to obtain regular updates and
the most current information about the ac-
tivities of that support element.
Therefore, no later than 180 days after the
enactment of the Act and annually there-
after, the Committees direct the DNI and the
Under Secretary for Intelligence and Anal-
ysis at DHS to brief the Committees on the
status of IC support to the National Vetting
Center, as established by NSPM–9.
Update on Status of Attorney General-Approved
U.S. Person Procedures under Executive
Order 12333.
The Committees acknowledge the difficult,
labor-intensive work undertaken by certain
IC elements, to ensure the current effective-
ness of, and in some cases to substantially
revise, final Attorney General-approved pro-
cedures regarding the collection, dissemina-
tion, and retention of United States persons
information. The Committees wish to better
understand the status of this project,
throughout the IC.
Therefore, the Committees direct that, not
later than 60 days after enactment of the
Act, the DNI and the Attorney General shall
brief the Committees on the issuance of
final, Attorney General-approved procedures
by elements of the IC. Specifically, the brief-
ing shall identify (1) any such elements that
have not yet issued final procedures; and (2)
with respect to such elements, the status of
the procedures’ development, and any in-
terim guidance or procedures on which those
elements currently rely.
Homegrown Violent Extremists Imprisoned in
Department of Defense Facilities.
The Committees are concerned about an
evident gap in information sharing about in-
dividuals imprisoned in DoD facilities who
are categorized by the FBI as homegrown
violent extremists (HVEs). A recent FBI re-
port underscores this gap, highlighting the
case of an individual who has been convicted
and sentenced to death by a U.S. military
court martial and remains incarcerated in a
U.S. military facility. The Committees un-
derstand that, despite his incarceration, this
inmate openly communicates with the out-
side world through written correspondence
and has continued to inspire extremists
throughout the world. The Committees fur-
ther understand that the FBI is unable to de-
termine the full scope of this inmate’s con-
tacts with the outside world because only a
portion of his communications have been
provided by the DoD.
Therefore, no later than 180 days after the
enactment of the Act, the Committees direct
the FBI to work with the DoD to create a
process by which the DoD provides to the
FBI the complete communications of indi-
viduals imprisoned in DoD facilities and who
are categorized by the FBI as HVEs.
Naming of Federal Bureau of Investigation
Headquarters.
According to statute enacted in 1972, the
current FBI headquarters building in Wash-
ington, D.C. must be ‘‘known and des-
ignated’’ as the ‘‘J. Edgar Hoover FBI Build-
ing.’’ That tribute has aged poorly. It should
be reconsidered, in view of Hoover’s record
on civil liberties—including the effort to dis-
parage and undermine Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. Even today, Hoover’s name evokes
the FBI’s sordid ‘‘COINTELPRO’’ activities.
The Committees believe Congress should
consider repealing the provision requiring
the existing Pennsylvania Avenue building
to be known as the ‘‘J. Edgar Hoover FBI
Building.’’ A new name should be deter-
mined, through a joint dialogue among Bu-
reau leadership, law enforcement personnel,
elected officials, and civil rights leaders.
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math
careers in Defense Intelligence.
Referring to the directive language found
in the committee report accompanying H.R.
5515, the HASC-reported Fiscal Year 2019
NDAA, the Committees direct the Director
of DIA to provide, within 90 days after enact-
ment of the Act, a briefing to the congres-
sional intelligence committees and the con-
gressional defense committees on a plan to
develop a Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Math career program that attracts and
maintains the defense intelligence cadre of
Science and Technical Intelligence analysts
to meet tomorrow’s threats.
Security and Intelligence Role in Export Con-
trol.
Referring to the directive language found
in the committee report accompanying H.R.
5515, the HASC-reported Fiscal Year 2019
NDAA, the Committees direct the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy, in coordina-
tion with the USD(I), within 60 days of en-
actment of the Act, to brief the congres-
sional intelligence and defense committees,
on security support to export control.
Security Clearance Background Investigation
Reciprocity.
Referring to the directive language found
in the committee report accompanying H.R.
5515, the HASC-reported Fiscal Year 2019
NDAA, the Committees direct the Secretary
of Defense, in coordination with the DNI and
the Director of the Office of Personnel Man-
agement, within 60 days of enactment of the
Act, to brief the Committees and the con-
gressional defense committees on efforts to
ensure seamless transition of investigations
between authorized investigative agencies,
as required by law.
Further, referring to the directive lan-
guage found in the committee report accom-
panying H.R. 5515, the HASC-reported Fiscal
Year 2019 NDAA, the Committees direct the
Secretary of Defense, in coordination with
the DNI and the Director of the Office of Per-
sonnel Management, within 90 days of enact-
ment of the Act, to brief the congressional
intelligence committees on efforts to ensure
reciprocity is a consideration for implemen-
tation of continuous evaluation and contin-
uous vetting across the federal government.
Foreign Influence Task Force.
The IC has warned of active measures
taken by foreign actors to interfere with and
undermine the U.S. democratic process, most
recently and brazenly by the Russian Fed-
eration. The Committees appreciate FBI ef-
forts to confront this challenge in part
through creation of its Foreign Influence
Task Force. The Committees believes that
confronting foreign influence directed at the
United States is of fundamental importance,
and thus desire to engage in a close and reg-
ular dialogue with the FBI about the task
force’s activities.
Therefore, the Committees direct the FBI
to provide detailed, quarterly briefings to
the Committees regarding the task force’s
activities, to include its progress and any
significant challenges.
Enhanced Oversight of IC Contractors.
A topic of sustained congressional intel-
ligence committee interest has been improv-
ing the federal government’s oversight of IC
acquisition and procurement practices, in-
cluding activities by poorly performing IC
contractors.
A framework exists to ensure that IC ele-
ments do not award IC contracts to busi-
nesses that engage in negligence or even
gross negligence, consistently fail to appro-
priately safeguard classified information,
maintain poor financial practices, or other
issues. For example, an IC element may
maintain a list of contractors of concern, in
order to ensure that proposals from such
contractors are rejected or subjected to addi-
tional scrutiny. The Committees wish to
build on these practices and are concerned
about the existing framework’s adequacy.
Therefore, the Committees direct all ele-
ments of the IC, to the fullest extent con-
sistent with applicable law and policy, to
share with one another information about
contractors with track records of concern—
such as the commission of negligence or
gross negligence in the performance of IC
contracts, or the repeated failure to appro-
priately safeguard classified information in a
fashion that the contractor reasonably could
have been expected to prevent.
Additionally, no later than 30 days after
enactment of the Act, the DNI shall brief the
Committees on the authorities of IC ele-
ments with respect to contractors with track
records of concern — before, during, and
after procurement. An objective of the brief-
ing will be to discuss information sharing
practices in this regard, and to identify spe-
cific areas where the oversight framework
can be strengthened.

HONORING SERGEANT KORT M.
PLANTENBERG, CHIEF WARRANT
OFFICER 2 JAMES A. ROGERS,
JR., AND CHIEF WARRANT OFFI-
CER 2 CHARLES P. NORD
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President,
today I rise with a heavy heart to
honor and pay tribute to three exem-
plary National Guard Members from
my home State of Minnesota. On
Thursday, December 5, SGT Kort M.
Plantenberg, CW2 James A. Rogers,
Jr., and CW2 Charles P. Nord lost their
lives when their Black Hawk UH–60
helicopter went down southwest of St.
Cloud, MN, during a routine mainte-
nance flight.
They had just returned home from
the Middle East in May after a 9-month
deployment conducting medical evacu-
ations. Once back in Minnesota, they
had continued serving our Nation by
ensuring that our Forces would be pre-
pared to respond the moment they
were needed. After this tragic loss,
Governor Walz, a Minnesota National
Guardsman for nearly 25 years, re-
marked that ‘‘we will forever be in the
debt of these warriors.’’ I couldn’t
agree more.
Today, I would like to honor these
brave men for giving what President
Lincoln called, ‘‘the last full measure
of devotion.’’ We are forever grateful
for heroes like Sergeant Plantenberg,
Chief Warrant Officer 2 Rogers, and
Chief Warrant Officer 2 Nord.
Some who knew these extraordinary
men described Sergeant Plantenberg as
‘‘one of the most professional individ-
uals . . . [who] had unlimited poten-
tial.’’ Chief Warrant Officer 2 Rogers
was said to be a ‘‘calming presence’’
who could always make those around
him laugh. Chief Warrant Officer 2
Nord was described as ‘‘lighthearted—
and kind-hearted.’’ Like many who
serve this country, these men all had
so many gifts, and our Nation is better
today because of their service and sac-
rifice.
During this time of unimaginable
grief, I would also like to offer my
prayers and condolences to the families
of these fallen heroes. I hope they take
comfort in the fact that their lives
weren’t lost in vain but in support of
their common goal: to serve the Nation
they loved.
They will be missed, but never for-
gotten, as their service has inspired us
all. So now, it is up to us to preserve
their memory and support all of our
brave men and women who make such
an immense sacrifice to keep our Na-
tion strong. Our thoughts and prayers
are with their families and loved ones
and with the entire Minnesota Na-
tional Guard community, at home and
overseas. There is no limit to the re-
spect they have earned, no cap to the
honor they are due, and no time when
we will not be in their debt.
Thank you.∑

Ms. SMITH. Madam President, today
I wish to recognize and celebrate the
lives of James Rogers, Charles Nord,
and Kort Plantenberg, all members of
the Minnesota National Guard, who
tragically lost their lives in a heli-
copter accident on Thursday, December
5. After returning home safely from de-
ployment to the Middle East in May,
this loss is especially heart wrenching.
These men conducted medical evacu-
ations in the Middle East, and their
service to our troops and allies will not
be forgotten. I am grateful for their
service and sacrifice for Minnesota and
our country.
CW2 James Rogers, often remem-
bered for his curious nature, served 10
years in the Minnesota National
Guard, having enlisted before his high
school graduation. CW2 Charles Nord
enlisted in 2007, and he leaves behind
his wife, young daughter, and a child
on the way. SGT James Plantenberg
enlisted in 2016, was a member of the
Guard’s biathlon team, and was pre-
paring to start flight school. We are all
indebted to these men for their service,
and I wish their families peace during
this time of tragic loss.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
REMEMBERING THE HANSEN
FAMILY
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise
today on a more somber note to pay
tribute to members of the Hansen fam-
ily who recently lost their lives in a
tragic accident.
For Jim Hansen, family is what
mattered most in life. This past
Thanksgiving, he was with his sons,
grandsons, and great-grandson, partici-
pating in an annual hunting activity
that had become a family tradition.
On November 30, 2019, they were re-
turning from this cherished family
time, when a tragic plane accident
took the lives of nine members of the
Hansen family: Jim Hansen, Sr., Jim
Hansen, Jr., Kirk Hansen, Stockton
Hansen, Logan Hansen, Kyle Naylor,
Tyson Dennert, Jake Hansen, and
Houston Hansen.
My wife Vicki and I offer our deepest
condolences and our hearts go out to
the remaining family members during
this overwhelmingly difficult time.
Their loss will not only be felt
throughout their community in east-
ern Idaho, but also by countless others
throughout the world who have been
touched by their religious and philan-
thropic service.
The miraculous survival of Josh Han-
sen, Matt Hansen, and Thomas Long is
a tender mercy to their remaining
loved ones and will hopefully bring a
measure of healing for their families.
Jim Hansen, Sr., spent his entire life
building a legacy steeped in a strong
sense of commitment to family, a
touchstone to guide future generations.
Being born into a family known for
hard work and business acumen, as
well as caring for people in need, Jim,
Jr., and Kirk harnessed their entrepre-
neurial spirit to expand the family
business into other successful ventures
that had a significant impact on their
home community of Idaho Falls. The
success of their values and vision was
manifest in the growth of their busi-
ness endeavors and their global impact.
Kirk and Jim were passionate about
bringing hope to others, and that hope
took shape in several forms. With the
guidance and insight of their remark-
able wives, Kirk and Jim helped found
Kyani Caring Hands. For nearly a dec-
ade, this organization dedicated a sig-
nificant portion of its time, energy,
and financial resources to respond to
disasters and support poverty-stricken

communities throughout the world,
with a special focus on improving chil-
dren’s nutrition and education.
The tragic plane accident that
claimed the lives of these Idaho sons
will forever cement the ideals and val-
ues that motivated these men to do
good where good was needed.
Idaho said farewell to several great
men who were not only pillars of the
community, but also beloved by em-
ployees everywhere. Jim Hansen, Sr.,
and his two sons, Kirk and Jim, Jr.,
were known throughout the world as
men who were passionate about helping
others and touching lives wherever
they went. The Hansen men and chil-
dren who lost their lives in this tragic
plane accident will be deeply missed,
but their legacy will not be forgotten.∑

RECOGNIZING VALLEY QUEEN
CHEESE FACTORY
∑ Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President,
today, it is my pleasure to name Valley
Queen Cheese Factory of Milbank, SD
as the Senate Small Business of the
Week. Valley Queen Cheese is a prime
example of the important role small
businesses play in their local econo-
mies and communities.
In 1929, Alfred Nef and Alfred
Gonzenbach decided Milbank, SD was
the perfect home for their business and
founded Valley Queen Cheese. Four
generations later, Valley Queen re-
mains a family-run operation and is
still owned by the Nef and Gonzenbach
families. Today, it operates less than
half a mile from the original location.
It is a recognized leader in the South
Dakota business community and the
greater dairy industry. Since 2017,
Doug Wilke has served as CEO of Val-
ley Queen. With guidance from the
board of directors, he currently over-
sees the largest cheese plant in South
Dakota and the largest employer in
Milbank.
More than 90 percent of all milk Val-
ley Queen uses comes from South Da-
kota cows, and they make a conscious
effort to continue South Dakota’s lead-
ership in this important industry.
Thanks to a recent expansion, Valley
Queen now has the capacity to produce
200 million pounds of cheese from 2 bil-
lion pounds of milk each year. Their
cheese can be found in most local gro-
cery stores, as it is sold to some of the
best-known food brands in the world.
To meet the growing demand, Valley
Queen recently invested in a business
expansion project that increased the
factory’s output by twenty-five per-
cent.
Valley Queen is an active leader in
the Milbank community, where it has
grown to employ 300 people. In 2017, the
Valley Queen Charitable Foundation
was established to advance positive
change by supporting local organiza-
tions and initiatives. In its first 3 years
as a nonprofit, the foundation has con-
tributed more than $900,000 to local
charities that have a community, edu-
cational, or humanitarian focus. Since
1990, Valley Queen has awarded high
school and college students over
$300,000 in scholarships. In addition to
the business’s own philanthropy, Val-
ley Queen makes an annual contribu-
tion to the Milbank Community Foun-
dation, which seeks to improve the
quality of life of residents in the com-
munity.
Valley Queen has been recognized for
their continuous improvement and ex-
ceptional process control through sev-
eral awards. Earlier this year, Valley
Queen won two awards and received
near-perfect marks at the U.S. Cham-
pionship Cheese Contest for their re-
duced fat cheddar and Monterey Jack
jalapeno cheeses. Valley Queen’s sus-
tained efforts toward improved re-
search and development does not go
unnoticed by the industry.
Valley Queen is an excellent example
of how small businesses fit the shared
values and ideals of their community
and give back in a multitude of ways.
I am proud to highlight Valley Queen
and its team for their integral social
and economic contributions to South
Dakota. Although many years removed
from being a startup company, Valley
Queen remains committed to the leg-
acy of its founders. Furthermore,
Milbank, South Dakota continues to
serve as the perfect home for this
thriving business. Congratulations
again to the entire team at Valley
Queen Cheese Factory for being named
Senate Small Business of the Week.∑

TRIBUTE TO FRANK FRAZIER
∑ Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I rise
today to pay tribute to Mr. Frank
Frazier of Oxford, NC, for his 35 years
of dedicated public service to the city
of Henderson and surrounding commu-
nities. Mr. Frazier was hired as an en-
gineering technician for the city of
Henderson in 1985 and has since dedi-
cated his career to public service. He
has held a number of roles within local
government including, but not limited
to, director of engineering, assistant
city manager and city manager.
As city manager, Mr. Frazier has
managed over 200 employees respon-
sible for all city operations including
the Fire and Police Departments, engi-
neering, human resources, finance,
recreation, and water resources, among
many others. Mr. Frazier has led sev-
eral significant projects that have ben-
efited the city, county, and region as a
whole, including upgrades to the Hen-
derson Water Reclamation Facility and
an upgrade to the Kerr Lake Regional
Water Plant. Not only did Mr. Frazier
successfully execute many accomplish-
ments for the community, he did so
through balanced budgets without tax
increases and simultaneously providing
substantial pay raises to city employ-
ees.
Mr. Frazier is well respected and ac-
knowledged for his consistent dedica-
tion to improving the quality of life for
Henderson and the greater region. I
would like to thank Mr. Frazier for his
35 years of honorable service, as well as
acknowledge his wife Sherrie and their
two sons, Mitchell and Chad, who have
supported his service. I wish Mr.
Frazier all the best in his future en-
deavors as he retires from the city of
Henderson.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself,
Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. DURBIN, and
Mrs. CAPITO):
S. 3070. A bill to modify reporting re-
quirements under the Controlled Sub-
stances Act; to the Committee on the
Judiciary.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise with my colleagues, Senators
GRASSLEY, CAPITO, and DURBIN to in-
troduce the Preventing Pill Mills
Through Data Sharing Act.
Millions of pills flooded small com-
munities throughout the Nation to fuel
the opioid epidemic we are facing
today.
Despite the fact that opioid manufac-
turers and distributors were required
to keep complete and accurate records
relating to the sale, delivery, or dis-
posal of opioids through the Auto-
mated Reports and Consolidated Order-
ing System, often referred to as
ARCOS, and to detect and disclose sus-
picious orders of opioids to the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA),
these substances still reached our
streets.
That is why my colleagues and I pre-
viously introduced the ‘‘Using Data to
Prevent Opioid Diversion Act,’’ which
was enacted as part of the ‘‘SUPPORT
Act’’ in 2018. As a result of that law,
DEA is now required to provide to
opioid manufacturers and distributors
anonymized information related to the
number of distributors serving a single
pharmacy or practitioner, and the
quantity and type of opioids being de-
livered to each.
This information, coupied with the
internal controls that these companies
already use in their efforts to deter-
mine the legitimacy of opioid orders, is
assisting manufacturers and distribu-
tors in their efforts to better prevent
these substances from being diverted to
someone other than the intended re-
cipient who has a lawful prescription.
That law also strengthened account-
ability by establishing civil and crimi-
nal fines for drug manufacturers and
distributors who fail to consider
ARCOS data when determining wheth-
er an order for opioids is suspicious.
Additionally, it increased existing civil
fines for drug manufacturers and dis-
tributors who fail to report suspicious
orders and keep accurate records ten-
fold, and doubled existing criminal
fines.
Finally, our legislation required the
United States Attorney General to
share standardized reports with state
officials, including regulatory, licens-
ing, attorneys general, and law en-
forcement agencies, related to the dis-
tribution patterns collected by the
ARCOS database on a semi-annual
basis.
This law has ensured that opioid
manufacturers and distributors have a
clear picture of how many pills are
going to each pharmacy, thereby help-
ing to eradicate pill mills.
To strengthen this law, my col-
leagues and I are introducing the ‘‘Pre-
venting Pill Mills Through Data Shar-
ing Act.’’ This new legislation is large-
ly based on recommendations included
in the October 2019 U.S. Department of
Justice (DOJ) Office of the Inspector
General (OIG) report related to the
DEA’s response to the opioid epidemic.
In that report, the DOJ OIG noted
two shortcomings associated with the
ARCOS system. First, not all reg-
istrants input data into the ARCOS
system at the same intervals.
While both opioid manufacturers and
distributors are required to input data
on a quarterly basis, manufacturers
often input the data monthly, while
distributors do so quarterly. This
means that when the DEA provides the
quarterly reports that drug manufac-
turers and distributors must use to de-
termine whether orders are suspicious,
they don’t have the most up to date in-
formation. Our legislation addresses
this problem by requiring all reg-
istrants to input data on a monthly
basis.
Second, the database only captures
information for Schedule I and II
drugs. As a result, addictive drugs in
other schedules, which are also di-
verted, are not captured. This includes
nine combination opioid products.
For this reason, our legislation ex-
pands the reporting requirements to in-
clude controlled substances in all
schedules. Our legislation also closes
an existing loophole.
The DEA has informed my staff that,
under current law, one pharmacy is
able to transfer up to five percent of its
inventory of controlled substances to
another pharmacy without having to
immediately report to the DEA.
Because these transfers are not auto-
matically reported to the DEA through
the ARCOS system, it creates a blind
spot for the DEA, as well as for drug
manufacturers and distributors who
are required to consider data from the
anonymized reports generated from the
ARCOS database when determining
whether an order for controlled sub-
stances is suspicious.
Moreover, because pharmacies are
not currently required to check the
ARCOS reports provided by DEA before
transferring a controlled substance to
another pharmacy, they could be inad-
vertently supplying a pharmacy with
excess amounts of pills that could eas-
ily end up on the black market.
That is why our legislation applies
the same reporting requirements and
penalties to pharmacies transferring
controlled substances, except in the
limited circumstance of a transfer
made for a specific patient need, as
those that are applied to drug manu-
facturers and distributors.
In 2018, we lost almost 70,000 individ-
uals to drug overdose deaths in our
country. Nearly 48,000 of these were
opioid-related.
Drug manufacturers, distributors,
and pharmacies all play a critical role
in preventing future overdose deaths.
The ‘‘Using Data to Prevent Opioid
Diversion Act’’ has been successful.
The ‘‘Preventing Pill Mills Through
Data Sharing Act’’ builds on that suc-
cess and will close existing loopholes in
order reduce the diversion of controlled
substances that are contributing to the
massive number of overdose deaths in
the United States.
I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation and look forward to its pas-
sage.
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the
floor.

f
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, we are rapidly running out of
time to protect our future and that of
our children and grandchildren from
worsening climate upheaval. America
ought to be taking every measure
available to rein in greenhouse gas
emissions from legislative action to
legal action, to diplomatic action, to
regulatory action, which is going to be
a theme of this talk tonight. We are
not doing those things, and, frankly, it
is because of corruption, plain and sim-
ple.
Regulatory action, that means en-
forcing the laws on the books. We have
a Clean Air Act that requires the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency to stop
dangerous pollutants from fouling our
air. The EPA has found that green-
house gases are pollutants under the
Clean Air Act, and the Supreme Court
has upheld that finding. That means we
ought to be regulating methane. Meth-
ane is among the most potent of green-
house gases. When released into the at-
mosphere, it traps about 30 times more
heat than its chemical cousin, carbon
dioxide. Oil and gas extraction releases
massive methane pollution. In fact, a
growing body of research suggests
methane pollution from natural gas ex-
traction may completely offset the cli-
mate gains of switching from coal to
natural gas.
To fulfill its duties under the Clean
Air Act, as a matter of law, EPA needs
to prevent methane pollution. It is the
law; it is not optional. But the corrupt
Trump EPA won’t fight methane pollu-
tion. This corrupt EPA is run by the
fossil fuel industry, which could not
care less about methane emissions.
Within weeks of Scott Pruitt taking
control of the Agency, the corrupted
EPA withdrew its request that oil and
gas companies even report methane
emissions. The industry knew a true
report on methane leakage would dam-
age their case for natural gas as a less
dangerous air pollutant, so they went
to a line of attack, taken directly from
the Big Tobacco playbook: Silence the
science. The fewer facts the EPA has,
the less action it needs to take under
law—the corrupt Trump EPA delib-
erately made itself ignorant and
stopped the reporting so it could avoid
its duty.
Step 2 came in March 2017 with the
corrupt Trump effort to roll back exist-
ing greenhouse gas regulations, includ-
ing methane regulations. Trump’s Ex-
ecutive order reads like a fossil fuel
lobbyist’s dream, probably because fos-
sil fuel lobbyists wrote it. He called on
the EPA to ‘‘review existing regula-
tions that potentially burden the de-
velopment or use of domestically pro-
duced energy resources and appro-
priately suspend, revise, or rescind
those that unduly burden the develop-
ment of domestic energy resources.’’
Regulations to limit methane pollu-
tion were among those that Trump’s
Executive order singled out, saying,
‘‘As soon as practical, suspend, revise,
or rescind [them].’’
Step 3 was to write a do-nothing re-
placement. After lots of dawdling,
Trump’s corrupt EPA decided to draft
a fake rule, a rule they could point to
if challenged in court for doing noth-
ing, but a rule that would conveniently
do nothing to limit methane emissions.
The fake rule exempts a huge chunk of
oil and gas production from regulation,
leaving the industry with an effective
blank check to pollute as much meth-
ane as it likes.
As I speak, the corrupt Trump EPA is
preparing to issue its final rule, and
the corrupted fossil fuel industry is
poised to grab everything it wanted.
The final rule is one that industry
stooges could have written themselves
because, well, it looks like they did
write it themselves. They bought that
privilege the old-fashioned way, by
buying it.
Even before Trump took office, the
fossil fuel industry began showering
him with money. Trump raised a
record amount for his inauguration—
nearly doubling the previous record—
and Hess, Chevron, BP, Citgo,
ExxonMobil, Consol Energy, Conti-
nental Resources, Murray Energy, and
Valero all made six- or seven-figure do-
nations. The oil and gas and mining
sector was the second largest source of
donations, providing more than $10
million to Trump’s inaugural com-
mittee. That money still flows as the
2020 election ramps up.
Fossil fuel companies are among the
largest donors to the political group
supporting Trump’s reelection. A pipe-
line company is the largest single
donor to the Trump victory political
action committee, more than $700,000
as of this November. The oil, gas, and
mining industries account for more
than $5 million to the Trump Victory
PAC.
Fossil fuel executives are some of the
largest individual donors to the Trump
Victory PAC. One executive alone gave
$360,000. These known donations likely
represent the tip of a big dark iceberg.
Dark-money political organizations ac-
cept unlimited donations and provide
no disclosure, and Super PACs accept
unlimited donations with little disclo-
sure. So the bottom line is we cannot
tell exactly how much fossil fuel
money is flowing to groups supporting
Trump, but it is a lot. When you con-
sider the $650 billion annual subsidiary
the fossil fuel polluters enjoy, they
have every reason to buy control over
government from a corrupt Trump ad-
ministration.
Money isn’t the only way the fossil
fuel industry exerts control. Oklahoma
oil king and Scott Pruitt patron Har-
old Hamm set up a Trump leadership
council to advise Trump. The fossil fuel
industry was the heart of the council,
with coal giants Alliance Resource
Partners and Murray Energy, oil serv-
ices company Baker Hughes, and nat-
ural gas company Devon Energy all ac-
tive members. Of course, there was the
National Association of Manufacturers,
a trade association recently identified
as America’s worst climate obstructer.
With all these obstructers and pol-
luters on board, the fossil fuel friendly

council fed Trump a steady diet of
talking points about slashing regula-
tions and achieving ‘‘complete Amer-
ican energy independence.’’
These fossil fuel industry talking
points became the Executive order I
mentioned earlier, an order to kill any
environmental protection that ‘‘unduly
burdens the development of domestic
energy resources.’’ Do you want to
know who the winners were from that
Executive order? Check the list of
attendees at the signing ceremony: fos-
sil fuel executives and fossil fuel indus-
try trade association executives, come
to celebrate the freedom to pollute
that their influence and money had
bought them.
Chevron has recently been identified
as one of the companies that has done
the most to damage our oceans. They
are one of the top ocean-wrecking com-
panies on the planet. In February of
2017, Chevron wrote to the corrupt Pru-
itt with a list of deregulatory proposals
the company wanted to see imple-
mented at the EPA. Included was a re-
quest to ‘‘refocus methane regulations,
particularly those that impact existing
sources, to encourage voluntary ap-
proaches.’’ For sure, you can trust one
of the world’s worst ocean polluters
with voluntary approaches.
The corrupt Trump EPA was stocked
with fossil fuel industry cronies ready
to implement whatever the industry
wanted. Pruitt rose to political power
on a wave of fossil fuel money and dem-
onstrated a willingness to sell his of-
fice by putting fossil fuel industry asks
verbatim onto his official letterhead.
Andrew Wheeler, Pruitt’s successor
as Administrator, had been a leading
lobbyist for the coal industry. The
head of the EPA Air Office, Bill
Wehrum, rose to prominence by help-
ing build and run an array of trade as-
sociations and front groups for—guess
what—the fossil fuel industry.
Beyond Pruitt and Wheeler and
Wehrum, the EPA’s political leadership
crawled with fossil fuel flunkies, like
the one who left to set up the fossil-
fuel dark energy group Energy 45 to
help promote fossil fuel energy poli-
cies; or the lawyer-lobbyist for energy
interests Dominion Energy, Koch In-
dustries, and TransCanada overseeing
Air Office compliance, of all things. It
has been an infestation.
It is easy for the fossil fuel industry
to spend big money to corrupt the EPA
because the corruption payback is so
big; the dirty methane work alone is
estimated to save oil and gas compa-
nies hundreds of millions of dollars.
Meanwhile, the American Petroleum
Institute, the largest trade association
for the oil and gas industry, announced
a new seven-figure ad campaign called
‘‘We’re on it.’’ ‘‘We’re on it.’’ These
ads—on the Internet, TV, and bill-
boards—they are all over the Wash-
ington, DC, airport. They are designed
to fool the public and to fool policy-
makers that the oil industry is ‘‘on
its’’ methane emissions problem. Of
course, they are not. Of course, they
are lying. It is what they do.
Science tells us that methane emis-
sions are far higher than the estimates
out of the corrupt Trump EPA. The in-
vestigative journalism group Un-
earthed found that leading oil compa-
nies are emitting unprecedented meth-
ane pollution. In just three producing
basins, in just 1 year, oil companies
emitted methane equivalent to the an-
nual emissions of 10 coal-fired power
plants or 8 million cars.
There is a recent New York Times ar-
ticle that you can link to showing in-
frared imagery—it is really impressive
to see, actually, if you click through to
it—infrared imagery of methane bil-
lowing out of what they call super-
emitter fossil fuel facilities.
A recent article described one meth-
ane blowout in Ohio leaking as much
‘‘methane than the entire oil and gas
industries of many nations do in a
year.’’
‘‘We are on it.’’ Yeah, they are ‘‘on
it.’’ What they are on is a binge of
lying about emissions, corrupting our
politics, and blocking climate action.
These massive polluting industries
have a long track record of climate de-
nial and deceit. It is how they roll.
A top climate obstructer, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, pays for a
phony study, claiming the Paris agree-
ment would cost jobs and economic
growth, and Trump pulls out a pass. Oil
companies lobby to gut auto fuel effi-
ciency standards, and Pruitt and
Wheeler gut the standards. The natural
gas industry objects to rules limiting
methane emission. The corrupt Trump
EPA rolls them back.
Just now, on the Senate floor, we are
looking at a tax extenders package
that wipes out the tax extenders for
solar going forward, wind going for-
ward. They gave us 1 year looking
backwards. Great, thanks a bunch.
Electric vehicles, storage, and bat-
teries, all of that had been in a ten-
tative agreement. The fossil fuel indus-
try and the Trump administration
kiboshed all of it. ‘‘On it,’’ indeed.
Will Attorney General Barr look into
any of this? Of course not. In the cor-
rupt Trump administration, fossil fuel
money and influence puts that indus-
try above the law. They can pollute
and corrupt more or less at will. We
cannot afford this self-dealing from
polluters any longer. This is flat-out
wrong. Indeed, it is flat-out crooked. It
is not only time to wake up, Madam
President, it is time to clean up. This
behavior is a disgrace.
I yield the floor.

CONGRATULATING CHAD BLACK
ON RECEIVING THE NATHAN
DEAL GOVERNOR’S AWARD FOR
TRAUMA EXCELLENCE
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, December 17, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize a fellow Northeast
Georgian and my dear friend, Mr. Chad Black,
for his incredible work in revolutionizing trau-
ma care services in Northeast Georgia.
Chad Black spent over three decades work-
ing with the Hall County Fire Services, includ-
ing 17 years in Air Medical Transport Serv-
ices. After retiring from the Hall County Fire
Services as Deputy Fire Chief in June 2016,
Mr. Black was named Director of the
Habersham County Emergency Services,
where he oversees all fire, emergency medical
services, and rescue for Habersham County.
He also currently serves as Chairman of the
Georgia Emergency Medical Services Asso-
ciation. Earlier this month, Mr. Black was ap-
pointed to the Georgia Firefighter Standards
and Training Council. These honorable titles
are the culmination of his 36 years of dedica-
tion to the fire and emergency services.
When Georgia Senate Bill 60 passed, it rec-
ognized the need for trauma centers in every
community. Upon passage, Mr. Black began
serving as Chair of the EMS Region II Re-
gional Trauma Advisory Committee where he
worked with the Northeast Georgia Medical
Center to help them become a Level II trauma
center. Today, the center remains the only
trauma center in Region II, serving more than
2,000 patients each year.
To Mr. Black, trauma centers are a vital part
of our community. Before these medical capa-
bilities were established in Northeast Georgia,
patients had to be airlifted to Atlanta to receive
treatment. Thanks to Mr. Black’s work, help is
now closer than ever for the residents of
Northeast Georgia.
Last month, the Regional Trauma Advisory
Committee recognized Chad for his tireless
work on developing the trauma center—and
for his 36 years of service—by presenting him
with the Nathan Deal Governor’s Award for
Trauma Excellence.
On behalf of the people of Northeast Geor-
gia, I join Chad’s colleagues in congratulating
him on this award. I truly cannot think of any-
one more deserving. I want to thank my dear
friend for his commitment to improving trauma
services across the state of Georgia, and most
importantly, for devoting nearly four decades
to saving lives in our communities.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AF-
FAIRS CONTRACTING PREF-
ERENCE, CONSISTENCY ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. DAVID P. ROE
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 16, 2019
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I have determined it necessary to in-
clude in the RECORD the following views on
H.R. 4920, the Department of Veterans Affairs
Contracting Preference Consistency Act in the
absence of a committee report.
VIEWS ON H.R. 4920, DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS
AFFAIRS CONTRACTING PREFERENCE CONSIST-
ENCY ACT
HON. DAVID P. ROE, RANKING MEMBER,
COMMITTEE ON VETERANS’ AFFAIRS
I.—PURPOSE AND SUMMARY: H.R. 4920,
the Department of Veterans Affairs Con-
tracting Preference Consistency Act, was in-
troduced by Representative MARK TAKANO on
October 30, 2019. H.R. 4920 is the ultimate re-
sult of a discussion draft that members of
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs began
circulating in October 2017. H.R. 4920 clari-
fies the relationship between the AbilityOne
Program and the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs’ (VA) Veterans First Program.
Congress established the AbilityOne Pro-
gram through the passage of the Javits-Wag-
ner-O’Day Act, P.L. 92–98, codified at 41
U.S.C. §§ 8501–8506 (JWOD Act). The
AbilityOne Program is designed to provide
employment opportunities to individuals
who are blind or who are severely disabled.
Pursuant to the JWOD Act, the U.S.
AbilityOne Commission (formerly known as
the Committee for Purchase from People
Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) main-
tains the Procurement List, which lists the
products and services made by qualified Non-
Profit Agencies (NPAs) for the blind or se-
verely disabled that the U.S. AbilityOne
Commission deems suitable for the federal
government to procure. If the federal govern-
ment intends to purchase products or serv-
ices on the Procurement List, it must pur-
chase them from the qualified NPAs des-
ignated by the U.S. AbilityOne Commission.
Therefore, the AbilityOne Program is often
referred to as a ‘‘mandatory source’’ in fed-
eral contracting.
Congress created the Veterans First Con-
tracting Program (Vets First Program)
through the passage of the Veterans Bene-
fits, Health Care, and Information Tech-
nology Act of 2006, P.L. 109–461, codified at 38
U.S.C. §§ 8127–8128 (VBA of 2006). The Vets
First Program encourages increased levels of
contracting by VA with Service Disabled
Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs)
and Veteran Owned Small Businesses
(VOSBs), in descending order of priority,
through a combination of noncompetitive,
sole-source, and restricted competition au-
thorities. The restricted competition author-
ity, reflected in U.S.C. § 8127(d) is known as
the ‘‘Rule of Two.’’ The Rule of Two states
that, ‘‘a contracting officer ofthe Depart-
ment shall award contracts on the basis of
competition restricted to [SDVOSBs or
VOSBs] if the contracting officer has a rea-
sonable expectation that two or more [such
SDVOSBs or VOSBs] will submit offers and
that the award can be made at a fair and rea-
sonable price that offers best value to the
United States.’’
Whereas the VBA of 2006 is silent as to the
relationship between the AbilityOne Pro-
gram as a mandatory source and the Rule of
Two, H.R. 4920 states that, notwithstanding
the Rule of Two, VA contracting officers
shall continue procuring from qualified
NPAs those products or services that were
included on the Procurement List on or be-
fore December 22, 2006, the date of enactment
of the VBA of 2006.
II.—BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEG-
ISLATION: VA, like other federal agencies
establishes contracts with private businesses
for needed products and services. Federal
contracting has the additional objective of
promoting small business, including socio-
economic subcategories, principally through
a system of government-wide participation
goals administrated by the Small Business
Administration. Congress established such a
goal for SDVOSBs in the Veterans Entrepre-
neurship and Small Business Development
Act of 1999, P.L. 106–50, codified at 15 U.S.C.
§ 644(g)(l)(A)(ii). The government-wide
SDVOSB goal remains three percent, rep-
resenting a minimum, though individual
agencies have opted for higher goals. Due to
agencies’, including VA’s, inability to
achieve the three percent SDVOSB goal,
Congress enacted the Veterans Benefits Act
of 2003, P.L. 108–183, codified at 15 U.S. Code
§ 657f, which among other purposes, granted
agencies the authority to restrict competi-
tion to SDVOSBs and to award sole-source
contracts to SDVOSBs under certain cir-
cumstances. The Veterans Benefits Act of
2003 (in section 308 of P.L. 108–183) was spe-
cific as to the relationship between the
AbilityOne Program as a mandatory source
and the newly created SDVOSB sole-source
authority, ‘‘Relationship To Other Con-
tracting Preferences.—A procurement may
not be made from a source on the basis of a
preference provided under subsection (a) or
(b) if the procurement would otherwise be
made from a different source under section
4124 or 4125 of title 18, United States Code, or
the Javits-Wagner-O’Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46 et
seq.).’’ However, due to VA’s specific inabil-
ity to achieve its SDVOSB goal, Congress en-
acted the VBA of 2006. In contrast to the
Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, the VBA of
2006 contained no language clarifying the in-
tended treatment of the AbilityOne Program
or other contracting preference programs.
VA initially implemented the VBA of 2006

Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation on
January 7, 2010. On April 28, 2010, VA issued
a policy referred to as an ‘‘information let-
ter’’ to address the relationship between the
Vets First Program and the AbilityOne Pro-
gram. This policy stated the following:
‘‘The Veterans First Contracting Program
final rule does not affect AbilityOne’s order
of priority in relation to the Veterans First
Contracting Program. Therefore, all items
currently on the AbilityOne Procurement
List as of January 7, 2010, will continue to
take priority over the contracting pref-
erences mandated by P.L. 109–461. However,
all new requirements will be subject to the
contracting preferences mandated by P.L.
109–461 prior to being considered for place-
ment with the AbilityOne Program. This pol-
icy provides an equitable solution by ensur-
ing VA’s continued commitment to
AbilityOne, while also recognizing the
changes to VA’s small business hierarchy.’’
The meaning and impact of the VBA of 2006
were challenged in a series of bid protests. In
one key protest to the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO), In re Kingdomware
Techs., No. B–406507 (May 30, 2012), GAO de-
termined that VA, ‘‘improperly used non-
mandatory Federal Supply Schedule proce-
dures to procure services, rather than using
a set-aside for [SDVOSB] concerns, and im-
properly awarding a contract to a non-
SDVOSB concern.’’ After VA declined to im-
plement GAO’s decision, the protestor
Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. proceeded
to file a similar protest at the Court of Fed-
eral Claims, which granted summary judg-
ment to VA upholding its interpretation on
November 27, 2012. Kingdomware Tech-
nologies then appealed the Court of Federal
Claims’ ruling to the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the ear-
lier ruling in a split decision on June 3, 2014.
The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case
on June 22, 2015. There were two matters of
controversy, which periodically rose and fell
in prominence, throughout these protests
and appeals: whether the Rule of Two should
be in force at all times, or only up to the
point in time in each fiscal year when VA
has awarded sufficient contracts to
SDVOSBs to satisfy its SDVOSB goal, and
whether the Rule of Two applies to orders
placed against Federal Supply Schedules. In
the government’s brief, the solicitor general
framed the question presented as, ‘‘whether
the Department of Veterans Affairs permis-
sibly concluded that 38 U.S.C. 8127 did not re-
quire it to utilize a small-business con-
tracting preference before placing an order
under a pre-existing Federal Supply Sched-
ule contract.’’ On August 25, 2015, forty-one
members of Congress, including Rep. David
P. Roe and three other current members of
the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs,
submitted an amici curiae brief, reiterating
congressional intent that the Rule of Two
shall apply continuously, not switch on and
off throughout each fiscal year depending on
when the SDVOSB participation goal is met.
The Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion,
Kingdomware Techs. v. United States, No.
14–916, 136 S. Ct. 1969 (June 16, 2016) held the
following:
‘‘Alternative readings of § 8127(d) are
unpersuasive. First, § 8127(d)’s prefatory
clause, which declares that the Rule of Two
is designed ‘‘for the purposes of’ meeting
§ 8127(a)’s annual contracting goals, has no
bearing on whether § 8127(d)’s requirement is
mandatory or discretionary. The prefatory
clause’s announcement of an objective does
not change the operative clause’s plain
meaning. See Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R.
Co. v. Thomas, 132 U.S. 174, 188. Second, an
FSS order is a ‘‘contract’’ within the ordi-
nary meaning of that term; thus, FSS orders
do not fall outside § 8127(d), which applies
when the Department ‘‘award[s] contracts.’’
Third, to say that the Rule of Two will ham-
per mundane Government purchases mis-
apprehends current FSS practices, which
have expanded well beyond simple procure-
ment to, as in this case, contracts con-
cerning complex information technology
services over a multiyear period. Finally, be-
cause the mandate § 8127(d) imposes is unam-
biguous, this Court declines the invitation to
defer to the Department’s declaration that
§ 8127 procedures are inapplicable to FSS or-
ders.’’
The construction of and relationship be-
tween the VBA of 2006 and the JWOD Act
were also challenged in a series of bid pro-
tests. One key protest to the Court of Fed-
eral Claims, Angelica Textile Servs., Inc. v.
United States, 95 Fed. Cl. 208 (Oct. 26, 2010),
concerned the necessity of VA performing a
Rule of Two analysis before adding a new
product or service to the Procurement List,
in addition to other alleged procedural irreg-
ularities. Angelica Textile Services, Inc. was
an SDVOSB and an incumbent VA con-
tractor performing a service which VA at-
tempted to add to the Procurement List. The
Court of Federal Claims noted in its opinion
that, ‘‘Were there a conflict between the two
statutes, the more specific Veterans Benefits
Act would control. See NISH v. Rumsfeld, 348
F.3d at 1272; NISH v. Cohen, 247 F.3d at 205.
Where, as here, the statutes exist in tension,
albeit not in direct conflict, the Department
was entirely reasonable in concluding in its
New Guidelines that the Veterans Benefits
Act should have priority.’’ Angelica Textile
Servs., Inc. v. United States, 95 Fed. Cl. 208,
222 (Oct. 26, 2010). The Court ordered that VA
be enjoined from adding the services to the
Procurement List and proceeding to contract
with an AbilityOne NPA, and that VA must
comply with its April 28, 2010 policy and
apply the Rule of Two before making any
such decisions in the future.
In another important protest, PDS Con-
sultants, Inc. v. United States, 132 Fed. Cl.
117 (May 30, 2017), the Court of Federal
Claims considered the question of ‘‘which
procurement priority must the VA first em-
ploy: the requirement that the VA conduct a
Rule of Two analysis to determine whether
it must restrict the procurement to veteran-
owned small businesses under the VBA [of
2006] or the requirement that the VA use the
AbilityOne List under the JWOD, regardless
of whether the VA has conducted a VBA Rule
of Two analysis.’’ The protestor was PDS
Consultants, Inc., a SDVOSB. The holder of
the protested contracts was Winston-Salem
Industries for the Blind (now known as IFB
Solutions) an NPA. This question arose in
the context of products and services which
had been included for many years on the
Procurement List for two of VA’s regions,
called Veterans Integrated Service Net-
works, as well as products and services for
two other regions which were being per-
formed within the Vets First Program but
which the AbilityOne Commission had re-
cently added to the Procurement List with-
out VA conducting Rule of Two analysis.
Therefore, this protest concerned SDVOSB
contracts which were subject to move into
the AbilityOne Program and NPA contracts
which were subject to move into the Vets
First Program. The Court of Federal Claims
noted in its opinion that:
‘‘The VA, faced with these potentially con-
tradictory contracting preferences, origi-
nally took the position in this litigation
that if a product or service appears on the
AbilityOne List for a particular region of the
country the JWOD requires the VA to pur-
chase that product off of the List without
first performing a Rule of Two analysis.
However, during the pendency of the litiga-
tion, the VA changed its position through
regulation. The VA now agrees that if a
product or service was added to the
AbilityOne List after 2010, the VA will per-
form the Rule of Two analysis before pur-
chasing off of the List. The new regulation
provides, however, that the VA will continue
to purchase items off of the AbilityOne List
without first performing a Rule of Two anal-
ysis for items added to the List before 2010.’’
The Court of Federal Claims held that,
‘‘VA is required to perform a Rule of Two
analysis for all procurements after the VBA
was passed. Accordingly, the VA may not
enter into future contracts with IFB until it
performs a Rule of Two analysis and deter-
mines whether two or more veteran-owned
small-businesses can perform the subject
work.’’ Winston-Salem Industries for the
Blind appealed this decision to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In PDS Con-
sultants Inc. v. United States, 907 F.3d 1345
(Oct. 17, 2018), the appeals court upheld the
lower court ruling and ‘‘conclude[d] that the
requirements of the more specific, later-en-
acted VBA take precedence over those of the
JWOD when the two statutes are in apparent
conflict.’’ The appeals court observed in its
opinion that, ‘‘While the precise question we
consider today was not presented in
Kingdomware, we may not ignore the Court’s
finding that the VBA ‘is mandatory, not dis-
cretionary,’’ ’ and, ‘‘We assume that Con-
gress was aware that it wrote an exception
into the agency-wide Veterans Benefits Act
in 2003 when it left that very same exception
out of the VBA only three years later.’’
Since the appeals court ruling, Winston-
Salem Industries for the Blind filed a peti-
tion for a writ of certiorari on September 9,
2019. Recently, on December 9, 2019, the solic-
itor general filed a brief in response in oppo-
sition, reasoning that although the Supreme
Court’s decision in Kingdomware ‘‘did not
address the question presented here,’’ and
‘‘although the government agrees with peti-
tioner that the relevant statutes taken to-
gether are better read to give priority to
JWOD’s specified-source requirements where
those requirements apply, the court of ap-
peals’ contrary holding also represents a rea-
sonable reconciliation of the competing in-
terests that are implicated here. And Con-
gress of course remains free to mandate a
different approach in response to the court’s
decision.’’
On May 20, 2019, in response to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit issuing a
mandate effectuating its decision in PDS
Consultants Inc. v. United States, VA issued
a new policy in the form of a Veterans Af-
fairs Acquisition Regulation deviation re-
placing its April 28, 2010 policy. The devi-
ation’s purpose was to ‘‘require contracting
officers to apply the VA Rule of Two to de-
termine whether a requirement should be
awarded to [SDVOSBs] and VOSBs under the
authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127–28, by using pref-
erences and priorities in subpart 819.70 prior
to considering an award to an AbilityOne
non-profit organization or the Federal Pris-
on Industry, Inc.’’ Impacts ensued from this
policy.
The AbilityOne Commission states on its
website that, ‘‘providing employment oppor-
tunities to more than 45,000 people who are
blind or have significant disabilities, includ-
ing approximately 3,000 veterans, the
AbilityOne Program is among the nation’s
largest providers of jobs for people who are
blind or have significant disabilities.’’ The
AbilityOne Commission also cites on its
website a 70 percent unemployment rate
among these populations and characterizes
this as ‘‘unacceptably high.’’ According to
the AbilityOne central nonprofit agencies

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1599
December 17, 2019
SourceAmerica (formerly National Indus-
tries for the Severely Handicapped) and Na-
tional Industries for the Blind, approxi-
mately 2,000 jobs of individuals who are dis-
abled and approximately 800 jobs of individ-
uals who are blind, respectively, are associ-
ated with VA contracts. In mid–2019, there
were roughly 90 such contracts held by NPAs
located in 30 states and the District of Co-
lumbia. Some of these contracts have passed
from AbilityOne NPAs to SDVOSBs or
VOSBs since May 20, 2019. Available informa-
tion indicates that more contracts for prod-
ucts have been affected than contracts for
services, due to the fact that the particular
services that are prevalent in the AbilityOne
Program, such as custodial, food, and call
center services, are relatively less likely
than products to pass the Rule of Two. Avail-
able information indicates that many af-
fected NPAs have furloughed employees
while attempting to secure work for them on
other contracts. However, the extent of lay-
offs that have already occurred is unknown,
while the Committee has been provided no
example of a SDVOSB or VOSB gaining a
contract which was formerly performed by
an NPA and taking on the NPA’s employees
who would otherwise be displaced.
The destruction of employment and em-
ployment opportunities for individuals who
are blind or disabled is extremely unsatisfac-
tory; it is also unnecessary and avoidable.
The courts in the cases discussed above re-
lied on the general maxim of statutory inter-
pretation that a specific statute (the VBA of
2006) takes precedence over a general statute
(the JWOD Act), particularly when the spe-
cific statute was later enacted. They also
gave weight to the Veterans Benefits Act of
2003’s clarity as to the treatment of the
JWOD Act in contrast to the VBA of 2006’s
silence and imputed there congressional in-
tent to subsume the AbilityOne Program in
VA. The purpose of H.R. 4920 is to clarify
Congress’s intent. The Vets First Program
and the AbilityOne Program should coexist
in VA as they did after the enactment of the
VBA of 2006, through the April 28, 2010 pol-
icy, through the time of Kingdowmare, until
PDS Consultants fundamentally changed the
programs’ alignment. However, recognizing
the time that has passed and the inherent
fairness issue that informs the relevant bid
protests and cases, it is more appropriate to
use the date of enactment of the VBA of 2006,
December 22, 2006, as a point of demarcation
than the date of VA’s former policy, April 28,
2010. This legislation would exempt the
award of contracts in VA for products and
services that were placed on the Procure-
ment List on or before December 22, 2006
from the Rule of Two and thereby preserve a
substantial amount of, though not all, em-
ployment in the NPAs that rely on these
contracts. All contracting for products and
services added to the Procurement List later
must comply with the Rule of Two. In effect,
all future contracting opportunities will flow
through the Vets First Program.
Finally, it should be emphasized that in
contrast with PDS Consultants, this intent
is wholly consistent with the Supreme
Court’s opinion in Kingdomware as well as
the congressional intent expressed in the
amici curiae brief submitted in conjunction
with that case and the functioning of the
Vets First Program since Kingdomware. I
share the solicitor general’s assessment, in
his December 9, 2019 response to Winston-
Salem Industries for the Blind’s petition,
that the treatment of ordering against Fed-
eral Supply Schedules, which was the matter
at issue in Kingdomware, is not generaliz-
able to the AbilityOne Program’s mandatory
source. It should also be noted that although
the AbilityOne Program’s status as a manda-
tory source is directly comparable to that of
the Federal Prison Industries Program, also
known as UNICOR, and these two programs
present a similar question as to their rela-
tionship to the Vets First Program, the vol-
ume of usage of Federal Prison Industries in
VA has declined to a minimal level and no
longer represents a significant controversy.
For this reason, H.R. 4920 does not address
Federal Prison Industries.

Historically Black Colleges and Universities

graduate 26 percent of all black bachelor’s de-
grees and 32 percent of STEM degrees
earned by black students. Having a degree
from an HBCU lifts the lifetime earnings of a

SPEECH OF
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 16, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support
of H.R. 4998, the Secure and Trusted Com-
munications Networks Act of 2019, as amend-
ed.
For nearly a decade I’ve raised how the
vulnerabilities in our telecommunications infra-
structure directly impact our national security.
On November 2, 2010, I wrote to the Chair-
man of the Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC) expressing grave concerns about
Huawei and ZTE, which have opaque relation-
ships with the Chinese government, and I re-
quest that my letter be entered into the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD.
Sadly, in the intervening nine years many
small and rural providers have invested hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in equipment made
by Huawei and ZTE because the equipment is
the cheapest available, and this investment
was often funded by the FCC’s own programs.
I’m pleased that H.R. 4998 addresses this
problem by strengthening the supply chain of
the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure by
prohibiting purchases of compromised equip-
ment when FCC funds are used. The bill also
creates a program to assist providers with the
costs of removing and replacing prohibited
equipment. This is necessary since smaller
providers can’t afford these upgrades on their
own.
However, H.R. 4998 is limited to strength-
ening our supply chain issue and is not a
comprehensive network security effort. The
threats we face are constantly evolving, and
Congress must remain diligent in ensuring our
communications are secure, private, and reli-
able.
I support H.R. 4998 and urge my colleagues
to do the same.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
WASHINGTON, DC, NOVEMBER 2, 2010.
Hon. JULIUS GENACHOWSKI,
Chairman, Federal Communications Commis-
sion, Washington, DC
DEAR CHAIRMAN GENACHOWSKI, As a senior
member of the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence, I have had grave
concerns about the implications of foreign-
controlled telecommunications infrastruc-
ture companies providing equipment to the
U.S. market for quite some time. In par-
ticular, I’m very concerned that Huawei and
ZTE, Chinese telecommunications infra-
structure manufacturers are looking to in-
crease their presence in the U.S.
These companies have long-standing rela-
tionships with the Chinese People’s Libera-
tion Army, and are not subject to the same
kinds of independence and corporate trans-
parency that other countries require of their
telecommunications companies.
Last May, I wrote to the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence and asked him to assess
the national security implications of Chi-
nese-origin telecommunications equipment
on our law enforcement arid intelligence ef-
forts, as well as on our switched-tele-
communications infrastructure. While I can-
not discuss the results of that assessment in
an unclassified letter, suffice to say the an-
swers were troubling, and the National
Counter Intelligence Executive has made
communications infrastructure security a
top priority.
Huawei and ZTE have recently taken ag-
gressive steps to increase penetration into
the U.S. telecommunications market. This
summer, Huawei was in discussions with
Sprint to provide mobile telecommuni-
cations equipment. And in August of 2009,
Huawei signed a deal with Clearwire to pro-
vide equipment to their wireless network.
Unlike mergers and acquisitions by foreign
firms, agreements to directly supply equip-
ment to the U.S. telecommunications infra-
structure are not subject to CFIUS require-
ments.
However, the net result is the same, where
sensitive U.S. communications will travel
over the networks and switches provided by
a foreign-controlled entity.
Clearly, the current CFIUS regime does
not provide scrutiny of procurements from
foreign companies to assess the risk to the
U.S. telecommunications infrastructure. I
would like to understand what your role is
to protect the U.S. networks in order to as-
sess what additional legislation may be
needed.
Do you have authority to protect the U.S.
telecommunications infrastructure from in-
appropriate foreign control or influence?
What authorities do you have to review
procurements of foreign equipment by U.S.
companies operating our telecommuni-
cations networks? What additional authori-
ties would you need to ensure that the U.S.

To what extent are you working with our

the threat to our telecommunications infra-
structure? What is, or should be, the inter-
agency structure to best review procure-
ments from foreign entities?
What kinds of transparency requirements,
including divestment from state ownership,
should be placed on companies seeking to
sell telecommunications infrastructure
equipment to U.S. network providers?
Should this be a U.S. or an international
standard?
Our nation’s telecommunications infra-

no quit in this team, which demonstrated the
relentlessness of a champion team all year.
The Bruins had 14 comeback victories

On their way to the National Champion-
ship—the 13th in program history—the Bruins
led the entire NCAA Tournament in batting av-
erage (.317); runs scored (79); slugging per-
centage (.548); and home runs (18). They
dominated all competitors in their way, never
trailing an inning in the WCWS.
Congratulations to all of the players, coach-
es, and training staff on securing another na-

Tuesday, December 17, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the James Madison High School
(JMHS) Marching Ensemble and to offer my
congratulations on its historic 2019 competi-
tion season. The band is known as ‘‘The Pride
of Vienna’’ and this year has proven that this
title is well-deserved.
In October 2019, JMHS won the Bands of
America (BOA) Mid-Atlantic Regional Cham-
pionship which was held in College Park, MD.
JMHS is the only Virginia high school to win
a BOA Regional competition in the past 40
years.
The band then went on to win the Virginia
Marching Band Cooperative State Champion-
ship held in Lynchburg, VA. This is the second
year in a row that JMHS was named Virginia
state champion. Following its thrilling success
at the BOA Regional competition, the band
traveled to Indianapolis, IN where it competed
in the BOA Grand National Championship—an
accomplishment that is unmet by any other
Fairfax County Public High School band. This
competition was held over the course of three
days in November. After a strong preliminary
performance, JMHS advanced to the semi-
finals and was named 2nd Place in Class 3A.
This marks the band’s most successful trip
ever to the Grand Nationals.
The JMHS Marching Ensemble is led by Mr.
Michael Hackbarth, Director of Bands, a posi-
tion he has held since 2001. In this role, he is
the director for the Wind Symphony, the Sym-
phonic Band, the Jazz Ensemble, and the
Marching Ensemble. Under his leadership, the
music programs have won numerous regional,
state and national honors. Mr. Hackbarth and
his dedicated team created this year’s show
entitled ‘‘Dusk ’till Dawn’’ and utilized music,
color guard costumes, stage make-up, props
and scenic backdrops. Preparation for this
year’s performances began on August 5, the
first day of summer band camp, and he and
the 150 members of the ensemble spent
countless hours perfecting the show and pre-
paring for a rigorous competition season, while
also performing at football games, in the
Homecoming Parade and in the Vienna Hal-
loween Parade.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in congratulating the James Madison
High School Marching Ensemble and Mr. Mi-
chael Hackbarth on the inspiring success of
the 2019 season. Together they made history
and will carry with them a lifetime of memo-
ries. I also want to commend the parents and
volunteers whose efforts made each show
possible. Collectively, you are the ‘‘Pride of
Virginia’’ and I wish you the very best of luck
and continued success in your future endeav-
ors.

December 17, 2019
BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT ACCU-
RACY AND TECHNOLOGICAL
AVAILABILITY ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 16, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong
support of H.R. 4229, the Broadband Deploy-
ment Accuracy and Technological Availability
Act, as amended.
We all agree that every American needs ac-
cess to broadband. Government agencies,
companies, and the philanthropic sector have
devoted significant resources toward this goal,
but our efforts are stymied by the fact that we
have a fundamentally flawed understanding of
where the investment is needed.
We need accurate maps to be able to close
the digital divide and the Federal Communica-
tions Commission (FCC) should wait until
these maps are developed before spending
billions of dollars in additional subsidies to
build out to unserved and underserved areas.
I commend Representatives LOEBSACK and
LATTA, along with all of the members of the
Subcommittee on Communications and Tech-
nology for their diligent work to find a bipar-
tisan solution to this problem that will solve
our mapping problem once and for all.
I’m also pleased that the legislation includes
an amendment I authored that protects the pri-
vacy of Americans. The bill allows the FCC to
contract out the development of a database of
all buildings developed by processing millions
of property records about every home, busi-
ness, and community institution in the country.
These records often include private data about
property owners and the property itself, includ-
ing property values.
My provision simply prohibits the FCC’s
contractor from selling this vast amount of
data for marketing or other purposes, a prac-
tice common among data brokers. Our country
doesn’t need more data brokers. Any com-
pany using money authorized by Congress
should only use its work product for the ben-
efit of the American people in the ways that
we expressly authorize.
I’m a proud cosponsor of this legislation,
and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.

HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE OFFICE OF LEGIS-
LATIVE COUNSEL
HON. ZOE LOFGREN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, December 17, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Office of the Legislative
Counsel of the House of Representatives on
the occasion of its 100th anniversary. The Of-
fice’s legal and drafting expertise is crucial to
the House’s core constitutional function of
making law.
The Office was established by section 1303
of the Revenue Act of 1918 (P. L. 65–254, 40
Stat. 1057) as the Legislative Drafting Service
with the charge of aiding ‘‘in drafting public
bills and resolutions or amendments thereto
on the request of any committee[.]’’ While the
early work of the Office was focused on
projects for the Committee on Ways and
Means, other committees, recognizing the
value of expert drafting, soon began request-
ing assistance. The Office now works with all
of the committees and Members of the House
in every area of Federal law, working with pol-
icy makers to produce legally effective legisla-
tive drafts.
Throughout the Office’s history, it has pro-
vided exceptional drafting services on a non-
partisan, impartial, and confidential basis.
Speaking during the floor debate on the estab-
lishment of the Office, the Chairman of the
Committee on Ways and Means described the
services of Middleton Beaman, who was the
first head of the Office, as ‘‘essential’’ and the
Committee as being ‘‘indebted’’ to him for
clarifying and simplifying the complex legisla-
tive provisions on which he worked. The
Chairman emphasized that Beaman had al-
ways been ‘‘absolutely neutral’’ on policy mat-
ters.
The Office continues to uphold the high
standard established by Beaman. A 1975 re-
port by the House Commission on Information
and Facilities concluded that there was ‘‘an
unmistakable consensus among those who
utilize the services of the Office of Legislative
Counsel, Members and committee staff alike,
that its overall operation is indeed a credit to
the House.’’ Over a quarter of a century later,
in H. Res. 635 of the 111th Congress, the
House recognized ‘‘the professional, non-
partisan service to which the Office of the Leg-
islative Counsel is dedicated.’’
While carrying outthe purpose described in
the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 of
achieving ‘‘a clear, faithful, and coherent ex-
pression of legislative policies,’’ the Office has
also become an increasingly important source
of institutional memory. Most of its attorneys,
paralegals, Ramseyer staff, IT staff, front desk
staff, and GPO detailees spend a career in
service of the House with many staying for
decades.
Such long tenures allow the Office to serve
as a source of education and expertise on
Congress’ role in making law, including the
process for introducing, amending, and pass-
ing legislation. The staff of the Office of Legis-
lative Counsel do more than provide drafts
and legal advice; they teach. As committee
and Member staff transition into more senior
positions on and off the Hill, they take the les-
sons learned from working with the Office and
apply them for the rest of their careers.
It is my honor and privilege to recognize the
Office of the Legislative Counsel of the House
of Representatives. For 100 years, the Office
has proved essential to the House in the
achievement of a clear, faithful, and coherent
expression of legislative policies.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOE CARDONA
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, December 17, 2019
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise in
recognition of Joe Cardona, the award-winning
documentarian and former Miami Herald col-
umnist. Mr. Cardona recently received a David
Burke Distinguished Journalism Award from
the United States Agency for Global Media
(USAGM) for his show ‘‘Arcoiris,’’ the first pro-
gram in Radio Marti’s history to address
LGBTQ+ issues in Cuba.
‘‘Arcoiris,’’ which means rainbow in Spanish,
premiered last year and is produced and
hosted by Mr. Cardona. The program provides
a platform for the LGBTQ+ community in
Cuba to express goals and concerns and to
engage with other LGBTQ+ communities
around the world. ‘‘Arcoiris’’ has already been
enormously successful. The show has aired
numerous stories, including on the experi-
ences of gay prisoners in Cuba and the poli-
cies of Mariela Castro, director of Cuba’s Na-
tional Center for Sexual Education
(CENESEX).
Mr. Cardona has created a space for the
long-underserved LGBTQ community to pros-
per. I’m proud that USAGM has recognized
his important work.

THE NEED FOR REVISIONS TO THE
PFIC INSURANCE EXCEPTION
FOR FINANCIAL GUARANTY IN-
SURANCE COMPANIES
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, December 17, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I thank the
Speaker and the Chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee for working on an end of
year bipartisan tax package and helping Con-
gress get on with the business of legislating.
While I wish that our colleagues in the Senate
would take up Butch Lewis, which the House
passed in July, and addresses the multiem-
ployer pension crisis affecting millions of retir-
ees across the country and I wish my col-
leagues across the aisle would have sup-
ported the Ways and Means Committee’s ad-
vancement of legislation to expand the Earned
Income Tax Credit and make the Child Tax
Credit fully refundable, it’s important for our
constituents to see Congress working to-
gether.
I also know that many Americans are wait-
ing for Congress to make essential fixes to the
tax code in response to the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act and were hoping that Congress
would add these fixes to our year-end tax
package. While a couple such fixes were
made, many vital revisions were left out.
I am planning to introduce bipartisan legisla-
tion early next year that will fix an unintended
consequence of the recent changes to the in-
surance business exception to the passive for-
eign investment company, or PFIC, rules. I
urge my colleagues to join me in this effort
and cosponsor this upcoming legislation espe-
cially Members who are aware of the impor-
tance of available and affordable municipal
bond financing to state and local municipali-
ties.
This legislation is necessary to preserve the
availability and affordability of financial guar-
anty insurance with respect to municipal bond
financing for state and local municipalities. I
have worked in close consultation with the
staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation in de-
veloping this legislation to ensure that it pro-
vides a narrow exception for financial guaran-
tors that is specifically designed to address
the issue affecting municipal bond insurance
in a manner that preserves the closing of a

loophole for foreign hedge funds, the intended
targets of the recent changes.
As I work with stakeholders and colleagues
to finalize this legislation, I understand that the
Treasury Department and the Internal Rev-
enue Service are currently working on final-
izing regulations with respect to the PFIC in-
surance business exception. I am particularly
encouraged that the Treasury Department and
the Internal Revenue Service specifically re-
quested comments with respect to the applica-
tion of those regulations to financial guaranty
insurance. I would encourage the Treasury
Department and the Internal Revenue Service
to carefully consider the comments received
pursuant to their request in light of the pend-
ing introduction and consideration of my legis-
lation to address as much as possible any un-
intended consequences with respect to finan-
cial guarantors.

CELEBRATING THE PASSAGE OF
THE FY2020 NDAA
HON. KENDRA S. HORN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, December 17, 2019
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I applaud the House for
passing the FY20 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act in an overwhelming bipartisan vote.
This bill includes important modernizations
and protections for our service members, mili-
tary families, and our nation’s Armed Forces.
It was an honor to represent Oklahomans as
one of four freshmen on the House Armed
Services Committee included at the bill’s con-
ference.
This legislation includes a Tenants Bill of
Rights to address unsafe housing conditions
on military bases and other critical protections
for service members in privatized base hous-
ing. I led the effort in the House for these pro-
tections after hearing about military housing
problems at Tinker Air Force Base during one
of my town halls. The Tenants Bill of Rights
will protect our military families from predatory
contracts and provide increased oversight of
privatized base housing.
I am proud this bill included legislation I in-
troduced to address a severe shortage of pi-
lots in both our Air Force and in the aviation
industry. My provision would assist JROTC
members in getting their pilot’s certificate. In
Oklahoma, Air Force JROTC provides special-
ized aeronautics and space education. With
about 1,000 students participating in Air Force
JROTC units alone, these programs provide
an important and unique service to strengthen
our aerospace workforce of the future.
This need will only become more pro-
nounced with the establishment of the United
States Space Corps within the Department of
the Air Force. As the Chair of the Space Sub-
committee of the Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee, I have heard from and
worked with experts who recognize the immi-
nent threats that our existing space infrastruc-
ture face. Satellites that offer geolocation serv-
ices, weather data, and communications are
all necessary elements to our modem day in-
frastructure. Our new Space Corps will protect
these interests from natural catastrophes while
deterring aggression from those intent on
harming U.S. national security.
This bill also came with vital reforms to bet-
ter our servicemembers daily lives.
The FY20 NDAA includes a 3.1% pay in-
crease for all military personnel. Members of
our uniformed services have not received a
pay raise in far too long. As a result, our serv-
icemember have experienced financial dif-
ficulty and have struggled to put food on the
table for their family members even while they
serve their country. I am proud to represent
the servicemembers of my district and thankful
to have a part in ensuring they are well com-
pensated.
This bill provides 12 weeks of parental leave
for all federal employees. A landmark policy
for the U.S. government, we passed an NDAA
that ensures all families can have the support
they need in the crucial first month of starting
or expanding their families. The US is the only
industrialized nation without a national paid
family leave policy, and this is a step in the
right direction to ensure all families have the
opportunity to work and take care of their fam-
ilies.
It preserves funding for critical education
needs. We passed a $40 million authorization
to support the schools that educate our
servicemembers’ children. The Impact Aid pro-
gram has maintained schools in areas with
small to non-existent tax bases such as Indian
reservations and military bases. This funding
increase ensures that every student, no matter
their zip code may have equal access to an
education.
The passage of the FY20 NDAA also came
with crucial reforms to streamline internal
processes and ensure transparency in our De-
fense Department.
As the sponsor of Section 1011, 1 was con-
cerned that requiring audit firms to disclose
confidential disciplinary proceedings could ulti-
mately lead to those proceedings becoming
public, contrary to the express intent of Con-
gress. I sponsored an amendment that rem-
edies that concern. The best way to avoid
such an outcome is for the DoD to permit con-
tracting accounting firms to provide relevant
proceeding information to the Department.
This preserves the confidentiality requirements
of Sarbanes-Oxley while remaining consistent
with the confidentiality provision included in
the conference report.
In addition, I wish to make the observation
that with respect to Section 1011, which
amends Section 1006 of the FY 2019 NDAA,
the disclosure provision covers ‘‘associated
persons’’ in addition to the accounting firm be-
cause it is important for the DoD to know
whether individuals that the accounting firm
assigns to work on DoD audit contracts are
subject to ongoing disciplinary proceedings.
This bill also addresses a major problem
that has plagued our service members
spouses for far too long. The Survivor Benefit
Plan/ Dependency and Indemnity Compensa-
tion (SBP/DIC) offset, also known as the ‘‘wid-
ow’s tax’’ unfairly asked military spouses to
forfeit money owed to them. More than 60,000
surviving military spouses were negatively af-
fected by this tax, including many in my dis-
trict. The FY20 NDAA repeals this reduction
over a three-year phase-in, allowing surviving
families to collect both payments in full, receiv-
ing the justice they deserve.
On employment practices, I worked tire-
lessly to extend direct hiring authority to do-
mestic defense industrial base facilities when
hiring civilian personnel. After extensive con-
versations with Lieutenant General Donald E.
Gene Kirkland, the Commander of the Air
Force Sustainment Center, I resolved to work
to stem the staffing shortages at these crucial
bases. These staffing shortages are hap-
pening across the nation, and reforms are crit-
ical to meet the workforce needs of today and
tomorrow. I am happy to note that direct hiring
authority reform was granted for civilian per-
sonnel at domestic defense industrial base fa-
cilities and the Major Range and Test Facility
bases until 2025. These necessary changes
are vital to meeting our national security and
readiness needs.
I am also glad to note that this legislation in-
creased the cap for DoD sole-source contracts
that can be awarded to the tribal community.
The cap was raised to $100 million to ensure
that our Native American businesses and con-
tractors are given the opportunities to provide
services for our military effectively.
The National Defense Authorization Act is
the proud product of bipartisan policies and
compromise and ensures the needs of our
men and women in uniform are met on and off
the battlefield. I am proud to have been a part
of the process from subcommittee to passage
and applaud my colleagues for achieving this
reform through compromise and negotiation,
to secure major accomplishments for all Amer-
icans while promoting our national security.
