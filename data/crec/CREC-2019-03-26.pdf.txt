HONORING CAPTAIN ADAM
CHAMIE’S TWO YEARS AS THE
COAST GUARD’S LIAISON TO
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD) for 5
minutes.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I have the honor of serving as chair-
woman of the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on Homeland Security.
The subcommittee is charged with
overseeing the funding of our Nation’s
longest continuous seagoing service,
the United States Coast Guard.
Since the Coast Guard’s founding in
1790 by Alexander Hamilton, Americans
have relied on this service to protect
our maritime interests. The Coast
Guard has secured our sovereignty in
times of war and peace and safeguarded
the American public during times of
national catastrophe.
As one of the five branches of the
U.S. Armed Forces, the Coast Guard
serves as a critical link between the
Department of Defense and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security.
My role as chairwoman of the DHS
Appropriations Subcommittee and pre-
viously as the subcommittee’s ranking
member has afforded me the oppor-
tunity to more fully appreciate the
challenging work of the men and
women of the Coast Guard. This in-
cludes saving more than 11,000 lives
after the devastating impacts of Hurri-
canes Maria, Irma, Harvey, Florence,
and Michael, to the cumulative inter-
diction of 432 tons of cocaine over the
past 2 years.
One of the greatest exemplars of
Coastie dedication and effectiveness is
Captain Adam Chamie, who has served
as the Coast Guard liaison to the House
of Representatives for the past 2 years.
Adam has consistently demonstrated
an ability to effectively convey the
critical needs of the Coast Guard to
both Members of Congress and staff,
while also supporting the Coast
Guard’s responses to the needs of
States and congressional districts
across the country.
Over his 2-year tenure as liaison, he
has helped facilitate the Coast Guard’s
two largest annual funding levels in
the service’s history.
On April 18, 2019, Adam will take
command of Coast Guard Sector Key
West, an area from the Bahamas to
Cuba encompassing 55,000 square nau-
tical miles.
While his departure is a loss to the
House, the men and women of the
Coast Guard serving along the Florida
Keys will greatly benefit from his lead-
ership and his commitment to the
Coast Guard’s core values of honor, re-
spect, and devotion to duty.
I wish Captain Chamie fair winds and
following seas as he starts a new chap-
ter in his career.
Today, I ask my colleagues to please
join me in recognizing this great Amer-
ican and Coast Guardsman for his self-
less service to our Nation.
f
CALLING FOR DEBATE ON THE
GREEN NEW DEAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I rise to call for debate in this
Chamber on H. Res. 109, referred to as
the Green New Deal.
This resolution lays out an agenda
that is, frankly, anti-American and
goes against everything our Constitu-
tion is all about.
The resolution states: ‘‘It is the duty
of the Federal Government to create a
Green New Deal.’’
The main components of this deal in-
clude: net-zero greenhouse gas emis-
sions; creating millions of good, high-
wage jobs; and upgrading all existing
buildings and building new buildings to
achieve maximum energy efficiency,
water efficiency, safety, affordability,
comfort, and durability. All of this is
to be accomplished in 10 years’ time.
Among the things the Federal Gov-
ernment has meddled in beyond the
scope of its limited powers, completely
overhauling every building and method
of transportation in the country would
be, by far, its most egregious trans-
gression to date.
However, the Green New Deal cer-
tainly will require Congress’ constitu-
tional authority to levy taxes and bor-
row money to pay for it.
This so-called ‘‘deal’’ would come at
the cost of trillions to the middle class

H2800 March 26, 2019
and spend taxpayers’ hard-earned
money, as if they don’t know best how
to use their money and need the gov-
ernment to do it for them.
The Green New Deal reflects zero un-
derstanding of moral hazard and the
government’s capacity for waste, sug-
gesting the government assume the
risks in the unchartered research and
development this socialist experiment
would require. The way the resolu-
tion’s supporters see it, money will
simply be put back into the economy
and create millions of new jobs. They
think nothing of the fact that these ac-
tions actually take power away from
‘‘We the people.’’
Now, in light of the Senate taking up
this resolution for a vote this week, I
would like to offer some thoughts as to
why it needs deeper thought and debate
in the House.
America is currently on a sustainable
plan with its all-of-the-above energy
strategy, including renewable, oil, gas,
coal, and nuclear sources.
Renewables presently make up 17
percent of U.S. electric power genera-
tion, and despite enormous subsidies,
are far from capable of serving as ex-
clusive energy sources that are reliant
and affordable. Yet, since 2005, use of
cheap natural gas has reduced carbon
emissions from power generation by 30
percent.
Our current approach encourages de-
velopment of renewable sources and ac-
counts for both environment and mone-
tary costs.
This resolution instead throws
money exclusively at renewables and
entirely eliminates the oil, gas, and
coal industries.
Secondly, if the goal is to build the
middle class and create jobs, why go in
completely the opposite direction of
what has worked to create over 5 mil-
lion jobs in the past 2 years?
Reducing the Federal footprint with
regulatory reform and middle-class tax
cuts have caused wages to rise, job
growth to soar, and consistently low
rates of unemployment. Allowing small
businesses to keep more of their money
has worked to create jobs and increase
wages.
We certainly don’t need to raise
taxes and spend more money to create
this effect.
Finally, this massive government
intervention will push businesses over-
seas and disrupt the lives of workers,
farmers, and students making the most
of America’s abounding opportunities.
Americans cherish freedom, which in-
cludes the ability for individuals to de-
termine their own paths without the
Government deciding how they will
contribute to society.
The Socialist ideology behind this
resolution is at odds with the Amer-
ican values that have caused our soci-
ety to flourish and innovate since its
founding.
I encourage the 90 House Democrats
who have cosponsored H. Res. 109 and
Speaker PELOSI to engage in serious
and open debate on this legislation, or
at least publish a new fact sheet they
can stand behind so accurate represen-
tations of opposing viewpoints can be
heard by the American people.
f
THE POWER OF EDUCATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to salute the tremendous work
by several Ohioans and to reflect on
what the power of education has on our
young people today, as reflected by the
boards.
It has been said: ‘‘A quality edu-
cation has the power to transform soci-
eties in a single generation, provide
children with the protection they need
from the hazards of poverty, labor ex-
ploitation, and disease, and give them
the knowledge, skills, and confidence
to reach their full potential.’’
I met with Columbus City Schools
Board of Education members W.
Shawna Gibbs, Michael Cole, and
Gahanna-Jefferson Public School
Board President Beryl Brown
Piccolantonio. These three dedicated
educators and advocates, along with a
whole host of others from across the
Third Congressional District, are work-
ing day and night to ensure every child
has the knowledge, skills, and con-
fidence to reach their full potential.
Across my whole district, whether
that be Worthington, East Columbus,
Reynoldsburg, to Groveport Madison,
and everywhere in between, people re-
spect the power of education.
Another Ohioan committed to mak-
ing this goal a reality for more stu-
dents is Jamie Spero. For over a dec-
ade, Jamie has been with Sandusky
City Schools, where she currently
teaches ninth grade English.
Her hard work and unique ability to
connect with students and people has
made all the difference. Under her tu-
telage, students have achieved an 85
percent passage rate on the State apti-
tude test, and in the process, achieved
the highest value-added score in the
English department 2 years in a row.
Mr. Speaker, we need more people
like Jamie, Shawna, Michael, and
Beryl.
Or as Jamie recently said to me:
We need more educators to let students
know daily that they can achieve anything
they can put their minds to no matter their
race, abilities, or anything negative they
have been told.
Yes, America’s next generation of
leaders are today’s students, and many
will go on to be great teachers, doctors,
first responders, lawyers, scientists, as-
tronauts, you name it, and, yes, even
Members of Congress.
So I was particularly honored to find
out that two of my youngest constitu-
ents were inspired by me.
Recently, Catharine dressed up as me
for Worthington Evening Street
Elementary’s Black History Month liv-
ing wax museum.
Similarly, Jamia, a student at A-
Plus Children’s Academy Community
School, did a presentation on my dec-
ades-long service to central Ohio.
As part of their projects, Catharine
and Jamia highlighted my career. I am
flattered, but I want them to know,
and every other young person, that
being the first is great, but we need to
have a second and third, because each
of us has the responsibility to mentor
the next generation.
For example, last month, students
from Grace Christian School in
Blacklick, including a student, 5 years
old in kindergarten, were studying
Martin Luther King’s ‘‘I Have a
Dream’’ speech, and 5-year-old Leah
said:
We learned what happened to people like
Ruby Bridges and Rosa Parks just wasn’t
right. We should treat everyone fairly.
So I stand here today on the shoul-
ders of heroes and sheroes who have in-
spired Americans of all backgrounds
for decades, even centuries, to still do
that: treat people fairly.
Mr. Speaker, whether it is the KIPP
School, Bexley High School, Ohio
Media School, Columbus Africentric, or
Columbus School for Girls, King fa-
mously said: ‘‘The function of edu-
cation is to teach one to think inten-
sively and to think critically. Intel-
ligence plus character, that is the goal
of true education.’’
Thanks to all the hardworking teach-
ers, educators, parents, mentors past
and present, students in central Ohio
and far beyond are embracing the
power of education and its positive ef-
fect on the lives of so many in our
classrooms.
Let us salute these students and
teachers for a job well done.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS WEEK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, this week, our Nation
celebrates Public Schools Week. It is a
time when we acknowledge the diver-
sity and success of our public schools
and the sound education that they pro-
vide. Strengthening America’s public
schools is the best way to ensure our
children’s future success and our coun-
try’s prosperity.
Ninety percent of American children
attend public schools. This week, sup-
porters across the country will share
stories of the many schools, students,
and professionals who make public
schools such vital components of our
communities. This includes parents
who are working hard to improve edu-
cational outcomes for children. Advo-
cates nationwide will share scores of
stories about public school students
and their successes.
Mr. Speaker, public school teachers
truly make a difference in the lives of
our students. They prepare them for
bright and successful futures. It is

their dedication to our students that
builds strong public schools and, there-
fore, strong communities.
As a senior member of the Education
and Labor Committee and a product of
public schools, I know the incredible
role our schools play in communities
across the Nation.
Public schools today have much good
news to share, from increasing gradua-
tion rates and reduced dropout rates,
to improved ratings given by commu-
nities on school performance.
Public schools welcome every child,
regardless of ability, race, wealth, lan-
guage, country of origin, or needs. By
strengthening the public school sys-
tem, we strengthen the democracy of
our country.
Supporting public schools today will
build a stronger workforce for tomor-
row. The future of our Nation to
produce in the manufacturing industry,
the farm, and the information age will
be based on the investment we make
today in supporting public schools.
Schools today are integrating the new
ideas that are being explored by busi-
nesses and industry.
Strong public schools are vital to our
national security. Our military’s suc-
cess is dependent on members who can
apply their knowledge and skills to
navigate the increasingly complex
tools that keep our country safe.
In many communities, the school dis-
trict is the largest employer. Teachers,
bus drivers, administrators, cafeteria
workers, coaches, and facilities man-
agement all depend on the school dis-
trict, and all these jobs contribute to
the fabric of a community. Commu-
nities are stronger and schools are bet-
ter when we all work together to sup-
port public education.
Public schools also make sure kids
receive at least one nutritious meal a
day. More than 30 million school
lunches are served each day, including
20 million free and 2 million reduced
priced lunches. For some students, the
only meal that they receive will be the
one that they get at school.
Mr. Speaker, a child’s opportunity
for success should not be left to
chance. Every child needs a quality,
well-equipped school right in their
neighborhood, where they can learn, be
inspired, and thrive.
Public education has always been the
great equalizer in the United States. I
am grateful for the contribution of our
public schools, and I know that, to-
gether, we will continue to work to
strengthen them for our most precious
resource: our children.

HONORING ANNE BEILER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, March
is Women’s History Month. I would
like to take this time to honor a nota-
ble woman from my district, Ms. Anne
Beiler, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
Anne is well known in our commu-
nity but is also well known and beloved
throughout the world, since she is the
founder of Auntie Anne’s pretzels. She
was born into an Amish family, and her
parents became members of the Amish
Mennonite church when she was 3
years old. She was a baker and a bread
maker and worked at a waitressing job,
which taught her the values of hard
work and customer service. She
learned to make pretzels when she
worked at a food stand in a farmer’s
market.
Eventually, she started her own pret-
zel business. In 1989, she opened the
first franchises throughout central
Pennsylvania. Auntie Anne’s unmis-
takable pretzel aroma can frequently
be smelled in malls around the country
and the world, and I am very honored
to recognize her hard work here today.
Anne has also been instrumental in
supporting many organizations and
causes in our community. Currently,
she serves on the board of the Museum
of the Bible here in Washington, D.C. I
am honored to recognize Anne Beiler
on Women’s History Month.
HONORING MARILYN WARE
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, March
is Women’s History Month. I would
like to honor a notable woman from
my district, Ms. Marilyn Ware, of Lan-
caster, Pennsylvania.
Ms. Ware was CEO of American
Water Works. During that time, she
grew that company to a market cap of
$8.3 billion.
Marilyn was also involved in the
local community, serving as chair of
the Lancaster County GOP from 1978 to
1980. She was a pioneer in fundraising
and cared deeply about the direction of
our State and our country. She was al-
ways doing all that she could to make
sure our country was on the right path.
In our local community, she was a life-
time advocate of farmland and open
space preservation.
From 2006 to 2008, Marilyn served as
Ambassador to Finland. She was pas-
sionate and hardworking, always look-
ing to make a difference and to recruit
young people into the world of politics.
Unfortunately, Marilyn passed away
in 2017, but she left a lasting legacy for
women and for people all across my
district. It is an honor to recognize her
on the House floor today.
HONORING JACKIE PFURSICH
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, March
is Women’s History Month. I would
like to honor a notable woman from
my district, Ms. Jackie Pfursich, of
Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
Jackie currently serves as the Lan-
caster County clerk of courts, where
she has served since 2016. Since then,
she has improved the court system by
modernizing the criminal court with an
electronic filing system. This allows
attorneys and case participants to file
documents electronically and helps
speed up our court process and make it
more efficient.
Jackie began her legal career as an
assistant attorney for the Pennsyl-
vania Office of General Counsel, De-
partment of Labor and Industry, where
she prosecuted those who violated the
Commonwealth’s labor laws.
She resides in East Hempfield with
her husband, Ed; and children, Ella,
Nathan, and Tyler. Jackie is an exam-
ple of a strong, innovative, and hard-
working woman. I am honored to rec-
ognize her on the floor of the House
today.
HONORING PEGGY STEINMAN
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, March
is Women’s History Month. I would
like to honor a notable woman from
my district, Ms. Beverly ‘‘Peggy’’
Steinman, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
Peggy served as the chairwoman for
Steinman Communications. Her fam-
ily’s business history in our area actu-
ally began not long after the founding
of the country. They were responsible
for publishing many of the local papers
in our area, including our daily news-
paper, the LNP, and Lancaster Farm-
ing. Peggy took helm of the companies
in 2010 and did an extraordinary job of
leading Steinman Communications.
More importantly, Peggy is a leader
in our community in philanthropy, al-
ways working to make Lancaster
County a better place. She served on
the leadership boards of the United
Way of Lancaster and, currently,
works with the Steinman Foundation
to improve the quality of life for people
in our community. She loves our com-
munity and is always giving back. For
that reason, I am honored to recognize
her on the floor of the House today.

ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIME VICTIMS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise, once again, to share stories of
Americans who once were vibrant and
alive but now are dead because Wash-
ington’s open borders policies fail to
protect our own people.
I yearn for the day when there are no
more speeches like this to give because
we have secured our borders and there
are no more illegal alien killings to de-
scribe.
On average, roughly 2,000 illegal
aliens are apprehended each year by
Federal agents for homicides com-
mitted on American soil. Another,
roughly, 120,000 illegal aliens are ar-
rested each year for other criminal ac-
tivity, including 50,000 assaults and
15,000 sexual assaults.
For emphasis, behind each statistic
is a crime victim who would have been
spared if America simply secured our
porous southern border.
In Marshall County, Alabama, an il-
legal alien was recently arrested for
first-degree rape of a 12-year-old girl.
According to Marshall County Sheriff
Phil Sims, the illegal alien had at least
10 different aliases, four different birth
dates, and two prior deportations. In
2008, the illegal alien was charged with
DUI in Louisiana and deported. In 2009,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2802 March 26, 2019
the illegal alien was deported yet again
for illegal reentry. This first-degree
rape of a 12-year-old girl would have
been prevented by proper border secu-
rity.
In Mobile, Alabama, Sonya Jones was
recently killed by an illegal alien
charged with vehicular homicide and
leaving the scene of a head-on colli-
sion. Sonya Jones was a teacher at Liv-
ing Word Christian Center Kingdom
Academy. One of Sonya’s colleagues
said that she had a smile that would
light up the hallways.
The illegal alien who killed Sonya
Jones is a prime example of how dan-
gerous asylum laws and catch-and-re-
lease policies are to Americans. Sonya
Jones’ illegal alien killer entered
America illegally and was captured by
law enforcement but then released
when he lied to claim asylum. As is so
overwhelmingly often the case, Sonya
Jones’ illegal alien killer failed to
show up in court on the asylum claim
and, instead, disappeared, leaving at
least one dead American in his wake.
Last week, in Washington State,
Kittitas County Sheriff’s Deputy Ryan
Thompson was shot and killed by yet
another illegal alien who legally en-
tered America in Texas in 2014 on a
temporary agricultural worker visa but
illegally overstayed his visa after it ex-
pired. Deputy Ryan Thompson was
married with three children and is the
first law enforcement officer to be
murdered in Kittitas County since 1927.
In 2005, in Milton, Pennsylvania,
beautiful 20-year-old Carly Snyder
loved animals and dreamed of being a
veterinarian. Her dream ended when an
illegal alien forcibly entered Carly’s
apartment, punched her in the face,
knocked her to the floor, and stabbed
her 37 times. Carly went into shock and
died at the scene.
Mr. Speaker, Washington should have
more sympathy and concern for the
lives of Americans than illegal aliens.
Unfortunately, Washington does not
and, instead, puts illegal aliens on ped-
estals, above the interests of Ameri-
cans.
Mr. Speaker, Americans have every
right to expect Congress to defend
American rights, and the most basic
right is the right to life, the right to be
protected from illegal alien killings
that could so easily be avoided.
Tragically, Congress turns a blind
eye to the lives and innocence of Amer-
icans stolen by illegal aliens. That is
wrong.
President Trump is right to declare a
national emergency to help save the
lives of at least 30,000 Americans who
are alive today but will be dead a year
from now if we do not protect and se-
cure America’s southern border. As
such, I will not hesitate to proudly
vote to sustain President Trump’s veto
of socialist legislation that supports
open-borders policies that aid and abet
illegal aliens who kill Americans and
aid and abet evil drug cartels that mar-
ket their poisonous, deadly drugs that
take American lives.
Mr. Speaker, Americans who die at
the hands of illegal aliens had dreams,
too.

WELCOMING REVEREND TONY LEE
The SPEAKER. Without objection,
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
BROWN) is recognized for 1 minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Speaker, let me begin by wishing you a
very happy birthday on behalf of the
435 Members of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to in-
troduce Reverend Tony Lee. He is the
founder and senior pastor of the Com-
munity of Hope AME Church.
Reverend Lee is a pillar of our com-
munity in Prince George’s County and
the entire region, not just as a faith
leader, but as an advocate for those in
need.
I have had a longstanding relation-
ship with him, partnering on a wide va-
riety of issues, including domestic vio-
lence, building trust between the com-
munity and law enforcement, tackling
poverty, and moving forward on social
justice issues. And, during the month
of January and February, we worked
together during the government shut-
down, serving working families who
were struggling to make ends meet.
I have had the privilege of worship-
ping at Community of Hope many
times over the years. The name of the
church reflects its character: a commu-
nity where we live and raise our fami-
lies, where we pray and teach hope as a
critical ingredient necessary for faith
and our daily lives.
He is a preacher who speaks to people
in a language they understand. He
draws people into church who would
not otherwise do so, going into every
neighborhood and going down every
street.
Reverend Tony Lee is the son of
proud parents, Orlando Lee and Rev-
erend Nancy T. Lee, who are joining us
in the Capitol today.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS NOT
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker,
I read with dismay this morning that
the Justice Department and the cur-
rent administration has decided to con-
tinue to treat the Affordable Care Act
as an unconstitutional wrong com-
mitted by the House and the Senate
and signed into law by the last admin-
istration. I can’t believe that they are
taking this position.
This has been a long national strug-
gle that we have gone through. We
have had this debate, we have had this
discussion, and we have had this fight.
And to say now that it continues to be
unconstitutional, the way that they
have said all along, we don’t need to do
this again. We have 10 to 20 million

Americans with preexisting conditions
that depend on the workings of the Af-
fordable Care Act to keep covered so
that they don’t have to file for bank-
ruptcy when they get sick, so that they
can move from job to job without wor-
rying about their healthcare coverage.
Let’s not do this again.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues here in the House to reject the
idea that the ACA is unconstitutional.

HEALTH CENTERS PLAY AN
ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THE U.S.
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak
about the essential role community
health centers play in neighborhoods
throughout the Nation.
America’s health centers serve 28
million patients who have the greatest
difficulty accessing healthcare. This
includes 24.9 million low-income pa-
tients; 3.5 million patients in or near
public housing; 1.4 million homeless
patients; nearly 1 million patients who
work in agriculture; and 6.2 million un-
insured patients.
Madam Speaker, community health
centers are located in areas of high
need and are open to everyone, regard-
less of insurance status or ability to
pay.
Congress recently made historic in-
vestments to the Health Center Pro-
gram, which increased access, expanded
services, and improved quality.
Health centers also play an impor-
tant role in rural America where the
need is great, but services are often
scarce.
And, each year, community health
centers generate approximately $54 bil-
lion in economic activity and save the
healthcare system an estimated $24 bil-
lion within our most underserved com-
munities.
Madam Speaker, we must ensure that
all Americans receive the services they
need, regardless of where they live, and
community health centers do that.
f
CLIMATE CHANGE
(Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, cli-
mate change is not a distant threat; it
is reality. In the Pacific Northwest,
our families and communities are fac-
ing acidic oceans; unhealthy, smoky
air; decreased snowpack; droughts; and
extreme weather patterns.
Recent reports from the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change and
the U.S. Global Change Research Pro-
gram make clear: human activity is
contributing to climate change. The
science supporting these reports is con-
vincing and alarming, but there is
hope. We have the opportunity and, in
fact, the imperative to take action
that will protect our planet and grow
our economy.
I am honored to serve on the House
Select Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis, and I will work with my colleagues
to reduce emissions, to transition to
100 percent clean energy, to create
good-paying jobs, rebuild our Nation’s
infrastructure in a sustainable and re-
silient manner, invest in clean and effi-
cient transportation systems, and sup-
port frontline communities, particu-
larly communities of color and low-in-
come communities, that have often
faced a disproportionate share of the
burden of our past inaction.
The future of our planet and the
health of our communities depend on
the actions we take today. For our
children, our grandchildren, and future
generations to come, let’s not wait.
f
AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE
TRANSPARENCY
(Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, over the past few weeks, I
have released the transcripts of the
interviews from Peter Strzok, Bruce
Ohr, and Lisa Page from the Judiciary
Committee’s investigation into appar-
ent wrongdoing at the FBI and DOJ. I
have said I would make additional
transcripts from the investigation pub-
lic, and I am here today to keep that
promise.
As I stated then, our interview tran-
scripts were pertinent to congressional
investigation. But the 115th Congress
ended, the investigation was closed,
and copies were shared with certain
Members of Congress.
Madam Speaker, I request that the
link www.dougcollins.house.gov/
papadopoulos be placed in the RECORD
so the American people can review the
transcript of George Papadopoulos. The
American people deserve to know the
origins of the probe against President
Trump’s campaign.
I will continue to release as many
transcripts as possible. The American
people deserve transparency.
f
MAKE QUALITY HEALTH
INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker,
Saturday, March 23, we celebrated the
ninth anniversary of the passage of the
Affordable Care Act, which has ex-
panded health insurance to over 20 mil-
lion people in the last 5 years. But
quality health insurance remains
unaffordable and out of reach for far
too many Americans.
Today, I introduced the Health Care
Affordability Act to help fix that and
reduce premiums for Americans who
purchase private health plans through
the marketplace.
My legislation would cut premiums
by hundreds or thousands of dollars per
year for more than 10 million people. It
does this by increasing the tax credits
people get to make premiums more af-
fordable and allowing more people to
qualify for tax credits.
This important improvement would
guarantee middle-class consumers
would pay no more than 81⁄2 percent of
their income on premiums. This would
be a huge help to families.
For example, in my district, a typical
family of four currently pays $1,741 per
month for marketplace coverage. With
my bill, their monthly premiums would
drop by nearly half.
A typical 60-year-old couple in my
district making $80,000 currently pays
over a third of their monthly income
for marketplace coverage. My legisla-
tion would reduce their monthly pre-
miums by over $1,700.
This legislation moves us forward by
making lower cost coverage available
to at least 9 million uninsured Ameri-
cans, while reducing premiums for an
additional 10 million Americans.
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in making quality
health insurance more affordable by
cosponsoring this important legisla-
tion.
f
RECOGNIZING GOLAN HEIGHTS AS
PART OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL
(Mr. PERRY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commend the United States’
recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over
the Golan Heights.
Now is a critical and appropriate
time for the United States to formally
recognize the Golan Heights as part of
Israel. At a time when Iran and ter-
rorist organizations, including
Hezbollah, are using the turmoil cre-
ated by the civil war in Syria to ex-
pand their presence in the region, it is
clear they hope to seize the Golan
Heights to then launch attacks against
Israel.
Recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over
the Golan Heights is vital to the secu-
rity interest of the United States and
Israel.
I co-led a letter last December to
Secretary Pompeo outlining the crit-
ical nature of recognizing Israeli sov-
ereignty over the Golan and encour-
aging the administration to do so. This
recognition should have occurred under
several previous administrations, but
the strong leadership needed was not
present.
I am glad that we finally have a
President that is taking the necessary
steps to foster stability and peace in
the Middle East. I applaud President
Trump and his administration for
issuing the proclamation recognizing
the Golan Heights as part of the State
of Israel.

KEEP LIBERIAN COMMUNITY HERE
IN AMERICA
(Mr. PHILLIPS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, our
Nation is the land of promise and the
land of opportunity. We open our doors
to the tired, to the poor, and to the
huddled masses. And, for decades, we
have opened our doors to Liberian refu-
gees fleeing vicious civil wars and the
Ebola virus.
The Liberian community in Min-
nesota—my home State—is the hard-
working bedrock of our healthcare in-
dustry. They are parents, children,
brothers, sisters, workers,
businessowners, and taxpayers.
In 1999, they were given a special im-
migration status in the United States:
deferred enforced departure, or DED.
They work legally, they pay taxes, but
currently have no pathway to citizen-
ship.
Madam Speaker, if you are here le-
gally, play by the rules, and contribute
to your community, you should have
nothing to fear. But if we don’t act by
March 31, the Liberian community’s
DED status will expire. It will subject
our friends and our neighbors to depor-
tation, and our community is terrified.
Since its inception, DED has been a
bipartisan issue. Both Republican and
Democratic Presidents have acted to
extend it for two decades. Now it is our
turn.
This week, we have the chance to
send a legislative fix to the President’s
desk. I urge all of us, on both sides of
the aisle, to do the right thing, the hu-
mane thing, and keep our Liberian
community here in their homes in the
United States of America.
f
RECOGNIZING DEBORAH R.
MCBRIDE
(Mr. ROGERS of Alabama asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
50-year career of Deborah R. McBride,
better known as Debby.
Debby was born to Clarence and Mir-
iam McBride in Washington, D.C. After
graduating high school, she moved to
Birmingham, Alabama, to attend Bir-
mingham-Southern.
During her senior year in college, she
came to Capitol Hill and lined up a job
with former Democratic Congressman
Bill Nichols and worked as a case-
worker until his death in 1988.
She stayed on with the office of Ala-
bama’s Third Congressional District
until Dr. Glen Browder, also a Demo-
crat, was elected in a special election
in April of 1989. She continued her
work as a caseworker, as well as sched-
uling and office manager.
In 1996, Bob Riley was elected. Al-
though a Democrat, Debby continued
to work for him through his three
terms doing casework, serving as office
manager and taking on coordinating
tours and flags.
I was elected in 2002 and, like before,
Debby stayed on to work for me, con-
tinuing in her roles and her service to
east Alabama. Debby has been with me
since day one. If you polled the Third
Congressional District, she would cer-
tainly be more popular than me.
She has institutional knowledge that
cannot be replaced, and I know I will
miss her very much. Debby has a heart
of gold and has touched many lives.
The Third District of Alabama will not
be the same without her.
Madam Speaker, please join me in
thanking Debby for her unwavering
service to the people of Alabama and
our country.

EMERGENCY FUNDING AND
MILITARY PROJECTS
(Mrs. KIRKPATRICK asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speak-
er, the Department of Defense pub-
lished a report revealing the dire im-
pacts of the President’s unlawful emer-
gency declaration. It threatens to steal
nearly $150 million of urgently needed
Arizona military construction funds
critical to the security of our Nation
and the well-being of our men and
women in uniform and military fami-
lies.
Both military bases within my dis-
trict, Fort Huachuca and Davis-
Monthan Air Force Base, are on the
list that could be directly affected by
these cuts, and I am here today to say,
no way.
I represent a border district in south-
ern Arizona, and we don’t want the ex-
pensive, ineffective wall. We want our
military bases funded.
Madam Speaker, 59 percent of Ameri-
cans reject this emergency declaration.
I will continue to take action to block
this brutal decision and fight to pro-
tect Arizonans from the drastic con-
sequences of this dangerous, unlawful
declaration.
f
CONGRATULATING NEW ULM
MEDICAL CENTER
(Mr. HAGEDORN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. HAGEDORN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate the New
Ulm Medical Center for being named
the number one critical access hospital
in the United States for 2019. This med-
ical center, part of Allina Health,
serves more than 13,000 New Ulm resi-
dents and countless more folks in
southern Minnesota.
The New Ulm Medical Center has
found positive ways to improve afford-
ability and increase successful patient
outcomes. Even when faced with seri-
ous health challenges, patients can
thrive when they have access to afford-
able and conveniently located
healthcare.
All Americans deserve access to qual-
ity, timely medical care. I am very
pleased that residents in New Ulm,
Brown County, and surrounding areas
in southern Minnesota have such a fine
institution of medicine to provide
them.
Congratulations to New Ulm Medical
Center, and thank you for serving our
community.

HONORING DR. JOAQUIN
GONZALEZ CIGARROA
(Mr. CUELLAR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to commemorate the life of
Dr. Joaquin Gonzalez Cigarroa.
Dr. Cigarroa was born in San Antonio
but soon moved with his family to La-
redo, Texas. From an early age, he
knew that medicine was going to be his
calling and devoted himself to aca-
demics.
He graduated as valedictorian from
his class at Martin High School, then
went off to attend the University of
Texas and then Harvard Medical
School, where he received his medical
degree. He was the first Harvard Uni-
versity medical student from the
Texas-Mexico border.
After graduating, Dr. Cigarroa served
his country as a first lieutenant with
the U.S. Army Medical Corps before re-
turning to Laredo and practicing medi-
cine.
Dr. Cigarroa made a dramatic impact
on education, not only in Laredo but
across the State of Texas, and also in
healthcare.
He will be fondly remembered for his
commitment to education, healthcare,
and a career that changed the way of
life for so many people.
Dr. Cigarroa is survived by his wife,
Barbara Judith Raymond Flores; their
children: Patricia, Barbara, Francisco,
Ricardo, Jorge, Carlos, Gabriella, Joa-
quin, Maria-Elena, and Marisa—10 chil-
dren; and, again, by so many grand-
children and so many great-grand-
children.
Madam Speaker, thank you for this
opportunity to honor the life of Dr.
Joaquin Cigarroa.

District of Georgia where the Girl
Scouts were founded.
In 1912, Juliette Gordon Low started
meeting with 18 girls who played bas-
ketball, hiked, camped, studied foreign
languages, and worked to help people
in need. With Juliette Gordon Low and
these 18 women in Savannah, the seeds
were sown for a movement, which now
includes 2.6 million Girl Scouts in 92
countries and 50 million alums.
With their motto of being go-getters,
innovators, risk-takers, and leaders,
the international organization has
made an enormous impact in the lives
of young women in their 107-year his-
tory. A testament to their work in-
cludes alums aboard the International

TRIBUTE TO OFFICER BENITO
CHAVEZ AND DEPUTY SHERIFF
RYAN THOMPSON
(Ms. SCHRIER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to pay tribute to two law en-
forcement officers in my district.
Police Officer Benito Chavez was in-
jured in the line of duty protecting our
community in a senseless act of vio-
lence after a car chase last week. He
has only been with the Kittitas Police
Department for 8 months, so he has
many years of service ahead of him. I
am happy to know that he is home
with his family and his wife, and I
thank him for his service, wish him a
speedy recovery, and hope that he will
be back on the job soon.
On a much sadder note, I, Kittitas
County, and the whole Eighth District
mourn the loss of a hero, Deputy Sher-
iff Ryan Thompson who lost his life in
the line of duty on March 19. It is
heartbreaking that Deputy Sheriff
Thompson leaves behind his wife and
three children. I send my deepest con-
dolences to his family, his friends, and
his colleagues who have been hit hard
by this tragedy. We will be forever
grateful for his service to our commu-
nity and to our State.
We all owe such a debt of gratitude
to Officer Chavez, Deputy Sheriff
Thompson, and all law enforcement
professionals who put themselves at
risk every day to keep our community
safe.

MEDAL OF HONOR DAY
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend

Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker,
this week we celebrate Medal of Honor
Day, dedicated to the recipients of
America’s highest military honor.
Today, there are just 72 living Medal
of Honor recipients. The 10th District
is home to one of these, Allen J. Lynch
of Gurnee, who was awarded the Medal
of Honor in 1970 for his actions in Viet-
nam.
While serving as a radio telephone
operator near the village of My An,
Sergeant Lynch risked his life to move
three wounded comrades to safety and
single-handedly defended their isolated
position for 2 hours against an advanc-
ing and numerically superior enemy
force until they could be safely evacu-
ated.
Sergeant Lynch’s service did not end
in Vietnam. He has spent his entire life
serving his fellow veterans with the
Federal Veterans Administration as
well as the Illinois State Government
Veterans Department.
In an interview, he said: ‘‘There are
many servicemembers, first responders,
and citizens who serve this country
above and beyond who are never recog-
nized for what they do. We hold the
Medal of Honor for all those men and
women who have never been recognized
for the great things they did.’’
My friend, Allen Lynch, is a true
American hero and a role model for us
all. On Medal of Honor Day, we reflect
on all those who have acted above and
beyond the call of duty and the hard-
fought freedoms we enjoy because of
their service and sacrifice.

Scott from McKinney, Texas, on win-
ning the 2019 C–SPAN Video Documen-
tary Competition.
Their documentary, ‘‘What It Means
to Be an American: Citizen Account-
ability in Government,’’ highlights
how the United States Constitution in-
tended to instill power with the Amer-
ican people and how corruption in our
system of government diverts power
away from those very individuals.
Like these impressive 11th graders
from Imagine International Academy
of North Texas, I, too, believe power
must rest with the people. Working to-
gether, we can bring real change in
Washington.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-

Daugherty and Eli Scott on their

(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire

Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire.
Madam Speaker, the truth is I believe
there is common ground within our
Caucus and within the Congress as a
whole on how to improve access to
healthcare for every single American.
We can all agree that we must reduce
the cost of health insurance and pre-
scription drugs and we must protect
millions of Americans with preexisting
conditions. That is why I am so excited
this week to work with my colleagues
on the Energy and Commerce Sub-
committee on Health and the New
Democratic Coalition to put forward
proposals that will make a real dif-
ference in the lives of families in New
Hampshire and all across this great
country.
Earlier this month, I joined my new
Democratic colleagues in pushing for
efforts to strengthen the Affordable
Care Act and continue the path toward
affordable, accessible universal
healthcare coverage. Today, I am ex-
cited that we are putting our ideas into
action by introducing this pivotal
healthcare bill.
Access to affordable healthcare has
long been a top priority of mine. I was
proud to unveil solutions over politics
in the last Congress.
We cannot turn back the clock on the
progress we have made. The time to
improve healthcare for all is now.

SUPPORTING PAYCHECK FAIRNESS
ACT
(Mr. CARSON of Indiana asked and

Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, on April 2, just a few days
from now, we will observe Equal Pay
Day in the United States. This com-
memoration represents the amount of
time into this new year a woman must
work to earn as much as a man earned
in 2018 alone.
As long as this continues, we are ef-
fectively telling our wives, our daugh-
ters, our mothers, and every woman in
our life that they are inherently worth
less.
I don’t believe this. I don’t believe
my colleagues do either, which is why
I encourage everyone to support the
Paycheck Fairness Act when it comes
to a vote tomorrow.
This bill represents a major step to-
ward closing the pay gap, ensuring em-
ployers pay women what they are due,
and the process will grow our economy
by putting more money in Americans’
paychecks and helping families thrive.
I am honored to support this legisla-
tion for my daughter, for the hard-
working families in our district, and
for women across America who deserve
a fair wage for honest work.

minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker,
today in America, women still make
only $0.80, on average, for every dollar
a man makes, and that disparity is
even greater for women of color.
Women are the sole or co-bread-
winners in two-thirds of American fam-
ilies with children. When we pay
women less, we hurt American fami-
lies, and we hurt our economy.
The pay gap isn’t a myth. It is math.
For a woman working full time, the
current wage gap represents a loss of
more than $400,000 over the course of
her career.
Tomorrow, the House of Representa-
tives has a real opportunity to tell
women in America that they deserve
equal pay for equal work. Tomorrow,
we can send a message that when
women succeed, America succeeds.
Let’s bring America into the 21st
century. Let’s pass H.R. 7, the Pay-
check Fairness Act.

DO THE RIGHT THING
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I want to speak openly to my friends
and colleagues. Take a moment to look
to your right as you come into this
body, to the memorial that was put to-
gether by the Parkland students and
other gun victims. It will pain your
heart and move you to action.
It acknowledges that 722 people die
every week from gun violence. It ac-
knowledges that teenagers may lose
their lives, and it has a form to indi-
cate which teenager is next. It has
flowers, and it says, ‘‘Stop killing us.’’
Every Member of Congress should
walk by that memorial today, commit
themselves to be decent and do decent
things, and recognize that we should
have gun safety legislation.
I rise as well to say that women who
are not being paid or who are sup-
porting families need the paycheck leg-
islation that I will be supporting to-
morrow.
I also say that this country must not
accept behavior by a President as a
norm, and the Mueller report and the
facts must be had. We must do it quiet-
ly and respectfully, and we must have
our hearings to tell the truth.
Finally, I am outraged, coming from
a State that was a poster child for the
persons without healthcare, that this
administration would try to oppose the
Affordable Care Act. We are going to
fight it. We are going to try to save the
lives of our children and provide
healthcare for all.

the joint resolution, H.J. Res. 46.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon?
There was no objection.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker,
today, we will vote to override the
President’s veto of Congress’ bipartisan
action to terminate his so-called na-
tional emergency declaration. The bot-
tom line is that this emergency dec-
laration is nothing more than an end
run around a majority, a bipartisan
majority, of both the House and the
Senate, in complete disregard of our
constitutional system of separation of
powers.
There is no doubt that we have a bro-
ken immigration system, and com-
prehensive reform should be a subject
of congressional deliberation. But
today, in particular, we have a new cri-
sis. It is a humanitarian crisis, but the
President has said that this wall will
solve that problem.
He also says that this is about drugs.
Well, let’s talk about that, if we could.
Here we have walls that are static. It
is very old technology that has been
used for many centuries, as we know.
Most recently, when the French built
the Maginot Line, the Germans went
around it in 24 hours, similar to what
the President is proposing. He wants a
wall on part of the border.
If the problem were people illegally
crossing, they would cross in other
areas where there is no wall, but that
is actually not the case. He says that
this will stop the flood of people who
are coming to the border. These are not
the historic people who were crossing
the border legally to come to the
United States for the purposes of work
and to remit funds home or those who
were illegally smuggling drugs through
remote areas. This is a humanitarian
crisis.
This is recently in Tijuana, a photo
of a flood of people coming to actually
two areas where we have walls and
fences, wanting to surrender to the
Border Patrol and claim asylum, or
coming to places where we don’t have
walls and fences, searching for Border
Patrol agents so they can claim asy-
lum.
A wall is going to do nothing to deal
with the humanitarian crisis, and we
need to take a much more thoughtful
approach to that.
Secondly, he says it is about drugs.
He makes a big deal about this contrib-
uting to the deaths in the opioid crisis,
fentanyl, and all that. Of course, the
Chinese are shipping in fentanyl in
other ways. It is not coming across the
Mexican border. Maybe we ought to do
something about that.
We have tried with walls to prevent
the smuggling of drugs. The drug
smugglers are very creative. They have
used rather primitive devices. That is a
catapult. They have used drones. They
frequently use tunnels.
We found out, in the trial of El Chapo
Guzman, that their preferred route is
not some remote area that is unwalled
but, actually, to come across at the
legal border crossings here. It is such a
big business, they can modify a semi
tractor-trailer, put in a fake floor, and
send 10 in a day. We only inspect 1 out
of 10. Therefore, they get nine through.
They lose one truck, millions of dol-
lars’ worth of drugs in a truck, and
they don’t care. It is a multimillion-
dollar business.
We need new tools and technology at
the legal border crossings. In par-
ticular, we need that so we can scan 100
percent of the vehicles. We are going to
have to reconfigure the border cross-
ings. We have to bring in the equip-
ment. We have to hire more personnel.
These are very expensive undertakings.
Instead, we are going to waste money
on a static wall, which isn’t going to
stop the drugs. Even more than that,
the former Commandant of the Coast
Guard testified that they have action-
able intelligence, they think, on about
80 percent of the maritime drug ship-
ments targeting the U.S., mostly from
Central America, some from other
Asia-Pacific areas.
They can only act on one-fifth of the
actionable intelligence because they
don’t have the personnel. They don’t
have the ships. They don’t have the
helicopters. They don’t have the tools
they need to interdict those maritime
drug shipments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2807
March 26, 2019
We are going to waste money on a
stupid, static wall. Meanwhile, the
drugs are going to flood in on a mari-
time basis or through the legal border
crossings.
Last year, the Republicans—this is
supposedly a crisis, and somehow it
wasn’t a crisis when the Republicans
controlled the Congress up until the
beginning of this year. They refused to
appropriate funds for the wall. Then
the President shut down the govern-
ment for 35 days, the longest govern-
ment shutdown in our Nation’s history.
More than 800,000 people were either
denied coming to work or had to work
without pay.
Finally, the President agreed to open
the government with a short-term con-
tinuing resolution, and he said that
lawmakers should come up with a com-
prehensive border security proposal.
Congress did that. A bipartisan group
delivered compromise legislation that
rejected the proposed border wall as in-
effective. Alternatively, it made effec-
tive, robust investments in border se-
curity. Congress overwhelmingly
passed the legislation. The President
agreed to sign it. Then he issued a na-
tional emergency declaration in order
to raid funds from other departments
to secure funding for a border wall,
which Congress has repeatedly voted
against.
As I already said, he has made it
about drugs; the wall will be ineffec-
tive. He made it about the humani-
tarian crisis; the wall will be ineffec-
tive.
How is he going to pay for it? Well,
he is going to take money that the De-
partment of Defense was going to spend
on high-priority military construction
projects, which will ultimately under-
mine the training, readiness, and qual-
ity of life for our men and women in
the Armed Forces.
In fact, General Robert Neller, Com-
mandant of the Marines, has detailed
that the ‘‘unplanned/unbudgeted’’ shift
of funds to deploy troops to the south-
ern border last fall has forced him to
cancel or reduce training exercises,
delay urgent repairs, posing an ‘‘unac-
ceptable risk’’ to our Armed Forces’
training and readiness.
Then he is also going to take, iron-
ically, money from the DOD drug inter-
diction program, which will further in-
hibit the capability of the DOD in ef-
fectively interdicting drug shipments,
in favor of a stupid, static wall.
This emergency declaration also vio-
lates a number of existing laws. The
Military Construction Codification Act
only authorizes the Secretary of De-
fense to reallocate funds for construc-
tion projects during a national emer-
gency if the project is ‘‘necessary to
support’’ a ‘‘use of the Armed Forces.’’
Our Armed Forces are not respon-
sible for enforcing our immigration
laws. Using these funds in this way is a
direct violation of existing law.
The administration would also need
to seize thousands of acres of private
property by eminent domain to build
this wall. This is the party of private
property rights and local control, and
they are going to support that activity,
or some are.
Currently, more than two-thirds of
border property needed to build the
wall is owned by private parties or rel-
evant States. In 1952, the Supreme
Court held in Youngstown Sheet &
Tube that President Truman’s declara-
tion of a national emergency, even in
the midst of an international armed
conflict, did not permit him to unilat-
erally seize private property.
It is unlikely that this thing will get
built anyway, but we are going through
this process. Because of this likely ille-
gal overreach, the House passed a bi-
partisan resolution to terminate the
national emergency declaration. Even
the Republican-controlled Senate
passed the resolution, with 12 Repub-
lican Senators breaking with the Presi-
dent.
With the President’s decision to over-
ride this resolution, we must send a
strong, clear message to the President
that we live in a constitutional, rep-
resentative democracy, and the Presi-
dent and his administration cannot ig-
nore Congress and existing law when
they don’t like our actions.
We must stand up and defend our
constitutional system, separation of
powers, and Article I of the Constitu-
tion of the United States.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
the President’s veto of H.J. Res. 46.
Keeping our Nation secure should be
this President’s very highest priority,
and it is this President’s very highest
priority.
With President Trump, there is no
question that he has, and he will con-
tinue to carry out, this priority. I sup-
port his efforts to build a wall on the
southern border to protect our country.
He has very clearly laid out the case
for a declaration for a national emer-
gency. There is a crisis at the border, a
crisis that could have been addressed
much sooner or even prevented, for
that matter. The open border policies
in the last administration compounded
this growing problem.
We are seeing the highest rates of il-
legal immigration since 2007. In Feb-
ruary, there were more than double the
number of illegal migrants coming into
this country, as compared to last year.
Border Patrol has apprehended over
268,000 individuals since the beginning
of this fiscal year. That is a 97 percent
increase from the previous year.
Schools, hospitals, and other services
have become overcrowded. The Amer-
ican workers have been hurt by re-
duced job opportunities and lower
wages. At the same time, human and
drug traffickers are thriving.
b 1245
In many of our communities, the no-
torious MS–13 gang has grown, and we
have seen tragic cases of crime com-
mitted by illegal aliens who have been
deported multiple times.
In my own home State of Missouri,
an individual who was previously de-
ported returned here illegally and was
charged in several violent incidents. He
is now suspected of murdering five in-
dividuals—or five Americans.
That should never have happened,
but these kinds of tragic—and prevent-
able—events are happening across the
country. That is the very definition of
a crisis.
Last Congress, we enacted legislation
to deal with the devastating opioid cri-
sis because that is, in fact, also a cri-
sis. We can and we must slow the flow
of illegal drugs into this country. The
men and women who put their lives on
the line every single day to secure our
borders deserve all the tools they need
to do the job—including a border wall.
Through President Trump’s procla-
mation and his veto of H.J. Res. 46, he
is acting decisively to finally address
this crisis under the authority provided
him by Congress. The National Emer-
gencies Act is crystal clear. The provi-
sions the President will use under title
10 explicitly provide the President with
that authority. The President is well
within his legal authority that Con-
gress has provided him. That is the
bottom line.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand with the President
and to stand with law-abiding Ameri-
cans and law-abiding immigrants to
sustain this veto.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
New York (Mr. NADLER), who is the
chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of overriding the President’s veto
of H.J. Res. 46.
One month ago, the House passed a
bipartisan resolution to terminate the
so-called national emergency declared
by President Trump. The Senate has
likewise voted on a broad bipartisan
basis to reject that emergency declara-
tion, leaving President Trump to issue
the first veto of his Presidency.
I am more convinced than ever that
the President’s actions are not only
unlawful, they are deeply irresponsible.
A core foundation of our system of gov-
ernment—and of democracies across
the world going back hundreds of
years—is that the executive cannot
unilaterally spend taxpayers’ money
without the legislature’s consent.
The President shredded that concept
when he declared an emergency after
he failed to get his way in a budget ne-
gotiation. As he often does, he an-
nounced his intention to ignore Con-
gress in plain sight for all the world to
see.
Meanwhile, hundreds of Americans
have started receiving letters from the
Federal Government demanding entry

onto their land. Soon our fellow citi-
zens’ backyards may be seized in order
to build a medieval border wall that
Congress and the American people do
not want.
The senseless diversion of military
resources to the southern border has
also created concerns about our troops’
combat readiness and their ability to
implement other key priorities, and
the Trump administration appears to
be deciding on the fly which military
construction projects they are plan-
ning to raid, leaving our men and
women in uniform and everyone else
who might be affected in a prolonged
state of uncertainty. This type of chaos
and confusion is the inevitable result
when the President ignores the express
will of Congress.
The Judiciary Committee recently
held a hearing to discuss the National
Emergencies Act and to begin consid-
ering reforms to check abuses of this
power. I was heartened by the enthu-
siasm on both sides of the aisle for
such efforts, and I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with my colleagues on
these proposals.
But these longer term reform efforts
should not detract from our responsi-
bility to address what the President is
doing right now. President Trump’s in-
vention of a so-called national emer-
gency to suit his political goals and to
get around Congress’ refusal of the
funding request is intolerable, and I
will be proud to cast my vote to over-
ride his veto.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD),
who is also the lead Republican on the
Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials Subcommittee.
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Missouri for
his leadership on this issue.
Madam Speaker, today the House
will vote on whether or not to override
the President’s veto preserving the
emergency declaration regarding the
ongoing crisis at the southern border,
and I am glad we finally acknowledged
on a bipartisan basis that there is, in
fact, a crisis on the southern border.
My friend from Oregon mentioned that
this humanitarian crisis exists, and I
couldn’t agree more.
There is also another crisis at the
border. There has been a 295 percent in-
crease in apprehensions of illegal im-
migrants crossing our southwest bor-
der from beyond Mexico—particularly
Guatemala, Honduras, and El Sal-
vador—over the last 10 years, roughly.
There have been 266 arrests of criminal
aliens in the last 2 fiscal years alone,
and these include criminal aliens
charged or convicted of assaults, sex
crimes, and killings, and those are
hardly victimless crimes.
In 2017, more than 70,000 Americans
died of drug overdoses as methamphet-
amine, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl
are flooding across the border, and I
would say that probably the families of
those 70,000 would argue that we cer-
tainly do have a crisis attributed to
the problems at our southern border.
Since fiscal year 2012, CBP has seized
more than 11 million pounds of drugs
between ports of entry, that is com-
pared with only 4 million pounds at
ports of entry.
Make no mistake, there is a crisis at
our southern border. Since October of
last year, illegal crossings have spiked.
In February alone, the month Presi-
dent Trump declared the emergency,
76,000 people illegally crossed the bor-
der. Just yesterday, the Border Patrol
took the highly unusual step of closing
inland border checkpoints in response
to abnormally high apprehensions. All
of this goes to show that we need a bor-
der wall.
The Customs and Border Protection
Commissioner put it best when he said
that this is clearly both a border secu-
rity and a humanitarian crisis. The
President attempted to remedy this
crisis by declaring the emergency, an
action well within his statutory au-
thority and constitutional obligation
to protect our country.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this veto override.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT).
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker,
President Trump continues to push for
his useless, medieval wall along the
southern border in defiance of Con-
gress, despite a bipartisan vote in the
House of Representatives and the Sen-
ate to reject this fraudulently invoked
emergency declaration which would
rob taxpayers’ funds from other pro-
grams. Congress has asserted its au-
thority, but the President is using
every tool he has in his toolbox for his
pet project.
Let me remind the American people:
There is no emergency at the southern
border or anywhere else that warrants
this wall.
The head of the U.S. Northern Com-
mand, who is responsible for troops on
the border, testified that border cross-
ings do not pose a military threat. The
refugees arriving on our border are
families: mothers and fathers with
their children. They are willingly turn-
ing themselves in to request asylum
from the violence and harassment from
gangs they face in their home coun-
tries. No wall no matter how high it is
built would change that reality.
Madam Speaker, this is nothing more
than a naked power grab, and if my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
truly stand for limited executive
power, I expect them all to vote to
override the President’s veto today.
Madam Speaker, there is no emer-
gency on the southern border.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL).
Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker,
while most Americans—maybe not ev-
erybody on the other side of the aisle—
would not deny we have a crisis at the
border, some of my colleagues actually
recognize the crisis, including the hu-
manitarian crisis.
Last year, I voted for a bill that
would have fully funded the wall and
averted the government shutdown, to
no avail. My choice this term would
have been to pass the six noncontrover-
sial bills and then pass a continuing
resolution for the Department of
Homeland Security so we could con-
tinue to work and negotiate on a reso-
lution that would not have put us at
this point.
Yes, the President declared a na-
tional emergency. Speaker PELOSI then
proceeded to the resolution con-
demning President Trump’s emergency
declaration, which was a messaging bill
by the Democrats. Voting for it would
have been playing politics, which many
in this Chamber chose to do. Voting
today without the votes to override is
yet another messaging bill, yet another
game of politics which I will not sup-
port.
I agree with my colleague on the
other side of the aisle: It is a constitu-
tional question, and determination of
constitutional authority is something
left to the courts to decide, something
the Supreme Court should decide, and
not a partisan whack job in the House
of Representatives.
If Congress wishes to narrow and de-
fine more clearly the National Emer-
gencies Act, then we should do so, and,
in fact, I am happy to participate in
doing that. However, in the interim, we
still have the issue of securing our bor-
der. It will not go away.
The crisis is not going away. As my
colleagues over here have indicated, it
continues to be a growing problem. So
why we don’t spend time addressing
that rather than one more messaging
vote—which appears to be the trend
right now in this House since Janu-
ary—befuddles me.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the resolution
to override the veto, and I urge my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle,
let’s get down to dealing with the prob-
lems of the American people.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. CASTRO).
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam
Speaker, I first want to say thank you
to my colleagues in the House, Repub-
licans and Democrats, and also in the
United States Senate who voted to ter-
minate the President’s emergency dec-
laration to build a border wall across
the U.S.-Mexico border.
There is a humanitarian crisis at the
border, but there isn’t an invasion, and
there is not an emergency of the sort
that the President speaks of. What we
have here is an act of constitutional
vandalism, the President trying to
take the power away from the House of
Representatives and the U.S. Senate,
the executive trying to steal the power
of the purse from the Congress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2809
March 26, 2019
If Congress allows this to stand, then
15, 20 years, 30 years from now, we will
look back upon this as a time that
gave both Democratic and Republican
Presidents incredible power to ignore
Congress and completely go around
this body to do the things that they
will in terms of domestic politics.
There are landowners in Texas who
are going to lose their land. This is the
largest Federal land taking of Texas
land, I believe, in history. Many people
in Texas will lose their land. Many peo-
ple will have their land values de-
valued, some of them very signifi-
cantly, because of this.
Military construction projects in
Texas are also at stake: $265 million
worth of Texas military construction;
projects at Joint Base San Antonio,
which includes those in my district, $76
million; Fort Bliss, over $50 million; $42
million at Fort Hood; Red River, $71.5
million; Galveston Naval Reserve, $8.4
million gone because the President has
decided—and this Congress will have
submitted to his will—to go around
Congress and unilaterally build a bor-
der wall.
Even those who support a wall should
agree with us that this is not the way
to do it. Congress funded over $1 bil-
lion, yet the President has gone around
them to do more.
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will stand with us and override
this veto.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK).
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker,
for 43 years, the President of the
United States has had the statutory
authority granted by Congress to de-
clare a national emergency and to re-
program unobligated military con-
struction funds to meet that emer-
gency. Fifty-eight times previous
Presidents have invoked this authority
to address such matters as civil unrest
in Sierra Leone and Burma.
Only when this President invoked his
authority for the 59th time to address
the most serious national security risk
our country has faced in our lifetime—
the collapse of our southern border—do
we now hear protests from the left and
its fellow travelers.
Madam Speaker, under our Constitu-
tion, the Congress appropriates money
but cannot spend it, and the President
spends money but cannot appropriate
it. He spends it according to laws given
to him by Congress. In this case, Con-
gress appropriated funds and delegated
to the President precisely the author-
ity to spend those funds that he is now
exercising.
Now, whether Congress should have
delegated this authority is a separate
question that no one has raised in 43
years. But while that authority exists,
the President has both a right and a
duty to use it to defend our country.
We also hear protests that the Presi-
dent’s act will divert money from other
military projects. Listen to what these
people are saying. They care more
about defending the Iraqi border than
defending our own. Such people should
not be entrusted with the defense of
our country.
I stand with the President, who is
acting within our Constitution to de-
fend our Nation, and against the rad-
ical left in this House who would dis-
solve our borders entirely if given the
chance.
History warns us that nations that
cannot or will not defend their borders
aren’t around very long. Let that not
be the epitaph of the American Repub-
lic or the Constitution that created it.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Just in response to the gentleman, if
he had been listening, he might have
heard the gentleman from Texas listing
bases in Texas which are going to lose
funds for critical military construction
projects, yet he launches off into some
fantasy about Iraq—I didn’t even quite
get that part—and also that we are pro-
posing open borders. I am not aware of
anyone on this side of the aisle who is
proposing open borders.
b 1300
We are proposing effective, 21st cen-
tury border security at the real threats
to America, like drug importation
through our legal ports of entry and
maritime drug imports that we can’t
intercept because we don’t have the re-
sources, and we are wasting money on
a stupid, static wall.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
BARRAGÁN).
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Madam Speaker,
my colleague on the other side of the
aisle said this was a partisan whack
job.
Yet, Congress has come together,
which is rare to see these days, on a bi-
partisan basis, in the House and in the
Senate, to vote to terminate this al-
leged crisis that is happening at the
border.
This is a constitutional issue. This is
about the separation of powers. This is
about Congress’ ability to appropriate
money and the President saying he
wants something, Congress doesn’t give
it to him, and him going around Con-
gress.
Again, this is not a partisan issue.
This should not be a partisan issue.
My Republican colleague in the Sen-
ate said: Never has a President asked
for funding and then had Congress not
provide the funding, just to have the
President come right back to use the
National Emergencies Act to get
around Congress.
This is a dangerous precedent. This is
not a messaging vote.
Again, on the House and on the Sen-
ate side, on a bipartisan basis, our col-
leagues are arguing today that we
should stand with the President.
I urge my colleagues: Stand with the
Constitution. Stand with the Constitu-
tion. Let’s override this veto.
A wall will not stop the drugs that
are coming in, the majority, through
the ports of entry; a wall will not stop
migrants who are coming to present
themselves for asylum, legally, at the
ports of entry; and a wall will not stop
the inhumane treatment that migrants
are receiving at the ports of entry.
Let’s work together on a comprehen-
sive immigration bill. Let’s work to-
gether to address this problem, not to
fund a wall against the will of Congress
which is being done on a bipartisan and
a bicameral basis.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, the President made it very
clear that the wall is critical to ad-
dress both national security and the
humanitarian crisis.
DOD issued a fact sheet of the uni-
verse of projects that have not been
awarded, and they totaled more than
what is needed. They total a little over
$12 billion.
Just because a project is listed
doesn’t mean that the funding will be
used. They only need $3.6 billion.
I might add, too, that if the fiscal
year 2020 budget is enacted on time and
as requested, there is going to be no
military construction project that is
going to be delayed or canceled.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
ABRAHAM).
Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker, the
President has a duty to protect our
borders and our people. He has the Con-
stitution and the law of the land on his
side to declare this national emer-
gency.
Democrats have blocked the appro-
priations for this border security, but
they had no problem when President
Obama built 130 miles of border wall.
While they played political games,
76,000 people alone, in February,
streamed across our borders, but the
United States has endured because we
are a land that believes in the rule of
law.
Turning a blind eye to this law and
allowing these open borders sends the
wrong message to the American people
and our laws.
Madam Speaker, I am a country phy-
sician who has, unfortunately, been in
emergency rooms and in funeral homes
with the families of those that have
died of illegal opioid overdoses. When
we play political games with American
lives and American families, shame on
us.
Madam Speaker, 85 to maybe 95 per-
cent of these illegal opioids come
across the southern border where we
have no fence, we have no barrier to

ing these drugs in.
We have got to secure this border

are due to fentanyl, and the fentanyl,
of course, is all produced in China.
Some of it is shipped via UPS, FedEx,
and the international postal service.
We lack the screening capability to
deal with that.
Much of it does go to Mexico and is
then smuggled into the U.S., but it is
not the classic myth of these people
carrying backpacks through remote
areas of the desert where, if we only
put up a wall, the wall would stop them
from getting the drugs into the U.S.
If people had paid attention to the
extraordinary trial of El Chapo
Guzman in New York, which I did,
there was testimony after testimony
after testimony that he is bringing and
they—his successors—are bringing the
drugs through our ports of entry, be-
cause they deal in volume and sophis-
tication.
And what are we going to do? We are
going to build a medieval wall over
here while they continue to flood this
country by modifying pickup trucks,
passenger cars, and semis to smuggle
humans and drugs into the United
States of America.
Border Patrol is understaffed. Border
Patrol does not have adequate tech-
nology. They only screen a very small
percentage of the vehicles coming
through, sometimes 6 percent, some-
times as high as 8 percent. Wow.
Well, then, you have got a 92 percent
chance, if you are El Chapo Guzman or
some other scumbag drug person from
a cartel in Mexico, of getting your
product in in an efficient, volumetric
way.
Why would you pay someone with a
backpack to go through some remote
area when you can just ship them in
that way, or you can use FedEx or UPS
if you are Chinese.
You can go online and find Chinese
selling fentanyl, and they will give you
advice about how you should order it
from them and how you can get it into
the United States.
Why aren’t we doing something
about that? The President is making a
big deal about getting tough on China.
They are producing all the fentanyl,
and it is coming in here in many, many
different ways, and this wall will do
nothing—nothing—to deal with that.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding. I
thank him for his enthusiastic defense
of the Constitution of the United
States.
Madam Speaker, I rise to join my
colleagues to uphold the Constitution
and defend our democracy once again.
The House and the Senate came to-
gether, in great unity and bipartisan-
ship, to pass Congressman JOAQUIN
CASTRO’s resolution to reject the Presi-
dent’s lawless power grab, yet the
President chose to continue to defy the
Constitution, the Congress, and the
will of the American people with a
veto.
At the birth of our democracy, amid
revolution and war, Thomas Paine
wrote that ‘‘the times have found us.’’
Once again, the times have found us
to defend our democracy.
The times have found us to restore
the Founders’ vision of balance of
power, checks and balances, coequal
branches of government, and restore
Congress’ role as Article I, the first
branch; Article I, the legislative
branch.
The times have found us to honor our
oath to support and defend the Con-
stitution and protect the American
people.
We all know that the heart of our
Constitution, the beauty of it all, is
that we have a system of checks and
balances.
Our Founders did not want a mon-
archy. That is what they had rejected.
They wanted a democracy: coequal
branches of government to act as a
check on each other.
This Congress of the United States
acted to honor the Constitution and
our responsibility to protect and de-
fend by passing legislation in our ap-
propriations bill, showing how, in a bi-
partisan way, Congress would protect
our borders.
We understand our responsibility to
do that. We don’t take that responsi-
bility lightly. We take it seriously.
Even when the President disagreed
with us, he should have accepted the
bipartisan, bicameral decision to pro-
ceed. He had taken pride in a shutdown
of Government for about 1 month be-
cause he didn’t get his way on the bor-
der.
After 1 month, bipartisan, bicameral
action by the Congress sent him a bill
almost exactly like what he rejected in
the first place, and he decided to reject
Congress’ wisdom and Congress’ acting
within its authority to protect our bor-
ders in a serious, effective, values-
based way.
We don’t take this vote here today
lightly. Even when the legislative
branch disagrees with the executive,
we respect the office the President
holds and his right to veto legislation.
But when those decisions violate the
Constitution, then that must be
stopped. Many of our colleagues from
across the aisle joined last month to
defend our democracy by passing Con-
gressman CASTRO’s privileged resolu-
tion.
That happened in the House. That
happened in the United States Senate.
We call on all of our colleagues to
simply show that same measure of re-
spect for our Constitution today.
We take an oath to the Constitution,
not to the President of the United
States. We take an oath that we must
honor.
The choice is simple, between par-
tisanship and patriotism, between hon-
oring our sacred oath or hypocritically,
inconsistently, breaking that oath.
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong, bi-
partisan ‘‘yes’’ to override this veto.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, I just need to point out that,
according to Customs and Border Pro-
tection, there were more illegal drugs
that were captured in between those
ports of entry than there were at the
ports of entry.
In 2012, there were 11 million pounds
of illegal drugs that were seized in be-
tween—again, in between—those ports
of entry, as opposed to 4 million pounds
at those ports of entry.
This is exactly why the wall is need-
ed, so that we funnel that illegal drug
trafficking to those ports rather than
in between those ports of entry.
It is time that Congress gave those
individuals that are on the border,
risking their lives to protect the
United States, the tools that they
need, and that is a border wall.
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as
he may consume to the gentleman
from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS), who is
also the lead Republican on the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the
time.
Today I rise in strong support of se-
curing our borders. There is a crisis at
the southwest border that can no
longer be denied.
Changing demographics have created
unprecedented challenges for Border
Patrol agents. Today, record large
groups of women and children from
Central American countries are over-
whelming Border Patrol facilities and
undermining the safety of migrants
and staff.
Family apprehensions for fiscal year
2019 are already 800 percent higher than
fiscal year 2013.
Customs and Border Protection sta-
tistics indicate that border apprehen-
sions are on pace to hit a 10-year high.
Human smugglers are exploiting
loopholes in our broken immigration
system and using children as visas to
gain entry into the U.S.
Further, drugs are pouring through
our porous borders. As you just heard
the gentleman mention, in fiscal year
2018, Customs and Border Protection
seized almost 900,000 pounds of drugs at
the border, the majority of which were
seized between the ports of entry. That
includes approximately 2,000 pounds of
fentanyl, which equals a lethal dose for
the entire United States population.
To address this crisis, we need an all-
of-the-above solution to border secu-
rity that includes manpower, 21st cen-
tury technology, and a barrier. With
this approach, we will stem the flow of
drugs that are devastating our commu-
nities. We will stop human smugglers
and others from crossing hundreds of
miles of open desert with innocent
children.
Border security used to be a bipar-
tisan issue. I have been on the Home-
land Security Committee since it was
established as a select committee after
9/11.

Not one time in the history of that
committee has there been any partisan
dispute about the need for a barrier,
the wall, until Donald Trump became
President, and now it is a toxic issue.
I stand by President Trump’s actions
to keep Americans safe, and I encour-
age my colleagues to do the same. Vote
against the effort to override the Presi-
dent’s veto.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Despite the majority’s blind objec-
tion to anything this President does,
the facts are clearly there to show that
this is a real crisis. President Obama
agreed when he requested emergency
funding in 2014 to deal with the crisis
on the border and when he declared a
national emergency because of the
transnational drug traffickers.
Since fiscal year 2012, Customs and
Border Patrol has seized 4 million
pounds, as I pointed out earlier, seized
4 million pounds of drugs at ports of
entry but more than 11 million pounds
of drugs between those ports of entry.
Nearly three times as many drugs are
seized in between those ports.
Many of our colleagues on the other
side of the aisle recognize the need for
a border wall. They voted to authorize
a wall in 2006 and again they voted to
authorize, under President Obama, in
2013.
Last year, we passed bipartisan legis-
lation to address the growing impacts
of opioids on our communities, drugs
that continue to flow into our country
through our southern border. Make no
mistake, the opioid crisis is real.
Earlier this month, the Centers for
Disease Control issued a report noting
that deaths from fentanyl have in-
creased from 1,663 in 2011 to 18,335
deaths in 2016. This is an increase of
over 1,100 percent.
There was bipartisan agreement that
there was a drug-related crisis, but
now, suddenly, some are calling this a
‘‘manufactured crisis.’’
The National Emergencies Act has
been on the books since 1976 and has
been used dozens of times, but now,
suddenly, some are calling it ‘‘uncon-
stitutional.’’
The National Emergencies Act is
clear; it is absolutely clear: The Presi-
dent has the authority to act. The
President is using the authority Con-
gress has given him, and the President
stood firm, understanding the gravity
of this crisis, and issued his first Presi-
dential veto.
I stand with him, and I urge my col-
leagues to sustain the President’s veto
on H.J. Res. 46.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, may
I ask how much time remains.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 81⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I
won’t use that much. I yield myself
such time as I may consume.
I would like to have a quote here
from someone who, I think, is quite
prominent: You go under; you go
around; you go through it. What they
need is more manpower and more tech-
nology.
That was the Acting Chief of Staff
for the White House, Mick Mulvaney,
when, perhaps, he was a little more
independent as a Member of the United
States Congress. That was August 25,
2015.
I would ask: What has changed since
then? Well, he now works for the Presi-
dent. That is a change.
Donald Trump, during his campaign,
was real hardline on immigration, but
he kept forgetting to mention immi-
gration in some of his speeches. So his
staff came up with a mnemonic. They
said: Well, he is a builder. If we say
‘‘wall,’’ he will remember it.
And the President did. It was just an
afterthought. It was: How are we going
to get him to give his hard line on im-
migration during his campaign speech-
es and get rousing going. Let’s use the
wall.
The wall then became a life unto its
own, as a campaign promise, not as
something that is effective.
As we have talked about before, the
drugs, use a trebuchet or a catapult.
Use a drone, tunnels—really common,
tunnels—and, of course, legal border
crossings.
This is an end conclusion to a cam-
paign promise for his base but not what
is in the best interests of the United
States of America in terms of pre-
venting the shipment of illegal drugs.
Now, I don’t know where the gen-
tleman came up with that new statistic
that three times as many drugs were
intercepted outside the ports of entry,
unless he was using the Coast Guard,
which he may have been, because the
Coast Guard intercepted more drugs
than every other agency of the Federal
Government, combined, in the mari-
time route.
Unfortunately, as the former Com-
mandant of the Coast Guard said: We
can identify 80 percent with our intel,
80 percent of the drug shipments com-
ing in on a maritime basis, but the
Coast Guard only has the resources to
intercept 20 percent.
So I guess that is probably where
that statistic came from.
The Coast Guard is doing a great job
with inadequate resources. In the bi-
partisan compromise, they got some
additional money for air and marine
assets, three multi-enforcement air-
craft. They could use a heck of a lot
more.
Why don’t we get that 80 percent?
Why don’t they have resources to get
that 80 percent that they know about,
and then let’s get better intel and get
the other 20 percent.
And then let’s scan 100 percent of the
vehicles coming across the border. I
have been at the border, when, through
intuition, a Border Patrol agent found
drug smuggling. I just happened to be
there that day. I mean, it was just sort
of a: Whoa, Congressman, you might
like to see this.
The guy drove up to the border. He
had a birthday cake and a bottle of te-
quila on the seat. The Border Patrol
guy said: Hmm, something is sus-
picious. Take the truck over there.
They scoped out the gas tank. They
found big blocks of drugs in the gas
tank.
Was that because we had sophisti-
cated technology and when the guy
pulled the truck up we could use that
technology? No, it was the intuition of
the Border Patrol agent.
I said: How did you know to go and
really search through that guy’s vehi-
cle?
He said: Well, there was nothing on
his key ring. There was only one key in
the ignition. He was a throwaway.
The cartel was probably paying him
10,000 bucks or something to drive that
stolen or purchased pickup truck
across the border concealing drugs, and
the human element caught that guy.
There aren’t enough Border Patrol
agents. They have openings. They are
not adequately compensated. They
weren’t paid during the shutdown, but
they were still working at the border.
They are the first line of defense.
But they also need new technology.
We can’t install all that technology to
scan 100 percent of the vehicles coming
through unless we invest a lot of
money in improving the border cross-
ing because we will have trucks backed
up 100 miles back into Mexico because
of the amount of commerce that comes
across.
So what are we going to do? We are
going to build a stupid, static wall over
there and over there, and we are still
going to let, probably, 85 percent of the
vehicles go through without applying
technology.
Guzman, sitting in his jail cell, is
probably just chortling over this. He is
saying: Boy, are those Americans stu-
pid. Why don’t they get the technology
they need to scan the cargo that we are
hiding in very sophisticated ways in
tractor trailers, in pickup trucks, in
individual passenger vehicles? Why
don’t they intercept the drugs that are
coming in through the oceans that
they even know about and they are not
intercepting them?
No, we are going to build a dumb
wall.
And, by the way, when the Repub-
licans were in charge, we had a vote on
that and it failed. If this was such a
crisis and such a great idea when the
Republicans controlled the House, the
Senate, and the White House, why
didn’t they make it a priority?
Well, they didn’t make it a priority
because they thought it was a stupid
idea. But now it is a political thing.
This is a victory for the President. It
excites his base. It energizes his base.
He has to have it, so he declares a na-
tional emergency.

The emergency is political. It is not
national security. It is not drugs.
We have a humanitarian crisis at the
border—yes, we do—and what is a wall
going to do about that?
They come to the border. They stand
there and they say: We want to apply
for asylum in the United States.
If they come across in a remote area,
they hope they come across a Border
Patrol agent because they want to sur-
render at the moment, right there, and
get some shelter and get medical care.
They are now organizing busloads to
come up from Guatemala and Hon-
duras.
We are not dealing with the root
problems down there, and we are not
dealing with the smugglers who are
now hiring very nice, luxury buses as
opposed to the old ride on that killer
train that people used to take to come
up, when there were smugglers who
would often rape them, kill them, rob
them, whatever else. Now they have
converted to: Oh, let’s put them in a
luxury coach and they will have rest
stops and everything else.
This has become big business. Why
aren’t we doing something about that?
The wall will do nothing about that—
nothing.
Why, why, why are we going to waste
billions of dollars on a medieval for-
tress that won’t work?
I urge my colleagues to vote and
override the veto of the President of
the United States; restore the integrity
of the Congress of the United States
and the appropriations process under
Article I of the Constitution of the
United States.

LYTTON RANCHERIA HOMELANDS
ACT OF 2019
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and pass the
bill (H.R. 1388) to take lands in Sonoma
County, California, into trust as part
of the reservation of the Lytton
Rancheria of California, and for other
purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1388
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Lytton
Rancheria Homelands Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) The Lytton Rancheria of California is a
federally recognized Indian tribe that lost its
homeland after its relationship to the United
States was unjustly and unlawfully termi-
nated in 1958. The Tribe was restored to Fed-
eral recognition in 1991, but the conditions of
its restoration have prevented it from re-
gaining a homeland on its original lands.
(2) Congress needs to take action to reverse
historic injustices that befell the Tribe and
that have prevented it from regaining a via-
ble homeland for its people.
(3) Prior to European contact there were as
many as 350,000 Indians living in what is now
the State of California. By the turn of the
19th century, that number had been reduced
to approximately 15,000 individuals, many of
them homeless and living in scattered bands
and communities.
(4) The Lytton Rancheria’s original home-
land was purchased by the United States in
1926 pursuant to congressional authority de-
signed to remedy the unique tragedy that be-
fell the Indians of California and provide
them with reservations called Rancherias to
be held in trust by the United States.
(5) After the Lytton Rancheria lands were
purchased by the United States, the Tribe
settled on the land and sustained itself for
several decades by farming and ranching.
(6) By the mid-1950s, Federal Indian policy
had shifted back towards a policy of termi-
nating the Federal relationship with Indian
tribes. In 1958, Congress enacted the
Rancheria Act of 1958 (72 Stat. 619), which
slated 41 Rancherias in California, including
the Lytton Rancheria, for termination after
certain conditions were met.
(7) On August 1, 1961, the Federal Govern-
ment terminated its relationship with the
Lytton Rancheria. This termination was ille-
gal because the conditions for termination
under the Rancheria Act had never been met.
After termination was implemented, the
Tribe lost its lands and was left without any
means of supporting itself.
(8) In 1987, the Tribe joined three other
tribes in a lawsuit against the United States
challenging the illegal termination of their
Rancherias. A Stipulated Judgment in the
case, Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of
the Sugar Bowl Rancheria v. United States,
No. C–86–3660 (N.D.Cal. March 22, 1991), re-
stored the Lytton Rancheria to its status as
a federally recognized Indian tribe.
(9) The Stipulated Judgment provides that
the Lytton Rancheria would have the ‘‘indi-
vidual and collective status and rights’’
which it had prior to its termination and ex-
pressly contemplated the acquisition of trust
lands for the Lytton Rancheria.
(10) The Stipulated Judgment contains pro-
visions, included at the request of the local
county governments and neighboring land-
owners, that prohibit the Lytton Rancheria
from exercising its full Federal rights on its
original homeland in the Alexander Valley.
(11) In 2000, approximately 9.5 acres of land
in San Pablo, California, was placed in trust
status for the Lytton Rancheria for eco-
nomic development purposes.
(12) The Tribe has since acquired, from
willing sellers at fair market value, property
in Sonoma County near the Tribe’s historic
Rancheria. This property, which the Tribe
holds in fee status, is suitable for a new
homeland for the Tribe.
(13) On a portion of the land to be taken
into trust, which portion totals approxi-
mately 124.12 acres, the Tribe plans to build
housing for its members and governmental
and community facilities.
(14) A portion of the land to be taken into
trust is being used for viniculture, and the
Tribe intends to develop more of the lands to
be taken into trust for viniculture. The
Tribe’s investment in the ongoing
viniculture operation has reinvigorated the
vineyards, which are producing high-quality
wines. The Tribe is operating its vineyards
on a sustainable basis and is working toward
certification of sustainability.
(15) No gaming shall be conducted on the
lands to be taken into trust by this Act.
(16) No gaming shall be conducted on any
lands taken into trust on behalf of the Tribe
in Sonoma County after the date of the en-
actment of this Act.
(17) By directing that these lands be taken
into trust, the United States will ensure that
the Lytton Rancheria will finally have a per-
manently protected homeland on which the
Tribe can once again live communally and
plan for future generations. This action is
necessary to fully restore the Tribe to the
status it had before it was wrongfully termi-
nated in 1961.
(18) The Tribe and County of Sonoma have
entered into a Memorandum of Agreement as
amended in 2018 in which the County agrees
to the lands in the County being taken into
trust for the benefit of the Tribe in consider-
ation for commitments made by the Tribe.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on the measure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona?
There was no objection.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Along with dozens of other California
Tribes, the Lytton Band of Pomo Indi-
ans had its relationship with the Fed-
eral Government terminated in 1958,
resulting in the loss of its Federal sta-
tus and all of its Tribal lands.
The Tribe’s federally recognized sta-
tus was eventually restored, but its
reservation lands were not. As a result,
with the exception of a small parcel of
land that Congress provided for gaming
in San Pablo, the Tribe has been left
essentially landless and without a res-
ervation since it was terminated.
H.R. 1388 will address that issue by
taking approximately 511 acres in
Sonoma County, California, into trust
as part of the reservation of the Lytton
Rancheria. On 124 acres of the land, the
Tribe plans to build housing for its
members, as well as governmental and
community facilities. Another portion
of the land is currently being used for
viniculture, and the Tribe intends to
develop more of the lands for the same
purpose.
In response to local concerns, the
Tribe has agreed that the lands will
not be used for gaming. This is pro-
vided in the text of the legislation as
well as in a binding memorandum of
agreement with the Sonoma County
Board of Supervisors.
In addition to the memorandum of
agreement with the County of Sonoma,
the Tribe has also entered into agree-
ments with the local school district
and the local fire department. Addi-
tionally, the Tribe is working with the
city of Windsor to ensure appropriate
water and sewer hookup.
b 1330
By directing that these lands be
taken into trust, the United States will
ensure that the Lytton Rancheria will
finally have a permanently protected
homeland on which they can once
again live as a community and plan for
the future.
An identical bill passed the House
last Congress by voice vote, and I urge
quick adoption of this legislation as
well.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1388 will pro-
vide for the acquisition of a number of
acres of noncontiguous land in trust
for the benefit of Lytton Rancheria.
The lands, located in Sonoma County
next to the town of Windsor, are the
subject of a fee-to-trust application
filed by the Tribe with the Department
of the Interior in 2009.
Neither the Obama nor Trump ad-
ministration has provided a reason why
the Tribe’s application has not been ap-
proved in the last 10 years.
The Tribe has testified that it in-
tends to use a portion of the land for
tribal housing, while the rest would
support a diverse range of economic de-
velopment, including plans for a future
resort and winery.
I notice everyone paid attention to
that last word.
An identical measure passed the
House in the previous Congress, and it
has been reported twice by the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources, though
not in the current Congress.
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of
the measure, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1388.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, on
that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on the measure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona?
There was no objection.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 297 will extend
Federal recognition to the Little Shell
Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana.
Federal recognition of Native Amer-
ican Tribes is critical to protecting
their tribal sovereignty and restoring a
tribe’s ability to control its land, its
water, and its resources, as well as the
ability to govern and to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of its mem-
bers.
The Little Shell Tribe has resided in
Montana for well over a century and
has long been recognized as a tribe by
the State of Montana.
The Little Shell Tribe is a political
successor to the signatories of the
Pembina Treaty of 1863, under which a
large area of the land in the State of
North Dakota was ceded to the United
States. While the Federal Government
has federally recognized the two other
Tribes that are successors to the sig-
natories of the treaty, the Little Shell
have inexplicably been left in limbo.
The Little Shell Tribe has repeatedly
petitioned the Federal Government for
Federal recognition, first in the 1930s
and 1940s under the Indian Reorganiza-
tion Act, and later, starting in 1978,
through the Department of the Inte-
rior’s recognition process. However, de-
spite their long and well-documented
history, they were deprived of their
rightful Federal recognition each time.
H.R. 297 finally extends recognition
to the Little Shell Tribe, making all
Federal laws and regulations of general
applicability to Indians and Indian
Tribes applicable to Little Shell and
its members.
Federal recognition of the Little
Shell Tribe enjoys broad support in
Montana, including support from the
Governor’s office, the Montana State
Legislature, the surrounding counties
and cities, and from all the other feder-
ally recognized Montana Tribes.
Recognition of the Little Shell is
long overdue.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 297, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 297, sponsored
by Congressman GIANFORTE, would ex-
tend Federal recognition to the Little
Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of
Montana.
With Federal recognition, the Little
Shell Tribe and its members would be
eligible for all services and benefits
provided by the Federal Government to
Indians because of their status as Indi-
ans.
A previous version of this bill passed
without opposition in the last Con-
gress, thanks in large part to the gen-
tleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE),
who has been a tireless advocate of rec-
ognizing the Little Shell Tribe and
whose work has been instrumental to
bring this legislation closer to the fin-
ish line.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Montana (Mr.
GIANFORTE).
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for the time.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to once
again provide the Little Shell Tribe of
Chippewa Indians of Montana with the
overdue Federal recognition that they
deserve.
The Little Shell Tribe began peti-
tioning the Federal Government for
recognition in the 1930s, over 80 years
ago.
Last year, the Little Shell Tribe of
Chippewa Indians Restoration Act
passed this Chamber unanimously. It
was the first time that a bill providing
Federal recognition to the Little Shell
Tribe passed either the House or the
Senate. Following the passage in the
House, however, the uncontroversial
bill hit a roadblock in the Senate.
Today, we again take up their worthy
cause as we pass this bill.
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman
GRIJALVA and Ranking Member BISHOP
for their continued support.
This Congress should provide the Lit-
tle Shell Tribe with the Federal rec-
ognition it deserves, particularly after
its eight decades of dedicated efforts.
Hopefully, my colleagues in the Senate
will recognize the importance of this
legislation.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
on the bill.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I
have no further requests for time, and
I want to extend our appreciation for
his work to the sponsor of the legisla-
tion. It passed unanimously, as he indi-
cated, and there is no reason why we
can’t do that again today.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 297.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, on
that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.
f

HONORING THE CABLE–SATELLITE
PUBLIC AFFAIRS NETWORK
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, this is
very important. We are going to ob-
serve the 40th anniversary of C–SPAN.
Are you ready for that? Are you braced
for the excitement of it all?
If that is not enough for you, today is
my birthday. No singing. I thank you
so much, and I will convey those good
wishes to C–SPAN as well.
Madam Speaker, our Founders envi-
sioned a people’s House that would be
transparent and accountable to the
American people. The very first House
sessions were made open to the public
so that the American people could see
our debates and have their voices
heard.
I rise to honor an institution that
powerfully honors that legacy, ensur-
ing that our sessions can be a townhall
for the Nation: the Cable–Satellite
Public Affairs Network, C–SPAN.
Since its founding 40 years ago, C–
SPAN has offered tens of millions of
Americans a front-row seat to democ-
racy, training an unblinking eye on
Congress and the campaign trail, Presi-
dents and parliaments, and so much
more.
We all know C–SPAN is a pillar of
our public discourse and a beacon of
unbiased reporting, an institution so
committed to objectivity and impar-
tiality that its founder never once ut-
tered his own name on the air through-
out 33 years of interviews, roundtables,
and lectures.
I thank Brian Lamb for his service to
our democracy.
C–SPAN has not only exposed our
public debate, it has enhanced our dis-
course, and in doing so, enriched our
democracy: shining light on govern-
ment to keep our leaders honest and
accountable, educating and informing
the public through gavel-to-gavel cov-
erage, Book TV, American History TV,
C–SPAN Radio, the Video Library, and
interactive resources such as the C–
SPAN bus—let’s hear it for the C–
SPAN bus—and renewing the promise
and purpose of our American democ-
racy, a government of, by, and for the
people.
In the first speech ever televised by
C–SPAN, our former colleague, then-
Representative Al Gore, spoke pre-
scient words about its power.
Al Gore said:
The marriage of this medium and of our
open debate have the potential . . . to revi-
talize representative democracy, offering a
solution for the lack of confidence in govern-
ment.
Our country has been strengthened
by C–SPAN’s progress to deliver on
that promise, revitalizing our democ-
racy so that people can have confidence
that this institution works for the pub-
lic interest.
On behalf of the House of Representa-
tives, I did want to tell you some C–
SPAN stories about what children have
said about what they have seen when
they have watched Congress in session,
but I will save that for another day.
On behalf of the House of Representa-
tives, I thank the founder, Brian Lamb,
and the entire C–SPAN family for their
enduring contributions to the public
debate and to our American democ-
racy.
Congratulations on 40 years.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished gentleman from California
(Mr. MCCARTHY), who is the minority
leader.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I
want to thank the Speaker for yield-
ing, and I also want to wish her a very
happy birthday.
Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate a
milestone in the history of open and
accessible government. Now, many of
us here and across the country were
first introduced as a child to how gov-
ernment works through our Saturday
morning cartoons in Schoolhouse
Rock’s ‘‘I’m Just a Bill on Capitol
Hill,’’ but giving life to the animation,
C–SPAN has taken the education and
turned it into experience.
Over the last 40 years, C–SPAN has
ensured the country experienced some
of the most consequential and memo-
rable moments that transpired right
here in this body.
On the 50th anniversary of the Selma
civil rights march, JOHN LEWIS re-
minded us of the quiet dignity of the
600 Americans who put their lives on
the line that this Nation might live up
to the promises made in its founding
documents. As JOHN LEWIS said, Our
country will never, ever be the same
because of what happened on this
bridge. C–SPAN was there.
At the height of the Iraq war, Sam
Johnson, a Vietnam veteran and POW,
gave a powerful salute to our soldiers
and taught us an important lesson
about patriotism and service before
self. We are better as a country because
of the example Sam Johnson set. C–
SPAN was there.
Throughout these 40 years of experi-
ences that have changed the culture of
history, from the Contract with Amer-
ica to the election of the first woman
Speaker, even capturing the light-
hearted moments of humor that can
make their way in to times of very se-
rious debate, C–SPAN captured it all.
This is important because the rise of
the internet and the new media envi-
ronment has only reinforced the need
for C–SPAN’s unfiltered coverage and
unbiased programing. Now more than
ever people must be able to form their
own opinions. They need objective cov-
erage, access to balanced analysis, and
the opportunity to debate their views
with others in good faith. C–SPAN does
just that.
Madam Speaker, James Madison be-
lieved that representative government
did more than cater to individual inter-
ests. He said that one of its key advan-
tages was that it refined and enlarged
the public view about the common
good. For the last 40 years, C–SPAN
has been an irreplaceable tool for ac-
complishing Madison’s vision.
I know I speak for the whole House in
congratulating C–SPAN for four dec-
ades of coverage.

AUTHORIZING THE HONORARY AP-
POINTMENT OF ROBERT J. DOLE
TO THE GRADE OF COLONEL IN
THE REGULAR ARMY
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Armed Services be dis-
charged from further consideration of
the bill (S. 252) to authorize the hon-
orary appointment of Robert J. Dole to
the grade of colonel in the regular
Army, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration in the House.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
The text of the bill is as follows:
S. 252
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Robert J. Dole, also known as Bob Dole,
was born July 22, 1923, in Russell, Kansas.
(2) As a student at the University of Kan-
sas, Bob Dole enrolled in the Army Enlisted
Reserve Corps in 1942. He was called to active
duty the following year and served during
World War II. While deployed to Italy as an
infantry lieutenant in the 10th Mountain Di-
vision, he was seriously wounded in combat
and was twice cited for acts of heroism under
fire. He finished his military service with
two Purple Hearts and two awards of the
Bronze Star Medal with ‘‘V’’ device for valor.
He was also awarded the American Campaign
medal, the European-African-Middle Eastern
Campaign Medal, and the World War II Vic-
tory medal. He resigned his Army commis-
sion at the grade of captain.
(3) Bob Dole served in the House of Rep-
resentatives from 1961 to 1969. He served in
the Senate from 1969 until 1996. His service
was previously recognized by both the Legis-
lative Branch of the United States Govern-
ment, through the Congressional Gold
Medal, and the Executive Branch of the
United States Government, through the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.
(4) Separate from the actions underlying
the honors previously bestowed upon him,
Bob Dole also made direct contributions to
the Department of Defense and the veterans
of United States military service, including
through the following:
(A) Bob Dole sponsored or co-sponsored
bills in Congress to improve veterans bene-
fits, to improve accountability of missing
members of the Armed Forces, to establish
the Persian Gulf War Veterans Health Reg-
istry, to recognize women veterans, and to
provide relief from certain inequities for Na-
tional Guard technician service in connec-
tion with civil service retirement.
(B) Bob Dole served as the National Chair-
man of the WWII Memorial Campaign, co-
chair of the Families of Freedom Scholar-
ship Fund, and co-chair of the Presidential
Commission on the Care of America’s Re-
turning Wounded Warriors.
(5) In 2018, an Army advisory panel re-
viewed the comprehensive record of Bob
Dole’s service to the Armed Forces, veterans,
and the national security of the United
States. The panel, recognizing Bob Dole’s
unique contributions to the Department of
Defense and veterans, recommended the hon-
orary promotion of Bob Dole to the grade of
colonel in the Army.
(6) Acting under provisions of section 1563
of title 10, United States Code, the Secretary
of the Army endorsed the recommendation of
the advisory panel for an honorary pro-
motion of Bob Dole and forwarded it to Con-
gress for further action.

sas, to the grade of colonel in the regular
Army is hereby authorized.
(b) ADDITIONAL BENEFITS NOT TO ACCRUE.—
The honorary appointment of Robert J. Dole
to the grade of colonel in the regular Army
under subsection (a) shall not affect pay or
other benefits from the United States to
which Robert J. Dole is otherwise entitled
based upon his military service or affect any
benefits to which any other person may be-

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
the Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of
H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act, and ask for its
immediate consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, if this unanimous consent re-
quest cannot be entertained, I urge the
Speaker and the majority leader to im-
mediately schedule the Born-Alive bill
so we can stand up and protect the
sanctity of human life and I ask all
others to join in in that request.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is not recognized for debate.
f
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
(Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to call out a
growing insidious threat to women.
There are bills in at least eight State
legislatures that would outlaw abor-
tions if a heartbeat can be detected.
Typically, this is at about 6 weeks of a
pregnancy, though it can be earlier.
Six weeks is before many women
even know that they are pregnant, ef-
fectively taking away their right to
choose whether or not to begin or ex-
pand their family.
These laws are cruel. They are also in
direct violation of the Supreme Court’s
decision in Roe v. Wade, a precedent
that has stood for over 45 years.
That is the point. Mississippi Gov-
ernor Phil Bryant recently signed into
law one of these bills, and he did so
knowing it was unconstitutional. He
even admitted he was signing this bill
for his own religious reasons knowing
that it was likely to be challenged. He
wants to see it go to the Supreme
Court because he wants credit for try-
ing to overturn Roe v. Wade.
But the women of this country will
not go back. We have fought tooth and
nail to obtain our rights in this coun-
try. Those who believe women will give
up their right to control their own bod-
ies will quickly learn that that are
sorely mistaken.
f
b 1445
ANTI-SEMITISM
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to speak out against the plague known
as anti-Semitism. We witnessed it in
Charlottesville. We suffered through
the killings at the Tree of Life syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh, Mr. Speaker, and
we saw it again recently here in Con-
gress.
Anti-Semitism is a condition that
has afflicted our world for many cen-
turies and ranges from written and spo-
ken words to the mass murder of 6 mil-
lion Jews in the Holocaust.
Each of us must speak out and con-
demn it in clear and certain terms
whenever it appears, Mr. Speaker.
In Knoxville, my late father, mother,
and I, along with our good friend, Ber-
nie Bernstein, helped build with our
own hands a memorial to the 6 million.
Just a few months ago, I traveled to
Israel and saw firsthand how the Holo-
caust affected the Jewish people and
how they created a new and dynamic
democratic state in the Middle East.
As I heard someone say yesterday,
Israel is an oasis of democracy in a
conflicted region, and support for
Israel is not a Jewish issue; it is an
American issue, Mr. Speaker.
But, Mr. Speaker, the truth is, sup-
port for one of our Nation’s staunchest
allies and anti-Semitism, they cannot
coexist.
As we remember the Holocaust and
protect the democracy of Israel, let us
join together in condemning anti-Sem-
itism in whatever form it appears,
whether in our neighborhoods or here
on the House floor.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
A message in writing from the Presi-

HONORING BRIGADIER GENERAL
SHAN K. BAGBY
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor an exceptional dentist,
Army Brigadier General Shan K.
Bagby.
General Bagby is the first African
American Army dentist to be promoted
to the rank of general. He is the first-
ever African American to serve as chief
of the Army Dental Corps.
General Bagby was born in Newark,
New Jersey. When he was 8 years old,
General Bagby went to the neighbor-
hood health clinic and met an African
American dentist. That visit, more
than 40 years ago, inspired him to be-
come a dentist himself.
When General Bagby graduated from
Columbia High School in Maplewood,
New Jersey, also in my district, he
went to Rutgers University to study
physics.
Today, General Bagby is a rising star
in the U.S. Army. He is an inspiration
to young people across the country
who dream of becoming a dentist.
I ask my colleagues to join me in
honoring Brigadier General Shan K.
Bagby for his service to our country.
f
COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF
DR. LLOYD DARBY, III
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today with a heavy heart to commemo-
rate the life of Dr. Lloyd Darby, III.
Dr. Darby was a Georgia-12 native
and lifelong resident of Vidalia, Geor-
gia, and the lasting impact he leaves
behind on behalf of the local commu-
nity, his friends, and his family will be
remembered for generations.
With a deep love for our Nation and
a strong passion for serving others, his
many years as a U.S. Navy lieutenant,
prominent dentist, and instrumental
political figure speaks volumes about
his character.
Dr. Darby was a former chairman of
the Toombs County Republican Party,
district chairman and member of the
state GOP board, and a delegate to the
1972 and 1976 Republican National Con-
ventions.
Additionally, he served as chairman
of the Friends of Mattingly campaign
during Mack Mattingly’s tenure as
U.S. Senator. He was the first Repub-
lican Senator from Georgia elected
since the Reconstruction era.
Lloyd Darby was a man passionate
about his faith. He cherished his local
community, loved his wife of 60 years,
and his entire family beyond measure.
Lloyd’s passion was to give back a
smile and to help those who otherwise
could not help themselves.
Robin and I send our heartfelt condo-
lences and prayers to all of Dr. Darby’s
family, friends, and community on a
life well lived.

minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, this past
winter, Iowa and the Midwest experi-
enced record snowfall with freezing
temperatures. The ground has re-
mained frozen, which kept the snow
from melting into our soil. And then
the rapid warming over March 12 to
March 14, along with heavy rains, re-
sulted in mass flooding and devastation
across Iowa, particularly in my district
of southwest Iowa.
The flooding has resulted in hundreds
of millions, if not billions, of dollars in
agricultural losses; destroyed homes,
schools, small businesses, medical cen-
ters; and has caused significant damage
to public infrastructure that is vital to
these communities.
Entire small towns, such as Hamburg
in Fremont County and Pacific Junc-
tion, shown here, in Mills County, are
under water and are facing irreparable
damage.
Communities are without sanitary
water. The lasting effects on the health
and well-being of Iowa families is be-
yond calculation, and the flooding is
still ongoing. We have yet to have seen,
probably, the worst of it.
I am grateful that the President de-
clared a disaster emergency declara-
tion to support efforts to guarantee
public safety and rapid recovery, but,
given the impact of this flooding—and
it was mainly in smaller rural commu-
nities—the assistance needed to ensure
these communities can recover is dra-
matic, and I have requested the House
Appropriations Committee to fund ad-
ditional disaster supplemental support.
f
ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
JOHNSON of Georgia). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 3,
2019, the gentleman from California
(Mr. GARAMENDI) is recognized for 60
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I
have got a couple of things I want to do
today, and I would like to start with a
very special celebration that occurs
every spring, and this is the Sikh com-
munity’s annual historic, cultural, and
religious celebration of Vaisakhi.
It is a celebration in the Punjab re-
gion of south Asia. It has been going on
for centuries, and today it is also cele-
brated in communities throughout
India, the United States, and, really,
around the world.
Vaisakhi is an annual festival cele-
brating the spring season, and it is of
great significance to the Sikh religion.
It commemorates the creation of
Khalsa, a fellowship of devoted Sikhs,
and was founded in 1699 by Guru Singh
and celebrates the community, pros-
perity, and continued progress in the
year ahead.
It is springtime, and so we celebrate
this very important event in the Sikh
community.
I also want to talk about another
event of the spring, one that you just
heard mentioned a moment ago from
our colleague, Mrs. AXNE of Iowa, when
she talked about the flooding that is
occurring.
As chairman of the House Sub-
committee on Readiness of the Armed
Services Committee, the question for
the U.S. military is very, very clear: Is
the U.S. military ready for climate
change?
Recent events indicate that there is
considerable doubt. Just this last year,
Hurricanes Florence and Michael
caused billions of dollars of damage to
Camp Lejeune and leveled much of
Tyndall Air Force Base.
Perhaps a photo might be better than
my words in describing the destruction
at Tyndall Air Force Base. Essentially,
this key Air Force base located on the
Panhandle of Florida, on the Gulf
Coast, was wiped out.
We don’t yet know how much it is
going to cost to rebuild it. We do know
that the Air Force is trying to sustain
operations there, and I am told that by
May they will be out of money to be
able to sustain operations.
We know that there is probably $3 to
$4 billion of damage at this Air Force
base alone. Keep in mind that this base
is located, literally, on a sand spit ad-
jacent to the Gulf, and, when hurri-
canes come through, destruction is
sure to occur.
Every marine knows this place, Camp
Lejeune. It, too, was hit by a hurri-
cane, not the winds but the deluge that
came with the hurricane.
Flooding wiped out a large portion of
the base. As you can see, a tree did
something that no marine would ever
want to have happen, and that is to
take out their barracks. This base, too,
sustained substantial damage as a re-
sult of the hurricane and the flood that
was precipitated by the hurricane.
This is also a $3 to $4 billion event.
The rebuilding of Camp Lejeune and
Tyndall raises a serious question for
those of us who must decide on the ap-
propriations: Should we even return to
these locations which we know are
going to be hit once again and perhaps
multiple times in the future?
And if we decide to return and spend
the $3 to $4 billion to repair each of the
bases, how will it be done? Will it be
done in the recognition that there is
climate change, that the hurricanes
will be stronger, the deluge even more?
We must always build for resiliency.
Now, this isn’t the only place that
the military has sustained significant
risk this year. I am from California,
and I know wildfires. Camp Pendleton,
on the far side of this continent, an-
other marine base, faced evacuation of
the family housing units when fires oc-
curred in the hills above Camp Pen-
dleton.
Naval Air Station Point Mugu and
the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare
Training Center in the Sierra Nevada
mountains also had to be evacuated as
wildfires came down into those areas.
In addition, beyond Camp Lejeune,
beyond Tyndall Air Force Base, we
know that our coastal installations
and their surrounding communities are
already experiencing significant flood-
ing as sea levels rise.
The Army’s Ronald Reagan Ballistic
Missile Defense Test Site at the Kwaja-
lein Atoll in the Pacific is threatened
by sea level rise and is not expected to
exist in 20 years.
The Navy’s principal Atlantic base,
Norfolk/Hampton Roads, and the Naval
Academy are already experiencing
flooding.
We know that melting polar ice in
Arctic regions has already opened up
new sea lanes and new routes and com-
petition for resources in the Arctic
Ocean.
Yet, today, it appears that the De-
partment of Defense has not developed
a systematic strategy for ensuring that
our U.S. national interests in the Arc-
tic and, indeed, the protection of our
bases, key military bases, here in the
United States and around the world are
prepared for climate change.
I want to give you one more example.
It was actually opened in a discussion
a moment ago by my friend from Iowa.
Now, this is not Iowa. This is Offutt
Air Force Base, just across the river
from the photo you saw just a few mo-
ments ago of the flooding in Iowa. It is
on the Missouri River. This happens to
be the Strategic Air Command’s Basic
Center. This is our nuclear weapons
system.
b 1500
More than half of the base was under-
water, and more than half of the base
today is not operable. Six years ago,
the U.S. Air Force knew that this Stra-
tegic Air Command base was subject to
flooding. Indeed, the flooding 6 years
ago had come up to the edge of the run-
way. Last week, it inundated the run-
way and half the base.
Back to my question: Is the U.S.
military ready for climate change? It
would indicate, from these few exam-
ples, that the answer is no. So what are
we to do about it?
The United States military is one of
the largest employers in the world. It
is also one of the largest consumers of
energy. The Department of Defense
owns millions of acres of global real
property, including over 550,000 facili-
ties valued at well over $1 trillion. The
Department is uniquely situated to en-
hance its readiness and resiliency
through effective energy policies, pro-
grams, and structures that are resil-
ient in the face of climate change.
Installations, bases, are where we
generate the force, where we train and
sustain them and, in many cases, house
critical operational missions, such as
the Strategic Air Command.
One way to enhance readiness is to
consume less. In fiscal year 2017, the
Department of Defense consumed over
85 million barrels of fuel to power
ships, aircraft, combat vehicles, and
contingency bases, at a cost of nearly
$8.2 billion. In many cases, through
contract vehicles such as energy-saving

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2820 March 26, 2019
performance contracts, these energy-
saving and resiliency enhancements
can be made at no upfront cost to the
Department of Defense.
In contested environments, such as
Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, better
fuel consumption extends the range of,
and mitigates the risk to, our military.
The resupply of energy is one of the
most dangerous things that occurs in
military operations, and resupply con-
voys are targeted. Naval vessels are
vulnerable during at-sea replenish-
ment. For austere land-based sites in
remote locations supporting contin-
gency operations around the world,
lower fuel and water consumption rates
are an essential readiness enabler,
helping that facility to maintain a
lower profile at far less risk.
It is essential that our bases and our
facilities recover quickly from extreme
weather events and from energy disrup-
tions that impact mission capability.
Section 335 of the fiscal year 2018 Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act re-
quired the Department of Defense to
report on the effects of climate change
on the Department and propose mitiga-
tion plans. We have that report in
hand. Only days after we received it,
Camp Lejeune was flooded; Tyndall was
wiped out; and now Offutt is flooded.
We are not happy with the report
that the military sent to the House
Armed Services Committee and the
Subcommittee on Readiness because
that report did not meet the congres-
sional reporting requirement that we
sent to the Department to describe fu-
ture focused mitigations necessary to
ensure mission resiliency.
We are not going to stop. The mili-
tary is going to come back to the com-
mittee, and we are going to hammer
home the necessity of resiliency and
the necessity, as every Boy Scout
knows, to be prepared.
What do they need to be prepared
for? Certainly, for the missions, what-
ever those might be, whether it is the
Strategic Air Command or the Marines
or the Air Force, but also to be pre-
pared for the inevitable effects of cli-
mate change.
To ensure that the military can per-
form its national defense mandate, the
Department of Defense must—must—
plan for the vagaries and exigencies
that exist as a result of climate
change.
The ‘‘2014 Climate Change Adapta-
tion Road Map’’ that the Department
put out noted that rising global tem-
peratures, changing precipitation pat-
terns, climbing sea levels, and extreme
weather events will intensify the chal-
lenges of global instability. Hunger,
poverty, and conflict are the inevitable
results of climate change and its ef-
fects on communities all around the
world.
In the Department’s words, climate
change ‘‘will likely lead to food and
water shortages, pandemic disease, dis-
putes over refugees and resources, and
destruction by natural disasters . . .
across the globe.’’
Not only are these climate-related
events impacting installations and
base readiness, but they are also cre-
ating more frequent requests for mili-
tary support for disaster relief and hu-
manitarian assistance. Active Duty
servicemembers, National Guard per-
sonnel, and Reserve personnel are in-
creasingly responding to assist commu-
nities in impacted events here in the
United States and around the world.
Climate change presents a myriad of
readiness challenges, both here at
home and abroad. It is not only a fu-
ture threat. By the events of this year
and last week, it is an event here and
now. It is a threat today; it is impact-
ing the resiliency of our installations
and our operations; and it is seriously
impacting the readiness of the Depart-
ment of Defense to meet its challenges
all around the world.
We have our hands full, making sure
that our military is ready in the era of
climate change.
HEALTHCARE IN AMERICA
Mr. GARAMENDI. Now, if I might,
Mr. Speaker, change subjects and pick
up another issue that is before us
today. Joining me in this discussion
will be Mr. PAYNE from the beautiful
State of New Jersey.
Just a moment, Mr. PAYNE. Let me
lay out what we are going to talk
about here.
Today, the House Democrats un-
veiled new legislation to protect people
with preexisting conditions and also to
lower healthcare costs. We know that,
over the last 2 years, President Trump
has declared war on healthcare, and
the Democrats here in this House and
in the Senate intend to address that by
lowering healthcare costs.
Last night, in a Federal court, Presi-
dent Trump radically expanded his
monstrous war on America’s
healthcare, asking the court not only
to strike down protections for people
with preexisting conditions—not only
asking the court to strike down protec-
tions for people with preexisting condi-
tions—but also to eliminate the very
last protections and benefits provided
in the Affordable Care Act.
If President Trump gets his way in
the Texas v. U.S. lawsuit, he would de-
stroy the ban on lifetime and annual
limits of care. He would destroy the
Medicare expansion and the tax sub-
sidies that make health insurance af-
fordable for millions of America.
On the very first day of the 116th
Congress, the House Democrats voted
to throw the full legal weight of the
House of Representatives against what
President Trump is attempting to do in
the Texas v. U.S. lawsuit. Thanks to
that vote, the House counsel has been
able to intervene as a party in the law-
suit to argue on behalf of the
healthcare of the American people. But
more than 190 of my Republican col-
leagues stood behind the President in
his brutal assault on American
healthcare.
Unlike my colleagues on the Repub-
lican side, today, the Democrats of
Congress are introducing legislation to
protect preexisting conditions and
make healthcare more affordable. We
are taking another step forward to de-
liver on our promises to reverse the
last 10 years of our Republican col-
leagues’ effort to sabotage the Afford-
able Care Act, and to lower the
healthcare costs that American fami-
lies need.
There are three parts to the legisla-
tion: lowering healthcare insurance
premiums with strengthened and ex-
panded affordable assistance; expand-
ing the tax credits that make
healthcare insurance more affordable
to more middle-income families; and
making them more sustainable to all
those who are eligible.
Point 2 strengthens protections for
people with preexisting conditions, cur-
tailing the Trump administration’s ef-
fort to give States waivers to under-
mine protections for people with pre-
existing conditions and weaken the
standards for essential health benefits.
Third, stop the insurance companies
from selling junk health insurance
policies.
Finally, reverse the GOP’s health
sabotage that has needlessly driven up
premiums and uninsured rates.
We know we are going to have our
hands full to get this past the Senate
and to the desk of the President, but
we would hope, as this debate develops,
as time goes by and Americans realize
what they are losing as a result of the
efforts of the Trump administration
and many of my Republican colleagues
to deny them the healthcare that they
deserve as Americans, that we will ul-
timately be successful in this legisla-
tion and that we will get the President
to see clearly what he is doing to the
American people as he promotes, de-
fends, and attacks Americans through
the Texas v. U.S. lawsuit that is cur-
rently underway.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my
colleague, Mr. PAYNE, if he could join
us with his comments. I yield to the
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
PAYNE).
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Congressman GARAMENDI for his leader-
ship and for bringing us together today
on two very, very important topics. I
have come to know him as a leader on
issues that are impacting the American
people, from California to New Jersey.
The gentleman has demonstrated a
concern for all people of this country
and his constituents. For that, I am
grateful.
Today, the second topic on the Demo-
cratic agenda for the people, protecting
preexisting conditions, is both timely
and important. Yesterday, the Trump
administration unleashed another as-
sault on the Affordable Care Act. In
Federal court, the Trump administra-
tion said that it agrees with the lower
court’s decision to overturn the Afford-
able Care Act.
After campaigning on the premise
that he would work to improve
healthcare, President Trump wants to

eliminate protections for people with
preexisting conditions.
President Trump wants to end the
provision that allows young people to
stay on their parents’ health insurance
plans.
President Trump wants to bring back
junk insurance plans that take people’s
money but refuse to cover their med-
ical expenses. That is what will happen
if President Trump wins in Federal
court.
It was not that long ago when Fed-
eral law allowed insurance companies
to discriminate against people with
preexisting conditions. Insurance com-
panies could charge people with pre-
existing conditions extremely high
rates and refuse to cover them at all.
The Affordable Care Act eliminated le-
galized discrimination against people
with preexisting conditions.
b 1515
But now the Trump administration is
fighting to bring healthcare discrimi-
nation back.
Well, there is no going back.
More than 200,000 people in New Jer-
sey, alone, who purchase their insur-
ance through the Affordable Care Act
marketplace have preexisting condi-
tions. Nearly 5 million New Jerseyans
who get insurance through their em-
ployment could be harmed by Trump’s
attack on the Affordable Care Act’s
protections for people with preexisting
conditions.
New Jerseyans and all Americans de-
serve protection, not discrimination.
In my district, 16,000 people, alone,
with preexisting conditions would be at
risk of coverage loss or premium in-
creases if the Trump administration
successfully rolls back the Affordable
Care Act.
Now, let me touch on the effects of
this on women for a second.
The Affordable Care Act’s protection
for people with preexisting conditions
prevents insurance companies from
charging women a higher premium on
the basis of their being a woman. It
keeps insurance companies from charg-
ing women a higher premium on the
basis of them being a woman. Now,
that is not something that they had
very much of a choice in at birth, so it
is immoral to hold that against them.
What the Trump administration is
trying to do would result in women fac-
ing significantly higher health insur-
ance premiums simply because they
are not men. That wasn’t right before
the Affordable Care Act, and it sure
isn’t right now.
Let me be clear: The Trump adminis-
tration wants to put lives at risk by
undermining people’s access to
healthcare in this Nation.
And let me be clear about this: I will
keep fighting, along with the gen-
tleman from California (Mr.
GARAMENDI), to ensure that all Ameri-
cans’ healthcare is protected. That is
the least we can do in the position that
our constituents have given us in this
task to be their voice in this House.
Mr. Speaker, I just want to once
again commend Mr. GARAMENDI for al-
ways being timely in bringing these
issues to light for the American people
and for all the country to see, that we
here in the House of Representatives do
speak for them.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman so very much; he
is far too generous in his comments
with regard to me. He is constantly
here joining in these discussions and
putting forth the interests of the con-
stituents in his district in New Jersey
and across wider America. I thank the
gentleman for raising those issues, and
particularly for pointing out the issue
of preexisting conditions as it affects
women.
Before the Affordable Care Act, every
woman was considered to have a pre-
existing condition, and, indeed, they
were charged higher premiums. That is
not the case with the Affordable Care
Act in law, but if the Texas case is suc-
cessful, if the President is successful in
his arguments before the court and it
is carried on, then those protections
for women, more than 50 percent of the
American population, will be gone.
Beyond that, the expansion of the
Medicaid programs, those, too, will be
gone. For people with preexisting con-
ditions, people who have diabetes or
high blood pressure, their protections
will be gone.
So the effect on preexisting condi-
tions, and particularly this case that
the President has put his full support
behind, is an egregious attack on the
healthcare and the well-being of Amer-
icans, as Mr. PAYNE so well pointed
out. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman so much for doing that.
ARMED FORCES READINESS
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker,
there are a couple of other things that
I do want to speak to today.
Today, the House Armed Services
Committee had before it the Acting
Secretary of Defense as well as the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Issues were raised during that com-
mittee hearing about readiness, specifi-
cally about the efforts of the President
to circumvent the Constitution of the
United States and to take unto himself
the appropriation power, which is
clearly laid out in the Constitution as
the power of Congress.
Article I, Section 9 of the Constitu-
tion clearly says that there shall be no
money taken from the Treasury except
by appropriation law. That is the
power of the purse that is given to Con-
gress.
The Founders were very clear that, if
the President would have not only the
power of carrying out the law, but also
the power of appropriation—that is,
money to carry out the law—we would
have a completely different system. In
fact, we would have an imperial presi-
dency. They didn’t want that, and they
wrote very clearly into the Constitu-
tion that no money shall be taken from
the Treasury without an appropriation.
Now, the Congress acted on this
issue, acted on the issue with an appro-
priation bill, and Congress did not
agree with the President. Instead of
the $5 billion, $6 billion that the Presi-
dent wanted for his border wall, Con-
gress said no and provided $1.3 billion
for border security, including some
fences in some locations. Very clearly,
Congress said no to the President, and
Congress appropriated money for a spe-
cific purpose.
No sooner was that legislation signed
by the President than the President at-
tempted to usurp the power of Congress
and to appropriate for himself some $8
billion by manipulating the existing
emergency laws that allow the declara-
tion of emergency and money to be
spent for that emergency.
Okay. That is what he wanted to do.
Be clear in understanding that this is
the attempt by the President to appro-
priate money in an unconstitutional
and, I believe, an illegal way.
Now, it is not just a constitutional
issue; it is also an issue of readiness for
the military. We are talking about tens
of millions of dollars to rebuild Offutt
Air Force Base, the home of the Stra-
tegic Air Command.
We are talking about $3 billion to $4
billion to rebuild Camp Lejeune, one of
the two major domestic bases for the
U.S. Marine Corps.
We are talking about $3 billion to $4
billion to rebuild Tyndall Air Force
Base in Florida, the home of the F–22
fighter jets and the new and presumed
home of the new F–35 multitask fight-
er.
So we should ask: If the President is
able to divert $6 billion to $8 billion
from the military construction ac-
count, which we call MILCON, and use
it for his border wall, where are we to
find the money, the $3 billion to $4 bil-
lion to rebuild Tyndall, the $3 billion
to $4 billion to rebuild Camp Lejeune,
and all of the other bases across the
United States and around the world
that face climate change? Where are
we going to get the money?
Well, if you happen to be a deficit
hawk, you are going to get excited
about the prospect it is going to be bor-
rowed money.
The way in which the budget and the
appropriation process works here, crit-
ical programs that the military has
deemed essential for the readiness of
our military and Congress has agreed
to, authorized and appropriated money
for that purpose, those programs will
be delayed, and we will simply increase
the deficit to do it so that the Presi-
dent can fulfill his campaign promise
of a big, beautiful border wall.
Last week, I was in Jordan on a mili-
tary mission to look at our troops
there, to look at the situation in Syria
and Iraq. Also, I was in Iraq and spe-
cifically went to look at a program
that the U.S. Government had funded
to build a modern 21st century border
security program for Jordan’s military
and Jordan’s Government.

Syria, in the most violent part of the
world, with ISIS, with refugees, with

military weapons, with drugs, all of
that, we spent $345 million of taxpayer
money building a 21st century border
security system, a system that in-
volves observation techniques of many
kinds, a system that involves observa-
tion towers at appropriate locations
along that 300-plus-mile border, and
quick response teams to go where there
was an incursion across the border.
And by all accounts from our own mili-
tary, from Jordan’s military, it is ef-
fective.
Now, the President wants $8 billion
for 150 miles of fence and walls. There
is a better way, and as Democrats, we
have been calling for this better way
for months and months. In fact, in the
legislation that the President signed, it
is the better way.
It is not a big, beautiful wall with
‘‘Trump’’ written on it. It is, in fact, a
virtual system similar to what we built
in Jordan, in the most dangerous place
in the world, and it works.
So we need to be very careful here,
because that is $8 billion that will not
be available to make our American
military installations all around the
world ready for the tasks that they
have before them.
So as we ponder this issue, as we go
through the appropriation process this
spring, and as we fight this constitu-
tional battle with the President over
the founding mothers’ and fathers’ un-
derstanding of what an imperial presi-
dency could become if they have both
the appropriation power as well as the
power to execute the law, they said, no,
the President cannot have that power.
As we fight this fundamental con-
stitutional issue, we should also keep
in mind that there is a better way to
protect our southern border, or any
border for that matter, and it is essen-
tial that we spend the money that we
have appropriated for the military to
protect their readiness and, in so
doing, protect the security and safety
of America.
So we will have this debate, and this
debate will hopefully result in the
American public understanding what
they should have learned in grammar
school about civics and about the sepa-
ration of powers. Unfortunately, our
President seems to have missed that
class.
But we are not going to let it go.
This is not a Democratic or Republican
issue. This is an American constitu-
tional issue.
So let us proceed. Let us proceed in
full understanding of what is at stake
here: the rebuilding of the bases, yes,
but, more importantly, the very funda-
mental notion of the separation of pow-
ers that is inherent in the Constitu-
tion. And, by the way, every Member of
the House of Representatives, every
Senator, and every general, including
acting Secretaries of State, have taken
an oath to defend and uphold the Con-
stitution. We would all do well to read
Article I, Section 9.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

RECOGNIZING HARVEST HOME
FARMS
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the DiFebo family, con-
stituents of mine from Upper Mount
Bethel Township, Pennsylvania, who
run Harvest Home Farms. They were
recently honored with Pennsylvania’s
first-ever Leopold Conservation Award,
named after the conservationist Aldo
Leopold, for demonstrating excellence
in environmentally sustainable farm-
ing practices.
Richard DiFebo; his wife, Lynn; and
their sons, Dohl and Dane, work hard 7
days a week. Their days are long and,
as Richard says, it is a ‘‘family effort’’
that only works because everyone
pitches in.
In Richard’s words: ‘‘It all starts
with the health of the soil. Less runoff
means cleaner creeks and rivers, which
leads to cleaner air. It benefits the
whole community. You need to protect
those resources or there is not going to
be anything left for the next genera-
tion.’’
Congratulations to the DiFebo fam-
ily not just for this award, but for their

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO
SIGNIFICANT MALICIOUS CYBER-
ENABLED ACTIVITIES—MESSAGE
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–
23)
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message
from the President of the United
States; which was read and, together
with the accompanying papers, referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
and ordered to be printed:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive
Order 13694 of April 1, 2015, as amended
by Executive Order 13757 of December
28, 2016, is to continue in effect beyond
April 1, 2019.
Significant malicious cyber-enabled
activities originating from or directed
by persons located, in whole or in sub-
stantial part, outside the United States
continue to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity, foreign policy, and economy of
the United States. Therefore, I have de-
termined that it is necessary to con-
tinue the national emergency declared
in Executive Order 13694, as amended
by Executive Order 13757, with respect
to significant malicious cyber-enabled
activities.
DONALD J. TRUMP.

COMMEMORATING WORLD DOWN
SYNDROME AWARENESS DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Kan-
sas (Mr. ESTES) is recognized for 60
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, on March
21, our country and the world cele-
brated World Down Syndrome Aware-
ness Day.
This afternoon, I am happy to lead
my colleagues in recognizing this im-
portant day and all of the contribu-
tions individuals with Down syndrome
make each day to families, businesses,
schools, and communities. From broth-
ers and sisters to employees and
businessowners, to artists and models,
people with Down syndrome have an
incredible impact on every part of soci-
ety. They deserve our support, under-
standing, and full acceptance.
Thankfully, there are many groups
and programs that have made it their
mission to support individuals with
Down syndrome and their families.
As Kansas State treasurer, I advo-
cated for passage of the Federal ABLE
Act and led the effort to implement it
in Kansas.
It is kind of one of those things that,
several years ago, I didn’t necessarily
expect that I was going to be standing
here today; so I was going through the
process of how do we lobby, how do we
make sure that a good program gets
passed through the Federal legislative
process that benefits so many people,
and then having to take that initiative
in my home State of Kansas and work
through the legislature and making
sure that we implemented it to help
people’s quality of life and enable them
to live the lives that they wanted to
live and make it more beneficial for
them.
This important law created tax-free
savings accounts for individuals with
disabilities to cover expenses like
healthcare, education, housing, and
transportation. It is important for par-
ents raising a child to be able to help
provide their care.
Obviously, the concern on the part of
parents is that, over years, particu-
larly as the parents age, they want to
make sure that their children, in some
cases when they are in their adult life,
are able to enjoy the life that they
want and the life that they deserve. A
program like ABLE is able to help
make that dream come true.
These programs are similar to the 529
college savings programs, health sav-
ings accounts, and individual retire-
ment accounts. The ABLE accounts

give people with Down syndrome and
other disabilities the opportunities to
live the life they deserve.
The Kansas ABLE Act went into ef-
fect in January 2017. I was proud to be
part of that effort because it is the
right thing to do.
In Congress, I have been humbled to
work with organizations like the Na-
tional Down Syndrome Society to build
upon the progress of the ABLE Act.
Last year, I was honored to receive the
2018 National Down Syndrome Society
Impact Award and look forward to sup-
porting the mission in this Congress.
This year, I am also honored to be on
the honorary committee for the Ac-
ceptAbility Gala, hosted by the Global
Down Syndrome Foundation, an an-
nual event in Washington, D.C., that
supports lifesaving research and med-
ical care for children and adults with
Down syndrome.
Back home in Kansas, I am also in-
spired by groups like the Arc of Sedg-
wick County, which supports individ-
uals living with intellectual and devel-
opmental disabilities, including Down
syndrome.
Just as each of these groups, among
numerous others, supports those with
Down syndrome, it is my hope that, in
Congress, we can do the same thing.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to dis-
cussing this more today, but, at this
time, I am happy to yield to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER).
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
honor of World Down Syndrome Aware-
ness Day, which was Thursday, March
21.
One of the greatest blessings in my
life is my 16-year-old son, Isaac, who
has Down syndrome. Each day, he
brings joy to our lives, and I am so
proud of everything he has accom-
plished.
World Down Syndrome Awareness
Day is an excellent opportunity to
raise awareness about the challenges
that Down syndrome brings, but it is
also a chance to celebrate just how in-
credible people with Down syndrome
truly are. It absolutely breaks my
heart—just breaks my heart—when I
hear some people say that they would
rather get an abortion than have a
child with Down syndrome.
The sheer ignorance of those individ-
uals is disheartening to me. They do
not see what a blessing all of God’s
children are, even if they are different,
and that is unfortunate for them. If
they met my son Isaac, I know they
would have a change of heart.
When we talk about disabilities, I
want us to talk about the abilities of
those like my son Isaac. Instead of fo-
cusing on what they can’t do, let’s
focus on what they can do.
The limit to what people like Isaac
can accomplish is not determined by
their condition but by how much we
love them and give them the empower-
ment so they can navigate the world of
work, education, and public life.
As Isaac’s dad and now as a Member
of Congress, I am committed to strong-
ly advocating for the inclusiveness of
those who live with disabilities and the
protection of their lives, always.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Representative STAUBER for those com-
ments.
Mr. Speaker, it is important for us,
as Representatives, to actually stand
up for what we think is important. Ob-
viously, as parents, we all care about
our children. We want to make sure
they get the best opportunities that
they can, and, as elected Representa-
tives, one of the reasons I ran for office
was to make sure that we could have
an impact and make sure that we could
make a difference in people’s lives.
When I look at the role of the Fed-
eral Government, one of the things
that is most important for us is mak-
ing sure that we can help those individ-
uals live out the life that is embedded
in our Constitution and Declaration of
Independence and having the right to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness, people having that opportunity to
live and enjoy all the blessings of this
great country.
We can talk a lot about different
issues, and there are, obviously, lots of
us here in the Halls of Congress who
want to talk about some of those
issues. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), my
good friend, who wants to weigh in on
this subject as well.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my friend from Kansas for yield-
ing. I appreciate him organizing an op-
portunity to come to the House floor
and talk about this important issue.
As the father of two children, I have
been committed to policies for a safe
and enduring future for all kids and un-
derstand that we have to ensure the
protection of kids no matter what their
walk in life, particularly those with de-
velopmental disabilities.
Mr. Speaker, over 200,000 in the
United States live with Down syn-
drome, and one in 792 babies is born
with this genetic disorder. While there
have been great advances in medical
research and public policy to enhance
the lives of those affected by Down
syndrome, there is still much work to
be done.
Individuals with disabilities face
many challenges, and I understand the
need to ensure access to vital services
and medical equipment to support
independent and active lives. This is
critical to help effectively live with
Down syndrome. Getting our kids the
proper development path at a young
age helps them ensure they will be
healthier adults with a bright future.
For over 20 years, I have watched
with such pleasure young people begin
to build that proper developmental
path at Access Academy in Little Rock
or Easter Seals Academy at Riverdale.
As a former member of the board of
directors of Arkansas Children’s Hos-
pital, I saw firsthand how important it
was that parents are given the tools
they need to keep their children
healthy. This is particularly important
for families who have a child with a
disability.
Back in 1990, President George H. W.
Bush signed the ADA into law, the
Americans with Disabilities Act. I was
proud to have been working on Presi-
dent Bush’s staff at that time. It was
an amazing piece of legislative work
that brought this Congress together
and that has benefited thousands and
millions of Americans and families
since.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues to build upon that legisla-
tion so that all Americans can reach
their full potential, no matter what
challenges they face. I will continue to
support efforts that provide services to
individuals and families who are im-
pacted by Down syndrome.
Regardless of political ideology, I
think we can all agree that every sin-
gle child deserves protection. When I
think about the kids over the past two
decades whom I have watched grow up,
who had incredibly nurturing parents
who got them on that developmental
path in the right way, who sacrificed so
that they had that opportunity to talk
about what my colleague did, the pur-
suit of happiness, and I see them smil-
ing at workplaces when I visit in
Conway, North Little Rock, and Little
Rock, that they have a job, that they
are out working, that they have that
self-sufficiency and excitement of the
work they do, it gives me such a warm
feeling to see their success with all the
hard work they have put into that pur-
suit of happiness.
Finally, Mr. Speaker, I have to say,
and I don’t think it should be left un-
said today, that a right to abortion
should not extend to children with
traits deemed undesirable or inconven-
ient. Would we throw away a life so
casually if a child had the wrong color
eyes or off-texture hair? Of course not.
If a child does not fit the physical or
developmental ideals of their parents,
they should be treated with the same
degree of medical attention, love, and
care as any other child. As a proud
Catholic and proud pro-life Member of
Congress, I believe we need to value
life.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from
Kansas for hosting this important
event today to talk about Down syn-
drome, the love we have for our Amer-
ican citizens who live with Down syn-
drome, and the affection we have and
support we have for their families.

Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL).
It is tremendous to be able to work
with representatives like him that
have a goal to focus on: how do we
make life better? How do we provide
opportunities for individuals?
You touched on a sad part in society
today where so many people seem to
think that it is right that just because
of some particular trait that the par-
ents don’t necessarily like, that they
are able to kill individuals because of
that through abortion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2824 March 26, 2019
When we are talking about Down
syndrome and awareness of that, you
know, it is a sad fact that we have got
to address this issue. We have got to
address that extreme discrimination
that some individuals that want to im-
press upon those people who may have
Down syndrome even before they have
a chance to live a life.
In the United States, two-thirds—67
percent—of babies diagnosed with
Down syndrome while in the womb are
aborted.
In Europe, it is even worse. In
France, the rate is 77 percent. In Den-
mark, it is 98 percent. And in Iceland,
it is nearly 100 percent, where late-
term abortions are allowed if the baby
has a deformity, which includes Down
syndrome, to quote a CBS News article.
In a society where Down syndrome
individuals can have a wonderful qual-
ity of life and pursue their dreams, this
discrimination needs to be brought to
light.
We live during a time when there is
so much medical innovation, so many
opportunities, so many brilliant things
that our doctors are developing, we
need to make sure that we capitalize
on that innovation, make sure that we
allow people the opportunity to live a
full life and live the opportunities that
they enjoy.
This innovation, unfortunately, has
been used by individuals to determine
the sex, determine if the child is
healthy, determine if the child has cer-
tain traits; and in some cases, for posi-
tive reasons, to determine whether
there is some medical necessity to op-
erate while in the womb to make sure
that that individual—that child—en-
joys quality of life.
However, we need to make sure that
that testing process never gets cor-
rupted, never gets used in a discrimina-
tory way, and it is never used to justify
abortion.
It is a sad fact that we are seeing so
many things being talked about in the
abortion arena nowadays, and so many
people beating that drum.
We have got to stand up, you know,
in our country. We want to be able to
stand up for people’s rights and we
want to be able to stand up for the op-
portunities for babies to live and have
the opportunity to live a life that we
all will enjoy as well.
I now yield to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. BABIN), my fellow colleague,
the opportunity to speak and talk
about this very important issue.
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my
great colleague from the State of Kan-
sas.
Mr. Speaker, on March 21, we cele-
brated World Down Syndrome Aware-
ness Day. What an appropriate thing to
celebrate as folks with Down syndrome
make incredible contributions to soci-
ety every single day that should be ac-
knowledged and appreciated.
I, for one, am thankful for all of
those with Down syndrome that I have
had the great pleasure and honor of
knowing and learning from.
With the rise of prenatal screening
tests across the United States, the
number of babies born with Down syn-
drome every year has significantly de-
creased. And while we do not know the
exact number of Down syndrome chil-
dren who are aborted each year, it is
estimated that approximately two-
thirds of children diagnosed in the
womb are aborted.
Two-thirds of children who would go
on to make a significant impact in this
world are murdered before they are
given a chance to even be able to have
that opportunity.
Iceland, in particular, has almost
completely eradicated Down syndrome
births.
Statistics show that they have an al-
most 100 percent termination rate of
Down syndrome children.
France has a 77 percent termination
rate; while Denmark is at 98 percent.
I pray that the United States will re-
ject the idea that Down syndrome chil-
dren somehow are less than other chil-
dren. As a society, we should move
away from any idea that advocates
killing any child in its mother’s womb.
And as a pro-life Congressman, I be-
lieve that all life is valuable, especially
the lives of those who cannot speak for
themselves.
Aborted Down syndrome children are
just that, they are children who have
their own hopes and dreams for a fu-
ture and to live a long, healthy life. To
take away their right to life is incon-
ceivable to me and abhorrent.
I will continue to fight for legislation
that protects every single unborn
child, regardless of whether or not they
have an extra chromosome.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Representative BABIN, and I appreciate
those words.
Mr. Speaker, we, as fellow col-
leagues, have such an important role
trying to work on how we bring forth
those American principles and opportu-
nities for everybody.
In recent months, we have seen poli-
ticians from States around the country
embrace late-term abortions and open-
ly discuss infanticide. Individuals with
Down syndrome would be among the
most severely impacted by these tragic
policies.
To help respond to that, my col-
leagues and I have repeatedly called to
bring forward the Born-Alive Abortion
Survivors Protection Act to the floor
for a vote.
This straightforward bill would re-
quire healthcare practitioners to give
the same care to a child who has sur-
vived a botched abortion just as they
would any other newborn child.
Apparently, the bill has 182 cospon-
sors.
Unfortunately, a vote on the bill has
been blocked 21 times now by the ma-
jority.
However, as we rise to commemorate
World Down Syndrome Day, I call on
my colleagues to consider this bill and
any other one that would protect life
and support those with Down syn-
drome.
There are 250,000 people in America
with Down syndrome. They live
healthy, productive, happy lives, just
like you and I do, and want to have the
same hopes and dreams and goals.
We need more awareness of what a di-
agnosis of Down syndrome really
means. It means that a child simply
has an extra chromosome and that
nothing else about their life is different
from you or me.
They have so much to contribute to
this world, and they deserve that
chance.
Last year, I had the chance to meet
David Egan. David is a fellow working
for the National Down Syndrome Soci-
ety, and previously worked for the
House Ways and Means Committee.
When I met him, he told me how
much he wanted to help others with
Down syndrome accomplish anything
they wanted to do, just as he has done
in his own life and career.
I am inspired by people like David,
and I want to thank my colleagues who
join me today for this Special Order
recognizing World Down Syndrome
Day.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to work-
ing with Congress to support those
with Down syndrome, and with that, I
yield back the balance of my time.

Your wisdom and grace. Infuse their
lives with an exemplary integrity that
illuminates the darkness of cynicism,
division, and despair. May our Senators
see beyond baffling events to the power
of Your prevailing providence, pro-
viding them with a vision of a better
nation and world. Lord, use our legisla-
tors with such power that they may
honor their calling by faithfully serv-

We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read the nomination of Bridget S.
Bade, of Arizona, to be United States
Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit.
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
NOMINATION OF BRIDGET S. BADE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
yesterday the Senate voted to advance
the nomination of Bridget Bade of Ari-
zona, the latest of President Trump’s
qualified judicial nominees. Today we
will vote on her confirmation as a
judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals.
Ms. Bade’s nomination comes with
the bipartisan support of our col-
leagues on the Judiciary Committee
and a ‘‘well qualified’’ rating from the
ABA’s Standing Committee on the Fed-
eral Judiciary.
Given that 77 Senators voted yester-
day to advance this nomination, it is
obviously clear to the vast majority of
us that the President has made yet an-
other excellent choice to the Federal
bench. I hope each of my colleagues
will join me in voting for Ms. Bade
later today.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Madam President, on another matter
entirely, this afternoon the Senate is
going to vote on the far-left wish list
that many of our Democratic col-
leagues have rushed to embrace—the
so-called Green New Deal.
For a relatively sparse resolution,
this proposal has already traveled
quite a fascinating path in Congress. It
originated with the most radical, far-
thest left Members of the new House
Democratic majority. The Speaker of
the House quickly praised its ‘‘enthu-
siasm.’’
Its principal sponsor rolled out the
first version of the plan alongside an
extensive background document that
laid out the policy’s true goals in can-
did detail but which Democrats then
rushed to hastily scrub off the inter-
net.
It is not exactly an auspicious start,
but, nevertheless, a number of our
Democratic colleagues here in the Sen-
ate rushed to embrace it as well. Every
Democratic Senator who is currently
running for President has embraced the
Green New Deal.
The energy, the momentum, and the
defining new voices in today’s Demo-
cratic Party seem to be all in for the
Green New Deal. ‘‘It is ambitious. It
captures your imagination,’’ said one
current Presidential candidate.
‘‘I’m in all the way,’’ said one of our
Senate colleagues, who is also running.
When asked if the proposal might go
too far, another of our Senate col-
leagues running for President replied
on this issue: ‘‘You cannot go far
enough.’’
So just how far does the proposal go?
What exactly is in this thing? What is
it?
For starters, the proposal addresses
the small matter of eliminating—listen
to this—the use of all fossil fuels na-
tionwide over 10 years—get rid of it all.
This might sound like a neat idea in
places like San Francisco or New
York—the places that the Democratic
Party seems totally focused on these
days—but, frankly, the communities
everywhere else would be absolutely
crushed by this.
It is killing off entire domestic in-
dustries, winding down millions of jobs,
and, basically, outlawing the only
sources of energy that working-class
and middle-class families can actually
afford. By one rough estimate, these
steps could lead to a spike in household
electricity bills of $300 a month—that
much increase in your utility bill. Keep
in mind that this is just a warmup act.
While they are at it, our friends on
the far left also propose a federally
mandated overhaul of every building in
America—every building in America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1950 March 26, 2019
would be safe until it meets Wash-
ington bureaucrats’ standards of green-
ness. But if you can believe it, other
aspects of this proposal make these
things sound downright practical, by
comparison.
The resolution also includes a far
broader socialist wish list that ges-
tures toward a new government-run
healthcare insurance system, a new
system for government-guaranteed
housing, and a new government system
to guarantee everyone—everyone—
‘‘economic security.’’
The last point is a little vague, but,
helpfully, before it was scrubbed off the
internet, the original sponsor’s back-
ground document made the long-term
goal perfectly clear—listen to this:
‘‘economic security to all those who
are unable or unwilling to work.’’
That is the background document
they rushed to delete. The Democrats’
long-term vision is taking hard-work-
ing people’s taxpayer dollars to pay
those who choose not get off their
couch day after day simply because
they are unwilling to work.
So my Democratic colleagues’ bril-
liant new idea—their rallying cry—is
snatching away the energy sources
that middle-class families use, shut-
tering the industries that provide
many of those families with their live-
lihoods, and changing the homes they
live in, the cars they drive, and the
healthcare plans they rely on.
Remember what our colleague said:
‘‘You cannot go too far.’’ Our col-
leagues are certainly putting that to
the test.
I haven’t even gotten to what Amer-
ican families would have to pay—to
pay—for the privilege of being lab rats
for all of this far-left social engineer-
ing—for being lab rats for all of this so-
cial engineering. My Democratic col-
leagues have been fairly quiet on that
subject. I guess it is a lot more fun or-
dering off the menu than taking a look
at the check.
Families would almost certainly be
faced with much higher utility bills.
Then, there is the cost to replace appli-
ances. Presumably, electric cars would
have to be purchased. Then, there is
the Federal tax burden.
Just how much of other people’s
money are Democrats proposing to
burn in this effort to turn the country
into a far-left fiction novel?
One initial rough estimate found that
all of the pieces of the Green New Deal
might add up to as much as $93 trillion.
That is just over the first decade.
That is quite a tab. It exceeds the an-
nual GDP of the entire world—the an-
nual GDP of the entire world as of 2017.
It would mean historic tax increases,
historic new debt, and even that would
only begin to scratch the surface. Bear
in mind, the sticker price doesn’t even
begin to capture the full national cost
of the economic wound this plan would
inflict on our country while all our
competitors would be roaring on by.
My colleagues want to pull the emer-
gency brake on the U.S. economy be-
cause it isn’t ‘‘green’’ enough, but glob-
al carbon emissions are a global prob-
lem. We only produce about 15 percent
of the global total. China has already
soared past us. They are the world’s
largest emitter. In recent years, while
U.S. emissions have actually been de-
clining, China’s share has been growing
fast.
We will certainly get to test their
new economic security payments for
those unable or unwilling to work after
the Green New Deal drives all of our
domestic manufacturing jobs over to
China, India, and our other competi-
tors, who will gladly gobble up our jobs
and continue to emit with reckless am-
bition.
My Democratic colleagues have set-
tled on quite an interesting strategy—
maximum pain for American families,
with no meaningful change in global
carbon emissions.
Since I announced last month that
Senators will actually have the oppor-
tunity to go on record and vote on this
socialist wish list, a funny thing has
happened. I am not sure I have ever
seen the self-professed supporters of a
piece of legislation more angry or irri-
tated that they will actually have to
vote on it. They are angry and irri-
tated that they will actually have to
vote on it.
Merely bringing their own plan up for
a vote—a plan they had characterized
as ‘‘an amazing step forward’’—is now
declared to be a ‘‘diversion’’ and a
‘‘sham.’’ By one colleague’s assess-
ment, by getting their proposal a floor
vote, I was creating ‘‘a ploy to try to
undermine the Green New Deal by call-
ing a vote.’’
I have to say, it is remarkable
enough to see a major political party
coalesce around a proposal to forcibly
remake the entire country according to
what is fashionable in Brooklyn and
San Francisco, but it is even more
stunning to see my colleagues so angry
and upset at the opportunity to back
up their new philosophy with their
votes. What an outrage, to actually
vote on something we say we are for.
Well, later today, we will see—the
American people will see which of their
Senators can do the commonsense
thing and vote no on this destructive,
socialist daydream, and they will see
which Senators are so fully committed
to radical, leftwing ideology that they
can’t even vote no on self-inflicted eco-
nomic ruin that would take a sledge-
hammer to America’s middle class.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call
be rescinded.

HEALTHCARE
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
last night, President Trump’s Justice
Department issued a letter to the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals calling for the
elimination of healthcare coverage for
tens of millions of Americans.
Up until last night, the Trump ad-
ministration had said one aspect of the
Affordable Care Act was unconstitu-
tional, but last night, the Department
of Justice declared that the entire law
and all of its vital healthcare protec-
tions must go.
Make no mistake about it—this is an
escalation of the Trump administra-
tion’s and Republicans’ attacks on pro-
tections for people with preexisting
conditions. All the protestations for
keeping preexisting conditions—Presi-
dent Trump said it as recently as this
past campaign—out the window. This
court case says get rid of preexisting
conditions, and the Trump administra-
tion is pursuing the case. What are
they saying to the 52 million Ameri-
cans who are dependent on protections
for preexisting conditions? What are
President Trump and his Justice De-
partment saying to a mom whose son
or daughter has cancer and the insur-
ance company says ‘‘We are not cov-
ering it’’ and they have to watch their
child suffer because they can’t afford
it?
The move by the Trump administra-
tion is a slap in the face to American
families, a devastating blow to Repub-
licans who promised to protect people
with preexisting conditions. How many
of our Republican colleagues will go to
the floor today and condemn the
Trump administration? I will bet, not
one. I will bet, not one. I hope I am
wrong, but I will bet, not one.
In two short sentences, the Trump
administration crystalized its position
that the healthcare coverage enjoyed
by nearly 20 million people, as well as
the protections for tens of millions
more with preexisting conditions,
should be annihilated. That is now the
official position, full stop. And the
Trump position ties a 2-year anchor
around the neck of every Republican
for the next 2 years. Yet again, they
will be forced to defend the indefen-
sible. It is a stark reminder of the dif-
ference between our two parties. Demo-
crats are fighting to expand and im-
prove healthcare coverage and lower
costs, while Republicans are trying to
take it all away and raise costs.
The bottom line: From the moment
this administration and this Repub-
lican majority came to power, they
waged a wholesale attack on our
healthcare system. They have pushed
policies that would rip away people’s
healthcare coverage, spike their pre-
miums and prescription drugs costs,
slap older Americans with an age tax,
and reverse protections for people with
preexisting conditions like cancer,
asthma, and diabetes.
Democrats condemn, in the strongest
possible terms, this attack against the
American people and demand we take
action to protect our healthcare.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1951
March 26, 2019
I know that the administration is
very happy with the Mueller report,
and so are our Republican friends. This
move by the Trump administration to
take away healthcare will prove far
more detrimental to the administra-
tion and the Republican Party than
any gains they might have made by the
issuance of Mr. Barr’s letter. Mark my
words. It is far more important to the
American people—far more important
to the American people—because it in-
volves their lives and the lives of their
families. The Trump administration is
hurting them badly.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, today, Leader MCCONNELL will fol-
low through on one of his specialties,
‘‘gotcha’’ politics, by forcing a vote of
the Republicans’ version of the Green
New Deal.
Make no mistake—Republicans want
to force this political stunt to distract
from the fact that they neither have a
plan nor a sense of urgency to deal
with the threat of climate change.
With this exercise, the Republican ma-
jority has made a mockery of the legis-
lative process. It is a political act, a
political stunt.
Everyone here knows it is a stunt, in-
cluding the majority leader himself,
who will put something on the floor
and then vote no. What is the point of
that, other than showing how hypo-
critical this act is?
With this exercise, they have also
elevated the issue in a way, I am sure,
they never intended, and, for that, I
want to thank them because now we
are finally talking about climate
change.
For 5 years, the leader hasn’t brought
one bill to the floor that will deal with
the issue of climate change. He may
not agree with what some people are
for. What is his plan? What is his plan?
Leader MCCONNELL and every Repub-
lican, with one exception, has refused
to sponsor a resolution.
Leader MCCONNELL has refused to an-
swer these questions, which he has
been repeatedly asked. One, is climate
change real? Do you believe that, Lead-
er MCCONNELL? Do you believe that,
Republican Members?
Two, climate change is caused by hu-
mans. Do you believe that? Say it.
Come to the floor and do something
about it.
And this is three: Congress must act
on climate change. This is a simple res-
olution. Every Democrat is for it. Will
Leader MCCONNELL sign it? Will any
other Republican sign it? No. It shows
where the party is.
We are going to continue asking
these questions over and over again be-
cause our Republican colleagues want
to play a stunt and vote no on another
bill, but they don’t want to say what
they are for.
The scientific consensus is clear. Dis-
asters are getting stronger and strong-
er. The great irony here is that right
after this bill goes down and the
McConnell stunt bill goes down, we are
going to vote on disaster relief.
Do you know what has made disaster
relief so much more necessary and so
much more expensive? Climate change.
The warmer the air, the warmer the
globe and the wilder the weather gets,
as the people in Iowa, Nebraska, and
Kansas have just experienced.
So this idea that we are voting for
disaster relief after a stunt, a sham
vote on climate change—and the Re-
publican leader and the Republican
Senators have nothing to say on cli-
mate change—reveals in bright lights
their ostrichlike behavior, putting
their head in the sand, ignoring re-
ality, doing nothing about it, and play-
ing games.
Every single Democrat and a few of
our Republican colleagues have joined
in the resolution that says these three
simple things. We will not rest until we
have most every Republican joining be-
cause the public is on our side, science
is on our side, and the need to help pro-
tect America—farmers, urban dwellers,
suburban dwellers—from the dev-
astating changes that climate is bring-
ing upon us is very real.
Let’s stop the nonsense. Let’s get se-
rious. Our children’s future depends
upon it. Our planet depends upon it.
MUELLER REPORT
Madam President, now there is one
final matter. Yesterday, I came to the
floor and asked unanimous consent on
a very simple matter—that the report
completed by Special Counsel Mueller
and all of the corresponding evidence
and documentation be made publicly
available for the American people.
There was a request, above all, to
achieve the greatest level of trans-
parency possible into the very serious
matters of Russian interference in our
elections. Transparency—that is all we
want.
I am hardly alone. It is the same res-
olution that passed the House unani-
mously, with the President’s strongest
defenders voting for it. They want
transparency.
Why has Leader MCCONNELL objected
to making the report public? What in
the world is he hiding? He got up and
objected when we asked to make it
public. If he had not gotten up, it
would have passed.
President Trump has called for the
report to be made public. So why is the
leader, the Republican leader, blocking
all attempts at transparency? There is
no conceivable reason for the Mueller
report to remain hidden from public
view. It is a shame—a darn shame—
that Leader MCCONNELL thinks other-
wise.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I
thank you for your hard work on the
sometimes powerful Senate Agri-
culture Committee. I would have liked
to respond to the leader—but I know he
is busy, and he is leaving the floor—
just to say that I think all Republicans
understand there is climate change,
and all Republicans know that human
activity does contribute to it, and, yes,
we ought to do something. The point I
am trying to make here is we don’t
want to do the wrong thing and cause
a great deal of disruption in the proc-
ess.
I also thank Senator THUNE for al-
lowing me to speak out of order. I
know this is a hardship on his sched-
ule, but he has been very kind to let
this happen.
I thank the sponsors of the Green
New Deal for enabling all Senators the
opportunity to discuss the practical
challenges this resolution actually pre-
sents. For me, as chairman of the Sen-
ate Agriculture Committee, it allows
me to discuss the real stewards of our
land—our farmers, ranchers, growers—
and how this legislation will affect
them and their ability not only to feed
this country but a troubled and hungry
world as well.
Those of us who represent farm coun-
try are grateful for the opportunity to
underscore something that too many
take for granted. Farmers, ranchers,
and growers in the United States now
grow the safest, most affordable and
abundant food supply in the world. As
I just said, we know that it is a trou-
bled and hungry world that needs farm-
ers, ranchers, growers, and their pro-
tection to help feed and clothe the
world’s increasing population. Yes, and
I think it will probably go longer than
12 years.
As chairman of the Senate Agri-
culture Committee, I am proud of our
bipartisan record on behalf of Amer-
ican agriculture and, in turn, our
record of respecting our Nation’s nat-
ural resources. These things go hand in
hand. Lawmakers on both sides of the
aisle on the Agriculture Committee
and those privileged to work in agri-
culture have always sought to grow
and raise more, using as few resources
as possible.
The men and women who make their
living off the land have an imperative
and keen interest in the responsible
use and management of our natural re-
sources. Show me a farmer who does
not practice conservation or does not
have access to precision agriculture or
the latest technology, and I will show
you a farmer who is really in trouble.
In short, within agriculture, there is
nothing new with the Green New Deal.
It calls for ‘‘working collaboratively
with farmers, ranchers, and growers in
the United States to eliminate pollu-
tion, greenhouse gases, and emissions
from the agricultural sector as much
as is technologically feasible’’—that is
the language—‘‘by supporting family
farming’’—that is also in the lan-
guage—‘‘investing in sustainable farm-
ing and land use practices that in-
crease soil health,’’ and ‘‘building a
more sustainable food system that en-
sures universal access to healthy
food.’’ That is in the resolution, the
legislation over in the House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1952 March 26, 2019
Check, check, and check. We have
been doing this already, and we con-
tinue to look ahead to create thought-
ful, well-considered policies. I do not
question the intent of the authors of
the Green New Deal, but they don’t
know what they don’t know, especially
about agriculture. They need to catch
up with the Agriculture Committee
and with the farm country in general.
In fact, we on the Agriculture Com-
mittee are so forward-looking that we
have embraced innovative methods of
investing in agriculture research with
the creation of the Foundation for
Food and Agriculture Research—some-
thing new.
The Foundation leverages public and
private dollars to bring together ex-
perts to identify and investigate the re-
searchable questions whose answers
have the potential to enhance the eco-
nomic and environmental resilience of
our food supply and the environment.
I encourage the Senator from Massa-
chusetts and the leader and other co-
sponsors to simply ask for a briefing
from the folks at FFAR. I would say
the same to vocal colleagues on the
House side who helped author—and
pardon the acronym—the GND, Green
New Deal. But given their unfortunate
focus on our livestock industry, I sim-
ply do not have time, I don’t think, to
fully discuss emissions emitted from
all livestock or, for that matter, for
Congress. Maybe that would be a better
answer—perhaps later, after riding
point on the herd and getting the cows
milked.
What is worth our time and what is
worth their time is a defense of Amer-
ican agriculture, the best in the world,
from attacks by those who are either
uninformed or misinformed regarding
organic, processed, and precision agri-
culture—all modern miracles and all
sustainable with regard to our environ-
ment.
America’s farmers, ranchers, and
others in rural America are constantly
working to produce their crops and to
raise their livestock in order to feed a
growing world and to do so with con-
stant challenges presented to them
from other nations.
The distinguished minority leader
just mentioned the floods we are expe-
riencing in Nebraska, Kansas, and
Iowa. This seems to have happened
about every 10 years. I am not sure it
has happened because of global warm-
ing, but at least it has with regard to
climate change. We are doing every-
thing possible to bring aid and help to
those folks who find their farmland un-
derwater.
Farmers are natural stewards of the
land, and they must be good at prob-
lem-solving. They identify the issues or
the trend, find ways to adjust their
business and respond to that issue, and
improve their way of operating. They
would like to do that under a Green
New Deal. If they don’t adjust to ad-
dress those challenges and simply do
the right thing, their farm or ranch
and their livelihood will not be sustain-
able.
It is pretty simple. Every living,
breathing person on this Earth needs
food in order to survive. Obviously, we
cannot and do not produce food in the
same manner that our grandparents
did because those methods were not
sustainable and, today, would not
produce food at the scope and scale our
troubled and hungry world demands.
American farmers and ranchers, who
live by the concept of continuous im-
provement, sound science, and vol-
untary-based conservation, are a model
for other industries and other coun-
tries on how to address problems like
climate change in a very practical way.
America’s farmers and ranchers raise
the same amount of beef as they did in
the 1970s, but they do so with 33 per-
cent fewer cattle. Over the last 50
years, American farmers have reduced
water use in pork production by 41 per-
cent, and the list goes on. These are
real success stories that speak to how
farmers are already managing natural
resources responsibly and voluntarily
making contributions to address the
issue of climate change. Examples like
these abound in agriculture.
The American farmer, through con-
tinuous improvement, embracing sound
science, implementing new tech-
nologies, such as biotechnology and no-
till farming, and being conservation-
minded, has achieved unprecedented
success that I do not believe the pro-
ponents of GND—i.e., the Green New
Deal—realize.
In the recent farm bill, which passed
Congress with overwhelming margins,
we strengthened the conservation pro-
grams, increased investments in agri-
culture research, supported risk man-
agement tools that will benefit pro-
ducers of all crops in all regions, and
provided additional authorities to ad-
dress animal health concerns. This leg-
islative package bolsters the sustain-
ability of U.S. farmers, ranchers, and
others in rural America while being en-
vironmentally sound.
Unfortunately, vague proposals or
resolutions, such as the Green New
Deal, which contain no real details or
no metrics are not going to solve the
issue of climate change in any mean-
ingful way. Regulating American farm-
ers and ranchers out of business will
only result in food and fiber production
being outsourced to countries that do
not have the same conservation-mind-
ed producers that we have here in the
United States.
Let’s face it: Nobody—no one I know
of—likes being told what to do, what to
drive, or what to eat. Consumers value
free choice. They also expect access to
reasonably priced food and nutritious
food.
In fact, consumers will surely con-
tinue to demand the choice of animal
protein here in the United States, and
so any reasonable discussion on the ag-
riculture sector’s contributions to so-
lutions on climate change must begin
with this acknowledgment.
These policy decisions must recog-
nize the complexity of the agriculture
and food value chain of growers, input
suppliers, processors, handlers, con-
sumers, and the list goes on. They
must be based in reality to facilitate a
genuine conversation between rural
and urban constituencies.
I know. I understand. I realize. I get
it. There are those who think the
Green New Deal is a moral imperative,
and it may well be, but farmers con-
tinuing to feed the world is also a
moral imperative. Too many go hungry
each day in America, and ending this is
also a moral imperative. Too many
people go hungry in a troubled and
hungry world as well. In restricting
American agriculture in any way,
whether it is in resolution form or leg-
islative form, the Green New Deal does
not match up with these moral respon-
sibilities.
I thank the distinguished Senator
from South Dakota for allowing me to
step in front of him. That doesn’t hap-
pen very often. So, Coop, you are up.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip.
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I
thank my colleague from Kansas, the
chairman of the Senate Ag committee,
who was incredibly instrumental in
getting that last Farm Bill passed. I
have the privilege of serving on his
committee, and we do a lot of impor-
tant work for our farmers and ranchers
in this country. As he very aptly point-
ed out, one of the things that could
undo a lot of the good work we hope
will improve the economic outlook for
farmers and ranchers, which today is a
very difficult one—something that
could really undo that is passage of
something like this Green New Deal. It
could do irreparable harm to the Ag
economy in this country and would be
disastrous for farmers and ranchers.
This afternoon, Senate Democrats
will have a chance to vote on the Green
New Deal, and the American people
will have a chance to see just how
many Democrats embrace this new
government expansion.
The Green New Deal, as the name
suggests, is largely about energy pol-
icy, but there is a lot more to unpack.
The Green New Deal is a comprehen-
sive socialist fantasy that would put
the government in charge of every-
thing from healthcare to the way you
heat your house.
Do you like your car? With the Green
New Deal you almost certainly will not
be able to keep it. The Green New Deal
also wants to eliminate fossil fuels,
which means the engine that currently
powers your car will likely be illegal.
It also means, roughly, 3.5 million
American truckdrivers will be out of a
job.
Presumably airplanes would also be
grounded, drying up the aviation sector
and the travel, tourism, and business it
supports.
Do you like your house? That may
not matter if the government decides
your house doesn’t meet the Green New
Deal’s guidelines. Enjoy rebuilding
your home according to plans provided
by Washington.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1953
March 26, 2019
Do you like your job? The Green New
Deal will eliminate millions of current
energy jobs, but that is not all. The en-
ergy industry in this country powers
the American economy. Our supply of
reliable, affordable energy allows busi-
nesses to flourish. So what happens
when the Green New Deal drives up the
price of energy or when businesses are
hit with Green New Deal taxes or when
American manufacturers can’t meet
the Green New Deal’s stringent emis-
sions goal? Well, I will tell you what
will happen: American jobs will be lost
or move overseas.
I mentioned Green New Deal taxes.
That is because paying for this plan
would require massive tax hikes on
just about everybody. One think tank
has released a first estimate of what
the Green New Deal would cost, and
the answer is between $51 trillion and
$93 trillion over 10 years. That is al-
most an incomprehensible amount of
money. Ninety-three trillion dollars is
more than the amount of money the
U.S. Government has spent in its en-
tire history. That is right. Since 1789,
when the Constitution went into effect,
the Federal Government has spent a
total of $83.2 trillion. In other words, it
has taken us 230 years to spend the
amount of money Democrats want to
spend in 10.
How do Democrats plan to pay for
this? Well, they don’t actually have a
plan. The Green New Deal resolution
itself refers vaguely to ‘‘community
grants, public banks, and other public
financing.’’ That is all very well, but
unless the Democrats’ plan is to just
print a lot of money, that public fi-
nancing has to come from somewhere,
and since the government is not cur-
rently sitting on a spare $9.3 trillion a
year, that money is likely going to
come from taxes—new and heavy taxes
on just about every American.
Let me be very clear. This is not a
plan that can be paid for with Demo-
crats’ favorite solution of taxing the
rich. Taxing every millionaire in the
United States at a 100-percent rate for
10 years would only bring in a tiny
fraction of $93 trillion. In fact, there
aren’t enough millionaires in the en-
tire world to cover $93 trillion. In 2017,
the combined wealth of all the million-
aires in the world was $70.2 trillion. So
you could confiscate—you could lit-
erally confiscate all the money from
all the millionaires in the entire world,
and you still wouldn’t have $93 trillion.
The Green New Deal is not a plan that
can be paid for by taxing the rich. This
massive government expansion would
be paid for on the backs of working
families.
The energy industry has been a
bright spot for American families over
the past few years. Between 2007 and
2017, as the price of healthcare soared
and education and food costs increased,
household energy costs decreased. That
is a big deal for working families, but
that progress would go away under the
Green New Deal. Energy costs would go
up, not down, and the price of a lot of
other items would likely rise sharply
as well, as everyone from farmers to
manufacturers would struggle under
the Green New Deal’s mandates and
taxes. Needless to say, families’ pay-
checks would shrink by a lot.
The size of the tax hikes that would
be required to even begin to finance the
Green New Deal would usher in a new
era of diminished prosperity for Amer-
ican families. Gone would be the Amer-
ican dream of giving your children a
better life than you have enjoyed.
Under the Green New Deal, American
families could look forward to perma-
nently narrowed horizons.
So this afternoon, my Democratic
colleagues face a choice. They can dou-
ble down on their socialist fantasies
and vote for the Green New Deal reso-
lution—perhaps the most costly resolu-
tion ever to come before the Senate—or
they can reject this green nightmare
and resolve to work with Republicans
to advance clean energy in a way that
will not devastate the livelihoods of
the American people.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise
to speak about the urgent need for the
United States to take action to con-
front climate change. I think it is pret-
ty clear from the evidence and from
the science right now that the fol-
lowing is true: climate change is real,
and it is a threat to human life; second,
that climate change is caused by
human activity; and third, we must
take action against it by reducing sub-
stantially greenhouse gas emissions.
We have an obligation, all of us—in
both Houses of Congress and in both
parties and in both branches of govern-
ment, the legislative and executive
branches—we all have an obligation to
care for and protect God’s creation. We
don’t have time. We don’t have time
for cynical political games. We need to
be serious about this challenge.
According to the World Food Pro-
gram, over 120 million people face ‘‘cri-
sis-level food insecurity’’ worldwide.
Too often we don’t focus on that chal-
lenge.
Developing countries across Africa,
Asia, and Latin America have been
hardest hit by frequent and intense
floods, droughts, and storms. These cli-
mate events can quickly spiral into
full-blown food and nutrition crises.
The U.S. intelligence community, the
intelligence agencies of the United
States of America, have linked global
food insecurity to instability that can
lead to a rise in violent extremism and
international crime that puts the
United States at risk. The January 2014
‘‘Worldwide Threat Assessment of the
U.S. Intelligence Community’’ reported
that the ‘‘lack of adequate food will be
a destabilizing factor in countries im-
portant to United States national secu-
rity.’’
We know the following is true: Cli-
mate change leads to humanitarian cri-
ses; humanitarian crises lead to hun-
ger, death, and insecurity; hunger,
death, and insecurity lead to despera-
tion, instability, extremism, and ter-
rorism. Inaction on this issue predi-
cated on denial or indifference will re-
sult in millions around the world suf-
fering extreme hunger resulting from
climate-related disasters, which in
turn leads to a rise in extremism and
terrorism. Ignoring climate change un-
dermines U.S. national security.
Similarly, failure to address climate
change will have negative con-
sequences here at home. In one exam-
ple—among many—a 2015 paper titled
‘‘Growing Stronger: Toward a Climate-
Ready Philadelphia’’ reports that since
2010, Philadelphia has experienced the
following: the snowiest winter on
record, the two warmest summers on
record, the wettest day on record, the 2
wettest years on record, and two hurri-
canes. That is just in 5 years, in one
city, in one State.
The same paper projects:
Philadelphia may experience four to 10
times as many days per year above 95 de-
grees, and as many as 16 days a year above
100 degrees by the end of the century. Up
from the 1950 [to] 1999 average of fewer than
one.
Fewer than one.
All of these changes have negative
consequences for local economies and
for the well-being of all of our constitu-
ents. Increased heavy rainfall can lead
to more flooding in communities along,
just for example, the Delaware River
and the Schuylkill River in my home
State, which places additional stress
on our already outdated wastewater in-
frastructure.
Older Americans and lower income
American families are particularly
hard hit by heat waves. We know near-
ly one-quarter of the children in Phila-
delphia suffer from asthma, a condition
that is exacerbated by ground-level
ozone, which is made worse by hot
weather.
So as Americans we have a duty to
develop a strategy and to take action
to confront climate change. We must
also provide robust assistance, train-
ing, and support for workers who may
be adversely impacted by the steps we
take, but we don’t have time to waste.
We need a serious bipartisan effort to
develop a strategy to take action to
prevent the horror that results from
inaction on climate change. Everyone
knows that today’s vote will do noth-
ing to help us deal with this grave cri-
sis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1954 March 26, 2019
Is there such a thing as climate
change? Are we going through some
change on our planet today? I think so,
and 98 percent of the scientists who re-
port on the subject believe the same
thing. The evidence is everywhere,
isn’t it? The extreme weather events
that we are seeing are, I think, an indi-
cation that something is happening on
this Earth that we call home.
The obvious question is this: Do we
have anything to do with it? Does the
fact that we are alive, functioning,
building things, and dealing with trav-
eling by plane and other means have
anything to do with what is happening
to our planet? I think so.
Can we do something about it? Sure,
we know we can. If we are dealing with
greenhouse gas emissions that some-
how in the atmosphere are raising the
temperature of planet Earth, what can
we do about those greenhouse gases?
We know there are a lot of very simple
and obvious things.
I can remember a debate on this floor
when we talked about making cars and
trucks more fuel efficient and when the
folks in Detroit, who are the smartest
people running the automobile compa-
nies, said: Impossible. You can’t do it.
Americans will never buy those cars. It
just will not work.
Thank goodness we ignored them. We
established standards and regulations.
Do you know what? Like it or not, we
drive more fuel-efficient cars and
trucks today, and, frankly, I like it. It
was a step in the right direction. It
took governmental, congressional
prodding to take place, and it made
this a cleaner, safer place to live in the
United States.
There are other things we can do as
well, but, first, we need a basic agree-
ment that there is a problem, that
human conduct—the way we live, the
way we work, and the way we produce
things—has something to do with it,
and that we are committed to changing
it.
How many nations in the world have
agreed with that conclusion? All of
them. Wait. All of them except one—
this country, this President, who de-
cided to withdraw from the Paris
Agreement. It is a universal, global de-
cision by every nation on Earth except
the United States that we do have a
climate problem, that we are the cause
of some part of it, at least, and that we
should do something to change it. This
President says he doesn’t buy it and
doesn’t think the science proves it. He
and he alone, on behalf of this country,
stepped away from this agreement. I
think that was a serious mistake.
I am happy to report that Governors
across the United States—at least the
Democratic Governors—have said they
are going to ignore the President when
it comes to this, and they are going to
set up their own policies. I salute my
own Governor, J.B. Pritzker, in Illi-
nois. He is not part of this denial camp
that is trying to ignore the problem.
He is trying to do in our State, as oth-
ers are, something to make sure that
this planet is more livable, more habit-
able.
Isn’t it amazing that this has become
such a partisan issue? There was a time
on the floor of this Senate when it was
not. I remember when the late Senator
John McCain, whom I still honor to
this day not only for his service in the
Senate but for his service to this coun-
try, teamed up with Democratic Sen-
ator Joe Lieberman and started pro-
posing ideas to deal with climate
change—bipartisan proposals, bipar-
tisan votes. Not anymore, no. We have
a big wall down the middle of this
Chamber—on that side, climate denial
and, on this side, a belief that we
should be doing something about it.
We could do something today,
couldn’t we? Couldn’t we take the lat-
est climate assessment from the Fed-
eral Government, which spells out the
problem and spells out the challenge,
and come up with at least a reasonable,
bipartisan approach with which to deal
with the clear scientific evidence that
has been produced by this government
as required by law? Of course, we could,
but we are not going to. Instead, the
Republican Senate leader has decided
he wants to make a political move. He
wants to put the Democrats on the
spot, not to solve the problem but to
have something he can talk about in
the next campaign.
A group came together and proposed,
as they call it, the Green New Deal. I
have taken a look at it. I went to Sen-
ator ED MARKEY of Massachusetts, who
is one of the sponsors, and I asked him
about it because he is one of the au-
thors. I know ED MARKEY. I served with
him in the House, and I serve with him
in the Senate. He has established cre-
dentials when it comes to this issue. He
truly cares and has done many, many
things to show that caring.
So I asked him: What is this Green
New Deal? It is not a law. I mean, it is
not a bill that will become a law. It is
simply a resolution, which is kind of a
statement of purpose, a statement of
position. He said to me that it was as-
pirational—in other words, that the
Green New Deal sets out aspirations,
targets, and values.
I said to him: ED, that is a good idea,
but I want something that is not aspi-
rational. I want something that is
legislational. That is what we do here,
right? I am sure he will come up with
those specifics.
Yet Senator MCCONNELL, the Repub-
lican Senate leader, has decided that
we are going to put the Democrats on
the spot. Take it or leave it in its en-
tirety—the Green New Deal. Be on the
record and vote this afternoon.
I will make it clear to you right now
that I think there are parts of that
Green New Deal that are excellent and
some that I disagree with. At this
point in time, I am going to be voting
present this afternoon because I believe
we should be legislational, and I be-
lieve we should be bipartisan.
I have said this on the floor many
times, and I will say it again: The only
major political party in the world
today that denies climate change is the
Republican Party of the United States
of America. Now, I have waited for
some Republican to come to the floor
and say: Oh, no, that is not true, Sen-
ator DURBIN. There are other major po-
litical parties that have the same posi-
tion as we do. Yet no one has come to
the floor.
A few months back, one Republican
Senator in an elevator quietly said: I
think there is a party in Australia that
denies climate change.
Maybe that is true, but why in the
world have we reached a point at which
this is such a partisan issue? Don’t we
all see what is happening with the
weather? Can’t we see what is hap-
pening in terms of the temperature of
this Earth that we live on as it is con-
sistently, year after year, continuing
to rise? Don’t we realize that it has an
impact on this Earth that we live on?
Don’t we realize that if it continues
unabated, the Earth that I am leaving
to my children and grandchildren will
be a much different place and a much
more challenging place? Can’t we see
the flooding in the streets down in
Miami in Florida? Can’t we see the
melting of the glaciers? Isn’t that proof
positive that something is happening?
In my part of the world, the Midwest,
I grew up with tornadoes. They are so
common where I live, we even named
sports teams after the tornadoes. When
I was a kid—this happened half a dozen
times, and I will never forget it—in the
middle of the night, Mom and Dad
would wake me up and say: The tor-
nado sirens are blaring. Get in the
basement right now. Grab your covers
and pillow and get downstairs.
We would head down to the basement
and wait for the all-clear signal.
Tornadoes were part of our lives, but
they were usually confined to the
spring and summer months. Just this
last December, we had a tornado in
Taylorville, IL, 30 miles away from
where I live. It wasn’t supposed to
come this time of year.
Unusual things just like that are
happening all over the place, and they
are devastating. Don’t take my word
for it; talk to the people in the prop-
erty and casualty insurance industry.
They make a living trying to guess
what the weather is going to be. If they
see some horrible weather condition
coming, they know it will not be good
for their bottom line. I have talked to
them. There are some States in which
they are unwilling to write property
and casualty insurance because of the
vulnerability to hurricanes, tornadoes,
and extreme weather events. They are
making a conscious profit-and-loss
business decision based on the evidence
before them that something is hap-
pening to weather in the United States.
They are not in denial. They embrace
the concept every day when they de-
cide whether to write insurance and
what premiums to charge.
So if the people who do this for a liv-
ing, who have to show a profit in their

company, have come to the conclusion
that climate change is for real, why
haven’t we in the Senate? Why do we
instead engage in this political theater
we are going to have this afternoon?
Why aren’t we instead, on a bipartisan
basis, sitting down and saying: What
can we do? What can we do in terms of
conserving energy, in terms of being
more fuel efficient, and in terms of
being more sensitive to this environ-
ment? What can we do?
There are a handful of Republican
Senators who have stepped up and said
‘‘We should. We can see climate change
where we live,’’ but I wish they would
become a force to lead their leadership
forward into taking this up on a seri-
ous basis. This afternoon’s vote is just
part of a political stunt. It is not a se-
rious effort to deal with climate
change. We better do that pretty soon.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President,
thank you.
I am sorry I didn’t hear all of the re-
marks from my friend from Illinois be-
cause at the end, he pointed out that
there are some on my side of the aisle
who acknowledge that we are dealing
with a changing climate and that those
impacts are real. Well, this Senator is
one of them.
I come from a State where we see it.
It is real. It is tangible. It impacts not
only the land and the water but also
the people. We see that in the Arctic. I
am one who is approaching this from
the perspective of pragmatism and
practical solutions we can move for-
ward with.
While I like aspirations, and we all
have to have goals, I want us to make
sure we are not setting ourselves up for
a situation where the expectations are
not realistic.
The Senator mentioned the vote we
will have later this afternoon. I have
suggested that it is important for us
around here to make sure that we don’t
distract from those pragmatic and
practical solutions and that we don’t
amp up the rhetoric so high that we
can’t get ourselves to a place where we
can work cooperatively and collabo-
ratively to get to these solutions. If we
are going to address it in a meaningful
way, it must be bipartisan, it must be
enduring, it must move from one ad-
ministration to another, and, again, it
has to be something we can work to-
ward with meaningful steps.
I would like to take just a couple of
minutes today to speak to some of the
things and some of the areas in which
I think Congress can actually make
some progress as we look to the issue
of climate change.
I have refrained from speaking spe-
cifically to the Green New Deal as it
has been laid down and introduced be-
cause I don’t see it as a real and viable
solution that has been fully considered
as a proposal. There certainly is a lot
of aspiration to it. There certainly is a
lot of aspiration, but I have kind of re-
frained from piling on, if you will, de-
spite my concerns about the costs of
the deal. I think we can go back and
forth in terms of how much it really
costs individual Americans, what is the
cost to society, and what is the cost of
not doing something, but I think those
are all kind of almost false in a sense
because it is not that we are not doing
anything. I think we need to establish
that. If we were to enact and move for-
ward with every aspect of the proposal
as it has been laid out, is it possible? Is
it possible?
It is certainly a worthy goal for us in
this country to be transitioning to
more renewable and cleaner sources of
energy. We are doing that. We are cer-
tainly seeing that as the cost of solar
is coming down and as we are seeing
more wind being harnessed. I think we
have great potential in more hydro-
power, more geothermal, and the tech-
nologies that could be coming our way
when it comes to ocean energy.
Surely we need to be moving in that
direction, but is it affordable? Is it pos-
sible to transition to 100 percent re-
newable energy and electric vehicles
over the next 10 years? I don’t believe
it is physically possible for us to do it
in 10 years. So are we setting some-
thing up so that young people, like the
Senate pages who are listening to me,
will say: Well, sure, you should be able
to do that in 10 years. You say you can.
So if you haven’t done it, you have
failed.
This is not a question of whether we
succeeded or failed but whether every
step we are taking is moving us in a
more positive direction. Shouldn’t it be
a worthy goal to maximize our energy
efficiencies within our buildings and
how we access our power? Absolutely.
But is it possible? Would we be able to
physically retrofit every building in
America to maximize energy and water
efficiency over the next 10 years? I
don’t believe we can do that in 10
years.
Aspirations are good, and goals are
good, but when you look at what has
been specifically laid out in this Green
New Deal, it is more than just
transitioning to renewables or electric
vehicles or greater energy efficiency. It
calls for a Federal jobs guarantee. It
focuses on healthcare, education,
wages, trade, and a lot more. It sug-
gests unprecedented levels of pros-
perity and economic security for all
people of the United States. That is
wonderful. I would love that. But how
do we get there? What is the feasible
mechanism for accomplishing this
goal?
Let’s be honest with where we are
and recognize the potential cost of this
Green New Deal. Whether you want to
peg it in the price range of $50 trillion
to $90 trillion over the next 10 years—
I am not going to get caught up in
those numbers because that is not
going to happen. It is not going to hap-
pen.
What I really hope doesn’t happen is
that this discussion about the Green
New Deal or whatever you want to tag
it—that we are not distracted from the
necessary and important conversation
we must have about climate change
and the practical steps we can take to
address it. Let’s talk about that.
I mentioned to my friend from Illi-
nois that we see it in Alaska. We say
that we are ground zero for climate
change. The Arctic is warming two to
three times the rate of the rest of the
world. We are seeing glaciers retreat.
Permafrost is thawing. We are seeing
sea levels rise. Wildlife migration pat-
terns are changing. We are seeing dif-
ferent invasive species. With the water
temperature, we are seeing ocean acidi-
fication. Villages are being threatened
by coastal erosion and in need of relo-
cation. For us, this is real. Climate
change is real.
If you don’t want to use the words
‘‘climate change,’’ you don’t have to
use the words ‘‘climate change,’’ but
just come up and take a look, because
something is happening. We are seeing
it.
Engaging in rhetoric that is either
fantasy or denial really doesn’t help
those who are facing this. I think there
are some policies that both parties can
support that I think can make a real
difference in real time.
I want to first start off by acknowl-
edging that we are not in a situation
and a place where we are doing noth-
ing. That is not the case. We are. We
are working on policies, and over the
course of years, we have put policies in
place that are making a difference and
will make a difference moving forward.
It is not as though we are starting from
scratch. Just look at where we were
last year. We expanded the tax credit
for carbon capture, utilization, and se-
questration, CCUS. We increased fund-
ing for the Department of Energy to re-
search and develop cleaner tech-
nologies. We passed legislation to pro-
mote basic science, nuclear energy, hy-
dropower, and more. Many of us sup-
port the production, use, and export of
clean burning natural gas, which can
substantially help reduce global emis-
sions. That was just last year in terms
of the policies we put in place that are
moving us forward in the right direc-
tion.
You don’t always hear about it, but
we have a pretty decent story to tell
here in this country. We are leading
the world in greenhouse gas reductions.
Despite an uptick we saw last year, in
2018, our emissions have fallen signifi-
cantly over the past decade.
We have made progress, but we need
to be making more progress and, in my
view, more accelerated progress. What
more can we do? That is a conversation
we are having in the Energy Com-
mittee. I have been working with my
ranking member, Senator MANCHIN
from West Virginia. It is a conversa-
tion we have been having on both sides
of the aisle. We had a hearing on the
impact on the electric sector due to
climate change. We had that hearing
about 10 days or so ago. We are plan-
ning on having others. We are talking

with other colleagues who are not part
of our committee about what more can
be done.
Two or three weeks ago, I was in
Houston attending the big oil and gas
conference, the big global conference.
It is kind of like the Davos of oil and
gas. It was notable that throughout
that week’s conference with oil and gas
producers, predominantly, the focus
and the attention was on climate
change and what we are doing with
those technologies that will help us to
reduce methane leakage, what we are
doing to help share some of these envi-
ronmental technologies, and what
more we are doing to help facilitate
these clean, lower carbon technologies.
This is coming from an industry that is
recognizing that innovation must hap-
pen.
It was fascinating. I sat down with a
group of about 20 folks who were pretty
high up within their sectors. I was
thinking we were going to be talking
about some of the latest technologies
in oil and gas development. But about
two-thirds of the people around the
table were not from oil and gas compa-
nies; they were from high-tech compa-
nies. They were there because they see
that the real difference in making a
difference is going to come from these
technologies, and they want to be a
part of that conversation. That is a
good conversation to have.
Within the Energy Committee, what
we are doing is we are going to revive
and refresh the bipartisan Energy bill
that we moved out of committee and
off this floor a couple of years ago with
the help of Senator CANTWELL. We
moved it out with the support of 85
Members. It may be that we have to
move some smaller bills instead of ev-
erything all at once, but we have to up-
date our policies.
We haven’t updated an energy policy
for 11 years now. Senator CANTWELL
knows, when you think about where
the industry has gone, where the en-
ergy sector has gone, and the fact that
our policies have lagged, that is a drag.
We need to address that.
I think there are areas where we can
reach a bipartisan agreement on poli-
cies that support the innovation, break
down the barriers, promote efficiency,
and keep the markets well-supplied.
There is a lot more we can be doing on
nuclear energy. I am going to be intro-
ducing a bipartisan bill this week to
promote advanced reactors. There is
more we can be doing on carbon cap-
ture utilization and sequestration. This
is a big priority of Senator MANCHIN’s.
We know that unlocking the key is
going to be with storage and energy
storage. We have to be advancing that.
There is so much more room within hy-
dropower, microgrids, to lower costs
for energy in rural areas, to lower the
cost of all renewables and make them
more competitive, to ensure we are
producing the minerals and materials
we need for the technologies. I men-
tioned sharing environmental tech-
nologies.
It is not just the Energy Committee
that is going to be working on this. All
committees will have their own con-
tribution to make, and I welcome that,
but we have to have rational discus-
sions.
I have said: Come to the Energy Com-
mittee, where there is a safe space if
you want to talk about climate. If you
are a Republican on this side who says
I don’t know that I want to go there, a
Democrat on that side, let’s sit down
and have a rational conversation about
how we are going to be working to-
gether across the aisle to agree on poli-
cies that will deliver cleaner and lower
carbon technologies. They have to be
pragmatic, they have to be durable,
and they have to be bipartisan.
Senator MANCHIN and I had an op-ed
that ran in the Washington Post a few
weeks ago. It wasn’t great, earth-
shaking, brandnew, novel ideas on how
to address climate change. What we
said is, we have to join hands on this.
We have to come together. We are both
from producing States with very vul-
nerable populations. Take a look at the
two of us and work with us to help ad-
vance some of these things.
We have gotten more shout-outs not
for highlighting some new technology
but the fact that we were talking to-
gether as Republicans and Democrats.
That is going to be an important part
of how we move forward.
I mentioned, I am from a producing
State. You all know that. What many
don’t know is how Alaska is leading
the way in what is possible for some of
the innovation, the proving ground, for
technologies. We have about every re-
source you can think of in great abun-
dance, including sunshine. You don’t
think about solar for us, but we are
putting it to good use. We have been
pioneering when it comes to microgrids
and these smaller scaled technologies.
We have wind turbines out in St. Mi-
chael. We have energy-efficient refrig-
eration on Saint Paul Island. This is a
little, tiny island out in the middle of
the ocean. We have clean power genera-
tion in Kodiak. About 99 percent of
that significant fishing community is
renewable. We have an in-river system
being installed in Igiugig. We have in-
novation happening all over the place,
and it is happening because we are
driven by necessity. It costs too much.
It is not sustainable.
I don’t want to be from a State where
most of my off-road communities are
powered by diesel. It is not good for
them. It is not good for anybody. How
do we get off that? Allow us to move
forward and free up—some are going to
be critical of me. They are going to
say: You know what, LISA, you are
talking about baby steps. You are talk-
ing wind turbines in St. Michael; you
are talking about energy efficiency in
St. Paul. Do you know what? When you
are paying $7, $8, $9 a gallon to keep
the lights on, to keep something refrig-
erated—close to 80 cents a kilowatt
hour—that is not sustainable. So for
these communities, it is making a dif-
ference. You say: Well, we have a big
globe out there. We do have a big globe
out there, and we all have a responsi-
bility there, but we have to start.
I want to share a quote from my
friend, the former Secretary of Energy,
Ernie Moniz. He was talking about
some of the practical, pragmatic solu-
tions. He said some are going to argue
it is not enough. Some would argue,
well, that will not get us there as fast
as we need to go. I would argue that
would get us there as fast as we can go.
We must—we must—move. We recog-
nize that, but we have to know the
only way we are going to be moving is
if we move together. That is what we
have to do in Congress. We have to
take these policies that can keep us
moving to lower emissions, to address
the reality of climate change, to do so
all the while recognizing we have an
economy we need to keep strong, we
have vulnerable people whom we need
to protect, and we have an environ-
ment we all care about—Republicans
and Democrats—and it is not just the
environment in our States or our coun-
try, but it is our global environment.
So, moving forward, how we are
working together on that is a priority,
or should be a priority, for us all. My
hope is, we get beyond the rhetoric, the
high-fired rhetoric, and we get to prac-
tical, pragmatic, bipartisan solutions.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the
Senator from Alaska to yield for 10 sec-
onds.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I
will yield.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank
the Senator. She was the person I was
thinking of when I said there are ex-
ceptions when it comes to the partisan
divide between us. I stayed for her
presentation because I knew what it
was going to be, and I wanted it to be
part of the RECORD.
I think Senator MURKOWSKI and Sen-
ator CANTWELL—whom we recognize on
our side of the aisle as one of the real
leaders on the subject—can show us the
way in the Senate to find a bipartisan
approach to deal with this challenge.
Thank you.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank my col-
league for that.
I want to acknowledge the support
and partnership I have had with Sen-
ator CANTWELL. She and I come from
differing views on certain issues, but
throughout our time as the chair and
the ranking on the committee, we real-
ly did work to try to advance some of
these solutions, where—I think we
would both agree—there is common
ground. Again, advancing that is im-
portant. It is important for the
progress we are making. It is making a
difference. It is helping to reduce the
emissions. It is helping to move us to-
ward greater efficiency.
So let’s not pooh-pooh the small
things. Let’s acknowledge that build-
ing things together, you do elevate
yourself—but we have to start. If we
keep dividing ourselves, then we are
not going to come together to build
these bridges.

I thank my friend from Washington
State who has worked hard on the com-
mittee to advance this and continues
to do so.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington State.
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I
come to the floor to join this debate. I
thank my colleagues, the Senator from
Illinois and certainly the Senator from
Alaska for her comments because I
think some of what I am going to say
will probably overlap in the context of
working together to get things done.
Why do I say that is so important?
Because she and I worked on a bipar-
tisan energy package that we passed
out of the Senate over 2 years ago that
had very important, what I would call
implementation strategies, for allow-
ing our businesses and our commu-
nities to be more cost-competitive
when it comes to energy.
Certainly, in the State of Alaska, I
can’t imagine paying $9 a gallon for
fuel just to heat a home or to have
your hospital or your school available
for kids to go to play in after school or
just meet the healthcare needs of a
community.
Getting energy right not just in big
urban cities like Seattle, which is a lot
easier to do—we have net zero build-
ings, probably some of the best net zero
buildings in the country—already es-
tablishing how you can create energy
and sell it back to the grid and be more
energy efficient, but we have to have
solutions that are going to meet needs
all across the United States of Amer-
ica.
So, good news to hear that the chair-
woman of the Energy Committee is
planning another energy bill. Hope-
fully, some of those provisions we
worked on 2 years ago, like smart
building strategies to help re-
engineering of energy systems within
our buildings to make them more en-
ergy efficient, would also go a long
way. That is about 40 percent of Amer-
ica’s energy use. Every dollar we help a
business save in energy costs just gets
plugged back into that business’s com-
petitiveness in today’s economy. I
thank her for that, and I look forward
to seeing what she and the ranking
member, Senator MANCHIN, push for-
ward, and, certainly, I know we will
have our ideas.
We are here to debate about energy
policy and getting it right for our fu-
ture prosperity and our competitive-
ness. I also agree with my colleague
that getting things done is important
because I think what we have proven
over the last decade, maybe 15 years, is
that we can transition to cleaner fuels;
we can become more energy inde-
pendent; we can become more energy
efficient; and doing so actually creates
new jobs that are higher wage jobs and
help us in the future.
What Americans want to know is
whether we can make it through this
transition without doing great damage
to our economy, and I think the results
of us working together to pass these
legislative ideas in the last decade
have proven to be very strong incen-
tives.
First of all, let’s talk about incen-
tives writ large, tax incentives. We
have been involved with the Finance
Committee over the last several years
to put in place tax credits that rebal-
anced our incentives towards the side
of renewable energy and away from fos-
sil fuels. In 2008 with my colleague,
then-Senator Ensign of Nevada, we
were able to work to make sure we
were driving down the costs of solar,
wind, and biofuels. This legislation,
which was extended in the Recovery
Act, now helps us with wind supplies to
over 6 percent of the U.S. supply.
I know my colleagues in Iowa know
how important this is because their
State’s electricity generates millions
of dollars in economic activity. So the
fact that we focused on renewables in
our tax incentive policy has helped
that industry grow and become a very
big part of our system.
Today’s grid economy is also being
modernized, and we have worked to put
R&D on the table and allow commu-
nities throughout the United States to
invest in smart grid technology.
The Presiding Officer comes from a
State where there are probably leaders
in a lot of renewable energies. I know
there are wind projects in the State of
Washington from companies in his
State that are showing just how effi-
cient wind has become over a long pe-
riod of time. Who would have origi-
nally thought, as I was talking about
the Presiding Officer’s State of Flor-
ida, that we would be talking about
wind? You would think I was talking
about solar. But this is to show you
that the era of distributive genera-
tion—that energy can be created from
a lot of different sources, put on the
grid, moved around cost-effectively, in
smart ways, to become more efficient—
would help us move toward the future
of giving people better opportunities
rather than the pollution we see from
carbon-intensive areas of the United
States.
Even in areas around the United
States that still do rely on coal, people
are starting to see that renewables are
becoming cheaper. The Northern Indi-
ana Public Service Company found
that building renewables is cheaper
than keeping existing coal plants open.
According to the company’s 2018 Inte-
grated Resource Plan filed in October,
they can save their customers $4 bil-
lion over the next 30 years by ramping
down the amount of coal they use from
two-thirds of their generation mix
today, to 15 percent by 2023, to elimi-
nating the use of coal entirely by 2028.
These aren’t just places like my
State of Washington, where we have, as
I said, a lot of technology and a lot of
efficiency, but also States that are
making the transition off these fossil
fuels, showing it is a good investment
and is cheaper for their customers.
We know new wind power purchase
agreements continue to set records for
the lowest cost power, putting down-
ward pressure on electricity costs na-
tionwide. I can’t tell you how impor-
tant that is. Coming from a State
where we have had cheap hydropower
for decades, decades, and decades, it
has built our economy over and over
again. I like to say it has helped us
store apples. After you pick apples and
want to store them for a while, guess
what helps? Cheap electricity.
Now we store bits—actual software
bits. There are data centers that want
cheap electricity. So the very nature of
cheap electricity keeps driving Wash-
ington’s economy over and over.
I know that other States in the Na-
tion would benefit from cheaper elec-
tricity sources too. It would help their
businesses and it would help their con-
sumers. So today, despite the fact that
over 94 percent of all electricity gener-
ating capacity added over the past cen-
tury has been in the renewable area or
natural gas, consumers are paying 4
percent less per kilowatt hour for elec-
tricity than they did a decade ago. So
this diversification off of fossil fuel and
this investment in these cleaner
sources of energy are helping to lower
rates for consumers, and that is why
we need to keep going in this direction.
There is a reason that Fortune 500
companies are among the largest re-
newable energy investors in the coun-
try. According to the Wall Street Jour-
nal, corporations as diverse as
Budweiser, The Gap, and MGM Inter-
national have invested over $16 billion
in wind and solar in 2018, and that is
expected to double in 2019. Even the
utility industry is waking up to this
new reality. The CEO of NextEra, the
largest U.S. electricity company in the
world by market capitalization, re-
cently told investors that solar and
wind, plus storage, will be cheaper than
coal, oil, or nuclear.
So this is something that we need to
realize. Specifically, he said that the
subsidy for wind generation costs will
be 2 to 2.5 percent per kilowatt, and
large scale solar will only be a little
higher than that. Adding storage to
this will help us to get those prices
down even more.
That is why getting the R&D budget
right for the Department of Energy
right now and ARPA-E is so critical.
We can’t cut these programs. We need
to make sure that we are continuing to
make an investment so that our Na-
tion’s electricity sector provides not
only more affordable and more reliable
energy, but also cleaner energy that
will help our atmosphere.
We already now have 3.2 million peo-
ple working in the clean energy sector.
That is nearly three times as many
jobs as in the fossil fuel industry. Yet
people continue to act like this is an
economic debate only about one sector
over the other. It is about how we
make the transition and how we skill
and train people for these future oppor-
tunities that support millions of jobs
here in the United States of America.
Now, why do I want to continue on
that route? Because I want the United

S1958 March 26, 2019
States to be a leader in clean energy
technology. I don’t want to leave this
up to our competitors in other coun-
tries for them to reap the benefit of
better technology and higher wage
jobs. I want us to reap these benefits. I
have seen many companies that have
made their transition in the energy
sector from a fossil fuel focus to renew-
ables, and I hope that will continue to
happen.
There is another area that we have
incented over the last 10 years that
has, I think, proven to be a good in-
vestment. Senator Hatch and I teamed
up in 2007 to introduce legislation pro-
viding a $7,500 tax credit for plug-in
electric vehicles.
Now, I know that at the time people
thought: Well, what is this electric ve-
hicle market all about? But I think we
can look here in 2019 and see exactly
what it is about. Consumers have more
choices, there are more competitors in
the market, and we are reducing our
dependence on fossil fuel. That is why
we need to fight President Trump’s
budget request to take away those tax
incentives for people who buy electric
vehicles. We need to continue to move
forward on driving down the cost.
Another area that we made progress
on in the last decade was fuel effi-
ciency for automobiles. I can tell you
what that fight was like in 2007 as we
struggled here to move forward. Fuel-
efficiency economy increases will re-
sult in oil savings in 2030 of about 3
million barrels per day—more than we
import from the Persian Gulf and Ven-
ezuela combined. So we should not roll
back fuel efficiency standards for auto-
mobiles. I believe this is a red herring.
We know that fuel efficiency helps
consumers to drive to work every day
and to afford to fill up in a more eco-
nomic way. If the Trump administra-
tion does roll back these fuel efficiency
gains, owners of an average model vehi-
cle from the year 2025 will have to fill
up their gas tanks 66 times more and
cost drivers over $1,620 more than what
they currently pay. So why roll them
back?
Another great area of success was es-
tablishing a renewable fuel standard
back in 2007 in that same bipartisan en-
ergy package that was worked on by so
many Members of this institution and
successfully by so many Members in
this institution.
So, to me, it stands in stark contrast
to where we are today in this debate,
because all of the people working to-
gether—our colleagues, the late Sen-
ator Ted Stevens, and the late Senator
Danny Inouye—played key roles as
chairman and ranking member of the
Commerce Committee, the EPW Com-
mittee, and the Energy Committee.
They all added to that legislation in
2007. This bipartisan increase in expan-
sion of the renewable fuel standard was
a great way to look at homegrown
fuels for the future and making up a
larger source of that supply today from
renewable clean energy.
So all of these show that we have
made progress working together over
the last decade or so in a bipartisan
way to demonstrate that this transi-
tion is necessary, that this transition
can be made, that we can make it suc-
cessfully without hurting our economy,
and that we can drive down costs for
businesses and consumers and better
protect our environment. That is so, so
critical.
I am so concerned about the cost of
extreme weather and the impact of cli-
mate change that I asked my col-
league, Senator COLLINS, to request
with me, from the Government Ac-
countability Office, what the costs of
these impacts were. Why did I want
that information? Because, in the
Northwest we are already seeing more
damage from fires that have become a
constant threat every summer. We
have seen a shellfish industry that has
basically been threatened by warmer
waters. We have seen our challenges to
our coastline and changing sea levels.
So we wanted that information.
The result of the study showed that
current estimates for the impacts as a
result of climate change would exceed
$1 trillion by 2039. These are costs that
we are going to pay in response, miti-
gation and adaptation. I would rather
get about the task of diversifying now
and reducing those costs that are going
to be paid out by the American tax-
payer. We can do better.
So moving toward a cleaner economy
off of fossil fuels is what we need to do.
With today’s energy infrastructure
turning over every three or four dec-
ades anyways, which will take an in-
vestment of $25 to $30 million, making
the right choices from the private sec-
tor, is with whom we need to partner.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues on that, working with my
colleague from the Energy Committee,
Senator MURKOWSKI, and my colleague
Senator MANCHIN, and all the other col-
leagues on that committee to help us
get these strategies right.
We know the answer to this question.
Moving forward on cleaner sources is
better for our environment and we
have made great strides in the last dec-
ade in doing so and driving better eco-
nomic opportunity for both the con-
sumers and the future energy workers
of the United States.
I thank the President, and I yield the
floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRUZ). The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, fear has be-
come an all too prevalent quality in
America’s political discourse, and, un-
fortunately, fear is unavoidable when
debating the substance of the resolu-
tion before this body today; that is, cli-
mate change, socialism, and the Green
New Deal.
On entering this debate, I have a lit-
tle fear in my heart as well. My fear at
this moment may be just a little dif-
ferent than that of some of my col-
leagues. Unlike some of my colleagues,
I am not immediately afraid of what
carbon emissions unaddressed might do
to our environment in the near term
future or our civilization or our planet
in the next few years. Unlike others, I
am not immediately afraid of what the
Green New Deal will do to our economy
and our government. After all, this
isn’t going to pass—not today, not any-
time soon, certainly.
Rather, after reading the Green New
Deal, I am mostly afraid of not being
able to get through this speech with a
straight face. I rise today to consider
the Green New Deal with the serious-
ness it deserves. This is, of course, a
picture of former President Ronald
Reagan naturally firing a machine gun
while riding on the back of a dinosaur.
You will notice a couple of important
features here.
First of all, the rocket launcher is
strapped to President Reagan’s back,
and then the stirring unmistakable pa-
triotism of the velociraptor holding up
a tattered American flag, a symbol of
all it means to be an American.
Now, critics might quibble with this
depiction of the climactic battle of the
Cold War because, while awesome, in
real life there was no climactic battle.
There was no battle with or without
velociraptors. The Cold War, as we all
know, was won without firing a shot.
But that quibble actually serves our
purposes here today because this image
has as much to do with overcoming
communism in the 20th century as the
Green New Deal has to do with over-
coming climate change in the 21st cen-
tury.
The aspirations of the proposal have
been called radical. They have been
called extreme, but, mostly, they are
ridiculous. There isn’t a single serious
idea here—not one. To illustrate, let
me highlight two of the most promi-
nent goals produced by the plan’s au-
thors.
Goal No. 1, the Green New Deal calls
essentially for the elimination of air-
planes. Now, this might seem merely
ambitious for politicians who represent
the densely populated northeastern
United States, but how is it supposed
to work for our fellow citizens who
don’t live somewhere between Wash-
ington, DC, and Boston? In a future
without air travel, how are we sup-
posed to get around the vast expanses
of, say, Alaska during the winter? Well,
I will tell you how.
Tauntauns is that beloved species of
reptile mammals native to the ice
planet of Hoth. Now, while perhaps not
as efficient in some ways as airplanes
or as snowmobiles, these hairy bipedal
species of space lizards offer their own
unique benefits. Not only are
tauntauns carbon neutral, but accord-
ing to a report a long time ago and
issued far, far away, they may even be
fully recyclable and useable for their
warmth, especially on a cold night.
What about Hawaii? Isolated, 2,000
miles out into the Pacific Ocean, under
the Green New Deal’s effective airplane
prohibition, how are people there sup-
posed to get to and from the mainland
and how are they supposed to maintain
that significant portion of their econ-
omy that is based on tourism?

At that distance, swimming would, of
course, be out of the question, and jet
skis are notorious gas guzzlers. No, all
residents of Hawaii would be left with
is this. This is a picture of Aquaman, a
superhero from the undersea kingdom
of Atlantis but, notably here, a found-
ing member of the Super Friends.
I draw your attention to the 20-foot
impressive seahorse he is riding. Under
the Green New Deal, this is probably
Hawaii’s best bet. Now, I am the first
to admit that a massive fleet of giant,
highly trained seahorses would be cool
and it would be really, really awesome,
but we have to consider a few things.
We have no idea about scalability or
domestic capacity in this sector. The
last thing we want is to ban all air-
planes and only then find out that
China or Russia may have already es-
tablished strategic hippocampus pro-
grams designed to cut the United
States out of the global market. We
must not allow and cannot tolerate a
giant seahorse gap.
For goal No. 2, the Green New Deal
anticipates the elimination of all cows.
Talking points released by the sponsors
of the resolution the day it was intro-
duced cited the goal of ‘‘fully get[ting]
rid of’’—and I will paraphrase a little
bit here—‘‘[flatulating] cows.’’
Now, I share their concern, but hon-
estly, I think you have to remember
that if the cows smell bad, just wait
until they get a whiff of the seahorses.
Back to the cattle, I have a chart to
illustrate this trend. As you can see on
the left, these little cows represent the
bovine population of America today.
On the right is the future population
under the Green New Deal. We would
go from about 94 million cows to zero
cows—no more milk, no more cheese,
no more steak, and no more ham-
burgers.
Over the State work period last
week, I visited some farms to find out
for myself what Utah’s own bovine
community might think about the
Green New Deal. Every cow I spoke to
said the same thing: Boo.
The authors of this proposal would
protest that these goals are not actu-
ally part of the Green New Deal but
were merely included in supporting
documents accidentally sent out by the
office of the lead sponsor in the House
of Representatives. This only makes
my point. The supporters of the Green
New Deal want Americans to trust
them to reorganize our entire society
and our entire economy, to restructure
our very way of life, and they couldn’t
even figure out how to send out the
right press release.
The Green New Deal is not a serious
policy document because it is not a
policy document at all; it is, in fact, an
aesthetic one. The resolution is not an
agenda of solutions; it is a token of
elite tribal identity, and endorsing it, a
public act of piety for the chic and
woke. And on those embarrassing
terms, it is already a resounding suc-
cess. As Speaker PELOSI herself put it,
‘‘The green dream or whatever they
call it, nobody knows what it is, but
they’re for it, right?’’ Right.
Critics will no doubt chastise me for
not taking climate change seriously,
but, please, nothing could be further
from the truth. No Utahn needs to hear
pious lectures about the gravity of cli-
mate change from politicians from
other States, for it was only in 2016, as
viewers of the Syfy network will well
remember, when climate change hit
home in Utah, when our own State was
struck not simply by a tornado but by
a tornado with sharks in it.
These images are from the indispen-
sable documentary film ‘‘Sharknado
4.’’ They captured the precise moment
when one of the tornado sharks crashed
through the window of Utah’s Gov-
ernor, Gary Herbert. A true Utah hero
and a fine American, Governor Her-
bert—who, by the way, is an incredible
athlete and expert tennis player—
bravely fought off the animal with the
tennis racket that he keeps by his desk
precisely for occasions such as these.
So let’s be real clear. Climate change
is no joke, but the Green New Deal is a
joke. It is the legislative equivalent of
Austin Powers’ Dr. Evil demanding
sharks with ‘‘frickin’ lasers’’ on their
heads.
The Green New Deal is not the solu-
tion to climate change. It is not even
part of the solution. In fact, it is part
of the problem. The solution to climate
change won’t be found in political pos-
turing or virtue signaling like this. It
won’t be found in the Federal Govern-
ment at all. Do you know where the so-
lution can be found? In churches, in
wedding chapels, and in maternity
wards across the country and around
the world. This is the real solution to
climate change: babies.
Climate change is an engineering
problem—not social engineering but
the real kind. It is a challenge of cre-
ativity, ingenuity, and most of all,
technical innovation. Problems of
human imagination are not solved by
more laws; they are solved by more hu-
mans, more people, meaning bigger
markets for innovation. More babies
will mean more forward-looking
adults, the sort we need to tackle long-
term, large-scale problems.
American babies in particular are
likely going to be wealthier, better
educated, and more conservation-mind-
ed than children raised in still indus-
trializing countries. As economist
Tyler Cowen recently wrote on this
very point, addressing this very topic,
‘‘by having more children, you are
making your nation more populous—
thus boosting its capacity to solve [cli-
mate change].’’
Finally, children are a mark of the
kind of personal, communal, and soci-
etal optimism that is the true pre-
requisite for meeting national and
global challenges together.
The courage needed to solve climate
change is nothing compared with the
courage needed to start a family. The
true heroes of this story aren’t politi-
cians, and they aren’t social media ac-
tivists; they are moms and dads and
the little boys and girls whom they are
at this very moment putting down for
naps or helping with their homework,
building tree houses, and teaching
them how to tie their shoes.
The planet does not need for us to
think globally and act locally so much
as it needs us to think family and act
personally. The solution to climate
change is not this unserious resolution
that we are considering this week in
the Senate but, rather, the serious
business of human flourishing. The so-
lution to so many of our problems at
all times and in all places is to fall in
love, get married, and have some kids.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise
today to join my Democratic col-
leagues in lifting up the voices of
countless people in my home State of
Washington and around the Nation who
are calling out for Congress to truly
address the climate change crisis.
I am glad the Republicans have de-
cided to take at least a short break
from their hurried ideological cam-
paign to pack our Federal courts with
as many conservative judges as pos-
sible. It is inexcusable that they are
now choosing to play silly political
games instead of working with us to
make progress on the many challenges
our constituents are facing right now.
Let me be clear. Democrats welcome
a robust, fact-based discussion on the
Senate floor about what we as a nation
must do to combat climate change.
That is not what today’s vote is, nor
what it was meant to be. From the be-
ginning, this vote was scheduled by Re-
publicans to throw red meat to their
rightwing base and an extra bone to
Big Oil and Gas. But, if anything, what
today’s vote makes painfully obvious is
that while Democrats are here at the
table ready to get to work to tackle
one of the most urgent issues of our
time, Republicans don’t have a vision,
much less any solution for how we are
going to reverse the course of climate
change and prevent future damage to
our planet. On the contrary, many Re-
publicans won’t even admit this is a
problem, even after the Trump admin-
istration itself released its own report
detailing how climate change has dam-
aged our planet and will continue to do
so if unaddressed.
Democrats are all on the same page.
We believe in the science, we believe
climate change is one of our planet’s
most urgent crises, and we all believe
that now is the time to take action be-
fore our planet suffers even more irrep-
arable harm. Democrats have long rec-
ognized climate change is a threat not
just to our environment but to our
economy, our community, our health,
and even our way of life.

ening wildfires that destroy more prop-

and prevent every year, and as a grand-
mother who wants to leave a better
world for the next generation, this is
personal to me. But it is not just me or
Senate Democrats; our families back in
our States understand the risk of cli-
mate change, too, and they are very
eager for their government to take ac-
tion against the immediate threat that
it poses.
I was back home last week meeting
with leaders in our State capital of
Olympia. They are working on a suite
of progressive policies aimed at tack-
ling climate change. Every day, I hear
from young people all over my State
about how they want to inherit a clean,
healthy planet. The only way we can
ensure that happens is by listening to
the science and working to do some-
thing now while we still can make a
difference.
I am inspired by my constituents—
especially the students. I understand
why they are so passionate. They get
it. They know how serious climate
change is for today and tomorrow, and
they get that we don’t have any time
to waste. But they cannot do it alone,
and neither can Washington State. It is
going to take a national effort, a Fed-
eral effort to give this issue the atten-
tion it deserves, and Congress should
play a major role in making sure it is
treated like the emergency it is.
Unfortunately, when I turn to my Re-
publican friends in moments like this,
when we could be having a real con-
versation about what we should be
doing today to tackle climate change, I
am reminded that this isn’t a debate
made in good faith. If Republicans were
truly interested in addressing climate
change, they would have stood against
President Trump’s reckless efforts to
roll back clean air standards or, even
better, stopped him from pulling the
United States out of the Paris climate
agreement and weakening our leader-
ship in the global fight against climate
change. And those are just a few
things.
Now we have some Democrats and
Republicans coming together to pro-
tect our environment. The recent pas-
sage of the public lands package is a
good example. But when it comes to
the issue of climate change and having
a discussion about what it would take
to really address it with the serious-
ness and the urgency it deserves, Re-
publicans apparently only have time
for partisan political games, which is
so unfortunate because it is long past
time for them to recognize that cli-
mate change is an urgent and serious
issue. It is going to take all of us work-
ing together to prevent future genera-
tions from suffering the worst of its
impact.
Democrats are ready and willing to
debate Republicans on the facts, about
the risks of not tackling climate
change as aggressively as possible, and
I can only urge Republicans to drop
these games. Listen to your constitu-
ents. Listen to the facts. Do the right
thing and work with us to address this
critical issue before it truly is too late.
Thank you.

Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Thank you, Mr.

I am on the floor today with a very
simple question: What is the Repub-
lican agenda for tackling many of the
major challenges we face today in the
United States of America?
We know what our Republican col-
leagues are against. In fact, just yes-
terday, the Trump administration
asked a Federal court of appeals to
strike down the entire Affordable Care
Act, which would eliminate affordable
healthcare for tens of millions of
Americans and strip away protections
for people with preexisting conditions.
So that is what Republicans are
against, the Affordable Care Act. What
are they for? Since January of this
year, the new Democratic majority in
the House of Representatives has al-
ready passed major legislation on some
important issues for our country. They
passed a major bill to protect and
strengthen the integrity of our election
system and the health of our democ-
racy. It includes lots of provisions, in-
cluding one to get rid of secret money
in politics, because, like the American
public, we believe that Americans have
a right to know who is spending tens of
millions of dollars to try to influence
their votes.
Why not get rid of secret money and
dark money in politics? That is what
the House bill does. That bill is right
here in the Senate now, but are we
going to get a chance to vote on that?
We are asking the majority leader for a
vote on that bill that is sitting right
here in the Senate.
The House also passed sweeping legis-
lation to address gun safety issues.
Specifically, the legislation calls for a
universal criminal background check
to keep guns out of the hands of dan-
gerous people. This is overwhelmingly
supported by the American public. Why
would we want to keep a big loophole
in the law that allows dangerous people
to get guns and commit violent acts
with those guns? That bill is also here
in the Senate, but there is no sign that
we are going to vote on that bill.
Instead, the Republican leader is
bringing up the nonbinding resolu-
tion—the Green New Deal resolution—
which calls for ambitious goals to
tackle climate change, which has cre-
ated a lot of important momentum in
our country to address this issue. Yet
our Republican colleagues are not
bringing up this bill because they want
to do something about climate change;
they are bringing it up with the ex-
press purpose of defeating it and play-
ing political games.
It is a very simple question. We know
what you are against. You are against
the Green New Deal resolution. But
what are you for when it comes to ad-
dressing climate change? The science is
overwhelming. It mounts every day.
Americans can see what is happening
with their own eyes in the form of ex-
treme weather events.
Former Senator Bob Kerrey from Ne-
braska just wrote over the weekend:
The disastrous flooding this month in Ne-
braska and much of the upper Midwest is a
reminder of several important truths. First,
weather and climate are not the same thing.
Climate affects weather, not the other way
around.
If our Republican colleagues don’t
agree with our own American sci-
entists at NASA and NOAA, scientists
throughout the country and around the
world, my goodness, I would hope they
would believe our military leaders who
just last year put out a report. I am
reading from a release that says: ‘‘New
Pentagon Survey: Climate Change-Re-
lated Risks to 50% of Military Infra-
structure.’’
The folks at the Pentagon seem to
recognize the costs and harm of cli-
mate change. Yet our Republican col-
leagues do nothing but play games
with this issue.
Ironically, this week we are going to
be taking up a disaster relief bill. I
think the pricetag for that bill is $13
billion to $14 billion. This is just one of
many disaster relief bills we will han-
dle.
We all know that we will always have
natural disasters, but we also know
from the science that they are more in-
tense, more extreme, and more costly
because of climate change, and they
happen more often because of climate
change.
Our Republican colleagues are happy
to ask taxpayers to shell out more and
more money to pay for the harm and
damage of climate change through ex-
treme weather events, but they are not
willing to consider any legislation on
this floor to actually do something
about it and stop the rising costs,
harm, and damage.
If you don’t like the nonbinding reso-
lution of the Green New Deal, why not
support another nonbinding resolution
put forth by Senator CARPER and every
Democrat? It is very simple. No. 1, cli-
mate change is real; No. 2, human ac-
tivity is the dominant cause; and No. 3,
Congress should take immediate action
to do something about it. That must be
a really radical proposal for our Repub-
lican colleagues, but only one Repub-
lican Senator has signed on, which just
shows the incredible hypocrisy of this
entire exercise.
The Republican leader is bringing up
a measure that calls for ambitious
goals. I think those are good goals. I
support it, but he wants to defeat it.
Yet he has not a single idea of his own
to address this issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1961
March 26, 2019
This week, I intend, along with Con-
gressman DON BEYER in the House, to
reintroduce a bill called the cap and
dividend bill. It is very simple: The pol-
luter pays, just as we have handled en-
vironmental issues in the past. We will
put a price on carbon pollution, and by
doing so, we will create more incen-
tives for investment in clean energy
technology, renewable energy tech-
nology, energy efficiency. We propose
to take the proceeds from that ‘‘pol-
luter pays’’ fee and rebate the entire
thing to the American people. As a re-
sult, according to the studies of the
University of Massachusetts, 80 percent
of the American people, at the end of
the day, will actually see more money
in their pocket than before, and we will
begin to address the ravages of climate
change.
I urge my colleagues to actually do
something when it comes to climate
change.
I yield the floor to Senator STABENOW
from Michigan, who has been a leader
on this issue.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I
want to thank my friend and colleague
from Maryland for his powerful words,
as well as all of my colleagues who are
here for their leadership on this incred-
ibly important issue.
Climate change is real. Carbon pollu-
tion is real. It is having a real effect in
my State of Michigan. We can and
must take real action to do something
about it. It is not a time for playing
political games. Frankly, the stakes
are just plain too high. We should be
coming together around a resolution
that our entire Democratic caucus has
put together that simply says this: Cli-
mate change is real; climate change is
caused by humans; Congress must act
on climate change. Let’s start there.
We can’t even get bipartisan support
for this, which is so basic. Let’s start
there and then take specific action.
I was very encouraged a few weeks
ago when Chairwoman MURKOWSKI and
Ranking Member MANCHIN on the En-
ergy and Natural Resources Committee
held a hearing on climate change. It
was the first one since I have been on
the committee. It may be the first one
ever to talk about the incredibly disas-
trous impacts of what is happening in
Alaska, as well as around our country.
We should be working together across
the aisle to solve this big problem and
to come together with specific actions
after the hearing. I am looking forward
to that.
Instead, the Republican leader is
playing ‘‘gotcha’’ politics with an issue
that is hurting real people from Bristol
Bay to the Missouri River Basin to the
Great Lakes. Frankly, it is insulting,
and the people who are having their
livelihoods upended deserve better.
You don’t have to spend much time
in Michigan to see the effects, unfortu-
nately. The Great Lakes Basin has
warmed more over the last 30 years
than the rest of the contiguous United
States. That is not a position we want
to be in.
Precipitation is up 11 percent since
1900. That means more flooding. Flood-
ing is worse. Between 2040 and 2060—
which actually is not that far away,
particularly when we are looking at
our children and grandchildren—North-
ern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula
could see 500 percent more 100-year
floods.
Heat waves in Michigan have tripled
compared to the long-term average. It
is estimated that by 2040 the dan-
gerously hot days could cause 760 peo-
ple in the Detroit metro area alone to
die each year when they otherwise
wouldn’t. Rising energy demands will
require more than $6 billion in infra-
structure improvements. Cold water
fish species could simply die off,
threatening our $5 billion per year
sport fishing industry.
Agricultural productivity could fall
to 1980 levels by 2050. Keep in mind
that by then, our planet’s population
will be double what it was in 1980. If ag-
ricultural productivity is falling at
that point, that will be a disaster, not
only for the United States and our peo-
ple but for around the world.
These changes are already hurting
our people in Michigan and our econ-
omy. Just talk to a cherry grower who
has lost an entire crop because of warm
weather in February—which causes his
trees to bloom too early, and then the
freeze comes and wipes out all the
cherry trees—or a family whose fishing
and boating business is threatened by
invasive species and toxic algal blooms
or the family who lost their 12-year-old
son when flooding caused the basement
of their home to collapse.
Perhaps you are more motivated by
the bottom line. If that is the case, you
should just talk to insurance company
executives. Their companies paid out a
record $135 billion from natural disas-
ters in 2017 alone. That is nearly three
times as much as the historic annual
average. By the way, after we finish
voting on this resolution that the Re-
publican leader is bringing up, we are
going to be asked to vote on a disaster
package to help States and commu-
nities that have been impacted by car-
bon pollution and climate change. We
will only see more of that if we don’t
take real action.
It is not time for words. It is time for
action. It is time to focus like a laser
on reducing carbon pollution, reversing
the damage that has already been done
and creating good jobs at home.
I am so pleased that Michigan right
now is leading in green new jobs in the
Midwest. We need to ensure that the
United States—not China—is the glob-
al leader on advanced transportation
technologies like electric and hydrogen
vehicles. We need to invest more in re-
newable energy and the research that
is making it more affordable all the
time.
I realize my time is up. Let me just
say, in closing, we can do something
about this. We have done this before.
When we discovered acid rain about 40
years ago, we put together a market-
based program and were able to fix
that issue. CFCs, chemicals that break
down into chlorine and eat away at the
ozone layer—today, that hole in the
ozone is closing because of actions we
took together. Now is the time to take
real action on carbon pollution, agree
to these basic principles, and then
move forward together on behalf of our
children and grandchildren.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii.
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I got my
first taste of politics when I was 16
years old. I was worried that my favor-
ite surf spot was going to be turned
into condominiums, so I joined the
Save Sandy Beach Coalition. Adults
around me told me that I was too
young to take action. They told me
that the adults had it under control,
but I didn’t listen. It took several
years, but with lots of grassroots en-
ergy, the Governor of the State of Ha-
waii eventually signed legislation that
preserved the Sandy Beach coastline
for generations.
America’s proud history of social
change is about young people who
don’t take no for an answer; they take
action. Some of the most inspiring
movements in our history have been
led by young people. They were the
ones who first refused to leave their
seats in segregated lunch counters,
who filled campus squares demanding
an end to apartheid, who marched in
the streets against police brutality,
and staged walkouts to protest gun vi-
olence.
Once again, young people are stand-
ing up because the adults are blowing
it. On March 15, tens of thousands of
kids walked out of school in hundreds
of cities and 130 countries demanding
action on climate. This isn’t a school
project for them. It is a fight for the
world they will inhabit. They see what
is happening around the world. The cli-
mate is changing, and it is getting
worse, and we need to take action.
In 2017, the United States experi-
enced 16 disasters that cost $1 billion
or more: 9.8 million acres burned by
wildfire; 30,000 people homeless; 200,000
homes and businesses damaged or de-
stroyed by Hurricane Harvey; the Flor-
ida Keys devastated by Irma; thou-
sands dead, and an entire island’s infra-
structure destroyed by Hurricane
Maria. The year 2017 set a new record
for the cost of extreme weather events.
Last year was not better. There were
14 separate disasters that cost $1 bil-
lion or more, including the largest,
deadliest wildfires that California has
ever seen. According to NOAA, the
wildfires did more than $40 billion
worth of damage. So in these two
record-setting years, climate change
has cost billions in personal property
and taxpayer dollars. And they have
cost lives.
Now the Midwest is flooding. I don’t
mean that as a political statement or a
rhetorical flourish. The Midwest is

flooding. In another once-in-a-lifetime
storm, which is happening more and
more frequently, the levees and sys-
tems built to deal with flooding have
failed because they were built for a cli-
mate that no longer exists. Commu-
nities are underwater, and people are
stranded in their homes right now, at
this very moment. In Nebraska alone,
the damage is already more than $1 bil-
lion. Livestock, crops, infrastructure
have been destroyed. Soil that is need-
ed not just for this season but for the
future has been destroyed. This is the
moment at which Congress should be
examining the costs of climate change
and what to do about it.
I have to say something about the
senior Senator from Utah. That was
appalling. I understand that we want
to make jokes and that we want to be
clever and that we want to have a clip
to put on Facebook or Instagram or
whatever, but that was appalling. This
is the crisis of our generation, and it is
not a joke. He spent time creating im-
ages not of what we ought to do—not of
his conservative proposals around cli-
mate change—but in being consistent
with what Leader MCCONNELL wants
the Republican Party to do, which is to
not engage in the substance and to
turn this into a joke.
I have to say, on behalf of everybody
in Hawaii, on behalf of the young peo-
ple who care about this, and on behalf
of the people across the planet who
want climate action, this isn’t funny.
This requires the party in charge of the
U.S. Senate to take it seriously.
The good news is, we are starting to
have an engagement about climate
change. I saw the senior Senator from
Tennessee engage a bit and say we
should have a Manhattan Project for
solving climate change. Good enough. I
saw Senator ISAKSON, 3 or 4 weeks ago,
talk about how we ought to take cli-
mate action. I also know the chair of
the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee cares about this issue. So
there is an opportunity for engagement
but not so long as Leader MCCONNELL
thinks this whole thing is worthy of
nothing more than being a joke.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico.
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, we
don’t have any more time to waste on
political stunts, on climate denial or,
for that matter, on climate ‘‘delay-al.’’
Enough with the straw man arguments
from my Republican colleagues about
hamburgers and ‘‘Sharknado.’’ Is that
really the best they can do?
Climate change is real, and our pollu-
tion is causing its devastating impacts.
Those are just facts.
As an engineer, I am certain our ca-
pacity to confront this challenge rests
heavily on our ability to make policy
that is actually driven by facts, by
data, and by the best available science.
That science provides us with clear and
indisputable evidence that the destruc-
tive wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding
we have seen are directly linked to
human-caused climate change.
We are running out of time. It is past
time for us to start implementing real
solutions to eliminate our carbon pol-
lution and mitigate the most dev-
astating effects of climate change, and
we must create a managed transition
to an economy that is run on 100 per-
cent clean energy. I encourage us to
look to what just happened in my home
State of New Mexico to see that this is
possible, that it is not pie in the sky.
For more than a century, New Mex-
ico has been a major part of our car-
bon-based economy—from coal, to oil,
to gas. Yet, just last week, our new
Governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham,
signed into law sweeping legislation to
move our State toward being a 100-per-
cent carbon-free power sector by 2045. I
am enormously proud of the hard work
that has led to there being this land-
mark legislation. This major transition
to clean energy will change our State
and our economy for the better.
New Mexicans will save money in
their monthly bills. Along the way, we
will create thousands of new, high-pay-
ing jobs across our State, including in
the communities that will be impacted
by this transition. We are already see-
ing the massive economic potential of
clean energy with the enormous wind
farms and solar plants that are coming
on line all across our State. Every new
project brings new jobs and brings mil-
lions—sometimes billions—of dollars of
investment.
That is the kind of action we need to
take in the U.S. Senate. The United
States can and must lead the way in
this transition. That is why we are
challenging Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL to put an end to the political
stunts.
Leader MCCONNELL, bring your solu-
tions to the floor. Let’s get to work to-
gether.
I yield the remainder of my time to
Senator WHITEHOUSE of Rhode Island,
who has been an incredible leader on
this issue.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
will speak very briefly.
Rhode Island is a coastal State, and
we are now looking at maps that our
coastal agency, the local university,
and the scientists at NOAA tell us will
create a new face of Rhode Island in
the decades ahead if we don’t address
climate change. We turn into an archi-
pelago. We lose enormous amounts of
waterfront, and as a small State,
frankly, we don’t have a lot to give
back to the ocean. This is deadly seri-
ous for us.
I join in my colleague’s sense of of-
fense that the other side thinks this is
something funny. This is not funny for
Rhode Islanders; this is deadly real.
You may disagree with us, but the one
thing that, I think, we are owed on this
subject is sincerity, but there is noth-
ing sincere about the vote that is going
to be held on the Green New Deal.
This is a vote that will be based on a
cartoon version of the Green New Deal
that was cooked up by the Koch broth-
ers, who have their oily hands all over
this mess, and it was instructed by the
fossil fuel mouthpiece of the Wall
Street Journal’s editorial page. It took
only days for the majority leader to
hop up and do the bidding of these
farces.
We are owed better than this. If you
disagree with our measures, fine. Have
one of your own. We have five or six
different bills and strategies that we
are willing to work on. This is the time
to be serious, to be sincere, and to quit
mocking a concern that across the
board is recognized as real. In fact,
there is not a Republican here who
can’t go to his home State university
and be told about the truth of climate
change.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts.
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, this
afternoon, the Republican leader is
bringing the Green New Deal resolu-
tion up for a vote on the floor of the
Senate. What the Republican leader,
however, is not doing is allowing us to
have any hearings, any witnesses, any
science, any evidence of the massive
destruction in our country.
Just from fires and flooding over the
last 2 years, there has been $400 billion
worth of damage. None of that will
ever be heard out here. None of it was
heard in a committee because the Re-
publican leader is making a sham of
this process. This is not the serious
process this incredible issue deserves.
The United Nations has made it clear
that climate change is now an existen-
tial threat to our country and to the
planet.
Notwithstanding the incredible dam-
age that is being done to our planet,
the Republicans’ concern is that the
Green New Deal is an existential threat
to the Koch brothers, to ExxonMobil,
and to all of those polluting companies
that do not want to end business as
usual. The Republican leader does not
want a hearing at which we will learn
that we now have 350,000 people who
are in the wind and solar industries
and that we have 350,000 blue-collar
jobs—electricians, roofers, steel-
workers—in our country. The Green
New Deal would supercharge that even
more to our having millions of clean
energy jobs in our country.
We can save all of creation by engag-
ing in massive job creation, which is
the core of the Green New Deal, and we
can do it in a way that ensures we pro-
tect people in our country. We have
gone now from 80,000 solar jobs to
240,000 solar jobs in just the last 10
years. We have gone from 2,500 all-elec-
tric vehicles to 1 million all-electric
vehicles in just 10 years. There have
been 500,000 new electric vehicles sold
this year in the United States—1
year—after only having 2,000 of them
sold 10 years ago. We went from 1,000
megawatts of solar capacity to 65,000
megawatts in 2018. That is a revolution
in 10 years. We have gone from 25,000

megawatts of wind to 98,000 megawatts
of wind in 10 years.
That is the revolution the Koch
brothers are afraid of, and that is the
revolution the polluters want to stop
because it is the existential threat to
their business model. That is what the
fight is all about out here—the Koch
brothers v. the Green New Deal. It is
one business model against another,
and our business model is the job cre-
ation engine of this generation for
blue-collar jobs.
Now, who paid for the Republican
study that they all came out on the
floor to use? It was paid for by the
Koch brothers. They put together what
they believe are the costs of the Green
New Deal. This was not some private,
independent group. The Koch brothers
themselves paid for the study that the
Republicans have used out here on the
floor.
The hearings, if the majority leader
had ever ordered them to have been
conducted, would have just picked out
some of the items regarding how much
harm had been done to our planet and
to our own country in the last 2 years—
$24 billion from western wildfires in
2018, $24 billion from Hurricane Mi-
chael, $24 billion from Hurricane Flor-
ence, $18 billion from western wildfires
in 2017, $91 billion from Hurricane
Maria, and on and on and on—Hurri-
cane Harvey, $127.5 billion.
This is all climate related. We pay
the price for this. There is no exempt-
ing America from having to pick up the
costs. Shouldn’t we be investing in job
creation? Shouldn’t we be investing in
this incredible change that is already
taking place in our economy?
The Green New Deal is not just a res-
olution; it is a revolution that is tak-
ing place across our country. That is
why people are rising up all across our
country. It is because they know we
can do this and because they know this
is a job-creation engine that absolutely
can create millions of jobs and that can
absolutely begin the process of having
America, once again, be the leader on
this issue.
The denier in chief sits in the White
House. The denier in chief addressed
the United States at the State of the
Union for an hour and 20 minutes just
7 weeks ago, but he did not mention
climate change and did not mention
clean energy jobs. That is why we are
in this fight. We are in the fight be-
cause, if we don’t lead, the rest of the
world will not follow. You cannot
preach temperance from a barstool.
You can’t tell China and you can’t tell
India what to do if you yourself are not
leading. We are the United States of
America.
President Kennedy challenged our
country to have a mission to the Moon.
He said in his speech at Rice Univer-
sity that we would have to invent new
metals, new alloys, and propulsion sys-
tems that did not exist. He said we
would have to bring that mission safely
back from the Moon through heat that
was half the intensity of the Sun and
get it completed within 10 years. We
did that as a nation. We can do this as
well. We can deploy these technologies;
we can invent new technologies; and we
can create millions of jobs within our
country because we are bold—because
we are a country that can do it.
The President is, for all intents and
purposes, John F. Kennedy in reverse.
He says we can’t do it. He says we
should not accept this challenge. La-
dies and gentlemen, the Green New
Deal is our accepting the challenge,
and we are looking forward to this de-
bate today and every day until election
day of 2020. We are going to inject this
issue into the Presidential and congres-
sional races of 2020 in a way that en-
sures that unlike in 2016, when Donald
Trump and Hillary Clinton were not
asked a single question about climate
change, the candidates will be asked
every day about what their plans are.
We say to the Republican leader: Do
you believe in the science? Do you be-
lieve it is an existential threat? If you
do, where is your plan? Where is the
Republican plan to deal with the
science of climate change?
If you do not believe it is a threat,
then, say it. If you do not believe the
science, then, say it. But if you do be-
lieve the science, then, all we say to
you is this: Where is your plan to deal
with this challenge?
President Kennedy responded to the
challenge of the Soviet Union control-
ling outer space, and we succeeded.
What is the plan of this Republican era
to deal with the challenge of climate,
an existential threat to our planet?
We thank you for your attention.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
S.J. RES. 9
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we
shortly will be voting on cloture on a
Senate resolution.
As I understand it, a Senate resolu-
tion in regards to a policy issue is basi-
cally trying to express the Senate’s
collective views on a policy issue with-
out implementing the legislation itself.
If we are going to take up such a reso-
lution, we should take up one that can
get broad consensus here in the Senate.
Although the Green New Deal has sup-
port, it certainly will not have con-
sensus in this body at this time.
Therefore, I urge the leader to bring
up S.J. Res. 9, introduced by my col-
league Senator CARPER, which deals
with climate change with three specific
issues that I think all of us should be
able to agree on: one, that climate
change is real and it is happening; sec-
ond, that our conduct here on Earth is
a major factor in accelerating climate
change’s activities, leading to the
types of extreme weather we have seen
around the world; and, third, that it is
urgent that we take action to mitigate
the impact of climate change.
Climate change is real. I represent
the State of Maryland, with 3,000 miles
of shoreline in my State. I see it in
flooding and shoreline erosion. I see
the impact it has on the Chesapeake
Bay, which is iconic to my State and to
our economy. Climate change is having
an impact—a negative impact. I see it
in communities such as Ellicott City,
which experienced two 100-year floods
within 20 months, just recently, and
cost loss of life and property. I see the
impact it has on our environment and
on our economy.
Clearly, our activities are having a
significant impact on accelerating cli-
mate change. Carbon emissions, green-
house gas emissions, and the use of fos-
sil fuels have had an impact on accel-
erating that. We use too much energy,
and we get too much of our energy
from sources that are not friendly to-
ward the issue of greenhouse gas emis-
sions.
Third is the urgency. An October 2018
report from the United Nations’ Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate
Change made clear that it is urgent
that we deal with climate change now
and that science tells us that we can
reverse the most extreme impact of cli-
mate change. We can mitigate the im-
pact of climate change if we take ac-
tion—if we act now—on this issue.
The Trump administration is an
outlier in the global community in
dealing with the realities of climate
change. Every other nation in the
world—every other nation in the
world—has acknowledged that we need
to act as a civilized world, that we need
to work together, and that there is no
geographical boundary as to dealing
with climate change.
The United Nations Framework Con-
vention on Climate Change met in De-
cember of 2015. I was there with 9 of my
colleagues, in Paris, where 195 nations
agreed to deal with climate change. I
was proud to be part of the U.S. delega-
tion. Now we have left those discus-
sions, and we are alone.
This is too important and too urgent
of an issue to play partisan games
with, and that is exactly what the ma-
jority leader is trying to do today. We
need to commit to work together,
Democrats and Republicans, in the
U.S. Senate to restore the U.S. leader-
ship on this key issue, knowing full
well that America’s full leadership is
desperately needed in order to deal
with these issues, and we need to make
sure that we take action.
More than passing a resolution, let’s
start with legislation that will really
make a difference on climate change
and commit much stronger to renew-
able energy, rather than using fossil
fuels to the extent that we do today.
Let’s put a price on carbon to allow the
U.S. market economy to figure out the
solution for reducing the amount of
fossil fuels. Let’s commit to conserva-
tion in our buildings and the way we

ditions of the U.S. Senate in providing

LEGISLATIVE SESSION
RECOGNIZING THE DUTY OF THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CRE-
ATE A GREEN NEW DEAL—MO-
TION TO PROCEED
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to legislative session to resume
consideration of the motion to proceed
to S.J. Res. 8, which the clerk will re-
port.
The assistant bill clerk read as fol-

Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 27, S.J.
Res. 8, a joint resolution recognizing the
duty of the Federal Government to create a
Green New Deal.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the time until 4
p.m. will be equally divided between
the two leaders or their designees.
The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last
month our colleague, the Senator from
New York, the Democratic leader, said:
So when the Republican leader says he
wants to bring the Green New Deal resolu-
tion up for a vote, I say: Go for it. Bring it
on.
Well, here we are. Senators will soon
have a chance to vote on the Green
New Deal, and we have already seen a
lot of confusion and more than a little
waffling from our friends on the other
side of the aisle, some apparently con-
fused on exactly what they should do
on a resolution they themselves pro-
posed.
When it was announced, the senior
Senator from Massachusetts quickly
pledged her support, as did the junior
Senator from New Jersey. But I find it
pretty curious that some of our col-
leagues who were among the first to
join these Senators and voice their sup-
port for this proposal are now among
those saying they will simply vote
present—present.
Even more interesting is one of the
bill’s authors, the junior Senator from
Massachusetts, who called this vote
‘‘sabotage.’’
Ordinarily, when proposing a piece of
legislation around here, one is tickled
pink when the majority leader sched-
ules it for a vote, but somehow some of
our colleagues will vote present—nei-
ther yea nor nay—and others claim it
is sabotage. As the vote approaches, we
have seen many of our Democratic
friends running for the hills, trying to
provide space between them and this
issue.
The Green New Deal is chock full of
utopian ideas but completely devoid of
concrete plans to implement any of its
overreaching policies. Even the name
is a little disorienting because the
Green New Deal is not just a new rad-
ical environmental policy; it is that,
but it is more. It encompasses much
more than that with Medicare for All,
free college, and guaranteed jobs. I
might add, parenthetically, you might
as well throw in free beer and pizza too.
What has been billed as an economy
invigorator and job innovator in order
to lift up the middle class is really any-
thing but. The bottom line of this pro-
posal is a solution in search of a prob-
lem. It is about a message; it is not
about finding solutions to real prob-
lems.
Maybe it is useful to take a step back
to look at what we have already done
in this Congress to help the middle
class and to generate job growth. Over
the last 2 years, we have worked to roll
back burdensome regulations left over
from the previous administration and
make much needed reforms to our out-
dated Tax Code—the first time in 30
years.
My constituents in Texas have taken
notice, and I have heard from many of
them who have seen an increase in
their take-home pay, thanks to the tax
reform bill, for example. Small busi-
nesses in Texas have been able to help
give their employees more benefits.
For example, Village Foods and Phar-
macy in Bryan, TX, said that because
of the tax reform bill, they were able to
provide employee bonuses and imple-
ment a 401(k) retirement program,
something they were previously unable
to do. In San Antonio, my hometown,
Hinee Gourmet Coffee said they used
their tax cut savings to give their em-
ployees raises, as well as to increase
employee benefits and upgrade their
equipment.
The unemployment rate in Texas re-
mains at 3.8 percent, near its historic
43-year low and on par with the na-
tional average. The Lone Star State
has added 268,000-plus jobs since Feb-
ruary 2018. If you go to Midland, TX,
and the Permian Basin, the unemploy-
ment rate is 2.1 percent. Labor is tight,
and employers are looking for workers
because the economy is booming, and
they need good people to fill these un-
filled jobs.
I think my State is proof positive
that when the government gets out of
the way, the economy can flourish.
That is why we have seen so many peo-
ple flooding into Texas to take advan-
tage of the low taxes and abundant job
opportunities. It is also why I find it so
ironic that a few weeks ago one of the
Green New Deal creators, the Congress-
woman from New York, chose South by
Southwest in Austin to peddle her so-
cialist agenda, because if implemented,
the Green New Deal would wipe out
most of this prosperity. It would cut
job growth; it would dramatically in-
crease taxes and cripple our red-hot
economy.
One group has estimated that in
order to achieve just one portion of
this radical agenda—a net-zero emis-
sions transportation system—the an-
nual cost to families would be about
$2,000. That is just for part of the Green
New Deal.
Add in another Green New Deal pro-
posal, and it gets more expensive—to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1965
March 26, 2019
the tune of $26,000. No, I am not talking
about somebody’s annual paycheck. I
am talking about the estimated cost
for families to implement their uni-
versal healthcare program that would
wipe out all employer-provided cov-
erage and bankrupt Medicare. Families
in Texas and across the country would
be on the hook for more than $65,000 a
year in order to finance the Green New
Deal’s expensive and extravagant
promises.
Unfortunately, the list of expenses
doesn’t stop there. The Green New Deal
calls for a move to 100-percent clean
and renewable energy in just 10 years.
Right now, Texas generates about 19
percent of our energy from renewables.
We like renewables in Texas, but there
needs to be a baseload that provides en-
ergy when the sun doesn’t shine and
the wind doesn’t blow. The Green New
Deal has no plan for how it expects
States to actually scale up their num-
ber from the 19 percent Texas currently
generates from renewables to this 100
percent—no plan at all.
Without a plan, Texans can forget
about electricity that is affordable and
reliable; instead, they need to ready
themselves for electric bills that could
jump to as high as $3,800 a year.
Instead of focusing on a grab bag of
government mandates and over-
reaching regulations that we know
would bankrupt our country, we need
to follow existing models that point a
way toward success. We know what
works, and, if you will forgive me, I
would suggest the Texas model is a
good one. Our model values collabora-
tion and partnership with the private
sector in order to create affordable and
cutting-edge solutions. We are all
about innovation and experimentation.
That is how we come up with better,
smarter, more efficient, and more ef-
fective ideas to deal with problems. It
is a model based on innovation that
has been the backbone of our successful
economy. The last thing we need is an-
other Federal Government wet blanket
that puts a damper on all of the great
innovation and activity that has
caused our economy to boom.
Texas is really the best example of
this with companies like NET Power
and NRG Energy, which are leading the
way in innovation. NET Power, which
has a plant in La Porte, outside of
Houston, has developed a first-of-its-
kind power system that generates af-
fordable electricity from natural gas
with zero emissions—zero emissions.
Our State is also proof positive that
one can promote innovation while har-
nessing the traditional power of oil and
gas development. In other words, we
can be pro-energy, pro-innovation, pro-
growth, and pro-environment. But if we
implemented the Green New Deal, we
wouldn’t be talking only about the
added costs and expenses to families;
hundreds of thousands of people would
lose their jobs and our export economy,
which helps fuel our booming economy,
would sharply decline. Our energy inde-
pendence would evaporate, but our
need for and reliance on natural gas,
coal, and oil would remain. It would
focus our efforts back on being more
dependent on foreign energy sources
rather than generating them domesti-
cally. I am sure Russia, for example,
would be happy about that.
Some have called the Green New Deal
the road map for solving climate
change, but to be a road map, you have
to have clear points on how to get from
point A to point B. You actually need
to be clear-eyed about the problem you
are trying to solve, and you need de-
tails in terms of how you actually hope
to get to where you want to go. But
this proposal is a pie-in-the-sky, unat-
tainable end destination with no de-
tails of how to arrive there.
So as the Senate prepares to vote on
the Green New Deal, I ask that we keep
in mind that our constituents didn’t
send us here to Washington to vote
present. That is a copout. Voting
present? Give me a break. People ought
to vote their conviction. They ought to
vote yes or no. To hide behind some
copout vote like present is just to take
the easy way out, and it is sad that ap-
pears to be the road many of our
friends across the aisle are about to
take, rather than doing the job they
have been sent here to do and working
with us to come up with actual, tan-
gible solutions that can become law. I
know that if we just tried a little bit
harder and avoided these sorts of ideo-
logical talking points, we could actu-
ally solve more of these problems and
ours could remain a strong economy.
We could create jobs. We can maintain
our energy self-sufficiency here in
America, and we can deal with environ-
mental emissions concerns. We can
find solutions to those problems, but
one big power grab by the Federal Gov-
ernment that ruins the economy, bank-
rupts us, and, frankly, doesn’t really
make things better is a bad deal for
Texans, and I believe a bad deal for
Americans.
Unsurprisingly, I intend to vote no,
and I hope my colleagues will join me
in doing the same.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so
ordered.
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I stand today with my colleagues
on the Democratic side of the aisle to
talk about the real impacts of climate
change.
Climate change is real. It is hap-
pening in our communities, and it is
harming our country. It is impacting
our economy, and it is threatening the
future of our kids.
You can see it clearly in my home
State of Nevada. The last 4 years have
been the hottest ever on record, and we
are on track to break that record again
in 2019. In Nevada, we are seeing
longer, more dangerous heat waves,
prolonged droughts, and more severe
wildfire seasons. Just this past year,
more than 660,000 acres of private, Bu-
reau of Land Management, and U.S.
Forest Service land burned in 138 fires
starting in June of 2018. The biggest
fire in our State’s history and also one
of the biggest in our country’s history
happened just this past year. The Mar-
tin Fire burned more than 439,000 acres.
That is an area about five times the
size of Las Vegas.
I have heard from Nevada ranchers
who are facing the tough choice to
abandon the land their families have
worked for generations due to the cost
of recovery and the threat of even
worse fire seasons. I have met with par-
ents in Las Vegas and Reno who are
worried about the impact that wors-
ening air quality, because of climate
change and these wildfires, will have
on the health of their children.
It is not happening just in Nevada;
throughout our country, Americans are
being displaced and communities are
being ravaged by devastating hurri-
canes, tornadoes, wildfires, and floods
that are causing millions of dollars in
damage to homes, businesses, and local
economies. Worldwide, carbon emis-
sions levels reached a record high last
year, increasing 3.1 percent in the
United States alone, despite evidence
that high emissions are driving
changes in our climate and fueling ex-
treme weather patterns. Yet this ad-
ministration and the Republican leader
have done nothing to act despite over-
whelming support from Americans who
want us to protect our planet and our
communities.
In my home State, Nevadans know
the stakes. In 2016, Colorado College
polled voters in six Western States
about their views on climate change.
At the time, 58 percent of Nevadans ex-
pressed concerns that climate change
was a serious problem. In January, Ne-
vadans were polled again. This time,
almost 75 percent of Nevadans ex-
pressed serious concerns about climate
change. That is a 16-percent jump in 3
years and comes months after 60 per-
cent of Nevadans supported a ballot
initiative to expand Nevada’s renew-
able energy portfolio to 50 percent by
2030.
Across the country, Americans are
worried about the impacts of pollution
and carbon emissions on our climate,
health, and our economy. They have
seen the harm it has caused just over
the last decade, and they are afraid it
is getting worse.
You don’t have to look far to see that
our climate is changing. It is already
happening in our own backyards. We
have the evidence. There is scientific
consensus. This isn’t a fringe theory or
a hypothesis asking to be debunked; it
is a serious crisis that must be met
with serious action. It is clear to
younger generations of Americans who

actually walked out of schools this
month to demand climate action from
their representatives in Washington.
Despite overwhelming evidence that
climate change is currently threat-
ening our country, Leader MCCONNELL
and this administration are sitting on
their hands. This administration has
repeatedly tried to scrub climate
change information from Federal
Agency websites, supported Agency of-
ficials with deep ties to fossil fuel in-
dustries, and pulled the United States
out of a critical international agree-
ment that we need to collectively work
together to avert climate disaster.
In the Senate, instead of working to
find bipartisan solutions to one of our
country’s greatest threats, Leader
MCCONNELL is setting up a vote de-
signed to be nothing more than a polit-
ical stunt. My Democratic colleagues
and I take the threat of climate change
seriously. We won’t support the Repub-
lican leader’s newest political game to
address climate change. We call it a
sham vote. This isn’t a vote about leg-
islation; it is a cynical attempt to dis-
tract from the challenge confronting
our country.
The fact is, Democrats all agree that
we need to take urgent action to pro-
tect our environment and avert cli-
mate catastrophe. Senate Democrats
have put forth many new ideas on how
to grow our economy and support
American prosperity, while addressing
our world’s growing climate crisis. We
would be happy to work with our col-
leagues to debate them on the floor.
From my seat on the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee, I
am continuing to fight for legislation
to tackle climate change by supporting
renewable energy production, pro-
tecting workers, and creating good-
paying, green jobs in Nevada and
across the country.
I call on Leader MCCONNELL and my
Republican colleagues: If you are seri-
ous about addressing climate change,
then join us. Senate Democrats will
continue to fight for commonsense
policies that reduce our dependence on
fossil fuels and combat climate change,
and we will continue to call on our col-
leagues across the aisle to work with
us to tackle this challenge in both the
House and Senate.
Democrats are working every day to
craft smart and effective policies that
will help safeguard our planet and help
grow our economy. By forcing a vote
now, Senator MCCONNELL is denying us
all the chance to come together to
craft bipartisan, comprehensive cli-
mate change legislation through the
legislative process. The American peo-
ple want action now.
I won’t stand for Republican leaders
using this vote in a cynical attempt to
divide Democrats and stall progress. I
intend to keep my promise to fight on
this issue and to protect the most vul-
nerable and marginalized, who often
bear the brunt of the effects of un-
checked climate change.
The American people continue to
speak out for action on climate change,
and Senate Democrats will keep fight-
ing because our planet and our future
depend on it.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the
Democrats on this side believe that cli-
mate change is a real and urgent prob-
lem. The Republican leader seems to
believe it is not a problem at all.
The majority leader has scheduled
votes today on a version of the Green
New Deal. I was proud to be a cospon-
sor of that.
I want to make sure that nobody be-
lieves what is happening today on this
floor is part of a serious debate. The
fact is, it is a sham debate about the
growing and urgent problem of climate
change.
The Green New Deal is all about of-
fering a mission statement—a state-
ment of direction on the urgency of cli-
mate change. It is about recognizing
the staggering threat and encouraging
everybody to come forward to bring up
good ways to tackle it. As the ranking
Democrat on the Finance Committee, I
will outline just one of them this after-
noon. It is not a bill; it is a resolution.
That is why it is a head-scratcher to
hear all these far-fetched attacks on
the Green New Deal in the media and
here on this floor.
Let’s be clear about what this resolu-
tion, the Green New Deal, says. Nobody
is out there banning cheeseburgers. If
you want to eat an ice cream sandwich
and wash it down with a milkshake,
nobody is going to be taking that milk-
shake out of your hands, either. I don’t
know what this anti-food legislation is
that I keep hearing opponents talk
about, but it certainly isn’t the Green
New Deal. I will tell you that my son,
William Peter Wyden, age 11, is specifi-
cally going to make sure that his papa
doesn’t sign on to something like that.
There is no building trains to Hawaii.
Nobody is banning airplanes, and no-
body is trying to take people’s cars.
The Green New Deal is about bringing
good ideas to bear in the fight against
climate change. That is what the
American people are demanding action
on.
I will tell you that this issue comes
up at every townhall meeting I hold.
Just over the last week, I was in rural
counties where Donald Trump won by
an enormous percentage, and people
understood what climate change was
all about because of the wildfires we
had.
These are not your grandfather’s
wildfires; these are infernos. We have
had them leap the Columbia River.
They are more powerful. They are more
dangerous. Fire season isn’t for just a
couple of months in the summer; it is
almost year-round. In my home State,
we have had to get used to what
amounts to the idea of clean air refu-
gees when fires burn near populated
areas. This is where folks—particularly
folks who are of modest income—have
literally nowhere to go and can’t go
outside. Anybody who hasn’t been to
the Columbia River Gorge should know
that when a fire leaps the Columbia
River, you are talking about something
very different. Rivers have historically
blocked the spread of wildfires but not
anymore. Last year, dozens of people
were killed and more than 10,000 struc-
tures destroyed by the Camp Fire, the
most destructive fire in California his-
tory. These infernos are happening
across the West—Washington, Nevada,
Colorado, Montana, and elsewhere.
Climate change isn’t just about fires;
it drives extreme temperatures in both
directions. Extreme cold is a danger to
millions of people during the winter.
Warmer temperatures in spring and
summer bring more rain and more
floods to so much of the country. Else-
where, especially in the West, the
threat of drought looms continuously.
The hurricanes battering the east coast
and the Gulf of Mexico are inten-
sifying. It seems as if every week, an-
other group of prominent scientists
warns about mass-extinction events,
ecological failures, and runaway tem-
perature increases.
There are great economic impacts as
a result of all this. When Americans
face a future of extreme temperatures,
bigger storms, and hotter fires, it will
mean that it will cost more money to
rebuild the city that has been flooded
by a hurricane or burned in an inferno.
We are going to see increases in insur-
ance premiums when weather-related
damage becomes more common. If you
really want to know how serious this
problem is, look at these private insur-
ance premiums. The market is telling
us how serious this problem is. It re-
quires more energy to heat and cool
homes and workplaces in extreme tem-
peratures.
I want to make one last point be-
cause I think there is a little bit of
confusion about the direction the Sen-
ate ought to go.
I had mentioned that the Green New
Deal is really a mission statement, a
resolution, a sense of urgency that we
ought to be all about. I want to con-
trast that with the original new deal,
which was actual legislation, some-
thing like 15 bills—certainly, more
than a dozen major ones. My sense is
that this is what Congress is going to
have to do in the years ahead with re-
spect to climate. Let me give an exam-
ple.
We have talked about the mission of
the resolution, where we would like to
go. Here is an example of what we
ought to work together on with respect
to legislation. As the senior Democrat
on the Senate Finance Committee, I
pointed out that there were more than
40 separate tax breaks for energy on
the Federal tax books—40 separate tax
breaks for energy. In fact, the Tax
Code, as it relates to energy, is essen-
tially anchored in dirty energy tax rel-
ics of yesteryear.
Given the fact that taxpayers now
write out big annual checks to the
dirtiest energy companies, what I have

proposed is that we replace that. You
can’t stand up to climate change as
long as you are ladling out all of those
tax subsidies to dirty energy. What I
have proposed is to take those 40-plus
energy tax breaks and just basically
throw them in the trash can—in effect,
throw them into the trash can that is
right next to our desks. For those 40
energy tax breaks that are dispropor-
tionately for dirty energy, we would
then substitute three new ones—one
for clean energy, one for clean trans-
portation fuel, and one for energy effi-
ciency.
I would like to think that the Demo-
crats and Republicans who are playing
off this idea are going to be able to say:
Hey, we can find common ground on
this because for companies all across
the country, when they buy new pieces
of equipment for their companies, they
will invariably make sure they will be
cleaner and more energy efficient than
what will have been on their factory
floors. So they would qualify for two
out of the three new energy incentives
I am talking about. That is something
we could have a real debate about.
That is not a sham debate. That is a
real debate.
Yesterday, Senator ALEXANDER, our
Republican colleague from the Pre-
siding Officer’s State, said he believed
climate change was real. He said he be-
lieved it was caused by man, and he
called for a new Manhattan Project for
Clean Energy. I heard it. It sounded
like he had plenty of ideas that could
make for a real debate between Demo-
crats and Republicans. Senator ALEX-
ANDER sits right over there, not far
from our colleague from Iowa, Senator
ERNST. He was talking about real ideas
after acknowledging that climate
change was a problem and that man
contributed to it.
I hope some of my colleagues on the
other side will follow Senator ALEX-
ANDER’s lead. This is a debate the Sen-
ate ought to have. It ought to have a
debate about what Senator ALEXANDER
was talking about. We ought to have a
debate about throwing the 40 separate
tax breaks for energy into the garbage
and substituting for them three new
ones that reflect our most current
challenges. That is the way the Senate
is supposed to function: You recognize
a problem; you come forward with
ideas in a serious debate; and you try
to build common ground.
I see my colleague from Iowa is here.
I am interested in working with her,
and we have worked together on other
issues. I am interested in working with
all of my colleagues as I have with re-
spect to this question of making the
Tax Code neutral regarding energy
sources. We are not doing that today.
What we are doing is playing a polit-
ical game.
I say to my colleagues that nobody
ought to take part in this political
game. You don’t play political games
when the consequences for the Amer-
ican people are so serious. Instead, you
have a serious debate about what to do
about the serious problem. That is not
what is going on today.
I close by saying that years into the
future, our children and our grand-
children are going to deal with the con-
sequences of inaction, and they are
going to look at something like this so-
called debate—because I call it a sham
debate—and they are going to be
angry. The American people deserve a
lot better than this kind of fake debate
that is being held on the Senate floor
right now.
I want to make it clear: As the senior
Democrat on the Senate Finance Com-
mittee, I am very interested in work-
ing with my colleagues on real and bi-
partisan approaches to deal with this
staggering challenge. That is not what
we are having today, and our country
is going to regret it.
I yield the floor.

FLOODING IN IOWA
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I rise
to speak about the flooding that has
devastated wide swaths of the Midwest
in recent weeks.
A harsh winter, combined with un-
seasonably warm weather and heavy
rains, created conditions that over-
whelmed much of our flood mitigation
infrastructure up and down the Mis-
souri River and its tributaries. In Iowa
alone, the flooding has caused an esti-
mated $1.6 billion in damages. Thou-
sands of homes have been damaged or
destroyed, and nearly 250 miles of lev-
ees will need to be repaired or rebuilt.
Thousands of acres of farmland have
been impacted, with there being losses
to the ag sector in excess of $200 mil-
lion. Fremont County, which is our fur-
thest southwest county in the State of
Iowa, has lost $7 million worth of
grain.
I spent much of last week on the
ground in Iowa, visiting hard-hit areas
of the State and meeting with local,
State, and Federal officials. In my
years as a member of the Iowa Na-
tional Guard, I was on the frontlines of
several of our major flood events, in-
cluding the 2008 Cedar Rapids flood and
the 2011 Missouri River flood. I can tell
you that what I witnessed in this flood
event was the worst flooding and de-
struction that I have ever witnessed.
The devastation is simply incompre-
hensible, with the most severe damage
being concentrated in Iowa’s western
most counties.
I have spent most of my life in south-
west Iowa. So this hits particularly
close to home for me. When I toured
the affected communities last week
and this past Sunday, the folks I met
with were not just Iowans and not just
constituents. Many of them were
friends whom I have known for a very
long time. In this part of the State,
down there in southwest Iowa, I am
just as likely to be called ‘‘Joni’’ as I
am ‘‘Senator Ernst.’’ It was heart-
breaking to see what these folks have
gone through. Again, they are not just
constituents. These people are family
and friends to me.
It will take a lot of hard work and
determination to get our communities
back up on their feet. But do you know
what, folks? Iowans are a resilient peo-
ple, and I know they are up to the task.
Since the first signs of trouble over a
week ago, our State and local emer-
gency response teams have been work-
ing together seamlessly, around the
clock, to keep our Iowans safe.
I credit Governor Reynolds and her
office for quickly gathering damage as-
sessments from all around the State in
order to make a strong case to the
President that a Federal disaster dec-
laration was warranted. I also thank
President Trump for recognizing the
gravity of the situation on the ground
in Iowa and for swiftly approving our
request. Nearly 60 of Iowa’s counties
will now have access to much needed
Federal assistance.
In the near term, our focus is on re-
covery efforts, and I will do everything
in my power to make sure Iowans have
every bit of the help they need. We
need to get our farms and small busi-
nesses back up and running as soon as
possible so Iowans can do what they do
best, and that is to work hard and take
care of their families.
As we move forward, I intend to re-
view the Army Corps of Engineers’
policies and closely examine how they
were applied throughout this flood
event. It is important that we study
and learn from events like this so that
we can try to prevent these types of
devastating events from happening
again in our future.
Once again, I want to say what a
heartbreaking and devastating event
this has been for so many of our Iowa
counties, our Iowa families, and our
Iowa businesses. My thoughts and
prayers are with each one of them as
we move through this event.
God bless you all.
Of course, God bless our great State
of Iowa and our great United States.
We are there for you. We are there
with you.
I yield the floor.

ator from Massachusetts.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I
rise to discuss climate change, which is
a great crisis currently facing our
country and our planet.
Let me start with a statement that is
sometimes controversial in this Cham-
ber: I believe in science.
Here are three simple scientific facts:
Climate change is real; it is caused by
humans; and we are running out of
time to fix our troubles.
Here are three more scientific facts:
The ocean and the air are getting hot-
ter; storms are getting stronger; and
flooding is getting worse.
These facts are widely accepted
throughout the world, but the Presi-
dent and Senate Republicans refuse to
acknowledge these basic truths. To-
gether, they routinely dismiss the im-
pacts of climate change and deny the
clear evidence that we must take ac-
tion. They refuse even to say the words

S1968 March 26, 2019
‘‘climate change.’’ That is not leader-
ship.
Here is the thing about the facts: Re-
fusing to believe them doesn’t mean
that they will go away. While a small
handful—a tiny minority—of my col-
leagues across the aisle acknowledge
that maybe climate change is real,
they say that actually doing anything
about it would just be too expensive,
that the problem is too big to solve,
and that we should just give up now—
close our eyes and plug our ears again.
Yet ignoring our problems has a
much bigger price tag than the com-
monsense solutions we should already
be pursuing. Our coasts are threatened
by ever-stronger storms that can de-
stroy our homes and devastate our
largest cities. Our food supplies and
forests are threatened by an endless
barrage of droughts and wildfires. Even
our naval bases are under attack, not
by enemy fleets but by rising sea lev-
els.
To my Republican colleagues, I say
that our biggest problems have to be
our top priorities. Instead of protecting
big fossil fuel companies that continue
to guzzle the polluting fuels of the
past, we need bold vision and forward-
looking leadership. I support a green
new deal that will aggressively tackle
climate change, income inequality, and
racial injustice. I thank my colleague
and my friend and good partner, Sen-
ator MARKEY, for leading the fight on
this issue.
This is not the first time America
has faced a so-called impossible chal-
lenge. Over half a century ago, Presi-
dent Kennedy said: ‘‘No nation which
expects to be the leader of other na-
tions can expect to stay behind in this
race for space.’’ He added that ‘‘we
mean to lead it.’’
President Kennedy challenged our
Nation to lead the space race, and less
than 7 years later Neil Armstrong set
foot on the moon. The impossible had
become a reality, and America had led
the way.
It is time not only to challenge our
country to tackle climate change head-
on but also to lead the world in doing
so. If we do not lead, then others will.
China and other countries will win the
race to define the green economy of the
future, and we will lose those jobs for-
ever.
I don’t accept the Republicans’ argu-
ment that boldly addressing climate
change and having the world’s strong-
est economy are somehow incompat-
ible. The exact opposite is true. Tack-
ling our climate challenges will pro-
vide us with the opportunity to grow
our economy and to protect public
health. We can propel the United
States to become the world leader in
green innovation in the 21st century.
We can address climate change and
strengthen our economy by making
major upgrades to our crumbling infra-
structure, by building more resiliency
along our coasts and rivers, by con-
structing more renewable energy, and
by promoting policies that will spur
new innovative research. These invest-
ments will protect our planet and will
create good jobs with living wages,
strong benefits, and safe working con-
ditions.
It is time for new ideas, not old ide-
ology. It is time for innovative re-
search, not tired rhetoric. It is time for
groundbreaking science, not political
stunts. It is time to roll up our sleeves
and get to work on climate solutions
because this crisis is upon us, and it is
time to act.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S.J. RES. 9
Mr. CARPER. Thanks very much.
Madam President, I rise again today
to speak on an upcoming vote later on
the majority leader’s Green New Deal
resolution.
To my colleagues, I would just say
that I think we have a serious choice
to make. Either we can acknowledge
the climate crisis that our planet faces
and confront it head-on, or we can turn
our backs to it and walk away. I think
the clock is ticking, and we need to not
walk away.
While it is clear that a majority of
Americans are calling on Congress to
work together to address climate
change, a number of our Republican
colleagues—not all—have chosen to de-
vote their time to deriding the Green
New Deal instead of acknowledging the
800-pound gorilla in the room and
crafting an action plan to do some-
thing about it while we still have time.
Madam President, I will ask unani-
mous consent to offer a very simple
resolution here in a few minutes. I
think my friend from Wisconsin is
probably here to reserve the right to
object to that, which is his right.
It is a pretty simple resolution.
There are three parts to it. The first
part of the resolution that I will be of-
fering is that climate change is real.
The second part of the resolution is
that we as human beings have a lot to
do with this problem. The last part of
it is that we ought to do something
about it. ‘‘We’’ includes the U.S. Con-
gress.
I have been asked a fair amount
today: Well, what should we do about
it? What should we do about it?
If you look at the Green New Deal,
the first part of the Green New Deal—
especially the findings—gives a pretty
good roadmap that I think we ought to
seriously consider. I would just suggest
that some items that have come up be-
fore the Environment and Public
Works Committee in recent weeks and
months—hearings that we held—could
also help us figure out what the Con-
gress might want to do about it.
If you think climate change is real—
and I do, and I think most of us do. It
is becoming a more urgent matter, not
a less urgent matter. What are some of
the things we can do? I will mention a
few.
I think most people believe that car-
bon dioxide contributes to climate
change, and that is true. With respect
to climate change, there are other pol-
lutants that are a lot worse than car-
bon. I want to mention a couple of
them.
One of them is black carbon. Where
does black carbon come from? It comes
from diesel engines—think of trucks,
cars, locomotives, trains, and boats. If
you have ever been at a traffic inter-
section and have seen those big diesel
trucks that pull away from the traffic
intersection and the huge plumes of
black smoke that appear as they pull
off, they include black carbon. Black
carbon is more than 100 times more
dangerous than regular carbon dioxide
in terms of its climate potential.
We have American-made technology
that can be used on diesel engines—all
diesel engines; there are millions of
them—to reduce those emissions by 90
percent.
We have a program called the Diesel
Emissions Reduction Act, which helps
to fund and make monies available for
States and local governments and pri-
vate businesses to reduce their diesel
emissions, especially black carbon.
That is one.
Two, think about our National High-
way System in this country. Through
most of our National Highway System,
we don’t provide charging stations for
electric vehicles that have batteries.
We don’t have fueling stations for vehi-
cles that are powered by hydrogen in
conjunction with fuel cells that create
movement for all kinds of vehicles.
We need to put money into tax cred-
its and grants for fueling stations for
hydrogen and charging stations for
electricity. We have an electric vehicle
credit that has expired or is about to
expire. It needs to be extended so that
when people in this country are think-
ing about buying a vehicle, they will
consider buying an electric vehicle,
which doesn’t put out any carbon diox-
ide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, or CO2.
Another thing we could do is provide
an investment tax credit, which SUSAN
COLLINS and I have proposed doing for
some time, where, for the first 3,000
megawatts of offshore wind that is de-
ployed, the business gets a 30-percent
investment tax credit. That is one
thing we can do.
The chairman of our Environment
and Public Works Committee is here.
He and I believe another good idea—
and we are joined in this by Repub-
licans and Democrats—is to develop
technology, which we think is very
promising, that would literally pull

carbon out of the air—not out of a
smokestack but literally out of the
air—and turn it into something more
useful. That is something we can do.
We had a hearing on legislation
called the Nuclear Energy Innovation
Capabilities Act, the NEIC. Part of
what we want to do is, instead of run-
ning nuclear powerplants and ending
up with a whole lot of spent fuel, we
want to have technology where, when
the heat is so high, those nuclear
plants would use most of the spent
fuel. Instead of having it stacked up
around the country, we use it up and
we create electricity from it.
Two more things, and I am done.
There are HFCs, hydrofluorocarbons,
which replaced CFCs. CFCs put a hole
in the ozone. They are a coolant. They
are a refrigerant. CFCs put a hole in
the ozone. They were replaced by
HFCs. HFCs didn’t put a hole in the
ozone. They are better for the ozone
layer but not good for climate change.
Now we have a follow-on product, a
successor to HFCs. They are good for
the ozone layer and good for climate
change. We ought to make sure that we
pass a treaty here in this body so we
can actually use that technology.
Finally, the last thing we can do is
provide for our auto industry. It is
something they are asking for.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time is expired.
Mr. CARPER. I ask for 30 more sec-
onds, please, Madam President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. CARPER. Thank you.
The last thing we can do is—the auto
industry has been saying, with respect
to fuel efficiency standards, CAFE and
so forth, that we ought to give them
some near-term flexibility in terms of
meeting more efficient fuel require-
ments, more efficient mileage require-
ments, and more stringent require-
ments going forward in the future.
That is what they are asking for to
provide certainty. It is a 50-State deal.
California is at the table. We ought to
do that.
Those are just a couple of things we
can do in Congress to actually address
this, and we ought to do them. While
we successfully help do good things for
our planet, we are also going to create
jobs and economic opportunity.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.
Mr. CARPER. I think that is some-
thing the chairman of our committee
and I might just agree on.
Thank you, Madam President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware.
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee
be discharged from further consider-
ation of S.J. Res. 9 and that the resolu-
tion be read a third time and passed
and the motion to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with
no intervening action or debate.
This resolution says that climate
change is real; that as people on this
planet, we have something to do with
it; and three, that Congress is part of
the solution.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. CARPER. That is my resolution.
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from my Wyoming.
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President.

ator from Wyoming.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Madam
President.
Madam President, many Democrats
have called climate change the great-
est challenge of our time.
House Representative OCASIO-CORTEZ
is the Green New Deal’s lead sponsor.
She calls climate change ‘‘our World
War II.’’ She said: ‘‘The world is going
to end in 12 years if we don’t address
climate change.’’ Senator SCHUMER
said that climate change is ‘‘an exis-
tential threat.’’
When the Green New Deal was intro-
duced just last month, Democrats lined
up to support it, to cosponsor it, and to
agree with it. Senator MARKEY of Mas-
sachusetts called it ‘‘the kind of gener-
ational commitment that we need to
transform our economy and our democ-
racy.’’ Every Democratic Senator run-
ning for President of the United States
is a cosponsor—every single one.
When Leader MCCONNELL called for a
vote on the Green New Deal, Senator
SCHUMER said: ‘‘Go for it. Bring it on.’’
He said it right here on the floor of the
U.S. Senate. Presidential candidate
Senator AMY KLOBUCHAR of Minnesota
agreed, saying that she will vote yes.
That is how she said she will vote—will
vote yes. We will see what she does
today.
Well, today, the Senate will vote on
the Green New Deal. All Senators will
have a chance to go on the record, a
chance to show whether they support
this radical approach. But rather than
voting for the Green New Deal that
they introduced and cosponsored, it
sounds like some Democrats are trying
to run away from a vote on something
they previously embraced.
If so many Democratic Party leaders
support the Green New Deal, why
aren’t they willing to vote for it and
stand up behind it today? The answer is
obvious: The Democrats are ducking
the vote. But why? The answer is pret-
ty simple: The Green New Deal is
unaffordable, it is unworkable, and it is
unpopular.
When you add up all of the costs and
the 10-year price tag of $93 trillion,
that is enough to bankrupt America.
The cost is astronomical. It would hit
every American really hard—about
$65,000 per family per year. That would
empty just about every bank account
in America. I believe it would drive a
stake right through the heart of our
strong and healthy and growing econ-
omy. The Green New Deal would mas-
sively increase the role of government
in our lives and the size of government,
the expense of government.
Let’s be honest. The climate is
changing. It continues to change. It re-
quires a serious response—a serious re-
sponse. The Green New Deal is not that
response.
This plan would eliminate fossil
fuels. It would require 100 percent re-
newable energy, carbon-free energy, in
just 10 years. The goal is to meet all of
our energy demands in the United
States through ‘‘clean, renewable and
zero-emission energy sources.’’ We need
more renewable energy, but the goal of
going from where we are to where they
want to be is absolutely impossible in
the period of time outlined.
Robert Blohm from the North Amer-
ican Electric Reliability Corporation
wrote in the Wall Street Journal: ‘‘An
all-renewable power grid is destined to
collapse.’’
America can’t tolerate a collapsed
power grid. Plus, it wouldn’t solve the
problem. Turning off America’s econ-
omy will not lower global emissions.
America is leading the way in reducing
emissions—reducing emissions.
Since 2007, U.S. energy emissions
have fallen by 14 percent, while global
emissions continue to rise. In 2017 the
United States produced just 13 percent
of global emissions and China and India
together produced over 33 percent. So
emissions are going to continue to
climb until these countries take ac-
tion. Emissions in the United States
continue to decline.
Shutting down our energy would also
harm American workers. That is why
major labor unions oppose the Green
New Deal. The AFL–CIO labor union,
which represents 12.5 million workers,
says: ‘‘We will not accept proposals
that could cause immediate harm to
millions of our members and their fam-
ilies.’’ I agree.
Even former President Obama’s En-
ergy Secretary, Ernie Moniz, called the
Green New Deal impractical. He said it
would hurt American progress in re-
ducing emissions. That progress came
from innovation, not from massive gov-
ernment taxation and regulation.
Congress must continue to support
technologies like nuclear power and
carbon capture utilization—things that
we know make a difference—and we
have done this in a bipartisan way in
these areas. I want to continue to work
with Democrats to find real solutions.
We have passed legislation in a bipar-
tisan way for advanced nuclear power-
plants, for carbon capture and seques-
tration, and for using the carbon in
productive ways, whether it is for
medication or whether it is for con-
struction products.
The Green New Deal is not the solu-
tion for America. It is a big green bomb
that will blow a hole in our strong,
healthy, and growing economy. That is
exactly why Democrats aren’t voting
for it. That is exactly why Democrats

are ducking and dodging and
distancing themselves from this so-
called Green New Deal, because it is a
radical plan, and it is exactly why
Democrats are running away—running
away—from the Green New Deal. I
think we are going to see it today—
running away as fast as they can.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
would my friend from Wyoming, who
mentioned my name, yield for a ques-
tion or three?
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
know the vote is scheduled at 4 o’clock.
I am happy to answer a question.
Mr. SCHUMER. My friend from Wyo-
ming said I said: ‘‘Bring on the vote on
the Green New Deal.’’ I did, not be-
cause I think it is a smart thing to
do—it is a stunt—but it will finally get
us to talk about climate change, some-
thing the other side has not done.
I would ask my colleague three ques-
tions. I was gratified to see Leader
MCCONNELL answer them for the first
time in his press conference. Does the
Senator from Wyoming believe climate
change is real? Does he believe it is
caused by human activity? And does he
believe Congress ought to do something
about it? Those are my three ques-
tions. I hope I can get a direct answer,
since my name was invoked.
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President,
as a matter of fact, I would say to my
friend, the Senator from New York,
that he asked me those three identical
questions on this floor about 2 or 3
weeks ago, and my answer today is the
same as it was then. You are welcome
to go back to the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD. I recommended this to the
Senator from New York, and I bet I
wrote in the New York Times in De-
cember that said: Yes, I do believe that
climate change is real, and, yes, I be-
lieve that humans contribute to it,
and, yes, I believe we have a responsi-
bility to do something about it.
I highlighted the role of innovation,
not taxation or regulation, in coming
to those solutions. I highlighted legis-
lation that has passed the Senate Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee
and was even signed into law by the
President, something called the FU-
TURE Act, which works on capturing
carbon dioxide and using it produc-
tively. We talked about a bill called
the USE IT Act, which is now coming
through the committee. We are work-
ing on it. It has bipartisan support, and
it passed last session. It didn’t get all
the way to a signature. We talked
about the future of nuclear power and
the advanced nuclear powerplants that
are being done, and we paved the way
for the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion to do things because nuclear
power has zero emissions.
These are bipartisan pieces of legisla-
tion, passed with overwhelming sup-
port by the Senate and the House and
signed by the President. These areas
with carbon capture and nuclear power
works are things that actually Presi-
dent Obama’s Secretary of Energy,
Ernie Moniz, testified to the Senate
Energy Committee are the two things
that actually can work at scale. Any-
thing else that the United States, I will
tell you, does unilaterally, will not
contribute to a solution because emis-
sions from the United States are only
13 percent of all the emissions in the
world.
I would once again recommend to the
Senator from New York an op-ed that I
had written about dealing with climate
change through innovation, not regula-
tion or taxation, and I hope, in that
way, that I have answered the Sen-
ator’s three questions.
I would say to the Senator from New
York that if he is actually serious
about discussing climate change on the
floor of the Senate and looking for so-
lutions, then, what he ought to do
today is instruct his Members—and I
believe he may have instructed them to
vote present—to vote to get on the bill,
to get on this to discuss it and to de-
bate it. But it doesn’t sound like even
the cosponsors are willing to stand up
and vote for something they have co-
sponsored. A dozen of them have done
it.
Three of them were leading a rally
outside the steps of the Capitol within
the last couple of hours, with one Sen-
ator chanting: What about the Green
New Deal and having a vote on it?
When do we want it? And the crowd
was chanting: Now.
It will be instructive to see how
those Senators—and one of these was a
candidate for President—vote when
their name is called as the roll is called
here on today’s vote on the Green New
Deal.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 97
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
first, I thank my colleague from Wyo-
ming. Now he knows why I said: ‘‘Bring
it on.’’ We are finally getting even peo-
ple like the Senator from Wyoming to
admit that climate change is real, that
it is caused by human activity, and
that we should do something about it.
If we could have an open debate on
climate change, that would be great.
That is not what is happening today.
The Senator from Wyoming talked
about the contradiction of the Senator
outside. How about the contradictions
of the Republican Party and the Sen-
ators here putting a bill on the floor
that they are going to vote no on.
Let’s put the bill that the Senator
from Wyoming asked for and let there
be an open amendment process and
let’s see where people fall. All we are
asking for is not a sham vote where
people who put the bill on the floor are
voting no because they don’t want to
have a debate, but rather a real discus-
sion, a real debate, and real
amendments.
I would say this. Earlier today, even
better than having the Senator from
Wyoming finally admit that climate
change is real and caused by human ac-
tivity, the Republican leader did, when
asked by the press at his gathering.
The whole plan of the Republican
leader here is backfiring.
We want a discussion on climate. We
haven’t had one major bill on the real
issues of climate come to the floor led
by the leader where we can have open
debate—not one. So now we are finally
beginning to debate. That is great. We
are not going to stand for sham bills
that the other side is all voting no on.
They know what a trick and joke and
sham that is. So do all the American
people. We are finally talking about
the issue, and that is great. Climate
change is not a joke. It is not a hoax.
It is a crisis. That is why we are doing
these things.
So right now, here is something else
we could do. Let’s see where our Re-
publican colleagues are if they want to
have a real debate. I am calling for the
creation of a Senate select committee
on climate change. It is a crisis. Ask
the farmers in Iowa, Nebraska, and
Kansas if they think it is a crisis. Ask
the people who have been subjected to
so many changes in the weather be-
cause the globe is heating up. They be-
lieve it is a crisis. The very least we
can do is to do what the House did and
set up a select committee on climate
change that is bipartisan. The com-
mittee can be partnering with the
House committee. We might actually
get something done, not sham votes
that everyone knows are a joke—a po-
litical joke.
I am hopeful that we can do that.
The reason for the select committee is
clear. If there ever were an issue that
demanded focus from this Chamber,
this is it. Climate change is an existen-
tial threat to our country and our plan-
et. The last 4 years have been the
warmest on record. Sea levels are ris-
ing and marine life and fishing commu-
nities are being destroyed. Record
flooding is inundating parts of the
country, most recently the Midwest,
and more and more powerful hurri-
canes have buffeted our coasts. Over
the next decade, climate change will
continue to negatively impact every
part of American life, our health, our
economy, our national security, and
even our geography, and the threats
will only grow.
We can’t run into our ideological cor-
ners anymore. I am gratified to hear a
growing number of Republicans admit
it is real, admit it is caused by human
activity, and that we should do some-
thing about it. That is great news, but
let’s do something real. Let’s do some-
thing real.
The Senator mentioned a few bills. I
would be happy to look at them. I hope
he will look at ours, and I hope he will
ask his leader, the Republican leader,
to allow an open debate on the floor
with amendments. We would welcome
that. We would welcome it. Some in
the oil and gas industry will not like
it. That is for sure. Some in the coal
industry will not like it. That is for
sure. But most Americans will.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1971
March 26, 2019
So let’s do it. The time for partisan-
ship on this issue is long over. The
time for one party to block any change
and not offer anything that they be-
lieve in is over. We need to act quickly
and boldly to confront this challenge
before it is too late. It is time to stop
the nonsense.
As I said, we welcome this debate be-
cause we are talking about climate
change for the first time, and the hy-
pocrisy of putting a bill on the floor
and then voting against it is becoming
so clear to the American people. But,
as a byproduct, we are getting a debate
and we are getting some of our col-
leagues for the first time to admit that
climate change is real and caused by
human activity and that we ought to
do something about it. We welcome it.
This committee will help bring the
kind of bipartisan discussion that my
good friend from Wyoming has asked
for. So let’s do it.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent that the Rules Committee be
discharged from further consideration
of S. Res. 97, a resolution establishing
the Select Committee on the Climate
Crisis and the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration; that the resolu-
tion be agreed to; and that the motion
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table with no intervening
action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Wyoming is recog-
nized.
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President,
reserving the right to object, I would
like to point out to my friend and col-
league that the statement I had made
earlier about my belief goes back a
long time—that the climate is chang-
ing—to the point that one of his col-
leagues, Jeff Bingaman, a Senator from
New Mexico, chaired the Energy Com-
mittee when he and I cosponsored leg-
islation dealing with carbon and car-
bon capture and putting together an
XPRIZE-type program. This is some-
thing I have long spoken about and un-
derstand.
I also hear the Senator from New
York essentially trying to strip the
EPW Committee of the jurisdiction we
have over climate change. That is the
wrong approach when we have made
real progress working together not just
on bills but on bills signed into law
that are making a difference today.
This resolution the minority leader
just introduced is an attempt by the
Democrats to once again duck and
dodge and distance themselves from
the Green New Deal vote this after-
noon. The Democrats seem to think
that adding a layer of bureaucracy is
an answer to every problem. That is
the same instinct that gave us the
Green New Deal. That climate is
changing and humans play a role in the
changing climate, there is no question
in my mind about that.
I am going to continue to work close-
ly with the ranking member of the
committee, Senator CARPER from Dela-
ware, to pass meaningful legislation to
promote nuclear power, carbon capture
technologies, and to reduce emissions.
So Democrats can’t hide from the
fact that every Democratic Senator
running for President has cosponsored
the Green New Deal.
Here we are today, and I will just
state that we have been passing bipar-
tisan legislation. The Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee recently
held a hearing on climate change. We
do not need another committee. We
don’t need the Green New Deal; we
need real solutions. For this reason, I
object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator
yield for a question?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time
has expired.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that we be
given 2 minutes so that the Senator
from Rhode Island can ask a question
of the Senator from Wyoming.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I appreciate the
comments of my distinguished chair-
man on the Environmental Works
Committee about carbon capture tech-
nology, and I am wondering what part
of the carbon emissions problem he
thinks carbon capture will solve, be-
cause leaders of the carbon capture
technology sector have said it is their
vision to capture 1 percent—1 percent—
of carbon emissions.
What I conclude from that is that
carbon capture technology is impor-
tant, but to rely on it at the expense of
the course of action that we really
need is profoundly misguided.
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
know that time has expired.
We had a hearing in the last couple of
weeks. We had an expert in the specific
area of carbon capture come to show
how much more effective the tech-
nology has become. This is something I
started working on 10 years ago. It is
something researchers around the
world are committed to because we are
finding value in that carbon to create
products that can be used either medi-
cally or for construction. The Univer-
sity of Wyoming has an integrated test
center right next to a coal-fired power-
plant, and the technology is there to
take the carbon dioxide right from the
stack and use it, some for enhanced oil
recovery, some for production. They
are continuing to work on the science
of all of this.
Certainly, there are the climate
alarmists who are out there, and it
does seem that what they want to do is
act immediately, drastically, and uni-
laterally in ways that will not solve
the problem. It will hurt our country.
It will hurt our economy. It will move
the lifeblood of the U.S. economy to
foreign countries, and I will do every-
thing I can to make sure that doesn’t
happen.
Thank you. I know the time has ex-
pired.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am interested
in the other 99 percent.

FLOODING IN NEBRASKA
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise
to speak to the historic flooding that
has devastated hundreds of commu-
nities throughout my home State of
Nebraska.
After a long, cold, and snow-filled
winter, the catastrophic storm known
as a bomb cyclone struck Western Ne-
braska with extreme blizzard condi-
tions, while the central and eastern
portions of the State were ravaged by
record-setting floods. What were small
streams became raging rivers, pouring
over the banks, and breaching levees to
flood towns and farmland.
The floods, which carried car-sized
blocks of ice in some areas, isolated en-
tire communities and deposited sand,
mud, and debris over large areas of our
land.
Homes have been destroyed, roads
and bridges ripped apart, businesses
and schools forced to close for an un-
certain period of time. It is with a
heavy heart that I say that three Ne-
braskans have lost their lives as a re-
sult of this storm: James Wilke, a
farmer from Columbus; Aleido Rojas
Galan of Norfolk; and Betty Hamernik
of Columbus. I send my sincere condo-
lences to their families. Their loved
ones will not be forgotten.
Cities like Fremont and farms across
the State became islands, leaving peo-
ple and livestock stranded. The bomb
cyclone has demolished thousands of
acres of family farmland and ranch-
land, resulting in a devastating number
of livestock deaths and demolished
farms, grain bins, hay supply, and farm
equipment.
One farmer recorded that he lost 700
of his hogs after 7 feet of floodwater
swept through his land within minutes.
A top concern for our ag producers is
how do we replace ruined feed and the
countless miles of washed-out fences.
The Nebraska Department of Agri-
culture initially projects that the dam-
ages will total a loss of $440 million in
crop losses and another $400 million in
cattle losses. The devastation con-
tinues to grow as our farmers and
ranchers across Nebraska assess lost
land use and more livestock deaths.
I heard from ranchers in Central and
Western Nebraska who fought through
this blizzard during calving, and what I
heard most was that even though they
suffered losses, they knew of others
who were worse off.
Farmers stood looking at once fertile
land now covered with sand, mud, and
unimaginably huge slabs and chunks of
ice. They are worried what the future
will bring.
I agree with Gov. Pete Ricketts, as
he has called this catastrophic weather
‘‘the most widespread disaster we have
had in our state’s history.’’
Water from the Missouri River and
Papio Creek has overwhelmed the
southeastern side of Offutt Air Force
Base and rendered some parts of the
base as inoperable. I welcomed Sec-
retary of the Air Force Heather Wilson
to survey the flood damage at the base.
Some buildings were filled with nearly
8 feet of water. Offutt leadership pro-
vided us with a preliminary damage as-
sessment and discussed the response ef-
forts that were successfully taken by
the airmen.
At the flood’s peak levels, one-third
of the base was affected, causing tens
of millions of dollars in damages. I will
continue to work closely with Sec-
retary Wilson to ensure that Offutt re-
ceives the funding to meet the needs of
the base and to restore one of Amer-
ica’s most important national security
assets.
According to the Nebraska Emer-
gency Management Agency, 81 of our 93
counties, 98 cities, and 5 Tribes have
declared states of emergency. This cov-
ers over 59,000 square miles, which is
about 76 percent of Nebraska.
To put this in perspective, well over
1.7 million Nebraskans are affected by
this storm. That is more than 95 per-
cent of our State’s population.
The Governor has estimated that
more than 2,000 homes and 340 busi-
nesses are damaged or destroyed. Sig-
nificant damage to Nebraska’s critical
infrastructure is still being assessed at
this time, but the Nebraska Depart-
ment of Transportation released a pre-
liminary estimate of $200 million that
is needed to reconstruct hundreds of
miles of roads and to repair or replace
15 bridges throughout the State.
Nebraska is hurting. However, as our
Nation has seen the sheer power of this
storm, I want America to understand
the courage, strength, and resiliency
Nebraskans have shown in response.
Overwhelming loss and grief have been
met with stories of bravery and heroic
efforts of our neighbors and first re-
sponders. Ordinary Nebraskans, with-
out any prior training, grabbed their
personal boats, jet skis, trucks, and
planes to save their neighbors who ex-
perienced life-threatening situations.
There have been countless stories of
heroes who disregarded personal risk to
help their neighbors in need—Nebras-
kans helping Nebraskans, neighbors
helping neighbors.
Hundreds of volunteers in Fremont
stepped forward to fill sandbags and
create barriers to protect the city from
floodwater. Local pilots in affected cit-
ies across Nebraska have flown their
personal planes to deliver and evacuate
people who have been surrounded by
water.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1973
March 26, 2019
In Boyd County, firefighters contin-
ued to stay on the job and rescue those
in need, even after their own homes
were flooded.
In the Nebraska Panhandle, one
State patrol officer even scaled a
barbed-wire fence to rescue a calf that
was frozen to the ground.
Last week, a staff sergeant with the
Nebraska Guard was helping lead res-
cue efforts in Fremont, where the town
was left without fresh food and water
for 2 days because of the surrounding
floodwater. She said:
As we approached the town, I saw people
coming out of their houses, standing on
street corners, waving and clasping their
hands in joy. . . . As we began carrying bot-
tled water into the store, an elderly lady,
who had been waiting for hours hugged me
and was overcome with emotion. . . . She
was so thankful and relieved knowing that
even in difficult and trying times, there are
Nebraskans doing things ‘‘the Nebraska
way’’ by watching out for our most vulner-
able citizens.
That is who we are. These stories are
inspiring, and they speak to the char-
acter and integrity of my fellow Ne-
braskans.
I have been traveling across Ne-
braska to see the impact of this dis-
aster firsthand.
In Omaha, I joined Governor Ricketts
at the Nebraska Strong phone-a-thon
for relief and support for flood victims.
The event, sponsored by the Nebraska
Broadcasters Association, raised nearly
a half million dollars to benefit the
American Red Cross in Nebraska and
Southwest Iowa.
In Winslow, I met with families and
residents of the area who had been hit
hard by the floods. Every structure in
that town was flooded. I spoke to a
mother of three who told me she had
just 15 minutes to gather her children
and her family’s belongings before the
floodwaters entered their home.
Winslow Volunteer Fire Chief
Zachary Klein, informed me that his
team was able to get boats to help with
their recovery efforts. Chief Klein and
his team saved 29 local residents from
their flooded homes.
In Plattsmouth, the town’s water
treatment facility is currently powered
down and inaccessible. Like many af-
fected communities across Nebraska,
their main concern is being able to
gather the facts and to make decisions
about how they can move forward with
their lives.
In Valley, I toured the devastation in
the community with Mayor Carroll
Smith and Councilwoman Cindy Grove.
Large piles of wreckage can be found
everywhere in town as people begin
that cleanup process, but the people of
Valley are resilient. Residents have
started a donation center where people
in need can get clothes, equipment, and
other supplies as needed. More than 150
people have signed up as volunteers.
I also spent some time with local
residents and city and county per-
sonnel in North Bend. The community
is understandably concerned about how
their community will rebuild their
lives, but it also warmed my heart to
listen to stories of how the town is
pulling together to support one an-
other.
Time and again, I heard of how proud
the North Bend community is of their
volunteers who are managing dona-
tions and distributing food and supplies
to those in need.
I want all Nebraskans to know that
my office stands ready to help in any
way that we can. Recently, I led the
Nebraska delegation in a letter to
President Trump outlining the extent
of damage to our State and the pro-
jected cost of recovery. I want to thank
the President for his rapid approval of
Governor Ricketts’ expedited request
for Federal disaster assistance.
Secretary of Agriculture Sonny
Perdue and I discussed the crisis that
ag producers are facing. He assured me
that USDA is committed to assisting
our farmers and ranchers in any way
they can. I also visited with Secretary
of Transportation Elaine Chao by
phone to share with her how this his-
toric storm has damaged our critical
infrastructure. The Secretary and the
Department of Transportation, as a
whole, are ready to help Nebraska.
I spoke with Major General Bohac to
discuss the Nebraska National Guard’s
flood response, the ongoing state of
emergency, and ways my office can as-
sist with their relief efforts. In the
coming days and weeks, I will continue
to work closely alongside Governor
Ricketts to assist in coordinating Fed-
eral relief efforts for our State. I have
spoken to President Trump and shared
with him the needs of our State as we
recover. He reassured me that Nebras-
kans will receive the help we need.
I take great pride in the way our
State has pulled together in this dis-
aster. To know communities like Fre-
mont, Plattsmouth, Columbus, Ash-
land, Norfolk, Spencer, or Niobrara is
to know the definition of strength in
unity and an unwavering pride in your
State and country. Above the flood-
waters, you will still see the American
flag waving proudly in all of these com-
munities. If you know Nebraska as I
do, you know our State is filled with
towns like these from one side to the
other.
I am proud to represent our great
State every day in the U.S. Senate.
Though much is uncertain for the vic-
tims of this disaster, our communities
are rallying to endure and recover from
these historic weather conditions.
I close by offering my sincere thanks
to our State and local officials, our
emergency responders, and National
Guard, who are working around the
clock to provide lifesaving assistance
to our citizens in need.
We have much work to do, but Ne-
braskans are resilient, we are tough,
and we are compassionate. Hour by
hour and day by day, we will get
through this difficult chapter in our
State’s history, and we will remain Ne-
braska Strong.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms.
MCSALLY). The Senator from Iowa.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
appreciate the majority leader’s bring-
ing the Green New Deal to a vote today
so that every Senator had an oppor-
tunity to go on record. I voted no.
Some of my Democratic colleagues
may argue that a vote against the
Green New Deal demonstrates an un-
willingness to reduce our dependence
on fossil fuels and to tackle serious en-
vironmental issues of the day, but
nothing could be further from the
truth.
Contrary to popular belief, the
United States is not a bad actor on the
world stage. The United States has re-
duced its carbon emissions by 758 mil-
lion metric tons per year since 2005.
This is the largest decline of any coun-
try in the world.
Meanwhile, China’s and India’s car-
bon emissions have grown. According
to the U.S. Energy Information Admin-
istration, U.S. consumption of biofuels
and other renewable energy has more
than doubled from 2000 to 2017. The
United States will only continue to in-
crease renewable energy consumption
through 2050 as we see more invest-
ment in wind, solar, biomass, geo-
thermal, and other alternative ener-
gies.
Let’s be very clear. A ‘‘no’’ vote on
the Green New Deal is a vote against a
government takeover of our economy
that would stifle economic growth,
bankrupt our Nation, and endanger the
prosperity of all Americans. A ‘‘no’’
vote is a vote in favor of continuing an
open and free economy that has made
America the richest country in the
world. We find that the best way to
make environmental improvements is
to use the wealth of a nation to accom-
plish that goal, and as a nation be-
comes more wealthy, the more apt it is
to have the ability to protect the envi-
ronment.
The fact is that the Green New Deal
is wholly unrealistic in its goal of ob-
taining net-zero carbon emissions with-
in 10 years. We are not going to be suc-
cessful at reducing our dependence on
fossil fuels and lowering our carbon
emissions through virtue signaling.
That is all the Green New Deal boils
down to—virtue signaling. It is all
lofty goals and aspirations with no
concrete plan or concern as to its feasi-
bility.
It is easy to support a vaguely word-
ed, nonbinding resolution calling on
the Federal Government to accomplish
certain goals, but guess what. That is
us—we, in the Congress. Congress is
part of the Federal Government with
the responsibility under our Constitu-
tion to write the laws. If Members of
Congress have concrete ideas about
what the Federal Government should
be doing, they should introduce real
legislation detailing who should do
what to accomplish these goals.

Deal, we need to focus on common-
sense, bipartisan approaches that have
an actual shot at making a difference.
In other words, a resolution is a resolu-
tion; it is not a law. It doesn’t accom-
plish anything. It states these goals
that we ought to seek, but nobody has
come forth with a concrete plan to ac-
complish those goals.
Cutting taxes is an effective way to
encourage positive, environmentally
conscious ways to produce electricity
and fuel. This is what I have sought to
do as a leader on renewable and alter-
native energy production for decades
now. I was the original author of the
production tax credit for wind energy
in 1992. It won me an award as the fa-
ther of wind energy, and now, I sup-
pose, 25 years later, I am the grand-
father of the wind energy approach.
During my leadership on the Senate
Finance Committee during the early
2000s, I oversaw the establishment, en-
hancement, and renewal of numerous
tax incentives that promote clean en-
ergy from sources such as wind and
solar to renewable fuels like biodiesel,
to energy efficient buildings, homes,
and appliances.
Unlike the aspirational goals of the
Green New Deal, these proposals I have
been a part of are real, proven, bipar-
tisan actions that I helped shepherd
into law to make the United States
more energy independent and, at the
same time, improve our environment.
Renewable energy is a very smart in-
vestment and the fastest growing
source of electricity generation in our
country. According to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration, utility-
scale solar power is expected to in-
crease by 10 percent in 2019—that is in
1 year alone—while wind power is ex-
pected to surpass hydropower for the
first time. As prices continue to fall,
the economic benefits from these clean
energy investments will obviously in-
crease.
Already, Iowa leads the Nation for its
share of renewable energy. Iowa’s wind
generates nearly 37 percent of the
State’s electricity from wind, and the
State’s largest utility in America is set
to generate 100 percent of its elec-
tricity within just a few years. Iowa
ranks first in the Nation in the produc-
tion of ethanol and biodiesel. Iowa
alone accounted for over 26 percent of
the entire U.S. ethanol production and
over 17 percent of the U.S. biodiesel
production.
The solar industry in Iowa continues
to mature and ranks 17th nationally.
The bottom line is that renewable en-
ergy helps diversify Iowa’s economy. It
creates jobs in rural America and
strengthens U.S. energy independence.
As far as the jobs are concerned, I be-
lieve there are about 7,000 just for wind
energy and 43,000 for biofuels.
Instead of trying to build on these
and other proven policies, the authors
of the Green New Deal are more con-
cerned with trying to correct all the
ills they see in the U.S. economic sys-
tem and even our broader society.
So it is not just about environment.
Here is a list of the grievances they
want to attack in the name of an envi-
ronmentally sustainable economy: life
expectancy, wage stagnation, economic
mobility, income inequality, systemic
injustices, the oppression of indigenous
people, the unhoused, and the list goes
on and on and on. Just in case I might
be taken as a person who doesn’t care
about all of those things I just listed—
in other words, don’t get me wrong;
these are important issues that deserve
our attention as a nation, but it is sim-
ply not realistic to believe that they
can all be solved through a plan that
targets environmental sustainability.
Of course, since no crisis should be
allowed to go to waste, every aspect of
the progressive agenda must be imple-
mented to fend off the threat of cli-
mate change. According to an analysis
by the American Action Forum, a por-
tion of the so-called Green New Deal
plan focuses on eliminating carbon
emissions. That program, by itself,
would cost between $8.3 and $12.3 tril-
lion. Of course, that is assuming it is
followed up with actual legislation
that attempts to implement the goals
it lays out, and I have pointed out that
all of that legislation is not being
brought forward.
Those figures account for only a frac-
tion of the Green New Deal’s cost. The
portion of the progressive economic
agenda that includes enacting uni-
versal healthcare, free college tuition,
a Federal jobs guarantee program, and
much more is estimated to cost some-
where between $43 and $81 trillion. So
that would put the total cost of the
Green New Deal at somewhere between
$51 and $93 trillion over the first 10
years.
Now, $93 trillion—that is kind of hard
to imagine. Can you imagine that?
That is more money than the U.S. Gov-
ernment has spent in its entire 230-year
history. How would we even go about
paying for it?
Several Democrats have floated ideas
or introduced bills that have gone
along the lines of taxing the wealthy.
That, I assume, may make up some of
their possibilities. Earlier this year,
the House author of the Green New
Deal suggested imposing tax rates of 70
percent or more on earnings over $10
million. Here in the Senate, Senator
WARREN has proposed an annual wealth
tax of 2 percent on assets of $50 million
and 3 percent on assets of over $1 bil-
lion. Not to be outdone, Senator SAND-
ERS has introduced legislation to su-
percharge the death tax with rates as
high as 77 percent of estates exceeding
$1 billion. More recently, Representa-
tive DEFAZIO reintroduced his proposal
to tax securities transactions.
Think about this. Even if we assume
that these proposals would not have
detrimental economic or behavioral ef-
fects—and we all know they would—
these taxes would not come anywhere
close to covering the price tag of the
Green New Deal. The Washington Post
reported that a 70-percent tax rate on
incomes over $10 million could theo-
retically raise $720 billion over 10
years. Senator WARREN’s own esti-
mates suggest her annual wealth tax
proposal could raise as much as $2.75
trillion in a decade. According to Sen-
ator SANDERS, his death tax proposal
would raise $315 billion over a decade.
Congressman DEFAZIO’s transaction
tax is estimated to bring in $777 billion.
So adding up all that, even under the
rosiest assumptions, these Senators’
proposals combined would only cover
between 5 and 10 percent of the Green
New Deal’s cost.
The fact is, there are not enough mil-
lionaires and billionaires in the United
States to cover the price tag, so even-
tually they start taxing the middle
class. These socialist ideas remind me
of former United Kingdom Prime Min-
ister Margaret Thatcher’s wise obser-
vation that ‘‘the trouble with socialism
is that eventually you run out of other
people’s money.’’
Many of the Green New Deal backers
appear to realize this and have even
suggested that offsetting its cost is un-
necessary. According to these authors
of the Green New Deal, it can be paid
for simply by printing more money.
Yes, you heard me right—printing
more money. Their solution is the
same as what has been tried by every
bankrupt third world country around
the world—just crank up the printing
presses.
The poster child for this fantasy in
the world today, at least, is Venezuela,
a country rich with great economic vi-
tality in the 1970s—probably even ear-
lier than the 1970s—but that economy
has been driven into the ground by so-
cialist policies, financed in large meas-
ure by churning out currency, leading
to multimillion percent inflation rates.
Now that Senators have had an op-
portunity to go on record in support or
opposition to the resolution, I hope the
nonsense that is the Green New Deal
will be put to rest. Hopefully, we can
all now rally around sensible, proven
policy to secure our energy independ-
ence and to improve the environment.
From my point of view, that is the
United States continuing on the suc-
cess we have already had but standing
as an example for China, India, Indo-
nesia, Brazil, and other countries.
Affordable, clean energy is key to
moving the United States forward. A
good starting point would be to enact
tax extenders legislation that I intro-
duced last month with Ranking Mem-
ber WYDEN. This legislation would ex-
tend nearly a dozen separate practical
and proven incentives for renewable en-
ergy and energy efficiency. Investing in
alternative forms of clean energy is
good for the environment, good for na-
tional security and energy independ-
ence, and good for job creation, par-
ticularly in rural America. It is good
for economic development and surely
good for the taxpayers, and it is obvi-
ously good for attacking climate
change.
I yield the floor.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

H.R. 268
Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I
rise tonight to talk about something
we don’t see very often in this body.
We saw a bipartisan effort today to
move to regular order, to actually put
a bill on this floor, to debate its mer-
its, to make amendments to it, and to
try to find a compromise position to do
the right thing for the people across
many States in our country that have
been devastated by untoward disasters
just in this last year.
As many of us know all too well, our
country suffered a series of unprece-
dented natural disasters over the last
year. Actually, it is a trend that has
gone on over the last couple of years.
We have had a series of unprecedented
disasters.
In July, August, and November 2018
alone, wildfires in California displaced
hundreds and even thousands of people
and destroyed thousands of homes in a
very short period of time. These fires
were the deadliest and most destruc-
tive in California history.
In August 2018, Hurricane Lane
dropped 52 inches of rain over 5 days,
causing heavy flooding and mudslides.
It ranks as the second wettest tropical
cyclone in U.S. history, behind Hurri-
cane Harvey in 2017.
In September of 2018, Hurricane Flor-
ence caused catastrophic damage in
North and South Carolina. It flooded
homes, schools, and businesses. A week
after the hurricane, major highways
were still underwater.
In November 2018, a 7.0 magnitude
earthquake hit Alaska and damaged
highways and buildings and displaced
hundreds, if not thousands, of individ-
uals.
Earlier this year, an EF–4 tornado
flattened Lee County, AL, and took 23
lives, including 3 children, and injured
hundreds of others.
Today, our friends in the Midwest are
suffering from devastating flooding.
Roads have been washed away, fields
look like lakes, and many cattle have
been drowned. As a matter of fact, this
flood happened just at the wrong
time—during calving—and we know
that thousands of calves have been
lost.
My home State of Georgia has not
been immune and is indeed at this mo-
ment reeling from a natural disaster as
well.
On October 10, 2018, Hurricane Mi-
chael made landfall on the Florida
Panhandle with a category 4 hurricane.
It was one of the strongest storms to
ever hit the United States. Over the
next few hours, Hurricane Michael bar-
reled through Florida, tore through
southwest Georgia, and moved on to
North Carolina and South Carolina,
doing immense damage. In a matter of
hours, homes were flattened, tracts of
timber destroyed, crops were ruined,
and people’s lives were radically
changed forever. This hurricane hit ex-
actly at a time when most crops were
ready to be harvested. Cotton, peanuts,
pecans, timber—it was devastating.
Nothing was spared.
Today, agriculture is Georgia’s top
industry and our No. 1 economic driver.
Before the hurricane, farmers in my
State were expecting a record harvest
in many commodity categories. In-
stead, just at the time when harvesting
was starting, Hurricane Michael hit,
and crops were completely destroyed
across most of our State.
Our farmers are resilient, however.
They have weathered droughts before
and low-yield harvests and poor farm
economies. They suffered through sev-
eral years of low commodity prices as
well. But they never ever faced any-
thing quite like this before. The
strength and magnitude of this hurri-
cane indeed was unprecedented.
Shortly after the hurricane hit,
President Trump, Vice President
PENCE, and the Secretary of Agri-
culture all came down to Georgia with
Senator ISAKSON and me to view the
damage. Together, we toured the State,
saw the devastation, and heard directly
from farmers about the tough road to
recovery. It was interesting that these
farmers were not asking for anything;
they were actually praying for their
brethren in other parts of the country
who were also being ravaged by these
disasters.
The scene we saw that day is some-
thing I personally will never forget. We
visited one of the largest pecan farms
in the world—certainly in Georgia—
and saw the damage in their fields. At
this one farm alone, these two brothers
who started from nothing had 800 acres
of beautiful pecan trees. These matur-
ing pecan trees were completely up-
rooted at the very time when the heavy
harvest was sitting right there on the
trees. In fact, when I was there, you
couldn’t walk on the ground; it was
just a solid carpet of pecans on the
ground, literally ruined.
Crop insurance will help with this
year’s losses somewhat, but agriculture
insurance only covers part of the loss.
What it won’t cover are the trees that
were damaged, particularly in this 800-
acre tract that we personally saw with
the Vice President.
Here, there is no insurance. Today in
the agriculture industry, there is no
way to insure this machine called a
pecan tree that produces pecans. You
can insure part of the crop, but you
can’t insure the trees. It takes about 10
years—some varieties, a little less, but
about 10 years to start getting a crop
from those new trees. So you can see
for them that this is truly a genera-
tional loss.
When they saw the devastation, the
Trump administration told Georgia
farmers and other farmers around the
Southeast from this particular hurri-
cane that they would have their backs,
and they have moved to do just that.
President Trump said: ‘‘Farmers
really got hurt, especially in Georgia,
but we’re going to get it taken care
of.’’ Vice President PENCE said: ‘‘We
will rebuild these crops and these com-
munities. We will restore southwest
Georgia. We will restore the Sunbelt
region bigger and better than ever be-
fore.’’ They have acted consistently
since October of last year.
The State of Georgia immediately
stepped up and offered tax credits,
short-term financing, bridge loans, and
other forms of direct assistance to
those impacted. The Federal Govern-
ment has been a little slower to act. It
has been 5 months since Hurricane Mi-
chael ravaged the Southeast, and this
Congress has done very little to help
people who are barely hanging on right
now. That is shameful. It is time to do
something about it. This aid should
have been funded as soon as we had an
estimate of the damage, which was
really a mere few weeks after the hur-
ricane came through in October. In-
stead, disaster aid got caught up in a
partisan spending battle here in the
Senate, and in typical Washington
fashion, Congress kicked the can down
the road.
It is totally unacceptable that Wash-
ington’s intransigence continues to
threaten the livelihood of the very peo-
ple who sent us here to represent them.
If we don’t help these people right now,
they may lose their businesses, their
farms, their livelihoods, and, in some
cases, their families through no fault
of their own. That is the reality we are
facing here.
Every night, farmers in my State get
on their knees and pray that help will
soon come. They pray their lenders will
show compassion when their bridge
loans are maturing, as they are, lit-
erally, today. They pray they will not
go bankrupt. They pray they will be
able to provide for their families. And
yes, they are praying for other people
around the country who have been dev-
astated just like they have.
Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON has been a
workhorse in this entire effort. He and
I, along with several other Senators
from southeastern States, have intro-
duced this stand-alone supplemental
disaster relief bill that we just had a
vote on merely an hour ago. This bill
passed the motion to proceed 90 to 10.
I am very proud to be a Member to-
night of a body that has agreed to put
this on the floor and to do what the
Senate is supposed to do, and that is to
debate a bill, amend it, and then vote
on its passage.
This particular bill, among other
things, for States like California and
other parts of the country, includes $3
billion for agriculture. This is specifi-
cally disaster relief for our farmers and
ranchers around the country. These
funds are for States like Georgia, Flor-
ida, Alabama, the Carolinas—that is

North Carolina and South Carolina—
Alaska, Hawaii, California, Iowa, Ne-
braska, Missouri, and Kansas, which
are all battling natural disasters right
now and over the past year.
I would also add that our colleagues
from the upper Midwest have really
moved very quickly and have been very
reasonable so that we can include in
the language here flexibility to make
sure their needs are met, as well.
I also want to take a moment to
thank our colleagues here for being
very reasonable about needs in other
parts of our country.
I really think that what the Presi-
dent has done with Puerto Rico needs
to be called out. The Trump adminis-
tration has been resolute in their sup-
port of the people in Puerto Rico after
Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma
hit the island. To date, $40 billion has
already been allocated, and another 50
is potentially going their way—depend-
ing on how things happen in the next 5
years or so—to help Puerto Rico re-
cover from recent hurricanes. That is a
potential of over $90 billion.
To ensure Puerto Rico continues to
have the resource it needs to recover,
this disaster relief bill includes $600
million in additional nutritional as-
sistance for the most vulnerable fami-
lies in Puerto Rico since that relief,
that aid, actually runs out this week.
Some Members of this body argue we
should allocate more funding for Puer-
to Rico. I would remind them that this
is the same level of funding that they
have previously supported. In addition,
Puerto Rico’s own representative in
Congress, JENNIFFER GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN,
supports our bill. She said this ‘‘bill
puts my constituents one step closer to
receiving the assistance they need to
continue the long path toward recov-
ery, and I look forward to its swift pas-
sage.’’
This bipartisan disaster relief pack-
age is a win for our farmers. It is a win
for families and businesses who were
devastated by historical hurricanes in
the Southeast and wildfires in the
West. It is a win for the people in Puer-
to Rico, whom the President has pre-
viously helped.
Every day we continue debating this
issue is a day that people across the
country face crippling uncertainty.
Today, I call on each of us to put our
individual political interests aside and
do the right thing for these people who
are depending on us right now. Time is
of the essence. People back home are
counting on us to get this done.
In conclusion, this discussion re-
minds us of a bigger issue. The funding
we are debating here today is, by defi-
nition, borrowed money. Because of
Washington’s intransigence over the
last 4 years and its inability to get its
financial House in order over the last
few decades, coupled with this debt cri-
sis we have today, we are losing the
ability to do the right thing, whether
it is medical research, infrastructure,
education, or responding to national
disasters. Moving forward, we will not
be able to continue dealing with these
emergencies and crises if we don’t have
a functioning Federal Government that
can pay its bills and keep its financial
house in order. Today I ask each of my
colleagues here for their individual
support on this disaster relief package.
I also ask that going forward we have
a serious debate about tackling this
debt crisis and responsively funding
the Federal Government on time every
year so we can help the American peo-
ple when they are counting on us the
most.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, sec-

stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I
ask unanimous consent to have printed
in the RECORD the notifications which
have been received. If the cover letter
references a classified annex, then such

a MK 82, MK 83, MK 84, BLU–109, BLU–110,
BLU–111, BLU–117, BLU–126 (Navy) or BLU–
129 warhead. The Guidance Set, when com-
bined with a warhead and appropriate fuze,
and tailkit forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit
(GBU). The JDAM Guidance Set gives these
bombs adverse weather capability with im-
proved accuracy. The tail kit contains an In-
ertial Navigation System (INS) guidance/
Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance
to provide highly accurate weapon delivery
in any ‘‘flyable’’ weather. The INS, using up-
dates from the GPS, helps guide the bomb to
the target via the use of movable tail fins.
The JDAM weapon can be delivered from
modest standoff ranges at high or low alti-
tudes against a variety of land and surface
targets during the day or night. After re-
lease, JDAM autonomously guides to a tar-
get, using the resident GPS-aided INS guid-
ance system. JDAM is capable of receiving
target coordinates via preplanned mission
data from the delivery aircraft, by onboard
aircraft sensors (i.e. FLIR, Radar, etc.) dur-
ing captive carry, or from a third party
source via manual or automated aircrew
cockpit entry. The JDAM as an All Up
Round is SECRET; technical data for JDAM
is classified up to SECRET.

2,000 pound JDAM respectively, which incor-
porates all the capabilities of the JDAM and
adds a precision laser guidance set. The
Laser-JDAM (LIDAM) gives the weapon sys-
tem an optional semi-active laser guidance
in addition to the correct GPS/INS guidance
which allows for striking moving targets.
The LJDAM AUR and all of its components
are SECRET; technical data for JDAM is
classified up to SECRET. The GBU–54/56 con-
tain a GPS Receiver Card with Selective
Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM).
22. GBU–49 and GBU–50 Enhanced Paveway
II (EP II) are 500lbs/2000lbs dual mode laser
and GPS guided munitions respectively. In-
formation revealing target designation tac-
tics and associated aircraft maneuvers, the

targets, vulnerabilities regarding counter-
measures and the electromagnetic environ-
ment is classified SECRET. Information re-
vealing the probability of destroying com-
mon/unspecified targets, the number of si-
multaneous lasers the laser seeker head can
discriminate, and data on the radar/infrared
frequency is classified CONFIDENTIAL.
23. GBU–39 (250lb) Small Diameter Bomb
(SDB–I) The Guided Bomb Unit–39 (GBU–39/
B) small diameter bomb (SDB) is a 250-lb
class precision guided munition that is in-
tended to provide aircraft with an ability to
carry a high number of bombs. The weapon
offers day or night, adverse weather, preci-
sion engagement capability against pre-
planned fixed or stationary soft, non-hard-
ened, and hardened targets, and provides
greater than 50 NM standoff range. Aircraft
are able to carry four SDBs in place of one
2,000-lb bomb. The SDB is equipped with a
GPS-aided inertial navigation system to at-
tack fixed, stationary targets such as fuel
depots and bunkers. The SDB and all of its
components are SECRET; technical data is
classified up to SECRET.
24. GBU–10/12/16/58 Paveway II (PWII), a
Laser Guided Bomb (LGB), is a maneuver-
able, free-fall weapon that guides to a spot of
laser energy reflected off of the target. The
LGB is delivered like a normal general pur-
pose (GP) warhead and the semi-active guid-
ance corrects for many of the normal errors
inherent in any delivery system. Laser des-
ignation for the LGB can be provided by a
variety of laser target markers or designa-
tors. A LGB consists of a Computer Control
Group (CCG) that is not warhead specific,
and a warhead specific Air Foil Group (AFG)
that attaches to the nose and tail of a GP
bomb body. The PWII can use either the
FMU–152 or FMU–139D/B fuzes. The overall
weapon is CONFIDENTIAL. The GBU–10 is a
2,000lb (MK–84 or BLU–117 B/B) GP bomb
body fitted with the MXU–651 AFG, and
MAU–209CB or MAU–169 L/B CCG to guide to

fitted with the MXU–650 airfoil and MAU–
209C/B or MAU–168L/B CCGs to guide to its
laser designated target.
25. M61 20mm Vulcan Cannon: The 20mm
Vulcan cannon is a six barreled automatic
cannon chambered in 20x120mm with a cyclic
rate of fire from 2,500–6,000 shots per minute.
This weapon is a hydraulically powered air
cooled Gatling gun used to damage/destroy
aerial targets, suppress/incapacitate per-
sonnel targets and damage or destroy mov-
ing and stationary light materiel targets.
The M61 and its components are UNCLASSI-
FIED.
26. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system
effectiveness or be used in the development
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities.
27. A determination has been made that
Morocco can provide substantially the same
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification.
28. All defense articles and services listed
in this transmittal are authorized for release
and export to the Government of Morocco.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Belgium—MQ–9B SkvGuardian Remotely
Piloted Aircraft (RPA)
The Government of Belgium has requested
to purchase four (4) MQ–9B, RPA; two (2)
Fixed Certifiable Ground Control Stations;
five (5) AN/DAS–4 Multi-Spectral Targeting
Systems (4 installed, 1 spare); fifteen (15)
Embedded Global Positioning System/Iner-
tial Navigation Systems (EGI) (12 installed, 3
spares); five (5) AN/APY–8 Lynx Synthetic
Aperture Radars (4 installed, 1 spare); and
five (5) Detect and Avoid Systems (4 in-
stalled, 1 spare). Also included are an Initial
Spares Package (ISP) and Readiness Spares
Package (RSP) to support a 5-year period of
performance; spare and repair parts; support
and test equipment; publications and tech-
nical documentation; personnel training and
training equipment; U.S. Government and
contractor engineering; technical and logis-
tics support services; and other related ele-
ments of logistical and program support. The
total estimated program cost is $600 million.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by helping to improve the security of
a NATO ally. It is vital to the U.S. national
interest to assist Belgium to develop and
maintain a strong and ready self-defense ca-
pability. This potential sale enhances the in-
telligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) capability of the Belgian military in
support of national, NATO, United Nation-
mandated, and other coalition operations.
Commonality of ISR capabilities increases
interoperability between the U.S. and Bel-
gian military and peacekeeping forces.
Belgium intends to use these defense arti-
cles and services to provide for the defense of
its deployed troops, regional security, do-
mestic security, and interoperability with
the U.S./NATO partners. The current fleet of
Belgian Air Component aircraft have proven
insufficient to support sustained and per-
sistent ISR operations. The proposed sale
will enable the Belgian Air Component to
conduct persistent and wide area ISR, in-
cluding target acquisition, target designa-
tion, providing precision coordinates for
Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided mu-
nitions, battle damage assessment, signal in-
telligence, communication, and data relays.
Belgium will have no difficulty absorbing
this equipment and support into its armed
forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The principal contractor will be General
Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., San
Diego, California. There are no known offset
agreements proposed in connection with this
potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale may
require multiple trips to Belgium and poten-
tially a deployed location for U.S. contractor
representatives to provide initial launch, re-
covery, and maintenance support.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

knots true air speed (KTAS) and a maximum
altitude of 45,000 feet. The system is designed
to be controlled by two operators within a
Certifiable Ground Control Station (CGCS).
The CGCS is designed to emulate a recon-
naissance aircraft cockpit, giving users ex-
tensive means to operate both the aircraft
and sensors. The MQ–9B is able to operate
using a direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) datalink
or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) through sat-
ellite communications (SATCOM). The de-
sign enables unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
control to be transferred between multiple
CGCSs, thus allowing remote-split oper-
ations and centralized mission control with
other assets. The MQ–9B system can be de-
ployed from a single site that supports
launch/recovery, mission control, and main-
tenance. The system also supports remote-
split operations where launch/recovery and
maintenance occur at a Forward Operating
Base and mission control is conducted from
another location or Main Operating Base
(MOB). The basic MQ–9B Unmanned Aerial
System (UAS) is UNCLASSIFIED. However,
inclusion of various subsystems, capabilities,
and potential weapons results in a maximum
classification of SECRET.
2. The Belgian MQ–9B system will include
the following components:
a. A secure Certifiable Ground Control Sta-
tion (CGCS) with workstations that allow
aircrew to operate the aircraft, execute the
mission, and record/exploit downlinked pay-
load data.
b. The AN/APY–8 Lynx He Block 20A Syn-
thetic Aperture Radar and Ground Moving
Target Indicator (SAR/GMTT) system pro-
vides an all-weather surveillance, tracking
and targeting capability. The system oper-
ates in the Ku-band, using an offset-fed dish
antenna mounted on a three-axis stabilized
gimbal. It has a large field of regard, pro-
duces a strip map, and can image up to a
10km wide swath. Swaths from multiple
passes can be combined for wide-area surveil-
lance.
c. The AN/DAS–4 Multi-Spectral Targeting
System (MTS–D) is a multi-use highly ad-
vanced EO/IR sensor providing long-range
surveillance, high altitude, target acquisi-
tion, tracking, range finding, and laser des-
ignation developed and produced for use by
the U.S. Air Force.
d. COMSEC is necessary for full
functionality of the Embedded GPS-INS
(EGI) and the AN/DPX–7 Identification
Friend or Foe (IFF)/Transponder.
e. The Detect and Avoid System (DAAS)
with Active Electronically Scanned Array
(AESA) Due Regard Radar (DRR) is a multi-
sensor system that detects and tracks coop-
erative and non-cooperative air traffic, and
enables an autopilot response for
deconfliction maneuvers.
f. The Belgium MQ–9B is intended to be
used in the near-term only for ISR-type mis-
sions. As such, the system is not requested
to be armed, but is requested to preserve the
option to arm the systems should the need
arise at a later time. If weaponized, the sys-
tem is capable of being equipped with the
U.S. Army AGM–114 Hellfire missile and var-
ious guided and unguided bombs.
3. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures or equivalent systems which might
reduce weapon system effectiveness or be
used in the development of a system with
similar or advanced capabilities.
4. This sale is necessary in furtherance of
the U.S. foreign policy and national security
objectives outlined in the enclosed Policy
Justification. A determination has been
made that Belgium can provide the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment.
5. All defense articles and services listed in
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to Belgium.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Morocco—F–16 Block 52+ Upgrade to F–16V
Configuration
The Government of Morocco has requested
to upgrade its existing twenty-three F–16
aircraft to the F–16V configuration. The re-
quested buy includes twenty-six (26) APG–83
Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA)
Radars (includes 3 spares), twenty-six (26)
Modular Mission Computers (includes 3
spares), twenty-six (26) Link–16 Multifunc-
tional Information Distribution System—
JTRS (MIDS–JTRS) with TACAN and ESHI
Terminals (includes 3 spares), twenty-six (26)
LN260 Embedded Global Navigation Systems
(EGI) (includes 3 spares), twenty-six (26)
Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems II
(includes 3 spares), twenty-six (26) Improved
Programmable Display Generators (iPDG)
(includes 3 spares), fifty (50) LAU–129 Multi-
Purpose Launchers; and twenty-six (26) AN/
AAQ–33 Sniper Pods. Also included are twen-
ty-six (26) AN/ALQ–213 EW Management Sys-
tems; twenty-six (26) Advanced Identifica-
tion Friend/Foe; Joint Mission Planning Sys-
tem; twenty-six (26) AN/ALQ–211 AIDEWS;
six (6) DB–110 Advanced Reconnaissance Sys-
tems; secure communications, cryptographic
precision navigation equipment; spares and
repair parts; support equipment; personnel
training and training equipment; publica-
tions and technical documentation; support
and test equipment; simulators; integration
and test; U.S. Government and contractor
engineering, technical and logistical support
services; and other related elements of logis-
tics and program support. The estimated
cost is $985.2 million.
This proposed sale will contribute to the
foreign policy and national security of the
United States by helping to improve the se-
curity of a major Non-NATO ally that con-
tinues to be an important force for political
stability and economic progress in North Af-
rica.
The proposed sale will contribute to Mo-
rocco’s self-defense capabilities. The pur-
chase will improve interoperability with the
United States and enhance Morocco’s ability
to undertake coalition operations, as it has
done in the past in flying sorties against
ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Morocco already op-
erates an F–16 fleet and will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing this aircraft and services
into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment will
not alter the basic military balance in the
region.
The prime contractor will be Lockheed
Corporation, Bethesda, Maryland. The pur-
chaser typically requests offsets. Any offset
agreement will be defined in negotiations be-
tween the purchaser and the contractor.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require the assignment of 10 additional U.S.
Government and approximately 75 contract
representatives to Morocco.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

Morocco can provide substantially the same
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification.
18. All defense articles and services listed
in this transmittal are authorized for release
and export to the Government of Morocco.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President,
I rise to join my colleagues in calling
for legislation to resolve the climate
crisis. The need for action could not be
more urgent. Every day of inaction in
the U.S. Senate brings new risks of ir-
reversible harm to our communities,
our environment and future genera-
tions.
Unfortunately, this week’s vote is
not really about climate change. The
Senate has been asked to invoke clo-
ture on a nonbinding resolution that
raises but does not really answer a
broad range of questions about climate
change and our economy.
The Senate is not ready to end de-
bate on these issues. We have hardly
begun.
The Democratic Caucus is united in
recognizing the realities of climate
change and calling for effective solu-
tions.
However, this constitutes a minority
view in the U.S. Senate. For too many
years, our calls for comprehensive cli-
mate change legislation have fallen on
deaf ears.
The Green New Deal in all of its am-
bition and breadth should be recog-
nized as a sign of the frustration that
is mounting in this country as a result
of Republican obstruction.
I do not agree with every aspect of
this particular resolution. It addresses
not only climate policy but also long-
standing partisan disputes over
healthcare, housing, jobs, and other
economic policies.
These are important policy debates,
but it is my view that the legislative
effort to address climate change does
not need to wait for agreement in these
other areas. The need for action is too
urgent.
But whatever our disagreements
about policy approaches and non-
binding resolutions, it is long past time
for us to set aside disagreements about
the validity of climate science.
The scientific community has warned
us about climate change for decades
with increasing certainty and speci-
ficity, including in a report of the
President’s Science Advisory Com-
mittee in 1965, five assessment reports
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change since 1990, and four na-
tional climate assessment reports of
the U.S. Global Change Research Pro-
gram since 2000.
Most recently, a special report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change identified the disastrous con-
sequences if we allow the world to
warm by more than 2.7 degrees Fahr-
enheit above pre-industrial tempera-
tures.
We are already at more than 1.8 de-
grees of warming. Sea levels have risen
more than 8 inches. Ocean acidity has
increased by 30 percent. Ice sheets in
Antarctica and Greenland are melting
into the sea at an accelerating pace of
more than 400 gigatons per year.
Allowing the world to warm another
degree, as we are on a course to do be-
tween 2030 and 2052, may well surpass
our ability to adapt.
Continued warming will threaten
rapid, widespread, and long-lasting in-
creases in heatwaves, wildfire, disease,
drought, crop failure, sea level rise,
ocean acidification, mass extinction,
collapsing food chains, mass popu-
lation migrations, and human conflict.
To avoid warming in excess of 2.7 de-
grees Fahrenheit, the special report
identified that we will need to cut
emissions 45 percent below 2010 levels
by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050.
That will require rapid transitions in
all sectors at an unprecedented scale.
Unless the U.S. Senate can undertake
the hard work of serious legislation
soon, it is clear the world will be un-
able to meet that goal.
The good news is that there are a
large number of good policy ideas the
Senate can consider if my Republican
colleagues agree to join with us in ear-
nest.
There are bipartisan proposals for
legislation to place a price on green-
house gas emissions by placing a fee on
fossil fuels.
We can even rebate the revenues to
cover the costs for households and in-
dustry. These are good ideas that we
should explore.
There are numerous examples of
clean energy standards and other pol-
icy commitments at the State, local,
and international level. These are also
good ideas that we should explore.
My own State of California has dem-
onstrated bold, creative new ideas for
cutting emissions at the same time as
it has grown to be the fifth largest
economy in the world.
The State has mandated that 50 per-
cent of its electricity must be from re-
newable sources by 2030.
We are actually ahead of schedule
and are on track to reach that deadline
by 2020, 10 years ahead of schedule.
From there, we are committed to be
completely carbon neutral by 2045.
My State’s policies work. From the
low-carbon fuel standard to the zero-
emission vehicle mandates to the econ-
omy-wide cap-and-trade system, each
innovative policy approach makes it
easier to meet our goals.
By harnessing the strength of the
American economy to address climate
change, we have an opportunity to cre-
ate millions of new jobs while strength-
ening the infrastructure and industries
that are critical to our future.
It is long past time for the Senate to
move beyond show votes on nonbinding
resolutions and move on to the hard
work of actual legislation.
I urge my Republican colleagues to
join us in this effort.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1982 March 26, 2019
Monday with my colleagues, Senators
DICK DURBIN, RON WYDEN, and ED MAR-
KEY. Senators JEFF MERKLEY, CHRIS
VAN HOLLEN, and RAND PAUL also co-
sponsored the bill this week. Our bipar-
tisan bill takes critical steps to ensure
that U.S.-manufactured weapons are
not used in the commission of heinous
war crimes, the repression of human
rights, or by terrorists who seek to do
harm to Americans and innocent civil-
ians abroad. We do not only have a
moral obligation to ensure that U.S.
weapons are used responsibly, but it is
clearly in our national security inter-
est.
As one may be aware, the United
States is the world’s leading arms sup-
plier. According to data compiled by
the Security Assistance Monitor, from
2002 to 2016, the United States has de-
livered more than $286 billion worth of
major conventional weapons and re-
lated military support to 200 recipi-
ents. The Cato Institute found that
more than 40 percent of nations pur-
chasing these arms are at high risk of
instability, terror, or egregious human
rights abuses.
There are far too many examples of
what can happen when we sell or trans-
fer arms without proper vetting. In
Yemen, U.S. arms transferred to Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and
their coalition have been linked to
more than 1,000 civilian casualties, ac-
cording to a recent report from a coali-
tion of local and international human
rights NGOs.
In December 2017, the Trump admin-
istration lifted a freeze on weapons
transfers to Nigeria to sell 12 Super
Tucano A–29 aircraft and thousands of
bombs and rockets worth $593 million,
according to a Reuters report. Earlier
that same year, the BBC reported that
at least 115 civilians were killed in a
Nigerian military airstrike on an IDP
camp. Twenty Red Cross humanitarian
aid workers were among the casualties.
Reuters reports that, since 2000, the
United States has provided close to $1
billion worth of military equipment to
the Philippines, ranging from surveil-
lance planes, drones, and boats to
small arms. Human Rights Watch esti-
mates that at least 4,000 men, women,
and children have been killed by some
of the country’s security forces in the
government’s anti-drug campaign.
President Duterte has openly encour-
aged the security forces to engage in
extrajudicial killings. Congress re-
cently prevented the administration
from selling small arms to the Phil-
ippines, but insufficient end use moni-
toring prevents us from knowing if
U.S. weapons were used in the commis-
sion of these abuses.
In Guatemala, according to the
Washington Post, authorities used
U.S.-supplied armored J–8 Jeeps to in-
timidate U.S. Diplomats and inter-
national anticorruption investigators
in August 2018. Just weeks later, the
U.S. provided an additional shipment
of similar jeeps to the Guatemalan
Government. Just to repeat, our dip-
lomats were threatened by the weapons
that we ourselves provided. This is far
from the only threat American citizens
and our partners face from American-
made weapons. Numerous investiga-
tions found that the dispersion of
American-supplied arms in Iraq made
up a significant portion of ISIS’s weap-
ons supply in the country.
This legislation will help curb these
dangerous practices by requiring the
Secretary of State to make human
rights certifications for certain arms
sales and transfers, specifically those
involving heavy weapons capable of
causing mass casualties or destruction,
such as attack aircraft and missile
launchers. The bill also requires the
Secretary of State, in coordination
with the Secretary of Defense, to de-
velop a strategy to enhance human
rights protections in the arms transfer
process. Since we know abuses can
take place years after weapons have
been transferred, the bill amends the
Arms Control Export act to ensure
stringent end use monitoring with re-
gard to human rights.
America’s strength around the world
is rooted in our values. Through this
legislation, the Senate can send a
strong message that the United States
must not allow U.S. made arms to
countries who abuse human rights, at-
tack civilians, recruit child soldiers, or
who are unable to keep weapons out of
the hands of extremist groups. These
commonsense measures ensure any
arms transfers take place in a respon-
sible manner that safeguards our secu-
rity and protects human rights.

TRIBUTE TO GENERAL JOSEPH L.
VOTEL
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I rise
today to honor GEN Joseph L. Votel, of
the U.S. Army and the Commander of
United States Central Command. Gen-
eral Votel is one of our Nation’s finest
military officers, and he will retire
from Active military duty on May 1,
2019, bringing to a close 39 years of dis-
tinguished service to our great Nation.
In 1980, General Votel was commis-
sioned as a second lieutenant in the in-
fantry upon graduation from the
United States Military Academy at
West Point. He commanded units at
every echelon, from platoon to theater,
with duty in Germany, Italy, Sarajevo,
Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United
States. As a young officer, General
Votel deployed with 75th Ranger Regi-
ment in support of Operation Just
Cause. He later commanded the 1st
Ranger Battalion at Hunter Army Air-
field in Georgia. General Votel com-
manded the 75th Ranger Regiment and

led them on deployments in support of
Operation Enduring Freedom and Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom. Later he served as
deputy commanding general of the 82d
Airborne Division in Operation Endur-
ing Freedom.
As a general officer, he served in the
Pentagon as the Director of the Army
and Joint IED Defeat Task Force and
subsequently as the Deputy Director of
the Joint IED Defeat Organization es-
tablished under the Deputy Secretary
of Defense. He served as the Deputy
Commanding General and then Com-
manding General of the Joint Special
Operations Command headquartered at
Fort Bragg, NC. He also served as the
Commanding General of U.S. Special
Operations Command, MacDill Air
Force Base, Florida. Most recently
General Votel has served as the Com-
manding General of U.S. Central Com-
mand.
At a time of great uncertainty in the
world, General Votel has led an incred-
ible combatant command that has an
enormous influence and presence in
some of the most volatile parts of the
globe. He has led the way in strategic
relationships with our partners and al-
lies that have made our country safer.
General Votel is an exceptional leader,
an American patriot committed to our
Armed Forces, our national security
and our Nation, but most importantly,
General Votel is a great man of char-
acter. It is for GEN Joe Votel, a sol-
dier, leader, and selfless servant, whom
we with profound admiration and deep
respect pay tribute to for all he has
done for the defense of our Nation for
nearly four decades.
We thank General Votel, his wife
Michele, and their two grown children,
Scott and Nicholas, for their dedica-
tion and sacrifice, and we wish them
well in the years to come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO TONY BAZZIE
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I
wish to recognize a dedicated public
servant and proud West Virginian,
Tony Bazzie, on the occasion of his re-
tirement from the Raleigh County
Housing Authority. Innumerable West
Virginians have benefited from his
tireless efforts to improve access to af-
fordable housing in our great State and
his advocacy for increased Housing and
Urban Development funding. Tony has
been a vocal champion for encouraging
investment in section 8 housing and an
advocate for a regulatory framework
that balances the interests of tenants
and property owners.
Tony started with the housing au-
thority at its inception in 1979 and
since then has worked hard to dispel
the negative stereotypes regarding
housing assistance. Currently, his of-
fice assists over 1,200 families in Ra-
leigh County, as well as Braxton, Sum-
mers, Nicholas, Fayette, and Webster
Counties. In fact, demand has been so
high that the housing authority has
had to implement a waiting list to
serve additional West Virginians.
Beyond the critical assistance that
the housing authority provides to West
Virginians in need, it also has a posi-
tive effect on the economy. Through
section 8 subsidies, Tony and his staff
have contributed over $4.5 million in
rental payments to local property own-
ers. Supporting local economies is
something I have worked for in the
Senate and knowing that I have allies
such as Tony in the State has made
this journey all the more successful.
Tony has come before Congress to
testify about the importance of hous-
ing authorities across West Virginia,
and his insight informed the discourse
regarding the Section Eight Housing
Choice Voucher Reform Act, SEVRA.
In his testimony, Tony highlighted the
need for providing decent, safe, and
sanitary housing to low-income fami-
lies. His passion for and knowledge of
housing policy were of great help to my
colleagues, and I thank him for his
service.
I would like to thank Tony for all his
insight and advice over the years. His
yearly visits to my DC office were al-
ways a highlight, and his input was in-
valuable when discussing housing
issues, particularly in West Virginia.
On a personal level, he was kind and
helpful not only to me, but to my staff
as well. They spoke highly of how at-
tentive, patient, and nice he was to ev-
eryone he worked with. I am honored
to call Tony my friend and fellow West
Virginian, and I wish him well in this
new phase of life. I wish him the very
best during his well-deserved retire-
ment, and I hope he can enjoy more
time with loved ones. West Virginia
owes Tony our gratitude, and I thank
him for all his excellent work for so
many years.∑

TRIBUTE TO TERRY DUPREE
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Madam President,
today I wish to recognize Terry
Dupree, a gentleman who has worked
diligently serving the people of Okla-
homa throughout his career with the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for 38
years.
Terry began his career with the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service performing
work involving the conservation, prop-
agation, management, protection, and
administration of wildlife species.
Terry dedicated his life to imple-
menting and advancing practices nec-
essary for the conservation and man-
agement of wildlife resources and habi-
tats. His experience and expertise has
proven invaluable to the fish and wild-
life community throughout his career.
This hard work eventually led him to
become a leader within the Partner for
Fish and Wildlife Program, which pro-
vides technical and financial assistance
for the restoration and enhancement of
fish and wildlife habitat on private
lands. I am incredibly proud of the
work he has put in over the years for
the people of our great State of Okla-
homa.
I want to thank Terry Dupree on his
years of service and wish him well in
his retirement.
Well done, Terry.∑

TRIBUTE TO COLONEL THOMAS
VON ESCHENBACH
∑ Mr. JONES. Madam President, today
I pay tribute to a great leader and an
exceptional officer of the U.S. Army,
COL Thomas von Eschenbach, now
serving as the director, Capabilities
Development and Integration Direc-
torate at the U.S. Army Aviation Cen-
ter of Excellence at Fort Rucker, AL,
as he prepares to retire from military
service on May 31, 2019.
COL Thomas von Eschenbach has
served our Army and our Nation for
more than 28 years. He has been a true
professional; a dedicated soldier, lead-
er, and officer. Throughout his career
he has commanded our great soldiers
at many levels; he has deployed to
combat numerous times in defense of
the Nation; and he has been assigned
critical positions in our military. Colo-
nel von Eschenbach has provided out-
standing leadership, advice, and sound
professional judgment on numerous
issues of enduring importance to the
Army, Congress, and this Nation.
A native of Alabama, Colonel von
Eschenbach was commissioned a sec-
ond lieutenant of aviation upon grad-
uating from Auburn University ROTC
as a Distinguished Military Graduate.
His first assignment after flight school
was at Fort Bragg, NC, where he served
as a platoon leader, company executive
officer, and battalion staff officer. He
next served in Germany as a troop
commander and division staff officer.
Upon his return from Germany, Colo-
nel von Eschenbach served as a small
group leader and later company com-
mander in the Aviation Branch Cap-
tains’ Career Course and Warrant Offi-
cer Advanced Courses at Fort Rucker,
AL. As a field-grade officer he returned
to Fort Bragg and served as the bat-
talion executive officer and operations
officer for an attack battalion, and
later brigade operation officer in the
82nd Combat Aviation Brigade to in-
clude a deployment to Operation Iraqi
Freedom.
After an assignment in Army Human
Resources Command, Colonel von
Eschenbach commanded an Air Cavalry
Squadron Task Force during a deploy-
ment to Operation Enduring Freedom
in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. After this
command, he served on the Army staff
as the Deputy Director for Army Avia-
tion.
For the past 4 years, Colonel von
Eschenbach has served as the director
of the Capabilities Development and
Integration Directorate at the U.S.
Army Aviation Center of Excellence. In
this role he was responsible to the de-
velopment of future doctrine and con-
cepts, force structure, and capability
requirements for Army aviation to en-
sure our aviation forces and soldiers

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE
REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY
WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT
MALICIOUS CYBER-ENABLED AC-
TIVITIES THAT WAS DECLARED
IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13694 ON
APRIL 1, 2015—PM 7
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States, together with an accompanying
report, which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive
Order 13694 of April 1, 2015, as amended
by Executive Order 13757 of December
28, 2016, is to continue in effect beyond
April 1, 2019.
Significant malicious cyber-enabled
activities originating from or directed
by persons located, in whole or in sub-
stantial part, outside the United States
continue to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity, foreign policy, and economy of
the United States. Therefore, I have de-
termined that it is necessary to con-
tinue the national emergency declared
in Executive Order 13694, as amended
by Executive Order 13757, with respect
to significant malicious cyber-enabled
activities.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Ms. HIRONO:
S. 868. A bill to address the disparate
impact of climate change on women
and support the efforts of women glob-
ally to address climate change, and for
other purposes; to the Committee on
Foreign Relations.
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I come
to the floor today to denounce the ma-
jority leader’s sham debate on the
Green New Deal.
Let’s be clear. The majority leader
did not call up this resolution for a
vote because he thinks climate change
is an urgent threat to our country. In
fact, he has opposed nearly every con-
gressional effort to combat the climate
crisis.
The Republican Party’s political and
financial ties to the fossil fuel industry
are well known. This latest effort to
attack Senators demanding action on
climate change with cries of socialism
is reminiscent of the Red Scare, in my
view.
Give me a break. The Green New
Deal is an aspirational plan to combat
climate change, create high-paying
jobs, and develop a more sustainable

S1990 March 26, 2019
economy that allows communities,
families, and individuals to thrive.
This isn’t radical. This isn’t socialism.
This is basic common sense. The truly
radical position is the majority lead-
er’s insistence that we stick our heads
in the sand, follow the lead of cor-
porate-backed interests funding Repub-
lican campaigns, and do nothing to
tackle climate change.
The status quo might benefit the ma-
jority leader, the Republican Party,
and their allies in the fossil fuel indus-
try, but it is deeply dangerous for our
country. Climate change is already im-
pacting our lives and damaging our
economy.
Annual weather-related natural dis-
asters have more than tripled world-
wide since the 1960s, when scientists at
the Mauna Loa Observatory on the big
island of Hawaii first confirmed that
carbon dioxide levels in the atmos-
phere were steadily rising due to the
burning of fossil fuels. According to the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration, NOAA, the United States
has sustained 139 weather and climate
disasters—beginning with Hurricane
Katrina in 2005—where damages ex-
ceeded $1 billion. The total cost of
these 139 disasters? Nearly $1.1 trillion.
Last year, in 2018, the United States
experienced the fourth highest number
of weather disasters in our history at
the tremendous costs of 247 lives lost
and $91 billion in damages. In Hawaii
last year, we registered recordbreaking
flooding on Kauai and Oahu that re-
sulted in more than $125 million in
damages. That storm generated the
largest 24-hour rainfall accumulation
in American history at nearly 50 inches
on Kauai’s North Shore in a very short
period of rainfall time.
Residents of the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands also felt
the devastating impact of Typhoon
Yutu—the worst storm to hit any part
of the United States since 1935. It cer-
tainly isn’t a coincidence that 2018 was
also the fourth hottest year on record,
surpassed only by 2016, 2015, and 2017.
We have already seen the devastating
cost of climate-driven disasters in the
first 3 months of 2019. Eleven days ago,
Tropical Cyclone Idai devastated Mo-
zambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, kill-
ing hundreds of people. It is already
being called one of the worst weather-
related disasters ever in the southern
hemisphere.
Closer to home, the Missouri River
has already set record levels of flood-
ing in Nebraska, Iowa, and South Da-
kota. Under current estimates, this
historic flooding in the Midwest will
cost at least $3 billion in damages to
roads, farms, homes, and businesses.
According to Texas A&M University
climate scientist Andrew Dessler, cli-
mate change is exacerbating the flood-
ing. He said: ‘‘You can think of climate
change as steroids for these rain
events.’’
More is on the way. According to the
spring weather outlook NOAA released
last Thursday, more than 200 million
Americans are at risk for some kind of
flooding, with 13 million of them at
risk of major inundation.
Given the increasing intensity and
frequency of severe weather events,
many more States and communities
will need disaster relief, something we
are about to vote on later this week.
Disaster relief is something we cannot,
and should not, play politics with.
Every community impacted by natural
disasters should receive assistance in
the upcoming supplemental appropria-
tions bill, including Puerto Rico, the
Northern Mariana Islands, and other
territories.
While these extreme weather events
will continue to impact local commu-
nities and the American economy, cli-
mate change also threatens our na-
tional security. Like a large majority
of the American people, senior national
security and Department of Defense of-
ficials understand we can’t just follow
the majority leader’s example and
stick our heads in the sand to avoid the
painful truth of climate change.
In 2017, for example, then-Secretary
of Defense James Mattis told the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee: ‘‘Cli-
mate change is impacting stability in
areas of the world where our troops are
operating.’’ He also stated that ‘‘cli-
mate change is a challenge that re-
quires a broader, whole-of-government
response.’’
In February, Director of National In-
telligence Dan Coats issued a new
worldwide threat assessment that con-
cluded that climate hazards like ex-
treme weather, wildfires, droughts, and
acidifying oceans are ‘‘threatening in-
frastructure, health, and water and
food security’’ around the world. This
means there will be more threats to
our national security in an increas-
ingly unstable world environment.
Faced with a global problem that
threatens our national security, Presi-
dent Trump, with the support of Re-
publicans in Congress, announced he
would withdraw the United States from
the Paris climate accord. He has, in ef-
fect, abdicated America’s global leader-
ship role in the climate crisis, alien-
ated our allies, and created new oppor-
tunities for near-peer competitors like
China. At the same time as the United
States embraced climate denial on the
international stage under Donald
Trump, China has stepped up to fill the
diplomatic void.
After the latest round of inter-
national climate talks in November,
Canada’s Minister of Environment,
Catherine McKenna said:
When the U.S. stepped back, China decided
to step up. The role China plays around the
negotiating table can’t be underestimated.
In addition to its diplomatic efforts,
China has made significant policy
changes to reduce its coal use from its
2013 peak and to scale up low carbon al-
ternatives. China is now the world’s
leading producer, exporter, and in-
staller of solar panels, wind turbines,
batteries, and electric vehicles.
China isn’t the only country on the
global stage acknowledging the reality
of climate change and taking steps to
combat it. German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, for example, has said: ‘‘Cli-
mate action is a matter of both eco-
logical necessity and economic ration-
ality.’’
Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has said:
The effects of climate change are every-
where, and they are a constant reminder of
the need to act now. While climate change is
the biggest challenge of this generation, it
also provides the opportunity to do better
while growing the economy.
Under the previous 2 years of their
unified control of the White House and
Congress, Republicans have repeatedly
blocked any efforts to combat climate
change. With Democrats now in control
in the House, I am looking forward to
working with like-minded colleagues
to demonstrate there are those of us
ready and willing to act.
Today, I am joining Representative
BARBARA LEE of California to introduce
the Women and Climate Change Act of
2019. This bill recognizes that while the
negative impacts of climate change
often impact women the most, they too
often don’t have a seat at the table
when it comes to developing policy.
Our bill creates a Federal inter-
agency working group that will collect
data and develop policies and strate-
gies to address the effects of climate
change on women both at home and
abroad. We need to empower women to
tackle climate change. They need seats
at the table.
So long as Donald Trump and his Re-
publican allies in Congress obstruct
meaningful debate and action, States
and local communities are taking their
own decisive steps to combat climate
change.
Almost every State in the country
has begun to experience the impact of
climate change. But as an island State,
Hawaii is poised to experience some of
the harshest consequences of climate
change. Rising sea levels, combined
with increased storm runoff, will in-
crease coastal flooding and erosion,
damaging sensitive ecosystems, infra-
structure, and agriculture.
According to research from the Uni-
versity of Hawaii Sea Grant Program,
70 percent of beaches in Hawaii are
eroding and 13 miles of public beaches
that once were present no longer exist.
Waikiki Beach alone generates $2.2 bil-
lion of Hawaii’s economy every year
and could be completely submerged by
the end of the century. A warming
ocean will increase bleaching and dis-
ease outbreaks on coral reefs, which
currently support $360 million in eco-
nomic activity each year.
For Hawaii, a sea level rise of 3.2
feet—which could happen as early as
2060—will result in $20 billion in dam-
age, the chronic flooding of 38 miles of
major roads, 25,000 acres of land, 6,500
structures rendered unusable or lost,
and 20,000 residents displaced.
The prospect of such widespread cli-
mate change-driven devastation has
spurred the State of Hawaii to action.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1991
March 26, 2019
We have made a commitment to be-
come carbon-neutral and generate 100
percent of our electricity from renew-
able energy sources by 2045, and we be-
came the first State to separately rat-
ify the Paris climate agreement. Eight-
een States and Puerto Rico have since
followed suit.
In addition to efforts at the State
level, local communities, families, and
landowners are taking their own steps
to cope with the threat of climate
change and adapt as necessary. Last
week, I met with National Park Serv-
ice officials, members of the Ala
Kahakai Trail Association, local gov-
ernment representatives, nongovern-
ment organizations, and community
partners, including Native Hawaiian
lineal descendants, to learn what they
are doing to lead community-based ap-
proaches to trail management and how
the issue of climate change is threat-
ening national treasures on our coasts
in Hawaii.
During my visit, members of the
Kailapa Community Association cre-
ated a plan to cope with decreased
rainfall, coastal erosion, and other im-
pacts on the ahupua’a—or division of
land—that they have lived on for more
than 12 generations. Families and com-
munities in Hawaii who understand the
threat of climate change are demand-
ing that we take divisive action to
combat it.
Donald Trump and Republicans in
Congress should muster the political
courage to do the same, but that is not
happening anytime soon—quite the
contrary. Instead, as with so many
ideas they oppose, Republicans have re-
sorted to mocking and distorting what
the Green New Deal does. They are
doing it by their tried-and-true meth-
od—by scaring people.
Donald Trump and the majority lead-
er have invested a lot of time in at-
tempting to justify their claim that
the Green New Deal is going to ban air
travel. What?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.
Ms. HIRONO. Let me conclude by
saying that the Green New Deal is aspi-
rational. To say that it is going to re-
sult in forcing everyone to stop eating
meat—it is like, what the heck? What
these so-called facts opponents and the
climate change deniers are saying
about the Green New Deal is laughable,
coming from the very people who deny
the scientific fact of climate change.
I could go on, but obviously my time
is up. I will have more to say as we
continue this so-called sham debate.
But let’s not continue to stick our
heads in the sand.
I ask unanimous consent to include
in the RECORD a letter written by an 11-
year-old girl in Hawaii who spoke at a
climate change rally in Hawaii. She
was so articulate. She said: You know,
this is like experiencing world war III
for the young people.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.
Ms. HIRONO. They demand that the
adults in the Senate to do something
about it and address climate change in
an appropriate way.
Thank you.
On Sunday, I received a letter from
Mesina—an 11-year-old girl—who spoke
at a March 15th climate action protest
in Hawaii, and she wrote:
‘‘I hope that all of our eyes are open now.
Floods are demolishing people’s homes, for-
est fires are killing people and singeing acres
of land. Sea creatures are dying. Oceans are
rising. How can we deny climate change and
the science that supports its human cause?’’
‘‘We are experiencing World War III, except
in this war, we are all on the same side. We
can all agree on clean air, clean water, and
a clean earth. As a child that is going to in-
herit our Earth, I beg you please do every-
thing in your power to protect my genera-
tion’s future and the generations to follow.’’
Mesina is asking us to step up. It’s
past time to take urgent action to
combat climate change.

f
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President,
I rise to join my colleagues in sharing
my concerns and all of our concerns
that we have—and really the concerns
of a nation—about the announcement
last night from a Department of Jus-
tice that works for this administra-
tion, which announced its plans to lit-
erally invalidate the Affordable Care
Act and strip healthcare coverage away
from millions of Americans, including
those with preexisting conditions.
Before this time, it was a bit unclear,
despite a court filing in Texas, what
the intentions were. Some of our col-
leagues were saying, ‘‘No, we don’t
really want to repeal the Affordable
Care Act,’’ but last night we learned
the truth, and the truth was very clear.
The Justice Department took a
hardline approach that they want to
repeal the Affordable Care Act.
The President tweeted today that the
Republican Party ‘‘will soon be known
as the party of health care.’’ In fact,
yesterday’s filing—in which the admin-
istration changed its previous position
and argued in support of affirming the
decision of a district court judge in
Texas—ensures exactly the opposite;
that this administration will break the
promise it made to the American peo-
ple that they can have healthcare in-
surance; that if they have a preexisting
condition, they will not lose their
healthcare. That was what the situa-
tion was before we had the protections
in place in the Affordable Care Act, be-
fore you were able to keep your kids on
your insurance until they were 26. That
was a huge positive development.
Then we also put in place protections
that said you couldn’t be kicked off
your insurance for preexisting condi-
tions. All over the last year, we had a
debate about this in this Nation. I still
remember being in a smalltown parade
in Northern Minnesota, where a mom
was pushing a stroller. She brought me
over and pointed to her toddler in that
stroller, to her young boy who had
Down syndrome. She said: This is what
a preexisting condition looks like, and
I will do everything to protect my
child. Guess what. Last night, the ad-
ministration announced they wouldn’t
protect that child because they will do
everything to repeal the Affordable
Care Act.
Let’s start with the absurd ruling the
administration is basing its actions on.
The Texas ruling last December came
more than 6 years after the Supreme
Court, in an opinion written by Justice
Roberts, upheld the law’s constitu-
tionality, which also found that parts
of the law can be severed from the rest
of the legislation. It also came after

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2001
March 26, 2019
the administration’s refusal to defend
the law. Instead of going in to put out
the fire when the house was burning
down, they just stood there. They just
stood there and poured lighter fluid on,
in terms of tweets and rhetoric.
If this ruling takes effect, the con-
sequences of just this ruling alone from
Texas will be devastating. To start,
protections for people with preexisting
conditions will be gone. About half of
all Americans have preexisting condi-
tions. This isn’t just rare diseases. It is
much more common diseases, like dia-
betes and asthma. The ability to keep
your kid on your insurance plan until
they are 26 would be gone. The work we
have done to close the Medicare dough-
nut hole coverage gap would be gone.
The provisions that help people buy in-
surance on the healthcare exchanges
would be gone.
In my State, Minnesotans would see
a loss of $364 million in premium tax
credits, and roughly 272,000 people
would lose their coverage. That is one
State alone.
We cannot allow this to happen. The
decision from Texas should be over-
turned, and we need a President who
believes the same thing. It is time to
stop trying to reset the clock or start
from scratch. This is not what the
American people want. The vast major-
ity of Americans support those protec-
tions in the Affordable Care Act.
We know we can make improvements
to the Affordable Care Act. I would like
to see pharmaceutical prices go down. I
would like to pass my bill to allow
Medicare to negotiate cheaper prices
for prescription drugs. We could have a
vote on that. I would love to see the
bill I had with Senator McCain, and
now Senator GRASSLEY, come up for a
vote that would allow less expensive
drugs to be brought in from other
countries that are safe, like Canada. I
would like to see a vote on the bill that
Senator GRASSLEY and I have to stop
pay-for-delay, where pharmaceuticals
pay off generics to keep their products
off the market.
We have already seen what kind of
healthcare proposal my Republican
colleagues have put forward. We saw it
just last year. The legislation we saw
last Congress would have hurt people
by kicking millions off of Medicaid, by
letting insurance companies charge
people more when they get sick, and by
jacking up healthcare costs.
Every major group you trust, when it
comes to your health, was opposed—
the largest groups of doctors, nurses,
seniors, hospitals, people with cancer,
Alzheimer’s, heart disease, diabetes.
Why were they opposed to repealing
the Affordable Care Act? Because there
was nothing good that was proposed to
replace it.
We cannot spend the next 2 years
going backward and fighting old fights,
as this administration announced they
would do last night. We need to focus
on building on the strengths of the Af-
fordable Care Act, those protections,
and making it even stronger by allow-
ing seniors to negotiate for less expen-
sive drug prices, for bringing in less ex-
pensive drugs from places like Canada,
and for stopping pay-for-delay.
We can also reduce premiums by
passing the bipartisan bill that Sen-
ators ALEXANDER and MURRAY have for
reinsurance, by passing Senator SHA-
HEEN’s cost-sharing bill, by moving on
for a public option which could be sup-
ported with Medicaid, the bill that
Senator SCHATZ has, or Medicare,
which is another bill Senator KAINE
has.
I have always said the Affordable
Care Act was a beginning and not an
end, but guess what. Last night, we
found out this administration truly
wants to end it.
What are real people saying about
this who don’t work in this place?
What are people who actually have to
depend on the protections of the Af-
fordable Care Act saying? I am going to
spend the rest of my time this evening
telling some of those stories, reading
from the letters that I and others have
received about people who have been
protected by the Affordable Care Act,
the very act that this administration
announced last night it wanted to re-
peal—not just partially repeal. They
announced they want to repeal all of it.
What would that do to people? Let’s
hear the stories. Let’s read the letters.
I am going to read 100 letters tonight,
and I am starting, with the first letter,
from my home State.
Bruce from Minneapolis has diabetes.
He was spending $1,000 a month for
medical coverage before Congress
passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010.
Today, he pays $300. He was quoted say-
ing: ‘‘As an individual with pre-exist-
ing conditions, the ACA has helped
save me thousands of dollars and given
me a better lifestyle.’’
Amy of St. Paul said she needs the
Medicaid benefits she gained under the
ACA. What happened to her? She
slipped on an icy driveway, as many
people in Northern States, in this past
winter, have done. Sadly for her, she
had a brain injury when that happened.
The ACA Medicaid benefits helped to
cover her medical costs.
Delaney was able to access a mam-
mogram screening to see if she carries
the same genetic trait that predisposed
several of her relatives to breast can-
cer. I have worked on the EARLY Act—
passed this bill as part of the Afford-
able Care Act—that allowed us to do
more to help especially people who
have genetically tested to have the
same gene, especially, by the way, cer-
tain women in African-American popu-
lations and certain women who are
Jewish. We have found a prevailing
gene that means they are more likely
to get breast cancer when they are
younger, but before we had the Afford-
able Care Act, none of this would have
been covered. None of this would have
been paid attention to.
Delaney wrote that because of the
bill, she was able to access a mammo-
gram screening to see if she had that
trait. Any threat to the ACA concerns
her because the law mandated that
healthcare plans cover recommended
screenings.
Story No. 4. Katherine of Min-
neapolis is trying to regain financial
independence after diabetes forced her
out of her job. For now, she is covered
by a low-income government policy
that would continue if the ACA stays
in place but otherwise it goes away.
She worries that any income from a
part-time job would disqualify her for
coverage and that she would struggle
to find private insurance without the
ACA’s protections for people with pre-
existing conditions.
I think this is really important for
people to know because even if you are
not using those exchanges because
maybe you have employer insurance,
which over half the people in this coun-
try have, the ACA helps you. Do you
know why? It has those prohibitions
that say your insurance can’t kick you
off just because you have a preexisting
condition, just because you are born
with diabetes, just because later in life
you have breast cancer, or, as was the
case before we passed the ACA in a
number of States, if you were a victim
of domestic violence, that was consid-
ered a preexisting condition because it
could happen to you again.
So as I read these letters and tell
these stories, people need to under-
stand that the people who have been
protected are not just the people who
are getting their insurance on the ex-
changes. There are a whole lot of peo-
ple who are on private insurance but
were protected because the Affordable
Care Act made clear that they can’t be
kicked off their insurance.
Story No. 5, letter No. 5. Amy quali-
fies for Medicaid only because the ACA
raised the income limits to be eligible
for the State program for those with
disabilities. She had 73 doctor visits
after she had this head injury, and she
doubts she would have received that
much care without good insurance.
That is the same story we had here in
the letter; it is the same person who
slipped and had a brain jury. This is
another piece of why this is so impor-
tant, because she got a disability when
she slipped, and that means she is con-
cerned that because of the income lim-
its, that could change.
Story No. 6. Kate wrote to me and
shared the following story:
I call my son the baby that almost didn’t
happen. A bright, loving and entirely all-boy
4-year-old, Daniel was a gift to us after I bat-
tled cancer from 27 to 34 years old. Unable to
find care for my cancer after it reoccurred,
my only insurance option even denied my
pap smears and lifesaving tests. Cancer dot-
ted my cervix in an attempt to overtake me;
I refused to allow it to win.
Because of the ACA, I faced a future of
hope—not only for myself, but for cancer sis-
ters who were unable to receive other treat-
ment and died. My best friend’s cancer scans
weren’t covered by her insurance until 2015
and after battling for 3 years, she passed last
year. Special provisions are now in place in
the bill for women’s health. Healthcare is
going to be more affordable for people like

me and my children for years to come. Being
a woman should NOT be a pre-existing condi-
tion.
Story No. 7. Abbey of Minneapolis
was diagnosed with a parasitic infec-
tion at the age of 10 months old. Be-
cause of the ACA, she was still on her
insurance throughout college when she
had to have two brain surgeries and
multiple eye surgeries. It also helps her
pay for the only medicine that treats
her disease.
Story No 8. Mary Jo from Minnesota
is struggling with the costs of sending
three kids to college. She was able to
provide health insurance for her middle
daughter only because the ACA allowed
her to be covered by her father’s insur-
ance. Mary Jo writes that a reversal of
this legislation would ‘‘be the last
straw for us. Please don’t take it away
from us—we’re hanging on by a finger-
nail.’’
I think that is a good one to send to
the White House: This would ‘‘be the
last straw for us.’’ This is someone who
is struggling to keep their kids in col-
lege and who needs the ACA to keep
the kids on their healthcare.
Tara is another one from outside of
my State. Tara’s young son would not
be alive if it weren’t for Medi-Cal. Tara
was laid off from her job just prior to
his birth, and there was an issue with
transitioning to COBRA. Her husband
is self-employed without insurance, so
when her son Benjamin came, he was
uninsured. Tara said:
We were hard-working Americans, but that
didn’t matter when it came to insurance.
Benjamin was uninsurable because of his
heart.
When Benjamin was 2 weeks old, he
was taken to the emergency room,
where they learned he had a congenital
heart defect that was causing him to
go into heart failure. As doctors rushed
to save his life, Tara and her husband
panicked, not knowing how they would
afford any care. Tara’s mom and sisters
offered to sell their houses, and their
extended family looked to liquidate
whatever assets they had. At that
point, someone at the hospital gave
Tara the paperwork for California Chil-
dren’s Services. That is where they
live. They found they were eligible, and
Benjamin’s coverage began shortly
thereafter.
For years, Tara and her family
watched their income levels closely,
keeping their income low, fearing that
Medi-Cal would be terminated. She
didn’t return to work for years. She
emphasizes that they never collected
any other kind of assistance, but she
was left with no choice, knowing that
they would never be able to find other
coverage for Benjamin.
Her mom, who is retired, takes care
of Benjamin and helps her. Tara even-
tually went back to work, but when she
went back to work, her husband was di-
agnosed with hepatitis. He now joins
the millions of Americans who have
preexisting conditions. She wrote:
If the ACA is repealed and I lose my job,
and insurance, my husband and son will lose
access to health insurance we can afford. No
healthcare saving will cover the cost of their
care, not on a teacher’s salary. Benjamin
will soon be an adult and unable to be cov-
ered on my health insurance. I pray he will
be able to afford health insurance.
She says this is what she wants law-
makers to know—that means us, right
here, who work here:
We never collected any other type of as-
sistance, but we had no choice to accept the
[healthcare] coverage. Please consider the ef-
fects of repealing this act on children like
my son and our family. We are real people.
We’re not special. We’re normal Americans.
We work hard, with some extraordinary cir-
cumstances. We don’t want a free ride; we
just want help and for lawmakers to know
we’re not disposable.
Letter No. 10. Kathy from Nevada
says:
Before the Affordable Care Act, there were
times in my life when I had health insurance
and other times when I did not. Some em-
ployers would offer me a plan, and then if I
switched jobs, I’d lose it.
By the way, I can’t tell you how
many times I heard this in my home
State.
She goes on:
I tried to apply for coverage on the indi-
vidual market—
This is before the Affordable Care
Act—
but insurers would deny me when I admitted
[and told the truth] that I had occasional mi-
graines and sinus issues.
In late 2013, I started to notice pain in my
abdomen nearly every time I ate anything.
. . . I drove myself to the nearest urgent
care facility. Many tests and procedures fol-
lowed, and by March I was diagnosed with
Burkitt’s lymphoma, a rare form of non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma that’s extremely ag-
gressive. . . . The diagnosis came at the
worst time imaginable. My mom died unex-
pectedly in January and a tree fell on my
house in February. I found myself running
away to escape because I was completely
overwhelmed and terrified of chemotherapy.
But after about a week, the cancer had
weakened me to the point where I could
barely walk from my car. . . . I went home
to begin cancer treatment.
Because Burkitt’s lymphoma is so aggres-
sive, I needed . . . infusions of chemotherapy
for 51⁄2 days during each round, for a total of
six rounds. These infusions could only be ad-
ministered in the hospital.
When I finally finished treatment, I had
amassed an astronomical amount of medical
bills. . . . If I had not had medical insurance,
I honestly don’t know if I would have been
able to continue.
The gratitude I felt (and continue to feel)
for the ACA and the fact that I have medical
insurance, is off the charts! The thought of
going back to the days of not having medical
insurance is so frightening to me. It almost
feels barbaric, for lack of a better term, for
anyone to be denied the opportunity to take
care of his or her health without the looming
possibility of bankruptcy.
She continues:
It is truly inhumane. I recently moved to
Nevada and enrolled in their exchange. I will
require monitoring for the rest of my life.
Now that the ACA is up in the air, I feel like
I am fighting for my life again! Congress is
trying to take away the one thing that con-
tinues to guarantee access to screenings and
treatment. Because of my age and my cancer
history, any plan that doesn’t have those
protections guarantees that I will be charged
more and that I am at risk for being dis-
criminated against.
Thank you for listening to my story.
Story No 11. Mendy in Virginia says:
My family’s whole world was turned upside
down in September 2015 when my husband,
Ed, survived a massive stroke.
The stroke left Ed severely disabled. He
lost the ability to verbally express himself,
needed a wheelchair, and required help with
all basic functions, including bathing and
toileting.
When the stroke hit, Ed was working for
an insurance company and I was a stay-at-
home mom. His employer was kind enough
to keep us on their health insurance for as
long as they could. But within a couple of
months, it became apparent that the damage
was too severe, and Ed’s recovery would take
too long. His employer had no choice but to
let Ed go, and with that, we lost our health
insurance.
It was frightening—I knew that Ed needed
help and that COBRA was too expensive at
$600 a month. A friend recommended that we
make an appointment with a navigator at
the local health center. I had no idea help
like that even existed, but we walked out of
an appointment with a silver plan for $15 a
month. . . . Our son was able to receive cov-
erage through CHIP.
The insurance is what we can ask for [and
it is good]. It covers Ed’s physical therapy
. . . our family doctor, his cardiologist, neu-
rologist, and all of the medications he needs
to make sure he doesn’t have another stroke.
Now, you can imagine if they didn’t
have this coverage, and if he had an-
other stroke when he is not that old, it
would be even more expensive. Those
are my words that I am adding.
She says:
Almost two years after the stroke, Ed can
move around with the help of a cane, but he
still needs assistance standing.
What are we going to do if we lose access
to insurance?
She continues:
I’m am not being dramatic when I say this
is life or death. My husband will die if we
lose access to affordable coverage.
I wish lawmakers—
And I would add in this case, as we
know from what was announced last
night, this administration—
could understand that they are cutting our
family’s lifeline.
Letter No. 12. Celeste and Larry from
Michigan say:
My husband and I worked our entire lives.
Larry worked as a stone mason, while I pur-
sued a degree . . . in social work. . . . We
. . . saved for retirement. We built up a great
safety net, but it all got yanked away. We’re
now 63 and 61, and I don’t know what we are
going to do if the Senate takes away—
If this administration takes away, I
would add—
our access to Medicaid.
In 2006, Larry was laid off from his job and
he struggled to find another job in light of
the Great Recession. It became really impor-
tant for me to keep my job so that we could
maintain insurance for both of us.
Within a couple of years, Larry began to
experience problems with his memory, and
doctors diagnosed him with early onset Alz-
heimer’s disease.
As we know, by the way, many mil-
lions of Americans are affected by Alz-
heimer’s—some of them way too early
and some of them not expecting it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2003
March 26, 2019
This can happen to any family—what
happened to Celeste and Larry. That is
why taking their word last night and
looking at what they have said they
wanted to do, which is to repeal the Af-
fordable Care Act, would mean that not
only do those who buy insurance on the
exchange lose out, but every American
loses out who could have a preexisting
condition or who does have a pre-
existing condition.
So she says this:
He was diagnosed with early onset Alz-
heimer’s. Unfortunately, because he had
been out of work for so long, he wasn’t eligi-
ble for disability benefits. I had to leave my
job because I became disabled. We were with-
out any insurance until the Affordable Care
Act marketplaces opened. In order to get by,
we sold our houses, spend down our retire-
ment, and took drastic measures to pay our
medical bills and day-to-day living expenses.
That first year, we bought a plan that cost
us only $27 a month. The next year, we quali-
fied for expanded Medicaid.
We paid into the system our entire lives. I
don’t think it is right that lawmakers are
now threatening to take everything away
from us.
She says this:
My parents immigrated to this country.
English wasn’t their first language. Four out
of five of us kids went to college. All of the
grandchildren went to college. Everyone is
doing well because we worked.
My family has collectively paid into the
system more than enough to cover us, but
now they are talking about ripping away
benefits. Where is the justice in that?
She adds this—this woman whose
husband has Alzheimer’s, who was pro-
tected by the Affordable Care Act. Do
you know what she says in this letter?
We are not losers. We are not freeloaders.
We should not have to be embarrassed or
shamed for needing help. There should be
dignity in getting old, and we should be en-
joying our golden years, but that has been
taken away from us. Don’t make it worse.
Story No. 13, Mary and Erich:
Let me tell you about my son Erich. He is
friendly and compassionate. When he grows
up, he wants to be in a band and to be a
Power Ranger. He loves to dance to videos
we find together on YouTube. His greatest
joy comes from being around his friends at
Miracle League Baseball, [and that is a base-
ball league for kids with] special needs,
where he plays third base.
Mary writes:
Erich was born with Down syndrome and a
severe intellectual disability. At 20 years
old, he functions at roughly the level of a
second grader. While many young adults
with Down’s have been able to integrate into
society and take on employment, Erich’s dis-
ability is so profound that he requires full-
time care, and he will never be able to live
independently.
My husband, Mary writes, died suddenly in
2009. So today, it is just Erich and me. After
my husband’s death, I was forced to close
down the business we owned, and we lost ac-
cess to traditional insurance. Erich and I
were able to get coverage through Medicaid.
It has been a critical lifeline over these last
9 years, and I don’t know what would happen
to either one of us if it were to go away.
Through the services provided by Medicaid
and other supportive programs in our com-
munity, I am able to keep Erich at home
where he belongs. He needs Medicare for
speech therapy as he has an enlarged tongue,
small mouth, and weak facial muscles. He
has difficulty communicating and saying
words like ‘‘water’’ [and] ‘‘phone’’. . . . His
sentences are two and three words. Erich is
prone to sinus and allergy infections due to
a smaller cartilage in his nose typical of
Down syndrome. He suffers from skin rashes
due to the infections that he gets. He does
require many prescriptions and doctor’s vis-
its and occasionally a visit to the emergency
room.
As a boomer generation widow, I need to
make sure that I am healthy enough to show
up for him. He has NO ONE else. I depend on
these services, too.
When I hear about potential cuts [to Med-
icaid, when I hear about repealing the Af-
fordable Care Act], I think not just about
Erich, but about all his ‘‘special needs’’
friends he has made over the years at the
school, at the tutoring center, and on the
baseball field. Cutting or capping programs
like Medicaid will devastate us all. Many of
his friends require more services, are wheel-
chair bound, have speech, hearing, heart, and
constant ear problems.
As a society, and the greatest country in
the world, we have to continue to support—
In her words—
our ‘‘special people’’ and families like ours.
These ‘‘special people’’ enrich our lives and
show us what is important . . . caring for
each other, compassion, and friendship.
Story No. 14, Sara in Maryland. She
says:
I am a physician, and the ACA allows me
to document [healthcare issues] better and
more fully. I no longer need to worry that if
a person is designated as, for example, hav-
ing acne and they have a serious condition
later, they will be denied insurance for a pre-
existing condition.
I thought this story in the letter was
interesting because it shows what the
doctors were going through as they
were trying to figure out how they re-
port things so this person isn’t denied
insurance later because they have a
preexisting condition. Now they don’t
have to worry about that anymore, but
if the administration wins—if they win
in their action to repeal the Affordable
Care Act, like they announced last
night they wanted to do—we would go
back to that situation.
Story No. 15, Tracey in Maryland.
She says this:
In 2011, I began dialysis due to end-stage
kidney disease. Before dialysis and well into
it, I worked as a preschool teacher, a notori-
ously low-paying profession. In 2007, when I
changed jobs, I lost my employer-based
health insurance. After 1 year of COBRA, a
local insurance person and a good friend of
ours told me about the Maryland State
Health Insurance Plan. Through that plan, I
was able to qualify. When the ACA began,
the MSHIP [State] plan ended. In a meeting
with a member of Howard County’s Health
Department to figure out how to replace my
insurance under the ACA, he told me that
because of my end-stage kidney disease, I
probably would qualify for Medicare. He was
right. I also have a supplemental plan (Care
First) and a drug plan [through] AARP, and
my parents help pay the premiums for those.
In 2015, I had to stop working because of ex-
haustion caused by dialysis. I then qualified
for disability. In 2016, I had a kidney trans-
plant. Medicare will continue to insure me.
. . . Our hope is that by then I will be back
to work, but my biggest concern is that
without the ACA, my preexisting condition
will prevent me from finding health insur-
ance.
At the end of her letter, she asks a
simple question: ‘‘What will I do
then?’’ That is a question that millions
and millions of Americans want to ask
the President today. They woke up to
read the newspaper or turn on TV and
found out that this administration had
announced that they want to repeal
the Affordable Care Act—not part of it,
no, no, the whole thing. So when they
do this, this means these protections
aren’t in place. So there is a whole ton
of people that joined Tracey in asking:
‘‘What will I do then?’’
Story No. 16, Debbie in New Jersey:
I am a 48-year-old woman with chronic
health issues that require me to visit doctors
every few weeks and take prescription medi-
cations. I suffer from migraines. . . . I also
have herniated discs in my back. . . . I am
self-employed and run two businesses.
Guess what. That means she is con-
tributing in a big way to our economy.
I purchase my coverage on the federal ACA
exchange. Before the ACA—
Or as we know it, the Affordable Care
Act—
I had nowhere to buy affordable insurance
coverage that would actually cover my
health issues. Repealing the ACA will have a
devastating impact on small businesses and
the self-employed, especially those of us
with health problems. I am terrified that I
won’t be able to afford coverage as I inch
closer to the 50–64 age bracket. And if the
ACA is repealed and if there is no market-
place for me to purchase insurance, I will be
forced to close my businesses.
Story No. 17, Stephanie in Massachu-
setts:
I was born with hip dysplasia. I had sur-
gery to correct it at 9 months old. At best,
the issue was corrected to 85 percent of what
a normal hip will do. In college . . . I had hip
pain. I underwent four separate surgeries to
fix cartilage. That meant four sets of pre-op
AND post-op MRIs or other scans and four
sets of post-op hospital stays.
In just 27 years, my family and I racked up
hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical
bills. In recent years, insurance covered . . .
[me].
I’m honestly not sure what repeal of the
ACA means for me, but I guarantee it’ll
make life harder as it will for a lot of people.
I was lucky to have insurance.
Please vote no on any bill that repeals the
ACA. Save my care.
As for this story, even though she
didn’t know quite how it would affect
her, I can tell you that with hip dys-
plasia, something I have, she has a pre-
existing condition, and that would
mean that she couldn’t qualify for in-
surance, especially when it came to
further hip surgeries.
No. 18, Tegan in Ohio:
It would put me at risk of losing coverage
[if you repeal] because of a genetic pre-exist-
ing condition. Congenital dilated cardio-
myopathy killed my grandfather, nearly
killed my aunt, killed my sister, and nearly
killed my brother. When my brother, a 12
year old at the time, needed a heart trans-
plant, doctors told our parents that the in-
surance could simply decide to not cover the
procedure. They had buried a toddler just 4
years earlier, and they were faced with the
possibility of losing another child.
Tegan writes:
We need to ensure that all Americans have
access to care. You can’t predict when you

will get sick or injured, and you can’t pre-
dict when a dangerous genetic mutation may
emerge in your family. How we treat our fel-
low Americans is a measure of who we are as
a people.
That is a good one to send to the
White House tonight.
No. 19, Shirley in Massachusetts. She
writes:
My second daughter was born with liver
disease, which was diagnosed 9 weeks after
her birth and required surgeries and medica-
tions. Pediatricians, cancer specialists, heart
doctors, and family physicians all agree that
. . . [healthcare suggested changes that
would repeal the Affordable Care Act] will
make things worse, not better.
No. 20, Sheila in Illinois:
The ACA allowed us to start a new busi-
ness, in spite of the fact that my husband
was diagnosed in 1992 with hepatitis C after
receiving a tainted blood transfusion in the
‘70s. We became, in her words, job creators
because we were finally able to get coverage
for him outside of employer provided cov-
erage.
She says:
I have been self-employed for 28 years but
have gotten a job because at age 61, the fear
of losing affordable healthcare at my age
could ruin our finances.
No. 21, Carter, 22 months. This is
written by his family.
Meet Carter. He loves cars, swimming, and
building blocks. He requires therapy (speech,
occupational, and physical), orthotics . . .
glasses, and nebulizer machine. He sees an
infectious disease, pulmonologist, and neu-
rologist. His disease is progressive . . . [he
needs healthcare].
Story No. 22, Myka, age 7:
Myka is 7 years old. She loves the Girl
Scouts, ice skating, and playing with her
friends. Myka was born with a congenital
heart defect. What does access to affordable
quality healthcare mean? It means Myka is
still alive.
No. 23, Leonore in New York. She
writes:
I have Parkinson’s, and I have had it for 18
years and have Medicare disability since
2008. I am 62, and the ACA allows me to have
a preexisting condition and . . . [still get
help].
She talks about her son, who is 24
years old and disabled and says:
We’d both be in terrible trouble if we lost
our coverage.
No. 24, Joanna:
My name is Joanna. I am here to share the
story of my daughter Jasmine. . . . I will
start at the beginning of her life, 3 years ago,
when she was . . . inside my belly.
I was four months pregnant . . . when I re-
ceived the most devastating and heart
wrenching news. . . . I was told that my pre-
cious little . . . [baby had a heart problem].
I was told she had one of the most complex
and deadly conditions around.
I was told she would have half a heart with
many of her organs flipped.
But she was given options.
I prayed for a decision. I was quickly re-
minded of the recent Obamacare legislation
that would give Jasmine a chance at life.
One that is hopeful and compassionate, that
protects innocent children like Jasmine
from being denied medical care due to pre-
existing heart conditions, one that refuses to
put a dollar sign on her life by imposing life-
time caps, and one that would ensure essen-
tial healthcare benefits to keep her alive.
She was born, and she had the sur-
gery. She says:
Thank goodness for Essential Health Bene-
fits that allowed me to receive proper mater-
nity care when Jasmine was in the womb
. . . and emergency services.
I am sharing my story today as a plea to
not steal these lifetime protections away
from Jasmine. . . . Please do not tell my
child and children like her that they are too
expensive, not worthy of life any longer.
Please know, this is a life and death fight for
me and my daughter, and I will do every-
thing in my power to protect her and to
stand up for whatever is needed to keep her
alive.
No. 25, Kendall in Oklahoma.
The moment I finally realized what it
meant to be poor and sick in America, I was
sitting by myself in the cancer center an
hour from my home. I had arrived early for
my infusion that day, checked in and gotten
that day’s hospital bracelet. Before I could
be hooked up to an I.V., I was pulled into a
side room and told my insurance had denied
my claim.
That is the story, and that is what is
going to happen over and over again if
we go back to those old days before we
had the Affordable Care Act.
No. 26, Jennifer.
My husband Chris is one of many ACA suc-
cess stories in red state Oklahoma. In Janu-
ary 2006, at age 29 at the time, Chris began
working for a nonprofit that offered
healthcare benefits after a certain period of
employment. A few months later, we went to
the ER thinking he had appendicitis. Doctors
quickly took him to surgery thinking the
same. After several hours, the surgeon (ac-
companied by a chaplain) said he removed a
large tumor from Chris’ colon. He was on the
brink of death with a rare aggressive form of
colon cancer. Removing the tumor increased
his chances for survival but the cancer was
far too advanced for traditional chemo-
therapy. The only course of action at that
point was to see an oncologist every month
for CEA labs and a colonoscopy every 6
months until the oncologist determined he
was out of danger for recurrence. We crossed
our fingers and hoped for the best.
Between 2006 and 2009, Chris tried to get
health insurance but [was] rejected due to
cancer diagnosis being a preexisting condi-
tion. Once the ACA became law, because of
its protections for people with preexisting
conditions, my husband was able to purchase
a [healthcare] policy through the federal ex-
change and continue seeing an oncologist for
needed care.
Miraculously, Chris has not had a recur-
rence—so far. Without ACA protections for
preexisting conditions, my husband will be
forced [and] (priced) out of the market.
Given the high probability for recurrence
and increased costs impeding an early diag-
nosis of recurrence, survival is less likely for
my husband. I cannot bear the thought of
losing my love, my best friend . . . my hero.
Story No. 27 is from Texas. His name
is Mike. All he says is this:
My wife and I are uninsurable without the
ACA. I take life-saving medications.
Think of how many people just write
those simple words.
No. 28, Amanda in Texas.
My son, Cooper, is 3 years old. We found
out he has cystic fibrosis when I was 14
weeks pregnant. Though he has been very
healthy for a child with CF, literally a sim-
ple cold could change that. He will always
have CF, and both preexisting conditions and
lifetime maximums keep us up at night. Just
being insured won’t mean anything if there
is a lifetime maximum. By the time he
reaches grade school, he will likely have ex-
ceeded the typical ‘‘million dollar max-
imum’’ we dread so much. Please keep our
boy healthy.
She pleads not to repeal the Afford-
able Care Act.
No. 29, Adele in Massachusetts.
I was diagnosed with epilepsy at 18 years
old. Beforehand, I was dealing with chronic
depression which required high doses of
antidepressants. . . . My mother is a single
parent and I am currently 22, so we try our
best to be able to afford our medications.
. . . If the ACA [is repealed] it is possible
that we will no longer be able to afford our
medicines and that I could fall into a deep
depression. . . . If the ACA repeal is passed I
will no longer be proud to be an American.
No. 30, Helen in North Carolina.
Insuring me through COBRA when my hus-
band retired would have cost us a full third
of our small, fixed income. The ACA provided
[us] not only assured access to health insur-
ance for me, but insurance with a premium
and an out-of-pocket maximum that fits
[with] our budget.
So many of these stories involve peo-
ple trying to fit their budget with
healthcare.
She writes:
That insurance allows me to continue my
treatments for my illnesses. Without my
medications, I will be in extreme pain, will
have more joints eroding to the point of
being nonfunctional, and will be landing in a
hospital multiple times a year. . . . Without
the tax subsidy I get through the ACA, my
insurance premiums plus the max for my
current plan would cost 80% of our income.
No. 31, Jennifer in Arizona.
I am an attorney and have been employed
full-time since graduating law school in 2006.
I take care of myself, make healthy choices,
and work hard. I have encountered multiple
medical challenges in the last 15 years. I was
diagnosed with thyroid cancer in my first se-
mester of law school and had surgery to re-
move my thyroid over Christmas break that
year. The surgery damaged my [parathyroid]
glands which produce a hormone that helps
the body process calcium. I have to take re-
placement thyroid hormone, activated Vita-
min D, and calcium supplements to stay
healthy. Over the last 15 years my prescrip-
tion costs have gone up from $30 a month to
about $110 a month.
In 2012, I had an unexplained placental
abruption with my first pregnancy and deliv-
ered my son 9 weeks early. He spent 5 weeks
in [intensive care] learning to eat and
breathe.
Last year, my son tripped over his Pull-up
and broke his femur. He was placed in a full-
body cast for almost 8 weeks.
We [have good jobs] with good employer
health coverage.
But here is the problem. Because of
her problems with her thyroid, she
would have a preexisting condition.
They would not get health insurance.
We are working on continuing to be con-
tributing members of society, investing our
savings . . . [and making sure we partici-
pate] in the economy in every way.

community was mobilized as never be-

ilies of people with kids with disabil-
ities, understand more than anyone
how important this preexisting protec-
tion is.
Yet, last night, without regard to
them, without regard to anyone in
America with a preexisting condition,
the administration just announced
they are going all out to repeal these
protections in the Affordable Care Act.
That is what happened.
Debra from Illinois.
Our older daughter is severely disabled. Es-
sentially a preexisting condition since birth.
In 2014 I underwent treatment for Stage 3
. . . breast cancer. I was horrified. Then I
pulled myself together. If I can survive can-
cer, I can survive [this].
But without healthcare, we can’t sur-
vive.
No. 33, Felicia in Texas.
I have struggled with chronic pain for over
20 years. For years I’ve gone to specialist
after specialist, and pain clinic after pain
clinic. No one could tell me why regular ap-
proaches to joint and tendon pain never
worked for me.
Just last year I was finally diagnosed with
. . . a genetic . . . connective tissue disorder.
She goes through and describes what
this means to her: There is no cure for
my chronic condition, only pain man-
agement.
Because these conditions are rare, [these
physicians don’t know] how to help me.
She says she depends on healthcare
specialists. She says she needs the af-
fordable healthcare act because of the
preexisting condition protection. I be-
lieve her.
No. 34, Janet in Illinois.
I have a son who survived cancer and a

No. 35, Elizabeth in Illinois.
I am lucky (for now), in that I have cov-
erage through my employer. That said, even
I could be impacted if lifetime and annual

What if one of my children is diagnosed with
a . . . disease like my best friend’s 5-year-old
daughter was?
No. 36, Patricia in Illinois.
I have a preexisting condition as I have
Multiple Sclerosis. My treatment includes
MRI’s yearly and medications that cost
nearly 60,000 dollars yearly. I am now in
Medicare and Medicaid and would be left
with no options as I am on disability and
could afford no insurance.
No. 37, Noel in Maryland.
I will soon be 26 and off my parents’ health
insurance, and it is thanks to Obamacare
that I have been able to stay on that insur-
ance while I have been struggling with a
chronic disease. . . . I have made great
strides in recovering my health . . . should
not be punished for having a preexisting con-
dition.
No. 38, Megan in Texas.
My dearest friend recently donated her
kidney to a two year old child who was on di-
alysis, and saved his life. At the time of her
donation, Obama was President and pre-
existing conditions seemed protected, and
she didn’t question such a transformative
medical procedure. Pre-existing Condition
coverage must remain in order to protect liv-
ing organ donors and encourage people to
save lives by donating. Who would donate an
organ if they knew insurers could charge
them or not accept them? We must protect
this important provision!
No. 39, Jeffery in Illinois.
I have MS. . . . Every 48 hours I inject my-
self with prescription medication to prevent
the disease from advancing.
If the ACA was repealed, I would not have
protection, and MS would, of course, be con-
sidered a preexisting condition.
The ACA has allowed me to remain a pro-
ductive wage earner supporting myself and
my family.
How many times do you hear this?
Please consider the personal and societal
costs of repealing the ACA.
No. 40, Lauren in California.
When I was a freshman in college, I do-
nated blood to the Red Cross. A couple of
weeks later, a letter from the Red Cross in-
formed me that I had Hepatitis C—I was 18,
living away from home (clear across the
country) for the first time, and I had no idea
what to do or how I might have contracted
the virus. After a year it was determined the
diagnosis was a false-positive . . . but every
blood test since has indicated liver enzyme
levels outside of normal, which means Hepa-
titis C will be a pre-existing condition that
follows me around for the rest of my life. I
just earned my PhD and I’m still looking for
my first postdoctoral job, which means I’ll
need health care coverage until I am insured
by an employer. . . . I’m screwed [if I don’t
have the ACA]. I’ve worked hard to make
good choices for my health, but now an ad-
ministrative mistake that I have no control
over—
That was the information she re-
ceived when she gave blood—
has the potential to wreck my chances for
affordable health insurance [if the ACA pro-
tections aren’t in place].
No. 41, Koula in Texas.
I have high blood pressure & pre-diabetic. I
am retired and currently I’m covered under
my employers plan as a retiree (I pay pre-
miums at twice what an active employee
pays) until the age of 65 then I switch to
Medicare and my employer insurance will
become secondary. If you cut the require-
ments that corporations offer to their em-
ployees and retirees I will be greatly affected
as I’m living on a fixed income. My condition
is heredity and no amount of exercise or di-
eting will ever bring down my blood pressure
enough for it to be normal. . . .
No. 42, Joy in Texas writes:
I would be dead and/or bankrupt without
ACA coverage. Within 6 weeks of moving to
Austin from New York City in 2012, I was di-
agnosed with stomach cancer; I had had
breast cancer . . . I came with insurance as-
sociated with my business, a plan unavail-
able in Texas. When that expired, I was kind
of stunned to discover I was uninsurable. . . .
For the next 6 months, I was in the state
pool and basically self-insured until the ACA
became effective. . . . Although not perfect,
it provided the coverage I needed at a price
point I could afford.
No. 43, Liz writes:
I wish the ACA had been around 10 years
ago. Back then I was almost 30 years into a
happy and successful teaching career. . . .
But then along came that little glitch in the
economy, and schools were tightening belts.
I found myself unemployed, uninsured, and
living with a pre-existing condition requir-
ing very expensive, but life extending medi-
cations. Worse, I was living in a country
where health care is tied to one’s job status.
Jobs were scarce, and age was not on my
side in a tight job market. So I worked in
daycare centers, and did babysitting. My
Cobra ran out. Private insurance was totally
out of reach.
Ultimately I had just one option left: I was
just old enough to retire early as a teacher
and to qualify for retired teacher benefits
with TRS. It was a last resort. . . . By law,
I would no longer be eligible to teach. . . .
Without the ACA, I had to choose between
my job and my life.
No. 44, Jerry writes:
Fifteen years ago I was self-employed and
working furiously to get a new company off
the ground. Things were going fine until I
ran up against a brick wall—health insur-
ance. My wife and I had been happily paying
for health coverage through my previous em-
ployer via COBRA, but then we approached
the time limit allowed under that coverage.
It was impossible for us to buy a policy on
the individual market for two reasons: my
wife had not only been recently treated for
cervical cancer, but she was also pregnant
with our first child.
He says:
Protect our care. Entrepreneurial and cre-
ative Americans deserve the freedom to
chase our dreams without having to risk fi-

prehensive . . . healthcare. Isn’t that risk-
taking spirit . . . what . . . [people say] . . .
is needed to build our economy ever higher?

made him ineligible for employee health in-
surance. . . . Due to a preexisting condition
he contracted as a teenager, however, he was
denied affordable insurance. . . . We oppose
the repeal of the ACA because the denial of
healthcare to individuals based on their em-
ployment status, their economic status, or
their health conditions is deeply unethical
and ultimately deadly.

That is what a lot of people in Amer-

No. 49, Darla in Michigan writes:
I’m on disability from chronic pain because
of a doctor’s mistake with back surgery. I
am going to have my fifth back surgery. I
live alone and am on disability. I already pay
huge premiums.
She says: If you repeal the Affordable
Care Act, ‘‘I will be homeless.’’
No. 50. Nathan in Michigan writes:
I am a builder who builds and maintains
homes for many of the wealthiest people in
our State. I have worked hard and climbed
my way to the top over the last 20 years.
None of the employers in my area offered in-
surance, and only until the ACA was I able
to afford the healthcare I need. I have severe
asthma and have arthritis in my right hip.
Even with the ACA, we still struggle to pay
my medical bills, but we manage.
He says:
Now, we are worried that . . . [if we lose
the ACA] I could be priced right out by being
put in a high-risk pool because I have pre-
existing conditions. I am making top dollar
working for the people who are going to reap
the profits. . . .

My husband has been disabled from a

lies. If Mental Health Services are dropped
. . . I will not be able to support my family.
My husband and I are both seniors and an-
ticipate insurance premium rates going up.

Act]. . . . we both have preexisting condi-
tions.
Erika in Washington writes:
I have triplet sons, each of which have all
had a form of healthcare issues that would
be deemed under this plan to now be pre-ex-
isting conditions.
I can’t fathom the thought that another
woman or a mom would not be alive or her
children would not receive the same care we
have. I will stand against anyone who
threatens my children’s future access to
health. I don’t know a single mother who
won’t be right there alongside me.
Well, I think they are going to have
to go to the White House now because
we just heard last night that they want
to repeal the entire Affordable Care
Act.
No. 53, Marcy writes:
I’m in fairly good physical health, but
mental health has been a lifelong struggle
for me. I take medication and have turned to
therapists . . . several times over the years.
I do my best to stay mentally healthy. But
there have been many times when I needed
help. . . . I believe everyone should have ac-
cess to mental healthcare. It’s not some-
thing you should choose as part of your
health care plan or not.
We ALL need full, comprehensive, excel-
lent healthcare coverage. Essential coverage
for mental health, maternity care, well care
check-ups, medication, etc. is important for
EVERYONE.
No. 54, Samantha in Massachusetts
writes:
My husband has a genetic kidney disorder
. . . and at the age of 47, needed a kidney
transplant. He is now, thanks to the mir-
acles of modern medicine and the incredible
generosity of his donor, back at work, pay-
ing taxes, and living a good life. The trans-
plant took place one week before the last
election, and the last thing we did before the
surgery was vote early—in large part to try
to stave off the repeal of the ACA. My hus-
band’s prospects are very good. . . . The fi-
nancial implications to both my family and
the kidney donors are impossible to predict
or calculate, but the cost of losing
ObamaCare would be steep, terrifying, and
entirely un-American.
No. 55, Amal in Tennessee writes:
I feel ridiculously lucky that the ACA ex-
isted when I had my baby, and here’s why:
My husband and I were both freelancers
when I got pregnant and were on ObamaCare
in New York. When I was 5 months pregnant,
we moved to Nashville for his job, which
didn’t provide insurance. Because of the
ACA, we were able to buy coverage, even
though somehow pregnancy is considered a
preexisting condition. It could once again be-
come the basis for an insurance company to
reject you or to increase your premiums if
the ACA is repealed.
Denying a pregnant woman insurance cov-
erage can have far-reaching effects. She
might stay in an unhealthy job to maintain
coverage, or stay in an unhealthy or abusive
marriage to maintain her husband’s cov-
erage. A family might forego a good oppor-
tunity to move for a better life for their
child. . . .
No. 56, Matthew in Washington
writes:
I was diagnosed with a chronic medical
condition when I was 9. Growing up, I was
fortunate to have a mother who was able to
fight for me, from keeping me enrolled in a
public school to getting me access to experi-
mental drugs at any of trials. . . . But I also
saw her in tears over medical bills when my
father was laid off after 9/11 and we had to go
on COBRA, and how draining negotiations
with insurance companies were.
I am now successful, independent, and
working in international relations in Wash-
ington, D.C., which I love. If the ACA is re-
pealed, I will live in constant fear of being
laid off or fired and losing my insurance, or
worry that I will have a flare-up that would
devastate me financially.
No. 57, Page writes:
I was fired in 2015 when I was 5 weeks preg-
nant. Thank goodness we had the Affordable
Care Act because I could not be discrimi-
nated against under any preexisting condi-
tion limitations. I knew my maternity care
would be covered. I logged onto the ex-
change, compared plans, [and] signed up . . .
I’m just so grateful that happened for me.

I’m a member of a union that takes care of
me, but a lot of people are not that fortunate
and I’m scared for them. I have family mem-
bers with preexisting conditions, and by
every accounting, this bill, if it passes, is
going to take coverage away from people
who are vulnerable. . . .
No. 60, Samantha writes:
I’m fighting the repeal of the ACA because
my father has a preexisting condition and
he’s hoping to retire in the next few years. I
don’t believe plans should be changed be-
cause of a bill that would remove protections
for people with preexisting conditions. . . .
No. 61, Golchin from Nevada writes:
It will be really hard for us to get insur-
ance since I will be [considered having a pre-
existing condition]. . . . We would love to
start our family. . . . Having kids is all we
talk about, so please don’t take that away
from many of us.
No. 62, Cathy writes:
ObamaCare saved my life. I had health in-
surance. I needed brain surgery. My health
insurance company kept delaying approvals.
. . . Because they refused to pay for a CT
scan that was needed to confirm a diagnosis,
I had to pay for one out of pocket. . . . But,
because of the public pressure, when
ObamaCare was being drafted, my surgery
was eventually approved by the insurance
company in 2009.
I am deeply concerned that legislation re-
pealing ObamaCare could leave in place dev-
astating and historic cuts to my hospital.
Please do not gut protections for those of us
with preexisting conditions. . . . Do not
eliminate services for special needs kids.
No. 63, Jennifer in Nevada writes:
If the ACA is repealed, my healthcare
might go away and I could never afford con-
tinuing care with my . . . [heart condition]
. . . and my husband’s arthritic condition.
When my battery runs out in four years, if I
don’t have health insurance, I’ll probably die
or have to go bankrupt. . . . My brother also
has heart trouble. . . . And for what? So that
the wealthy can have more . . . ? Our govern-
ment is supposed to work for our best inter-
ests. . . .

In 1986 to 1987, I was diagnosed with [ge-
netic] breast cancer and was told I had a 25
percent chance of living 5 years. I quit my
job to have medical treatment, and, after
COBRA coverage ran out, was put in a high-
risk pool (Illinois). My insurance payments
were high . . . I had to go back to work to
pay for . . . [them]. If that’s what happened
30 years ago . . . [what would happen now if
I had a preexisting condition and couldn’t
get insurance coverage]?
No. 65, Michelle writes:
I have had three surgeries for the ‘‘chronic
disease’’. . . . Prior to ACA, these surgeries

No. 66, Elizabeth writes:
Please do not allow States the ability to
opt out of holding insurances companies ac-
countable to cover essential health benefits
like maternity care, mental health treat-
ment, and rehabilitation treatment. As an
elementary public art educator, I know first-
hand the importance of [the] mental health
care [provision]. The school district I serve
. . . has suffered the loss of four students
who have taken their own lives just this year
to battles with mental and emotional issues,
the youngest of whom was 12 years old and a
former student of mine from the first year I
taught. . . . These saddening and possibly
preventable deaths have rocked our commu-
nity. Coverage for mental health and treat-
ment will allow parents the ability to seek
help for their children whose precious lives
hang in the balance in the politics of
healthcare. Affordable care helps
destigmatize mental and emotional illnesses,
giving these students the confidence and
ability to speak up.
People have long stories, and they
care about this a lot.

would not have been available to her before
she had health insurance. Through good
care, hard work, and persistence, she is alive
and again a productive member of society.
Please do not take healthcare away from
people like my friend Mary.
No. 68, JoSelle in Florida:
I am self-employed as a freelance editor
and writer and have been for most of my
post-college life. Unfortunately, I also have
preexisting conditions.
Pre-ACA, I was ineligible for insurance de-
spite taking some of the cheapest, most com-
mon medications on the marketplace. I was
forced into a high-risk pool in the State
where I lived at the time, Utah, which placed
an enormous financial burden on me. . . .
Post 2014, I can afford to pay for my insur-
ance.
Of course, the ACA isn’t perfect. I am sym-
pathetic to those who faced premium in-
creases under it or who found their access to
healthcare diminished. However, the logical
thing to do is to improve it, not demolish it.
That is a pretty good line. Send that
one to the Justice Department.
I urge all people reading this to stop and
think. Whether you voted for Clinton or
Trump, whether you preferred one of their
primary challengers to either of them,
whether you live in a red, purple, or blue
State . . . it does not do to not have the Af-
fordable Care Act.
No. 69, Kat in Kansas:
I had advanced stage 3 breast cancer and
inflammatory breast cancer. I am now on
disability. Contrary to what many have said,
I did nothing to bring this on myself. I ate
right and exercised. I didn’t smoke. My can-
cer was genetic. So was the heart problem I
had. I did not ask for this. Disability is no
picnic. I can barely make ends meet. If the
ACA is repealed, I will be homeless at the
best and, at worst, dead.
No. 70, Lois in New York:
Breast cancer runs throughout my family
on both my parents’ sides. My mother, aunt,
and cousins have all had this disease. Some
have died from it, including my mom. When
I was 23, I had a lump removed. Luckily, it
was benign. The anxiety, pain of discovery,
and treatment are excruciating enough with-
out having to worry if you can afford care.
No. 71, Penny in New York:
My son has a life-threatening preexisting
condition for which he received medical
treatment and medication through the ACA
expansion of Medicaid in the State where he
lives. Without this, he will be unable to pay
for his medications and doctors’ visits and
will surely decline. Both my mother and my
husband’s father were able to be cared for in
nursing homes, until their dying days, be-
cause of Medicaid. I am desperate to make
sure we keep our healthcare.
Thank you for listening.
No. 72, Jen:
In 2015, I donated a kidney to a stranger,
kicking off a chain of three transplants. I
didn’t have to worry about how it would af-
fect my health insurance because, thanks to
the ACA, I could never be charged more or be
denied coverage because I shared my spare
kidney. I am 55 years old and self-employed.
This repeal will be a direct attack on my fi-
nancial and health security.
No. 73, Jolene:
I know many of my friends rely on Med-
icaid. Losing it means the loss of their lives.
They cannot afford their medications with-
out the ACA.
No. 74, Deborah:
My family’s story is over, but I want peo-
ple to know how much the ACA meant to us
at a very difficult time. Our niece, a single
adult, lost her job and her insurance cov-
erage when she was in the middle of the fight
for her life, battling advanced melanoma.
Because of the ACA, she was able to sign up
for insurance on the marketplace. I will be
very honest and say it wasn’t easy, and she
was forced to change insurance companies
because of changes in available plans. How-
ever—and this is big—
she writes in capital letters, sort of
similar to the President’s tweets—
she was able to get coverage despite the fact
that she was very ill. Anyone who has
watched a loved one suffer from this dev-
astating disease of melanoma knows how
terrible it is. Even though she eventually
succumbed to the melanoma that had spread
throughout her body, she was able to have
continued quality medical care and, eventu-
ally, hospice care until her death. I beg you
to consider how your decisions will impact
people. Even the least of those among us—
That was a quote she put—
deserve the dignity of receiving quality med-
ical care.
Think about this. This is a story of
someone whom she lost in her family,
and she is making a point that, I think,
many would make in this Nation. Even
when people are going to die, they
want to have them die peacefully. They
want them to have good healthcare.
They don’t want to have them taken
off of their insurance because of pre-
existing conditions.
Story No. 75 talks about how a finan-
cial burden in the early 2000s forced
him into bankruptcy. The reduction of
work hours and required continuing
medical costs left him unable to afford
healthcare.
Now, with the potential loss of affordable
healthcare on the horizon, my wife is facing
a similar situation with her preexisting con-
dition.
He writes:
Anyone is one step away from a financial
disaster due to the onset of a serious medical
condition. Believe me, I lived it first hand,
and I didn’t see it coming. I think most peo-
ple who get suddenly sick would say the
same thing. They have gone through their
lives. They are working hard. They didn’t see
it coming. That is why we need the protec-
tions of the Affordable Care Act.
No. 76, Jackson:
Most of the people in my family are likely
to lose coverage without anything less than
the protections established in the ACA. Any
one of us without the ACA would be one car
accident or illness away from bankruptcy.
That kind of says it all.
No. 77, Allison in Utah:
My husband and I are self-employed, so we
buy our insurance on the open market. Al-
though we were much healthier than some
people when we applied for insurance prior to
the ACA, we were both rated out because of
preexisting conditions. I was even rejected
by one company. This seemed ridiculous
since the preexisting conditions that caused
the rate increases were injuries from being
active and were both completely resolved.
This made our insurance astronomically ex-
pensive.
When I say we are healthy, we really are
healthy. We are lean; we are trim; we are in
our mid forties; but we can run, hike, climb,
and do more pushups than most people in
their mid-20s. We eat healthy, exercise hard,
and never get sick. At the most, we might
catch one cold a year between the both of us.
Since the ACA, we have had no problem
getting health insurance, and we are not
rated out because of preexisting conditions,
but the best part is we feel comfortable that
we have health insurance. Now it sounds like
people are scheming to take away the pro-
tection we enjoy under the ACA.
OK. They are not just scheming.
They actually announced last night to
the entire country that they were
going to do this. People woke up. They
watched the TV. They looked at their
newspapers. The administration said,
yes, it is not going to repeal just part
of the ACA; it is going to repeal the
whole ACA.
It goes on to read:
We are against their attempt to take away
the mandate that prohibits insurance compa-
nies from discriminating against individuals
with preexisting conditions.
No. 78, Erin in Missouri:
Ours is a story of a genetic mutation that
none of us could fathom would bring incred-
ible health challenges to our family. We are
the lucky few that have jobs that provide us
with insurance. My grandfather’s sister was
the first to be diagnosed with breast cancer.
My mother’s cousin and her sister were next.
Then my mom was diagnosed with uterine
cancer. Then I came along at 32 with the di-
agnosis and then my sister. Now, as I type
this note, my 78-year-old mother awaits an-
other radiology appointment.
This story is filled with heartbreak and
much love. These are the things patients
should have to worry about, not whether
they can afford their care or be discrimi-
nated against because they carry a gene that
is beyond their control.
No. 79, Mary in Massachusetts:
We have MassHealth and great hospitals.
Without both of these, my daughter would
have died at birth. Everyone, no matter their
income, deserves proper access to healthcare
even if you have a preexisting condition or a
previous illness. Every time I look at my
daughter, it affirms this.
No. 80, Brent:
When I graduated high school, my dad in-
formed me that he had paid enough for my
health insurance, and now that I was an
adult, he wasn’t going to pay for it anymore.
That’s it. That was the entire conversation.
I had no idea how to get health insurance for
myself, much less how to pay for it, so I just
went without for 7 years. Within that time,
I had health problems.
My sister lives in France.
He talks about her getting protec-
tions.
Instead of being punished, we should be
able to have healthcare. This is no way to
run a democracy. This is no way to be a de-
cent human.
No. 81, Tina in Texas:
I have stage 4 colon cancer, and I am cur-
rently on private insurance. I will be forced
on to Medicare in another year as I am cur-
rently on disability. My life span is at risk if
the provision to cover preexisting conditions
is abandoned. I have literally risked my life
in order to participate in a phase 1 drug trial
to help advance our knowledge of treating
cancer. How good is that knowledge if we
will not be covered?

No. 83, Nicole in Kansas:
I am writing on behalf of my 15-month-old
daughter, Mira. I experienced a normal preg-
nancy, a normal birth, and a normal mater-
nity leave, but around the 4-month mark, we
learned that Mira had a neurological dis-
ability that may very well render her unable
to walk or talk. I could not return to work
for a year while I was acting as her mom.
The ACA is the only thing that kept our
family afloat in the most difficult year of
our lives. If the ACA is repealed, Mira, who
has absolutely no control over the state of
her health—
a 15-month-old kid—
she will suffer needlessly. Please help us.
No. 84, Jane:
I am a psychologist with a Ph.D., employed
for the past 30 years in community mental
health centers. I have a serious preexisting
condition that made me completely uninsur-
able before the ACA. Access to healthcare
matters.
No. 85:
Because the ACA mandates access to free
mammograms, I got one this year that re-
sulted in a breast cancer diagnosis. Because
the ACA mandates coverage for genetic test-
ing, I was able to have that done and found
out I have a gene that means I am at risk for
cancer. My risk of ovarian cancer was 60 per-
cent. My risk of breast cancer recurrence
was 70 percent. I get to ensure that won’t
happen to me. Yes, early menopause and a
mastectomy suck, but they are a whole lot
better than radiation, chemo, and possibly
death.
No. 86, Ashley:
In 2012, at the age of 29, I had my first job
and was diagnosed with a heart disease. This
is a pregnancy-induced form of heart failure
that occurs in women with no prior history
of heart disease. My recovery has been a long
and brutal one of heart disease. I was on a
life vest—a portable defibrillator—for the
first month, and I should have been on it
longer. I will always have a preexisting con-
dition. The ACA makes me safe.
No. 87, Lea:
I am a wife, mother, grandmother, sister,
aunt, and great aunt. In my family, my hus-
band and I owned a small business and
couldn’t change health insurance because of
a preexisting condition in one of my chil-
dren. As a sister, I watched my older sister
fight cancer while still working 12-hour
shifts as an RN. As a great aunt, I have
watched my niece handle two sons with med-
ical conditions. These people deserve the
health insurance that does not have any life-
time maximums, and they should be able to
pay reasonable premiums.
No. 88, Hillary from New York City
and Kansas.
Although I live in New York now, Kansas
City is home. I was raised in KC, attended
Shawnee Mission Schools and KU. My
friends, family, and a piece of my heart re-
main there. I was born with spina bifida, so
I have always had a preexisting medical con-
dition. I need affordable healthcare.
No. 89.
Eleven years ago, I had just turned 23.
She talks about her pregnancy, how
she needed the protection, and how the
Affordable Care Act—now that she has
a preexisting condition and has a pho-
tography business and her husband’s
work insurance doesn’t cover her, ACA
has saved her and allowed her to work,
and she has a beautiful baby.
No. 90, Laura.
My son Danny was born at 30 weeks gesta-
tion via emergency C-section. He was diag-
nosed with spastic cerebral palsy at the age
of 1. Without the protections of the ACA, we
would not have him. Now we don’t have to
worry about lifetime limits, preexisting con-
ditions, and the security of knowing we
could keep him on our insurance until he is
26.
No. 91, Kerry.
My initial surgery, a bulging disk, hap-
pened when I was 17 and a senior in high
school. When I was 18, the disk herniated. I
had back surgery at 19, and then I felt like a
new person. No more crawling to the bath-
room every morning, no more chronic pain.
In June 2003, I was days away from being
kicked off my parents’ insurance when I re-
injured my back.
Then she talks about how, later, the
ACA helped her.
Now I am going to finish up with let-
ters from my own State.

without protections for individuals
with preexisting conditions, she would

from Minnesota is concerned that

her young son, Hudson, who has asth-
ma and a rare food allergy. Without
protections for individuals with pre-
existing conditions, Julie believes Hud-
son will be forced into a plan that will
dramatically reduce his access to
healthcare or, worse, prevent him from
getting health insurance to begin with.
No. 97, Sarah. Sarah was diagnosed
with stage IV colon cancer when she
was 34 and has undergone countless
rounds of chemo. She fears what the
‘‘scarlet letter’’ of having a preexisting
condition will mean for her access to
care and wonders how she will be able
to receive the most cutting-edge treat-
ments.
No. 98, Kate. I remember Kate. Kate
did a video, and she became famous.
She wrote to me about her son, Cooper,
who has severe, nonverbal autism. Be-
cause of Medicaid, Cooper has access to
the care he needs, and Kate can keep
her job. Why were they famous? Cooper
was featured on Jimmy Fallon and the
‘‘Today’’ show for being the cutest tod-
dler to say ‘‘mama.’’ He started a con-
test, and his mom Kate decided to
enter herself and her son saying
‘‘mama.’’ Cooper can’t speak, but he
uses a speech device to help him com-
municate. She sent in her video, that
was the one they picked, and Cooper
became a star.
Kate is afraid that changes to Med-
icaid could force her to quit her job in
order to take care of Cooper. How could
she explain that to her sons?
This is another story of someone who
has a family member—in this case, her
beloved son—with a disability that
would then be considered a preexisting
condition. Maybe there would be a way
to cover him, of course, under dis-
ability insurance, but then you start
messing with whether his mom can
work. We would be right back where we
were before these protections took
place.
Story No. 99, Penny of St. Paul.
Penny works with disabled veterans,
but she has a chronic condition of her
own—rheumatoid arthritis. Thank-
fully, her current insurance allows her
to get the care she needs. But without
the ACA, Penny is concerned that she
and many others with treatable condi-
tions will be unable to afford their
medications.
Last, Ariane. Ariane had triplets at
just 28 weeks, and her pregnancy in-
cluded three hospitals stays and
bedrest. Without the ban on lifetime
caps, Ariane said she would have lost
everything.
Those are just 100 stories. Think of
the millions more, the millions of peo-
ple who would like to tell the President
and the Justice Department and this
administration what it would mean if
what they said they wanted to do last
night actually happened. These are just
100 people from across the country.
I hope my colleagues are listening to
this because just last night, this ad-
ministration announced that they were
going to go all-out, that they were
going to do everything to repeal the
Affordable Care Act. These 100 people
are not going to let this happen. You
have heard the stories of those moms
who will do anything for their kids
with disabilities. You heard the story
of the woman who, while her family
member was lost to melanoma, that
coverage for a girl who would have had
a preexisting condition allowed her to
have a peaceful life in her last weeks of
life.
These are the stories this administra-
tion needs to hear to understand that
this isn’t just some political battle to
see how this sits with your base, to be
against ObamaCare; these are real
Americans with real healthcare needs.
We will fight this on their behalf to the
end.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

HANNAH KING HOOVER
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 26, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Hannah King
Hoover for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge
Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
Hannah King Hoover is a student at Three
Creeks K–8 and received this award because
her determination and hard work have allowed
her to overcome adversities.
The dedication demonstrated by Hannah
King Hoover is exemplary of the type of
achievement that can be attained with hard
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of
their education and develop a work ethic
which will guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to Han-
nah King Hoover for winning the Arvada
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth
award. I have no doubt she will exhibit the
same dedication and character in all of her fu-
ture accomplishments.

HONORING THE LAKE HAVASU
CITY VETERANS TREATMENT
COURT
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 26, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the Lake Havasu City Veterans
Treatment Court located in Lake Havasu City,
Arizona. My district is home to 90,000 vet-
erans and the Lake Havasu City Veterans
Treatment Court has proven to be one of the
most effective programs in improving the lives
of our nation’s veterans.
The Lake Havasu City Veterans Treatment
Court was awarded a SAMHSA grant of al-
most a million dollars over a three-year period,
beginning in September 2017, one of four Vet-
erans Treatment Courts in the country to re-
ceive this grant. The grant aims to benefit vet-
erans who are participants of the Veterans
Treatment Court and those who are ineligible
to receive local VA treatment services. The
grant also merged the Lake Havasu City and
Kingman Veterans Treatment Courts in order
to benefit all the veterans of Mohave County.
The success of the program speaks for
itself. Over a five year period, the program has
only experienced a 6.5 percent recidivism rate
amongst graduates. When the graduates were
asked what they felt was most helpful in the
program, 87.5 percent of graduates felt it was
their positive interaction with the judge, 73.6
percent felt it was their community service.
I want to especially commend Judge Mitch-
ell Kalauli, Veterans Treatment Court Coordi-
nator Colene Lowery, and Court Administrator
Jennifer Harrold for their incredible work in
leading this program. They truly represent
what is great about this country and the state
of Arizona. The veterans of Mohave County
and the entire state of Arizona are incredibly
grateful for their hard work.

HONORING MRS. CHARLOTTE BENT
HON. MARTHA ROBY
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 26, 2019
Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Mrs. Charlotte W. Bent for her years of
service to the people of Alabama’s Second
District and my office.
Charlotte grew up in Troy, Alabama, and
she spent time during college in Virginia, New
York City, and Florence, Italy. She graduated
from Troy University in Troy, Alabama, with a
degree in Fine Art and Art History.
Prior to joining my staff in 2011, Charlotte
worked several different positions, including
jobs with Eastern Airlines and with her own
sister’s Sister Shubert’s Homemade Rolls. In
2000, Charlotte joined former Congressman
Terry Everett’s staff as a Constituent Services
Representative. Then, Charlotte graciously
came back to serve Alabama’s Second District
and joined my original staff as a caseworker in
my Montgomery district office.
Charlotte has dedicated much of her profes-
sional life to serving the constituents of Ala-
bama’s Second District. During her time in my
office and in Congressman Everett’s office,
Charlotte worked to resolve various types of
casework problems to better the lives of those
in need of assistance. Throughout her time on
Team ROBY, Charlotte proved to be a dedi-
cated staff member with a strong commitment

RECOGNIZING CLARK COUNTY’S
BICENTENNIAL
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 26, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, Illinois’
Clark County was formed in 1819 out of
Crawford County. At the time of its formation,
Clark County included about a third of Illinois
and extended as far north as the present state
of Wisconsin. Clark County was so large that
it gave birth to many of its sister counties:
Pike County and Fayette County in 1821,
Edgar County two years later, and Coles
County in 1830.
Clark County enjoys an illustrious history.
The county was named for George Rogers
Clark, the older brother of William Clark of the
Lewis and Clark Expedition. George Rogers
Clark was an officer of the army of Virginia
that captured the Northwest Territory from the
British during the Revolutionary War.
Clark County’s first courthouse was a log
house located in Aurora, and the county seat
was in Darwin Township, but by popular vote
Marshall was designated the new seat in
1839. In the late 1800s, county leaders be-
lieved they were outgrowing their latest build-
ing, so a fourth courthouse was built in 1887.
The current courthouse, which is the county’s
fifth, has been in place since 1903.
The people of Clark County have planned
many festivities to celebrate their bicentennial
this year. The celebration began on January
9th with Clark County Trivia Night, and com-
memorative activities will extend to October. I
am honored to be a part of that celebration.
Madam Speaker, I ask that we pay tribute to
those hearty people who first settled in Clark
County, and to the pioneering spirit that lives
today in all its citizens. I stand today to salute
Clark County on its 200th anniversary and to
wish it the very best in the future.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIONS
CLUB OF MONTCLAIR, VIRGINIA
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 26, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to use this time to recognize the Lions
Club of Montclair, Virginia. The club will cele-
brate their forty-first year anniversary in June
2019. The Montclair Lions club was founded in
1979 at the Montclair Country Club and elect-
ed their first president, Mr. Ron Milam, soon
thereafter. As part of the June 2019 celebra-
tion, the one remaining active charter member,
Mr. Terry Tallent, will be assuming the role as
the club’s 41st President.
Over the past forty-years, the club has
raised upwards of a half million dollars and
provided hundreds of thousands of volunteer
hours in support of various charitable organi-
zations and community service projects within
the First District. The Montclair Lions Club has
supported the Old Dominion Eye Bank, train-
ing of leader dogs for the blind, high school
scholarships, Action in Community Trough
Service (ACTS), Boys and Girls Club of Prince
William County, little league baseball teams,
the Boy Scouts of America, Special Olympics
and many more.
The men and women of the Lions Club of
Montclair exemplify the best of the spirit of the
First District. Their lives of patriotism, service,
and selflessness stand as an example to the
ideals founded in the Lions Clubs motto ‘‘We
Serve.’’ Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me
in recognizing this momentous occasion for
the Lions Club of Montclair and to wish them
the brightest future.

INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION
RECOGNIZING PEOPLE OF AFRI-
CAN DESCENT AND BLACK EURO-
PEANS
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 26, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce a resolution with my good
friends and colleagues, Representatives
GREGORY MEEKS of New York, GWEN MOORE
of Wisconsin, and JOHN LEWIS of Georgia,
which recognizes People of African Descent
and Black Europeans.
Our resolution would observe the history
and current situation of People of African De-
scent living in Europe and Black Europeans
during the United Nations designated Inter-
national Decade for People of African De-
scent. It also encourages the U.S. Secretary
of State to take a number of steps to ensure
their situation is improved following rec-
ommendations from last year’s People of Afri-
can Descent Week (PADWEEK) held by our
colleagues in the European Parliament in
Brussels, Belgium May 13–17, 2018.
As it was quite rightly put by European Par-
liamentarian Cecile Kyenge, ‘‘The People of
African Descent Week reaffirms European val-
ues by developing strategic and coherent re-
sponses to make our society more inclusive in
the face of rising racial prejudice and violence
across Europe.’’ Recommendations from the
week included a European Black History
Month and Remembrance Day for Victims of
Colonialism and Enslavement; a fund for Black
European led initiatives to address continuing
disparities and discrimination and support for
empowerment initiatives; European-wide strat-
egies for the inclusion of People of African De-
scent; and support for transatlantic exchanges
on common issues of racial prejudice and dis-
crimination.
The need for recognition of Black popu-
lations in Europe became clear ten years ago
when I chaired a U.S. Helsinki Commission
hearing entitled, The State of (In)visible Black
Europe: Race, Rights, and Politics, where we
learned that the situation in Europe is very
similar to the one in the United States. While
the presence of Blacks in Europe can be
traced to enslavement, colonization, military
deployments, voluntary or forced migration,
the movement of refugees and asylum seek-
ers, or educational and other professional ex-
changes, the story of Europeans of African
Descent and Black Europeans still remains
largely untold, rendering many of their past
and present contributions to the very fabric of
Europe unseen or forgotten, which is unac-
ceptable.
Madam Speaker, it is my hope that when
we gather in the years to come to review the
efforts of the United Nations designated Inter-
national Decade for People of African De-
scent, we will not only speak of how our ef-
forts resulted in our respective nations publicly
recognizing the injustices and long-term im-
pact of slavery and colonialism, but also of
how our societies reconciled these issues in a
manner that ensured equal opportunity, ac-
cess, and justice for all people of African de-
scent.

INTRODUCTION OF THE RFK ME-
MORIAL STADIUM CAMPUS CON-
VEYANCE ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 26, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill, the RFK Memorial Stadium
Campus Conveyance Act, to direct the federal
government to sell for fair market value the
Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium (RFK)
to the District of Columbia.
RFK, once an active sports stadium, for
years has been a rusted stadium surrounded
by deterioration and several parking lots. The
District leases the RFK site from the Depart-
ment of the Interior and, under the terms of
the lease, may only use the land for recre-
ation, stadium purposes and open space. The
lease expires in 2038. The stadium and its
many parking lots comprise 88 percent of the
190-acre campus, which currently has only
22.3 acres of green space and is largely
hardscape.
The District recognizes the vast potential of
this sprawling campus in the heart of the city
to provide significant value to residents while
also strengthening the local economy and
neighborhood. The current lease and its ac-
companying restrictions have limited the Dis-
trict’s ability to make full use of this land, in-
cluding collecting tax revenue. The limited
number of years remaining on the current
lease have also complicated the District’s abil-
ity to plan for the long-term development of
this site and attract private investment.
The District has worked hard to identify cre-
ative utilization options for the property despite
the uncertainty surrounding long-term control
of the land. In August of last year, the District
began work on its efforts to redevelop one of
the site’s many parking lots into multipurpose
playing fields as part of a larger recreation
complex. The conveyance of the site will give
the District the ability to consider more uses
for this site including additional green space
for public use, housing, commercial develop-
ment and other enhancements that would ben-
efit the surrounding neighborhood and the Dis-
trict as a whole.
This bill, at no cost to the federal govern-
ment, would provide the District with the cer-

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to honor Tom Brymer, who is retiring from
his dual leadership roles as the Town Man-

rollment charter school. Under his leadership,
the school’s enrollment has more than dou-
bled, and it has added four additional building
to its campus. Mr. Brymer, in coordination with
Westlake Academy’s faculty and staff, devel-
oped a renowned educational program that

INTRODUCTION OF THE AFRICAN
DESCENT AFFAIRS ACT
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 26, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce the African Descent Affairs
Act. As we continue to highlight the Inter-
national Decade for People of African De-
scent, we have seen a sharp increase in rac-
ism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, homophobia
and other forms of discrimination across the
globe.
Human rights violations emanating from ra-
cial prejudice and discrimination have nega-
tively impacted people of African descent
around the world, resulting in racial bias and
disparities in education, employment, health,
housing, justice, and other sectors.
We must act now to reverse these dis-
turbing trends. The International Decade for
People of African Descent provides an oppor-
tunity to not only draw attention to these in-
equities, but to also join efforts with countries
around the globe to develop and implement
national strategies honoring the vast contribu-
tions of people of African descent and to com-
bat continuing issues of prejudice and dis-
crimination such as those currently gripping
our nation.
To aid these efforts, I have introduced the
African Descent Affairs Act. This bill seeks to
improve the situation of people of African de-
scent around the world by establishing within
the United States State Department a Global
Office of African Descent Affairs to establish
global foreign policy and assistance strategies
for people of African descent; creating a
‘‘Fund’’ to support antidiscrimination and em-
powerment efforts by African descent led civil
society organizations; requiring Annual State
Department Human Rights Reports to include
a section on discrimination faced by people of
African descent; and creating similar initiatives
at the United States Agency for International
Development that can work in partnership with
the State Department.
U.S. foreign policy strategies such as these
have improved the situation of vulnerable
groups internationally and would greatly assist
in responding to increasing levels of prejudice
and discrimination faced by people of African
descent around the globe. The State Depart-
ment has already launched many successful
initiatives that have aided vulnerable popu-
lations, such as the Office of Global Women’s
Issues, the Special Envoy to Monitor and
Combat Anti-Semitism, and special initiatives
focusing on disability, LGBTQ+ and other
communities.
Implementing a Global Office of African De-
scent Affairs will continue this tradition and fa-
cilitate the full and equal participation of peo-
ple of African descent in our society, promote
knowledge of and respect for the diverse herit-
age, culture and contributions of people of Af-
rican descent, and strengthen and implement
legal frameworks that combat racial discrimi-
nation.
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope that my
colleagues will embrace the challenge of com-
bating prejudice and discrimination around the
world. I encourage them to join me in recog-
nizing the collective history and achievements
made by people of African descent by sup-
porting the African Descent Affairs Act.

Tuesday, March 26, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the retirement of Dr. Eliza-
beth (Sissy) Crowther as President of the
Rappahannock Community College. After 15
years as President, Elizabeth will be leaving
the College a better, stronger institution of
higher education and learning.
A Northern Neck native, Sissy grew up on
Bruington Farm in Northumberland County.
Her late father, Rudolph Prosser Crowther,
Sr., was president and then chairman of Lillian
Lumber Company in Northumberland County,
and served on the Rappahannock Community
College local board in the 1980s. After grad-
uating from St. Margaret’s School in
Tappahannock, Crowther attended Virginia
Tech where she received both a bachelor’s
and master’s in English. After college, she
moved to Richmond, where she began a ca-
reer in financial services. She aided J.
Sargeant Reynolds and John Tyler community
colleges with providing educational programs
for their employees. Crowther was inspired by
the change and inspiration she saw, shifting
her career from banking to working in the
community college system.
She was accepted into a doctoral program
at the College of William & Mary, becoming
friends with a colleague who encouraged
Crowther to apply to her first job at Rappahan-
nock Community College. She then advanced
to positions at Lord Fairfax Community Col-
lege and Blue Ridge Community College, ulti-
mately returning to Rappahannock as Presi-
dent. Since 2004, Crowther has provided lead-
ership and oversight for College and commu-
nity initiatives. They include growing the Edu-
cational Foundation’s assets from $1 million to
$11 million; completing facility renovations at
both the Glenns and Warsaw campuses; add-
ing satellite sites in Kilmarnock and New Kent;
expanding partnerships with community orga-
nizations, agencies, and businesses including
the establishment of LEAD Northern Neck;
and providing focused resources on relevant
programs.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
recognizing Dr. Elizabeth Crowther’s accom-
plishments as she ends her tenure as presi-
dent of Rappahannock Community College.
We hope she enjoys her new life back on the

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E355
March 26, 2019
pleased the House is considering this bipar-
tisan, bicameral legislation to extend and au-
thorize important Medicaid programs that
serve medically complex children, seniors, and
people with disabilities, mental health and sub-
stance use disorders.
I’m especially proud that H.R. 1839 includes
the ACE Kids Act. ACE Kids is the product of
years of extensive work by my colleagues,
former Congressman Joe Barton and Con-
gresswoman KATHY CASTOR. This bill will im-
prove care for the sickest children enrolled in
Medicaid, which is the backbone of our health
care system for these children. Children with
complex medical conditions require a large
amount of health services which are expen-
sive and difficult for families to coordinate. The
ACE Kids Act aims to better coordinate this
care while reducing overall Medicaid spending.
Each state’s program will be specifically tai-
lored to fit each child’s needs and will provide
families with a care coordinator. It is based on
existing programs that save money while de-
creasing hospital visits and improving care.
This legislation has broad bipartisan support
and was passed by the House last December
by a vote of 400 to 11. I urge all Members of
the House to support it.
This bill also extends spousal impoverish-
ment protections for recipients of home and
community based services in Medicaid. These
important protections ensure that spouses of
Medicaid patients do not have to spend down
their own assets for the Medicaid beneficiary
to qualify for home and community based long
term care services. Home and community
based long term care services are critical to
meeting the care and treatment needs of Med-
icaid beneficiaries, but spouses should not
have to risk impoverishment for their loves
ones to access these important services.
H.R. 1839 authorizes additional funding for
the Money Follows the Person demonstration
which has been successful in transitioning
Medicaid beneficiaries out of institutions into
community settings. The bill also extends the
Excellence in Mental Health demonstration for
two states to provide mental health services in
community settings. Evidence shows that
keeping patients in their communities and out
of institutions improves outcomes, and I’m
pleased to support extensions of these critical
programs to ensure that patients can access
services in the best setting for their needs.
The bill offsets these important extensions
by closing loopholes that drug companies
have exploited to misclassify their drugs and
receive inappropriate rebates on their prod-
ucts. It also makes changes to third-party li-
ability in child support, and denies federal
funding for penis pumps in Medicaid.
I’m grateful that this bipartisan, bicameral
legislation is being considered today to
strengthen the Medicaid program for children
with complex medical conditions, seniors, and
people with disabilities, mental health and sub-
stance use disorders and I’m very proud to
support it.

MENSTRUAL EQUITY FOR ALL ACT
OF 2019
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 26, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, in recognition
of Women’s History Month and the incredible
advances women have made in our nation
and around the world, I rise today to introduce
the Menstrual Equity for All Act of 2019. This
is the first comprehensive legislation that
would end our nation’s inequities toward
women, girls, and individuals who menstruate.
Menstruation hygiene items, such as pads,
tampons, cups, and liners, are necessary pur-
chases for the vast majority of women.
Madam Speaker, popular culture would
have one believe these products are ubiq-
uitous and cheap. But I have heard the heart-
breaking testimonies of countless girls and
women from across our nation that would say
otherwise. We live in the richest nation and
yet millions of women and girls suffer from
issues of access and affordability. This is an
injustice and it is simply wrong.
Most premenopausal women use menstrual
hygiene products on a monthly basis and it is
estimated that a woman will use up to 16,000
tampons in her lifetime. Regardless of income,
women spend a significant amount of money
on purchasing menstruation hygiene products
each year.
Beyond being cost-prohibitive, different pop-
ulations of women and girls face unique chal-
lenges in accessing menstrual hygiene prod-
ucts. The Menstrual Equity for All Act aims to
address these challenges by:
Giving states the option to use federal grant
funds to provide students with free menstrual
hygiene products in schools—these grants al-
ready provide funding for health and wellness
efforts;
Ensuring that incarcerated individuals and
detainees in federal (including immigration de-
tention centers), state, and local facilities have
access to free, unrationed, menstrual hygiene
products;
Ensuring that no visitor is prohibited from
visiting an incarcerated individual due to the
visitor’s use of menstrual hygiene products;
Allowing homeless assistance providers to
use grant funds that cover shelter necessities
(such as blankets and toothbrushes) to also
use those funds to purchase menstrual hy-
giene products;
Allowing individuals to use their own pre-tax
dollars from their health flexible spending ac-
counts to purchase menstrual hygiene prod-
ucts;
Requiring that Medicaid covers the cost of
menstrual hygiene products for recipients;
Directing large employers (with 100 or more
employees) to provide free menstrual hygiene
products for their employees in the workplace;
and
Requiring all public federal buildings, includ-
ing buildings on the Capitol campus, provide
free menstrual hygiene products in the rest-
rooms.
Madam Speaker, every woman deserves to
succeed and advancing menstrual equity is
critical to achieving this goal. I urge my col-
leagues to support my legislation. Access to
safe, affordable menstrual hygiene products is
a basic need and a health care right for over
half the population; it is a human right.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E356 March 26, 2019
This year marks the Foundation’s 36th anni-
versary of shattering barriers to academic and
professional success for thousands of first-
generation Latinos from underserved commu-
nities. In addition to providing critical edu-
cational services and resources for veterans,
TELACU’s Continuum of Education—com-
prised of the College Readiness and College
Success Programs—annually propels approxi-
mately 2,000 TELACU Scholars from high
school through graduate studies, equipping
them with the academic credentials and pro-
fessional tools needed to successfully enter
the increasingly technical 21st Century work-
force.
Historically, approximately 98 percent of
high school TELACU Scholars graduate and
nearly all pursue higher education; more than
99 percent of college Scholars earn a Bach-
elor’s degree, with an increasing number
going on to seek advanced degrees. Since
TELACU Scholars are predominantly Latinos
from some of the most economically-de-
pressed communities in Southern California,
their attainment of high school diplomas and
college degrees directly benefits
disenfranchised communities. Program grad-
uates become self-sufficient, well-educated
professionals and role models who inspire and
invest in the next generation of Latino leaders.
Their attainment of higher education, in-
creased earning power and dedication to serv-
ice leads to the socioeconomic empowerment
of their local communities, and betters our
country as a whole.
Madam Speaker, in recognition of the thou-
sands of students, families and communities
they have served and empowered, I ask my
colleagues to please join me in congratulating
the TELACU Education Foundation on the oc-
casion of its 36th Annual Building the Dream
Gala, and in celebrating their inspiring
TELACU Scholars.
