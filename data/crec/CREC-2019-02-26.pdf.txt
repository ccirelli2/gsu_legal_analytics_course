nication from the Speaker:

VA MEDICAL CENTERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I have
run a small business, and I know that
any organization needs long-term cer-
tainty. No organization can success-
fully operate under a revolving door of
short-term leaders, especially not one
tasked with caring for America’s he-
roes. Unfortunately, this is what is
happening at our Nation’s VA centers.
Almost 20 VA medical centers, na-
tionwide, currently lack a permanent
director. Some of these facilities have
not been staffed by a permanent direc-
tor in almost 2 years. Instead, these fa-
cilities are managed by short-term di-
rectors who stay on the job for just a
few months.
There is just not a lot you can do in
a few months. It is not nearly long
enough to review operations, rec-
ommend improvements, and see these
reforms brought through to an end.
That is why I introduced bipartisan
legislation with Mr. COSTA from Cali-
fornia that put an end to this revolving
door. Our bill pushes the VA to hire
permanent directors at all VA medical
centers—no more interim directors.
We all want a VA system that can
complete its mission to care for those
who shall have borne the battle. Hav-
ing consistent leadership is the least
we can do for our Nation’s heroes.
ASSAULT ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I say to
the people of southern Illinois and this
country: Your constitutional rights are
under assault. If you are a law-abiding
gun owner, a sportsman, you need to
pay attention.
This week, the House Democrats will
bring a bill to the floor that will re-
strict your freedoms and do little to re-
duce gun violence.
As a father and a grandfather, I want
to reduce gun violence as much as any-
one, but we have to be smart. We can’t
get roped into scoring political points.
That is why I worked with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle last
year on a measure which is now law to
increase security for our kids in the
schools. But the gun control bill being
considered this week makes it harder
for law-abiding citizens to defend
themselves and others against crimi-
nals who have guns.
We need to enforce the laws already
on the books, not limit the rights of
law-abiding citizens who want to pro-
tect their families.
EMERGENCY DECLARATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) for 5
minutes.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
I rise to urge that we come together
today to defend the Constitution of the
United States by repudiating President
Trump’s emergency declaration of Feb-
ruary 15.
Few provisions of the Constitution
are more plain than Article I, Section
9, Clause 7: ‘‘No money shall be drawn
from the Treasury, but in consequence
of appropriations made by law.’’
The President has immense powers,
but he cannot spend money unless we,
the people’s Representatives in Con-
gress, have agreed that he can.
Now, there might be extraordinary
circumstances when a President could
violate that principle, when all of us
would agree that he must act but there
is no time to ask Congress for funds: a
military invasion or a massive natural
disaster, for example. The National
Emergencies Act provides for that.
But if the situation on the southern
border were that kind of emergency,
then the President hasn’t been acting
like it. For 2 years, when his party con-
trolled the House and Senate, he never
asked us for money to build a wall, and
if we truly faced that kind of imminent
threat, a wall would not even be an
emergency measure given how long it
would take to build.
The critical point is this: When the
President finally got around to asking
us for money, we deliberated on his re-
quest, and we said no. You may believe
we were right or you may believe we
were wrong, but that is what the elect-
ed Representatives of the American
people decided.
So the question before us today is
not how do we secure the border; it is
whether this President or any Presi-
dent can use emergency powers to defy
the Congress when he disagrees with a

decision that we have made. Are we
going to stand by and watch this Presi-
dent seize funds from the military to
forcibly take land from law-abiding
American citizens to build something
that Congress has said should not be
built?
We know this would be wrong. The
National Emergencies Act is for gen-
uine emergencies. It is not a get-out-of-
the-Constitution-free card for Presi-
dents who want something that Con-
gress won’t give them.
Now, I have heard some people say
that President Obama did the same
thing. I am sorry, he did not. Both
President Obama and President Bush
were sometimes accused of exceeding
their constitutional authority; the
courts sometimes overruled them. But
neither Obama nor Bush nor Nixon nor
Reagan nor Roosevelt nor Lincoln nor
any President since the founding of our
Republic has ever decreed an emer-
gency to spend money that the Con-
gress explicitly denied them.
If you want to find a precedent for
what President Trump has done, I can
give you one. When I was a diplomat
representing our country and standing
up for our values around the world, I
had this exact same debate with au-
thoritarian governments in Ethiopia,
in Bahrain, and in Egypt, telling them:
Do not use emergency powers to get
around your constitutions. I never
thought I would have that kind of ar-
gument with a President of the United
States.
Many of my Republican colleagues
have been saying that America must
not go the way of Venezuela, and they
are right. When President Trump said
in his State of the Union that we must
never become a socialist country, I
joined them in getting to my feet and
applauding.
But how do you think Venezuela got
to be a socialist country? I will tell
you. President Maduro declared a state
of economic emergency to give himself
the power to defy his elected national
assembly and spend money however he
pleased.
That is not America. We must never
become that. We believe in rule of law,
not rule by decree.
We disagree passionately within the
boundaries the Constitution draws, but
we agree zealously to defend those
boundaries when any one of our party
or any party tries to cross those bound-
aries. That is how we have survived as
a constitutional democracy. It is the
only way we can survive.
We are divided enough right now, so,
please, let’s not allow another tear in
the constitutional fabric that holds us
together. Let’s unite as patriots on this
one question so that we can safely dis-
agree as partisans on everything else.
f
THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON
OUR SOUTHERN BORDER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss
the issue that is facing Americans
across the Nation: the opioids crisis.
The 2018 National Drug Threat As-
sessment, a comprehensive guide pub-
lished by the Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration, indicates that illegal
drug use continues to rise. It cites
Mexican transnational criminal orga-
nizations as America’s greatest enemy
in the war against drugs. While these
criminal organizations are bringing a
wide variety of illegal drugs across our
southern border, I am particularly wor-
ried about their role in spreading the
opioid crisis.
Thousands of pounds of opioids are
smuggled across our southern border
every year. Just last year, the DEA
seized more than 17,000 pounds of her-
oin in the United States. About 39 per-
cent of this was seized at the southern
border.
Another opioid that has devastated
communities across America is
fentanyl. As we started to understand
the scope of the opioid crisis facing our
Nation, the CDC says doctors started
prescribing less and less pharma-
ceutical fentanyl. But fentanyl
overdoses remained steady as prescrip-
tion rates dropped, meaning that illic-
itly manufactured fentanyl is one of
the main drivers of the opioid crisis.
Illicit fentanyl is a synthetic opioid
that is produced in China and Mexico.
It is either smuggled into the United
States through the mail from China or
across our southern border from Mex-
ico. In 2017, Customs and Border Patrol
agents seized nearly 1,500 pounds of
fentanyl at the border. Considering
fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent
than morphine, last year’s seizures ac-
counted for millions of potential
overdoses and deaths.
But it is easy to discuss the amount
of illegal drugs that have been seized at
the border. It is easy to discuss the
need for change. The hardest part is
discussing the human toll that this cri-
sis has taken.
Madam Speaker, last year more
Americans died of a drug overdose than
in any other recorded year. In 2017,
overdoses killed more than 70,000
Americans, and more than 28,000 of
these deaths were related to synthetic
opioids such as fentanyl.
Our country is facing a crisis, and ac-
tion is necessary. That is why I was
proud to stand with President Trump
and support H.J. Res. 31. This appro-
priations bill included provisions that
are vital to my congressional district
and that will bring the fight against
opioids to the front lines: the southern
border.
Although I was disappointed that my
Democratic colleagues didn’t include
more to combat this crisis, I was
pleased that it included funding for 55
miles of wall on the southern border.
Walls work, and we need to continue
the construction of this wall. This is
why President Trump’s national emer-
gency declaration is necessary.
But, Madam Speaker, tomorrow
House Democrats will bring up a meas-
ure to block President Trump’s emer-
gency declaration, H.J. Res. 46. They
say the wall is immoral. They say it is
cruel. I say we need decisive action to
fight the opioid crisis, and this is the
first step in the right direction.
Since President Carter, there have
been 31 national emergencies declared.
President Clinton declared 6, and Presi-
dent Obama declared 10 that are still in
place. All 31 national emergencies rec-
ognized a dire threat to the American
people and took action. By declaring
this national emergency, President
Trump is taking action against a
threat that killed 70,000 Americans in
2017 alone.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.J. Res. 46.
Support our President and save Amer-
ican lives.

EMERGENCY DECLARATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I
rise in strong opposition to the resolu-
tion the House will vote on later today
that would terminate the President’s
declaration of a national emergency.
The need to secure our borders isn’t
just a matter of good public policy, it
is our highest calling, and it is our con-
stitutionally prescribed duty as guard-
ians of our citizens’ safety.
When our Founding Fathers penned
our Constitution and changed the
course of history, they charged the
Federal Government in the preamble
with the preeminent responsibility to
provide for the common defense. But
they didn’t just stop there. They went
on and not only empowered, but they
commanded that the Federal Govern-
ment shall protect every State in the
Union against invasion.
Madam Speaker, unfortunately, as
the American people and, especially,
the citizens of the great State of Texas
know far too well, the Federal Govern-
ment has abdicated its most important
responsibility and has been derelict in
its constitutional duty to defend our
borders and provide for our defense.
For too long, politicians have pontifi-
cated and they have postured that they
would stop illegal immigration and
that they would secure the border, but
the fact is they haven’t. Anyone who
has been to the border or worked along
the border or lives along the border
knows that this is a crisis. This is a na-
tional emergency.
We know that, just last month, ap-
prehensions at the southern border
spiked 84 percent compared to the same
time last year, with 120,000 apprehen-
sions in the last 2 months alone. Home-
land Security personnel spent 28,000
man-hours to render basic medical
services to folks who were coming
across the border.
New migrant caravans continue to
form and march toward our cities

along the border where our Border Pa-
trol agents are already overwhelmed
with migrants from other caravans.
b 1015
And in the first caravan of 8,000 peo-
ple that forced their way into Mexico—
they forced their way into Mexico—
where they should have stopped as the
first safe country when they were ap-
plying for asylum, we know that 600 of
that first caravan of 8,000 were known
criminals.
Additionally, because of our porous
borders, drugs continue to flood into
our country, poison our communities,
and destroy our families.
Just last year 70,000 people died from
drug overdoses in this country. Ninety
percent of those drugs are coming from
across the southern border. If that is
not an emergency, I don’t know what
is.
No one is on the front lines of this
fight more than the State of Texas.
Since 2011, 186,000 illegal aliens have
been charged with more than 290,000
crimes in Texas alone.
When you combine the total cost of
illegal immigration from healthcare
services, education, and incarceration,
it is over $12 billion for the State of
Texas. It is over $150 billion for the
United States.
We are $22 trillion in debt. We will
have two of our biggest safety-net pro-
grams insolvent in less than 20 years,
and we are spending $150 billion on ille-
gal immigration.
We know that constructing physical
barriers, when combined with boots on
the ground and technology, are effec-
tive at stemming the tide of illegal im-
migration.
We know walls work because we have
seen it when we have deployed them in
El Paso, San Diego, and Tucson, and
we have stopped illegal immigration or
stemmed the tide 90-plus percent.
So, instead of letting this crisis con-
tinue to worsen, this President took
action, using authority not that he in-
vented but that we in Congress explic-
itly gave him under the National
Emergency Act.
It is not like the President is setting
new precedent or breaking new ground.
Other presidents have declared na-
tional emergencies 50-plus times, and I
know President Clinton declared it a
national emergency to fight drug traf-
fickers—rightfully so—and President
Obama against transnational criminal
organizations.
This President loves this country. He
wants to do his job. He doesn’t want
another one of our sons and daughters
to die of drug addiction or overdose. He
doesn’t want crime to run rampant in
the streets of the United States.
The President understands his first
job as Commander in Chief is to keep
our citizens—our people—safe, and I
stand with him.
Madam Speaker, today I will be vot-
ing for our President, for his constitu-
tional, legal authority to defend this
country, to protect our borders and our
citizens. I will be voting for the safety
of the American people today and the
safety of our communities, not just in
west Texas but throughout this coun-
try.
Again, President Trump is doing the
right thing. He is doing the responsible
thing. He is doing the constitutionally
necessary thing. And I am behind him
100 percent.

RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF
MATHEW HALL LUMBER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the legacy of
Mathew Hall Lumber, which has been
operating in downtown St. Cloud, Min-
nesota, for 130 years.
Mathew Hall Lumber has been a fix-
ture in the community and a backbone
of the local economy.
Maintaining a business is not an easy
task. It involves blood, sweat, and
tears to sustain the test of time. How-
ever, with that comes joy and fulfill-
ment, something that generation after
generation of the Hall family knows all
about.
One of the reasons why St. Cloud and
the great State of Minnesota are so in-
credible is because of hardworking peo-
ple like the Hall family. By maintain-
ing their business in St. Cloud, they
brought commerce, jobs, and a great
product to our community.
As Simonson Lumber purchases this
historic company and the Hall family
transitions into a new chapter, I speak
for all of central Minnesota when I say
thank you to the Hall family for your
great contribution to our State and our
community.
HONORING STEVE TAYLOR, A GREAT MINNESOTA
PUBLIC SERVANT
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Sherburne County Ad-
ministrator Steve Taylor.
As Steve prepares to retire from his
30-year career, he leaves with the rep-
utation for providing the highest level
of customer service.
During his time with Sherburne
County and Carver County before that,
Steve has served Minnesota’s Sixth
District with distinction.
As a fellow public servant, I com-
mend Steve for committing his life’s
work to serving others. His dedication
and leadership will be hard to replace.
The employees who had the pleasure
of working with and learning from
Steve will keep the good work going,
but, certainly, his dependable presence
will be missed.
His efforts toward expanding
Sherburne County’s government center
by adding extra courtrooms, more se-
curity, and much-needed space will be
enjoyed by generations to come.
Thank you, Steve, and congratula-
tions on an amazing career in public
service. I wish you a long and happy re-
tirement.
HONORING THE LEGACY OF STEVE GILMER
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in honor of Steve Gilmer, who
has retired after serving 45 years as the
CEO of the State Bank of Delano, Min-
nesota.
Steve retired leaving an incredible
legacy. He cultivated a family out of
his employees and built an environ-
ment based on humor, trust, and excel-
lence, inspiring all those around him to
be the best they could possibly be.
As a resident of Delano, I can say
from experience that Steve led by ex-
ample and took the time to know and
care for the customers who walked
through the door of his bank.
Most in the community knew Steve
through his role as a volunteer, the
volunteer treasurer of the Fourth of
July Celebration Committee for over 40
years.
Delano is home to Minnesota’s larg-
est Fourth of July parade, and Steve’s
service to that committee displayed
his dedication to our community.
Thank you for all you have done for
the Delano community, Steve. Enjoy
your retirement with your family and
friends. You deserve it.
CELEBRATING THE MINNESOTA CENTRAL REGION
SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the Minnesota Cen-
tral Region Small Business Develop-
ment Center for being named the Min-
nesota Small Business Development
Center of Excellence.
Located at St. Cloud State Univer-
sity, the Central Small Business Devel-
opment Center provides free consulting
services and assistance to those start-
ing a small business.
The center services the majority of
my district, counties such as Benton,
Sherburne, Stearns, and Wright. My
constituents have benefited greatly
from the services provided and the nu-
merous business workshops focusing on
educating local businesses and entre-
preneurs on how to improve their new
business.
Special recognition goes to the cur-
rent director, Barry Kirchoff, who
came to the center in 2006 with an ex-
tensive background in business and
economic development.
Today, their success continues be-
cause of Barry’s commitment to help-
ing address the needs of the local small
business community. His hard work is
evident.
Congratulations and thank you to
Barry and the staff of the Minnesota
Central Region Small Business Devel-
opment Center. Central Minnesota is
lucky to have you.

tinuation to that grant, which reaf-

SETTING STRAIGHT THE RECORD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise.
And I rise today with love of country
in my heart and a belief that the
record has to be set straight.
The record has to always reflect the
truth, and there is a truth that is being
obscured.
I want to set the record straight be-
cause there seems to be a belief that, if
you have committed acts of bigotry, if
you have been a racist, if you have
been engaged in homophobia, xeno-
phobia, Islamophobia, there seems to
be a belief that, if you can do one
thing, somehow that thing will eradi-
cate and eliminate all of the bigotry
that you have perpetrated.
I rise to correct the record because I
want the record to show that at least
one person came to the floor of this
Congress and made it clear that, yes,
unemployment may be low for African
Americans—yes, it may be low—but it
is still twice that of Anglo Americans,
generally speaking.
Yes, you may have signed a bill to
deal with some aspects of criminal jus-
tice in a just way, and that is appre-
ciated. But there is still more work to
be done. But notwithstanding the fact
that there is more work to be done, it
is still appreciated.
But the record has to be set straight,
and here is what the record should
show: that that does not eliminate the
bigotry emanating from the Presi-
dency.
Eliminating bigotry does not occur
because you signed one bill. It does not
occur because unemployment is low. It
does not occur.
If you want to have the record reflect
that you have done something to atone
for your bigotry, then you have to do
something a little bit more than to
simply sign a bill.
And I am not saying to you that an
apology is in order. I say to people:
Tell the truth. Just tell the truth.
Say: I was wrong when I instituted a
policy that separated babies from their
mothers that emanates the type of big-
otry that we don’t condone in this
country.
Say: I was wrong when I said there
were some good people among those
who were the racists, the bigots, the
xenophobes and homophobes in Char-
lottesville.
Say: I was wrong when I said that
you don’t have to be so kind when you
are taking persons into your care, cus-
tody, and control and you are part of
the constabulary, you are part of the
policing force in this country.
Just say you were wrong if you want
to atone. Signing bills won’t do it.
Going to church won’t do it.
Asking forgiveness will cause you to
be forgiven. And I will forgive you, but
that doesn’t mean that you are no
longer going to be sanctioned for your
bigotry.
I want to thank those who have stood
and made their points clear as it re-
lates to bigotry.
I am listening to these morning pro-
grams now. They are all talking about
bigotry emanating from the Presi-
dency, not necessarily in those words.
They are talking about the racism that
the President perpetrates.
I appreciate what they are saying,
but we have got to do more than talk
about it. We cannot allow a President
to remain in office who has engaged in
this kind of bigoted conduct.
It is time for us to take a stand here
on the floor of the House of Represent-
atives.
There were no fine people in Char-
lottesville. You ought not separate ba-
bies from their mothers. You ought not
have policies that would condone big-
otry and encourage others to engage in
it.
I believe that we have a duty to take
a vote, and at some point in the near
future we will take another vote, not-
withstanding the Mueller report.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF WELCOMING THE
STRANGER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize a nonprofit or-
ganization in Bucks County, Pennsyl-
vania, that is celebrating its 20th year
of service helping immigrants settle in
the United States.
Welcoming the Stranger, based in
Langhorne, was founded in 1999 by the
late Reverend Sturgis Poorman.
Welcoming the Stranger has provided
countless opportunities for immigrants
in southeastern Pennsylvania from
over 100 countries.
Welcoming the Stranger offers
English language classes and courses in
citizenship preparation and computer
science. Their programs have been so
popular that they often expand to 300
attendees, packing houses of worship
and community centers across Bucks
County.
Madam Speaker, I applaud the work
of Welcoming the Stranger, and I wish
the organization all the best as it en-
ters its 20th year of service to our com-
munity.
I would also like to extend my appre-
ciation to Meg Eubank, the executive
director of Welcoming the Stranger,
for her work and her vision.

HONORING FRIENDS OF FIVE MILE WOODS
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
I rise to honor a group of conscientious
citizens in Bucks County, Pennsyl-
vania, who were recently recognized for
their environmental stewardship.
Earlier this month, the Lower
Makefield Board of Supervisors and the
Lower Makefield Environmental Advi-
sory Council awarded Friends of Five
Mile Woods with its annual Environ-
mental Stewardship Award. Friends of
Five Mile Woods, which has been a
presence in Bucks County since the
1980s, seeks to protect the landscape of
Five Mile Woods Preserve.
One of the most successful programs
the organization has implemented is
its volunteer cleanup efforts on the
second Saturday of the months of
March through November. During
these Saturdays, dedicated volunteers
pick up trash, maintain trails, and re-
pair infrastructure in the 285-acre pre-
serve.
Madam Speaker, Friends of Five Mile
Woods helps provide amazing nature
experiences and educational opportuni-
ties for our community in Bucks Coun-

RECOGNIZING MEGHAN SCHULZ FOR HER WIN ON
‘‘JEOPARDY’’
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize a resident of
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who re-
cently made us all proud from her suc-
cessful appearance on ‘‘Jeopardy.’’
Meghan Schulz, a resident of Bristol
and an environmental engineer for
SEPTA, appeared on the hit television
show last month. Going into the final
round, Meghan was in second place
with $14,000. She was able to clinch her
victory, however, when she success-
fully answered that Mariah Carey was
the New York native who, in the 1990s,
had eight of her first 10 Billboard Top
40 hits reach number one.
Her closest competitor, whom she
trailed by $400 going into Final Jeop-
ardy, incorrectly guessed Whitney
Houston, putting Meghan over the top.
Madam Speaker, I congratulate
Meghan on this major accomplishment.
It is a major feat to be selected to par-
ticipate on this famous show to begin
with, but to win against other highly
intelligent competitors is something
truly noteworthy.
I wish Meghan and her family all the
best, and we congratulate her on this
achievement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2109
February 26, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, I rise to discuss concerns with
S. 47, legislation we will soon be voting
on in the House of Representatives.
Madam Speaker, S. 47 has some posi-
tive things in it. The legislation pro-
vides for expanded recreational oppor-
tunities, expanded opportunities to
hunt and fish on our public lands, and
a lot of things that I very much sup-
port.
Madam Speaker, the bill has some
pretty profound flaws, one of which
being process. This is a 700-page bill—a
700-page bill—that has been held at the
desk. It has not gone through the reg-
ular committee process.
This isn’t some small bill that folks
have been exposed to. This is 700 pages
of text, and it has not gone through the
regular legislative process and, in fact,
is being put up under suspension of the
rules, where we are not even being pro-
vided the opportunity to offer amend-
ments or to represent our constituents,
other than just voting ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no.’’
Madam Speaker, I want to throw out
some statistics on what this bill does
and the implications. It provides 1.3
million acres of land being designated
as wilderness areas—1.3 million acres;
694 acres of recreation and conserva-
tion areas; 370,000 acres of mineral
withdrawals; national monument des-
ignations of 2,500 acres; 621 miles of
wild and scenic rivers; 2,600 miles added
to the national trail system; and 42,000
acres added to our national parks.
Now, Madam Speaker, I used to teach
outdoor wilderness courses. I have
spent hundreds, maybe even thousands
of nights of my life in the outdoors,
sleeping out in the wilderness areas,
national parks, and national forests
and others. I love these areas. I enjoy
them.
I am not saying that these things
shouldn’t happen. I am saying that we
need to have the ability to go through
regular order, just like the Senate did
this week when they had the ability to
offer amendments to this bill. We are
not being afforded that same oppor-
tunity.
Madam Speaker, my biggest problem
or concern with this legislation is this:
The bill permanently reauthorizes the
Land and Water Conservation Fund,
which, I will say it again: I support the
acquisition of lands, the protection of
lands, so we can enjoy the ecological
productivity and enjoy time in the
great outdoors. However, the bill does
not address the fact that we have a $17
billion backlog in national park main-
tenance—$17 billion. So we are acquir-
ing more land without a plan for ad-
dressing the existing backlog mainte-
nance issues that actually prohibit or
prevent people from enjoying some of
these same lands that are being ac-
quired.
We are talking about the Land and
Water Conservation Fund, and $9 bil-
lion in funds over the next 10 years
being deposited into a Treasury receipt
account to acquire more land. Guess
where this money is coming from,
Madam Speaker. A hundred percent of
these funds is coming from the State
that I represent and the other five
States that produce offshore energy.
Every penny of it is coming from the
State of Louisiana, which produces per-
haps over 80 percent of all the offshore
energy of this Nation in Federal
waters. It is paying for this fund.
At the same time, we have lost 2,000
square miles—2,000 square miles—of
our coast. Guess how much of this bill
addresses the problem there? With 2,000
square miles of our coast disappearing,
the ecological productivity being lost,
the increased vulnerability to the peo-
ple that I represent, zero, nothing. This
bill diverts money for conservation and
for protection in other States in other
areas and does nothing for my home
State of Louisiana, yet it is coming
from our revenues that we are pro-
ducing in our offshore.
This is a flawed process. This is a
flawed bill. We need to go through reg-
ular order.
I really can’t even believe that this is
happening. Here we have dozens of
hearings on climate change and other
things, and the very State that is the
canary in the coal mine, the State that
is experiencing the worst ecological
challenges or losses as a result of sea
rise and other challenges, is being com-
pletely ignored.
Where are the climate change advo-
cates right now? Where are you?
I strongly urge opposition to this
bill. We need to go back through reg-
ular order, consider the largest con-
servation and the largest natural re-
sources bill that we have had since I
have been in the Congress, and send it
through regular order again.
I urge opposition to this bill.
f
STATEHOOD FOR DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON)
for 5 minutes.
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, to-
morrow, our residents who are fortu-
nate to live in our Nation’s Capital will
come to the Capitol as part of their
Lobby Day to ask the Congress to pass
the D.C. statehood bill.
Most Americans are unaware that
the Americans who live in their Na-
tion’s Capital have the fewest rights of
any Americans. That is at the same
time that those 700,000 residents who
live in the Nation’s Capital pay the
highest taxes per capita, higher than
the taxes of the residents of any State.
As you might imagine, the residents
of the District of Columbia are seeking
to become the 51st State of the Union.
I am pleased that already almost 90
percent of Democrats are on our D.C.
statehood bill. I am grateful to Senator
CARPER, who will soon introduce this
same bill on the Senate side.
There are many reasons that no
Americans should fail to have equal
rights if they pay equal taxes. But
surely, service in every war the Nation
has fought, even beyond being first per
capita in Federal income taxes, should
qualify the 700,000 residents of the Dis-
trict of Columbia for equal treatment
as the 51st State.
On this poster, we see why any State
would stand for its rights: World War I,
more casualties of people who live in
the District of Columbia than three
States; the Korean war, more casual-
ties than those of eight States; World
War II, casualties are more than four
States; and the Vietnam war, casual-
ties that outnumber those in 10 States.
The residents of the District of Co-
lumbia will be here to say to my col-
leagues that 200-plus years—it is about
218 years now—without equal rights is
218 years too many.
Nobody who lives in our country and
pays taxes should be unrepresented on
this floor when votes are taken. I ap-
preciate that I can now vote for the
District of Columbia in the Committee
of the Whole, where some votes are
taken. But District resident have no
representation on this floor and none
in the Senate at all.
It is past time to right this wrong.
We cannot do it for those who have
died in war for our country. We can
certainly do it in their memory.

Pastor A.D. Shaw, Shekinah Glory

Plant City, Florida, offered the fol-
lowing prayer:
God of infinity and sovereignty and
redeemer of humanity, grace us with
Your mercy, as this 116th United
States Congress forges the future of
America.
Cover the distressed and despondent,
too often forgotten and manipulated,
with unceasing care.
Shelter the children of this Nation
from the destructive silence and sins of
their predecessors. Grant unto them
courage and fortitude to be affirming
and inclusive of all.
Reclaim us to Your peace and unity,
that we may truly be one Nation under
God, the Nation known as the melting
pot of the world.
Therefore, redeem the soul of this
Nation, and bequeath unto us wisdom,
mercy, and love, that we may all en-
counter heaven on Earth.

WELCOMING PASTOR A.D. SHAW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. SPANO) is recognized for 1 minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor A.D. Shaw, founder and
pastor of Shekinah Glory Cathedral lo-
cated in Plant City, Florida, and who
most gracefully offered this morning’s
opening prayer. He is also my brother
and my friend.
Pastor Shaw’s dedication to family,
friends, and community serves as an
example to many. His over 15 years of
hard work in the ministry without ex-
pecting anything in return embodies
the definition of unity and the best of
the human spirit.
As I listened to his prayer, I thought
of the many distinguished men and
women who have stood in this Cham-
ber, at that podium, preaching the im-
portance of unity in our great Nation.
One such man was Abraham Lincoln,
who said: ‘‘A house divided against
itself cannot stand.’’
In our fast-moving society, it is easy
to focus on those things that divide us
over those things that bring us to-
gether. It is why, Mr. Speaker, I stand
here today calling for greater unity
among all who serve in this Chamber,
among the American people and for the
thousands of communities across our
great land.
Only together can we withstand ad-
versity, not just as individuals, but as
a Nation. This does not mean that we
will always agree. It does mean we
should seek unity in those disagree-
ments.
We do not need to see eye to eye to
walk hand in hand.
If, as a Nation, we seek to remain
strong into the 21st century, we must
stand united through our differences.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

ACTION AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, I rise in support of action in
the fight against gun violence. Con-
gress is finally acting.
Over the last decade, we have wit-
nessed gun violence take the lives of
innocent children in our schools, ter-
rorize our neighborhoods, and harm our
fellow colleagues in Congress.
Each event invoked a moment of si-
lence. We can no longer remain silent.
This week we have the opportunity
to vote on two pieces of legislation
that close loopholes in the gun pur-
chase background check process.
These aren’t radical or partisan poli-
cies. Background checks are supported
by 97 percent of Americans, including
97 percent of gun owners.
On behalf of the families who have
lost someone to gun violence and those
who we long to keep safe from future
gun violence, I stand proudly in sup-
port of congressional action to protect
our communities from gun violence
and urge my colleagues to do the same.
f
REASSURING EUROPEAN ALLIES
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, last week I was grateful to
join Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM on a del-
egation for the Munich Security Con-
ference. A highlight was Vice President
MIKE PENCE reaffirming America’s
commitment to the Transatlantic Alli-
ance.
I then joined the delegation led by
Congressmen GERRY CONNOLLY and
RICK LARSEN for the NATO Parliamen-
tary Assembly.
House Speaker NANCY PELOSI reas-
sured our allies of bipartisan support
for NATO’s continued success. Con-
gressman MIKE TURNER ably presided
as vice president of the assembly.
Another highlight in Brussels was to
meet with U.S. Ambassador Ronald
Gidwitz and his wife, Christina, whose
enthusiasm for service is extraor-
dinary.
The ambassador is promoting the res-
toration of the Mardasson Memorial,
honoring American servicemembers in
the Battle of the Bulge.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
f
ETHYLENE OXIDE
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, every
parent deserves to have confidence that
the air they and their children breathe
is safe. That is why we have environ-
mental standards and why we have an
Environmental Protection Agency to
monitor, update, and enforce the rules.
So, when communities face a known
public risk, new or recently reclassi-
fied, we rightly expect the EPA to
act—quickly, comprehensively, and
transparently.
In the Chicago area, this, sadly, has
not been the case. Ethylene oxide, or
EtO, was reclassified as a known car-
cinogen more than 2 years ago, yet we
just recently learned facilities around
Chicago could be emitting it at ele-
vated levels.
The EPA has been unacceptably slow
to respond and has failed to keep af-
fected communities informed.
This month, I partnered with Sen-
ators DURBIN and DUCKWORTH and other
colleagues in my delegation to intro-
duce legislation that would require the
EPA to immediately revise and update
its EtO standards and to keep the pub-
lic fully informed.
We are also demanding that EPA
evaluate ambient levels of EtO in these
communities immediately, something
it should be doing already.
Our communities deserve more from
the EPA. This is about our families and
their public health.
f
RECOGNIZING LENAWEE COUNTY
SHERIFF JACK WELSH
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Lenawee County
Sheriff Jack Welsh as he retires after
431⁄2 years of service to Lenawee Coun-
ty, Michigan.
Sheriff Welsh has served in many
roles during his law enforcement ca-
reer, beginning as a volunteer reserve
deputy and eventually working his way
up to captain.
After his initial retirement from the
sheriff’s department in 2007, he went on
to become an emergency management
regional planner.
Then, in 2008, he accepted the call to
run for sheriff, where he has served
ever since.
Law enforcement officers like Sheriff
Welsh are the fabric of our community.
Day in and day out, they answer the
call to serve and protect.
Over the years, Sheriff Welsh has
been one of the very best. He is a man
of integrity, a dedicated public servant,
and a trusted friend to many. He has
been instrumental in making Lenawee
County a better and safer place to call
home.
I thank Sheriff Welsh for his decades
of distinguished service, and I wish him
nothing but the best as he begins his
retirement.

SUPPORT FOR SEPTEMBER 11
VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I rise today to urge all my colleagues
to support the Never Forget the He-
roes: Permanent Authorization of the
September 11th Victims Compensation
Fund Act because it is the right thing
to do.
I would like to thank my fellow New
Yorkers CAROLYN MALONEY, PETE KING,
and JERRY NADLER, who have led this
fight for years, and LEE ZELDIN, who
will work with me to build bipartisan
support amongst the freshman class.
Because 9/11 wasn’t just an attack on
New York City; Washington, D.C.; and
a field in western Pennsylvania; 9/11
was an attack on our entire country.
This was an attack on the United
States of America and everything that
we stand for.
But what thousands of these 9/11 he-
roes and their families now face is
being forgotten because the Victims
Compensation Fund, which supports
these families and these heroes in all 50
States, is running out of money and
cutting benefits by 50 to 70 percent.
That is wrong. And if we fail to make
this right, shame on us. Shame on any-
one who says ‘‘never forget’’ and then
turns their backs and pretends this
doesn’t affect their State or their dis-
trict or they’re suddenly fiscally re-
sponsible.
Shame on anyone who says that we
can’t afford to do this while we spend
trillions of dollars on bombs in Afghan-
istan.
When it comes to doing what is right,
it is about keeping our promises and
honoring those who put their lives on
the line and didn’t ask for anything in
return.
Now is the chance to put action be-
hind the words ‘‘never forget.’’
f
ENSURE HEALTH PLANS COVER
MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to speak for Kannon Koser, a
constituent and friend of mine who is
with his family in the gallery this
afternoon.
Mr. Speaker, 3-year-old Kannon is
one of 4 percent of children in the
United States who is born with a con-
genital anomaly—in his case,
hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.
Most health plans provide coverage
for congenital anomalies, and many
States require insurers to provide cov-
erage of any health services related to
congenital anomalies.
Despite this, health plans systemati-
cally and routinely deny claims and ap-
peals for any oral or dental related pro-
cedures under the pretense that such
service is merely cosmetic.
That is why Representative COLLIN
PETERSON and I have joined together to
introduce the Ensuring Lasting Smiles
Act, a bipartisan bill that would di-
rectly address this issue and ensure
that we don’t have to tell children like
Kannon that their health condition
isn’t valued by insurance companies.
As the original sponsor on the Repub-
lican side, I am proud to put my name
on this bill and ask my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to support it.
ELSA would ensure all health plans
cover medically necessary services, in-
cluding reconstructive surgeries that
are a result of congenital anomalies or
birth defects.
If enacted, this life-changing bill will
allow the Koser family the opportunity
to save for Kannon’s college rather
than spend money on reconstructive
surgery.
Commonsense reforms like this will
help children like Kannon grow up
healthier and have a better quality of
life.
Hi, Kannon. We will see you later,
Buddy.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from ref-
erencing occupants of the gallery.

IGNORING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL
BORDERS
(Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the se-
rious border emergency that America
is confronted with today is an emer-
gency that Donald Trump has created
by ignoring borders—ignoring the bor-
ders set forth in our Constitution, bor-
ders that were set forth to prevent an
all-powerful executive, a would-be
king, or the type of tyrant that Trump
so admires abroad.
After Congress repeatedly rejected
his phony border crisis and wasteful
wall, Trump decided: build it anyway.
Well, today’s emergency wouldn’t
have happened without two years of
Republicans who have continued to
yield the right-of-way to his creeping
wrongdoing—more and more of it—Re-
publicans who can just never summon
the ability to say ‘‘no’’ to Trump.
Today, we must reject this unconsti-
tutional power grab that diverts re-
sources from real threats to an imagi-
nary, politically contrived one.
Today, we defend our Constitution
and our democracy by pushing back on
the lies, the deceit, the anti-immigrant
hysteria, and the fear-mongering mis-
management of this administration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
GUN VIOLENCE
(Mr. MOULTON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, last
year I attended a rally where the fa-
ther of a gunshot victim spoke, and he
talked about all the things that he and
other people around this country are
doing to end senseless gun violence.
Then he turned to the crowd and
asked: But what is Congress doing?
And tens of thousands of Americans, as
if they had rehearsed it hundreds of
times, all said in unison: ‘‘Nothing.’’
But what is Congress doing? Nothing.
Standing in that crowd was not a
proud moment for me, because he is
right.
Mr. Speaker, 37 Americans have died
from gun violence in my district alone
in the past 5 years. Gun violence is now
the second leading killer of young peo-
ple Nationwide, trailing only car acci-
dents.
For too long, Congress has done ex-
actly what the crowd said: nothing.
This week, we are putting forth legis-
lation to enhance background checks,
but this alone isn’t enough. Thoughts
and prayers won’t cut it. Only action
saves lives. This is just a start.

WELCOMING THE MAYORS COUN-
CIL ON RAHWAY RIVER WATER-
SHED FLOOD CONTROL
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker,
today I rise to welcome the Mayors
Council on Rahway River Watershed
Flood Control to Washington. They
represent towns in and around New
Jersey’s Seventh District and are here
to ask our help to stop the flooding
that hurts thousands of people in our
communities.
For years, homeowners near the Rah-
way River have lived under the con-
stant threat of flooding that devastates
businesses and homes whenever there
are heavy rains. The last major flood
was in 2011, when Hurricane Irene rav-
aged the East Coast. The town of
Cranford was the worst hit, with 1,600
homes sustaining damage worth $40
million.
Our mayors have presented a pro-
posed solution to the Army Corps of
Engineers and are now asking for a fea-
sibility study to be completed. This
will get us one step closer to author-
izing construction on the Rahway
River Basin.
Mr. Speaker, this is a solvable prob-
lem. We need to start now. I will do ev-
erything I can to support our mayors’
call to action and expedite this process
so that we do not have to be pulling
people out of second-floor windows in
suburban New Jersey, so people up and
down the Rahway River can feel safe in
their homes.

Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to mark a monumental
occasion for this Chamber. For the
first time in decades, this body will
take up major legislation to address
the epidemic of gun violence in this
country. I am a proud cosponsor of
H.R. 8, bipartisan legislation to require
a background check on every gun sale
or transfer.
I know the vast majority of my con-
stituents support this step, including
Renae Greg, a woman from Carlsbad,
who was simply trying to enjoy a coun-
try concert when she was forced to
dodge bullets at a Las Vegas shooting.
I know that Lonna Leghart, a con-
stituent from Vista, supports this com-
monsense legislation. Her sister Kim-
berly, tragically, lost her life as a re-
sult of gun violence in my district.
It is on their behalf and on behalf of
all Americans who are impacted by
daily gun violence in this country that
I will support H.R. 8, and I hope all of
my colleagues will stand with us.
There is so much more that we need
to do to fully address the epidemic of
gun violence, but today it is a huge
step for Renae, Lonna, and families
across this country.
f
REVERSE PRESIDENT TRUMP’S
EMERGENCY DECLARATION
(Mrs. KIRKPATRICK asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Mr. Speaker,
the President has set a dangerous
precedent by crying wolf in the name
of national emergency.
I represent parts of the southern Ari-
zona border. My community knows the
border. We know the further away from
the border you live, the more fictional
the border narrative.
Border crossings are down to one-
fifth of what they were in 2000, and ap-
prehensions are at their lowest level in
more than four decades. Those are
facts.
Instead of protecting our national se-
curity, the President’s declaration
makes America less safe. The Presi-
dent is stealing billions from high-pri-
ority military construction projects
that ensure our troops have the essen-
tial training and resources they need
to keep the American people safe.
We will not sit by when the President
abuses his power. I am confident that
my Republican colleagues will regret
supporting this false national emer-
gency when there is a Democrat in the
White House.

DEAR MADAME SPEAKER: This is to notify
you formally, pursuant to Rule VIII of the
Rules of the House of Representatives, that
the Committee on Energy and Commerce has
been served with a subpoena for documents
issued by the United States District Court
for the Central District of California.
After consultation with the Office of Gen-
eral Counsel, I have determined that compli-
ance with the subpoena is not consistent
with the privileges and rights of the House.
Sincerely,
FRANK PALLONE, JR.,
Chairman.

PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION
OF H.J. RES. 46, TERMINATION
OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY DE-
CLARED BY THE PRESIDENT ON
FEBRUARY 15, 2019
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, by direction of the Com-
mittee on Rules, I call up House Reso-
lution 144 and ask for its immediate
consideration.
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 144
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the
House the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 46) re-
lating to a national emergency declared by
the President on February 15, 2019. All points
of order against consideration of the joint
resolution are waived. The joint resolution
shall be considered as read. All points of
order against provisions in the joint resolu-
tion are waived. The previous question shall
be considered as ordered on the joint resolu-
tion and on any amendment thereto to final
passage without intervening motion except:
(1) one hour of debate equally divided and
controlled by the chair and ranking minority
member of the Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure; and (2) one motion to re-
commit.
SEC. 2. The provisions of section 202 of the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622)
shall not apply during the remainder of the
One Hundred Sixteenth Congress to a joint
resolution terminating the national emer-
gency declared by the President on February
15, 2019.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized
for 1 hour.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, for the purpose of debate
only, I yield the customary 30 minutes
to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
WOODALL), pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members be given 5 legislative days
to revise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Com-
mittee met and reported a rule, House
Resolution 144, providing for consider-
ation of H.J. Res. 46, relating to a na-
tional emergency declared by the
President on February 15, 2019.
The rule provides for consideration of
the legislation under a closed rule. The
rule provides 1 hour of debate equally
divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking member of the Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure.
Additionally, the rule provides that
the provisions of section 202 of the Na-
tional Emergencies Act shall not apply
during the remainder of the 116th Con-
gress to a joint resolution terminating
the national emergency declared by the
President on February 15, 2019. This
provision was included to avoid privi-
leged legislative action on redundant
resolutions.
Mr. Speaker, today we must stand up
for democracy; we must stand up for
the rule of law; and, most importantly,
we must stand up for the United States
Constitution, the Constitution that we
took an oath to defend when we were
sworn into office.
Mr. Speaker, the Constitution we
swore to defend granted Congress the
power of the purse. That means Con-
gress decides how we spend the Amer-
ican people’s hard-earned money.
Congress spoke when we passed, and
President Trump signed, a spending
bill that granted him $1.4 billion for
fencing along the border. Now Presi-
dent Trump is acting like a dictator by
ignoring Congress and declaring a na-
tional emergency. As a result, billions
of taxpayer dollars would be taken
from high-priority military construc-
tion projects that ensure our troops
have the essential training, readiness,
and quality of life necessary to keep
the American people safe.
Mr. Speaker, as a former member of
the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have
visited countries where the rule of law
takes a backseat to the whims of their
Presidents. Just look at Venezuela,
where Nicolas Maduro has removed
every single obstacle to his power.
When he objected to the rulings of
the judges, he ended their terms early
and replaced them with his political al-
lies. When the democratically elected
congress didn’t agree with him, he cre-
ated a new congress filled with his sup-
porters.
Last year, he even banned prominent
opposition leaders from running into
the Presidential election. He has de-
monized the press and even took CNN
en Espanol off the air. Last night, he
detained one of America’s journalists,
Jorge Ramos, of Univision.
Fighting with judges, manipulating
elections, attacking the press. Mr.
Speaker, does any of this sound famil-
iar?
Now you have a situation where food
is so scarce that the average Ven-
ezuelan has lost 24 pounds in the last
year and more than 3 million have fled
the country. The Maduro presidency,
now that is a true national emergency
for the people of Venezuela.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2113
February 26, 2019
The collapse of democratic institu-
tions is also happening in Nicaragua
and Guatemala. The President of Gua-
temala and his allies in congress are
taking the country down the same
path, removing every check on their
power. They have expelled the inter-
national prosecutors who dared to in-
vestigate them.
And just as Guatemala’s Government
has tried to undermine and
delegitimize the police and prosecutors
who are investigating, President
Trump has called Robert Mueller’s in-
vestigation a ‘‘witch hunt’’ and deni-
grated the brave men and women of the
FBI.
Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this
President—or any President, Repub-
lican or Democrat—to take us down
the same path as Venezuela, Guate-
mala, and Nicaragua, all to build a
wasteful and ineffective wall along our
southern border.
These women and children coming
from Central America do not represent
a national emergency. That is why 58
former national security officials, both
Republicans and Democrats, issued a
statement saying there is ‘‘no factual
basis’’ for the President’s emergency.
Our call to duty today is to protect,
to defend our Constitution. We will
vote, and we will see how many in this
body have that same respect for the
rule of law.
b 1230
Mr. Speaker, I urge our Republican
colleagues to join us in this effort. It is
not too late for my colleagues across
the aisle to tell the President that this
is wrong, that the Constitution that we
swore an oath to uphold really mat-
ters.
We stand here today to stop this
power grab of our own democracy. A
‘‘yes’’ vote will affirm our democracy.
A ‘‘no’’ vote further erodes the trust in
our democracy and, again, expands ex-
ecutive power.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on
which side they stand.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I want you to know it
flatters both me and the gentlewoman
from California that you have made it
your habit to be down here during
Rules Committee time. It is good to
know that you respect what we do up-
stairs as much as the members of the
committee do.
I always enjoy coming down for the
Rules Committee debate, because it is
the only debate on all of Capitol Hill
where the Reading Clerk reads every
single word of the bill that we are
about to consider. Ordinarily, we waive
that, but the rules don’t let you waive
it. You have to read the rule so folks
will understand what is happening
today.
I happened to time the Reading Clerk
today. I didn’t put him up to anything
special. He read as he always does. It
took him 1 minute and 6 seconds to
read the resolution that is before us.
I heard my friend from California
talk about the important constitu-
tional questions that are here before us
today. I heard my friend from Cali-
fornia equate our President to discred-
ited despots around the globe and how
we must stand up to prevent that be-
havior here in America. I heard my col-
leagues who took to the floor this
morning for 1 minutes be sanctioned by
the Chair and advised to cease engag-
ing in arguments of personality and at-
tacks against our President.
One minute and 6 seconds it took to
read the resolution before us today,
Mr. Speaker, and that is 1 minute and
6 seconds longer than this resolution
has been considered in total in every
committee throughout this Capitol.
I want to say that again. You heard
my colleague talk about how critically
important this resolution of dis-
approval is as it relates to our con-
stitutional powers. You heard it de-
scribed as a power grab equivalent to
those of discredited despots. And we
haven’t talked about it at all in this
Chamber. In committees, not one wit-
ness has testified.
One minute and 6 seconds is how
much we have invested in these nation-
ally important matters.
I listened, Mr. Speaker, as you cau-
tioned Member after Member to cease
engaging in personal attacks on the
President during their 1 minutes this
morning. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned
that that is exactly what we are doing
here today.
If you want to have a debate about
Article I and Article II powers and how
we ought to retrieve the power that has
slid down Pennsylvania Avenue
through administration after adminis-
tration after administration, I am not
just your willing partner, I am your en-
thusiastic partner and passionate advo-
cate. But that is not the bill we have
before us today. It is not the debate we
are going to have today.
This is another in a long string of
measures that have been brought to
the floor of this House that could have
been brought in a bipartisan way. I
don’t mean one Republican; I don’t
mean two Republicans; I mean the ma-
jority of Democrats and the majority
of Republicans standing together to
speak with one voice on behalf of the
American people. But time and time
again, we are missing that oppor-
tunity.
This isn’t a constitutional issue
today, Mr. Speaker, though you would
not know that, because we have not
had any witnesses testify. This is a leg-
islative issue before us today.
There is, in fact, a National Emer-
gencies Act that allows the President
to do extraordinary things if he or she
decides there is a national emergency.
That is not unconstitutional. Congress
passed the National Emergencies Act;
the President signed the National
Emergencies Act. Perhaps the Supreme
Court one day will decide that was an
unconstitutional delegation of power
by the Congress, but the Congress dele-
gated that power in the National Emer-
gencies Act.
The way we talk about this issue, Mr.
Speaker, you would think this is the
first time you and I have seen this in
the few years we have been in Con-
gress. Of course, you and I know that is
nonsense.
There are 31 other national emer-
gency declarations in effect today—31
other national emergency declarations.
National emergency declarations from
the Obama administration are still ac-
tive today.
If we are so concerned about Article
I and Article II power grabs, perhaps
these emergency declarations that
have been on the books since the last
administration, Congress should deal
with those affirmatively here on the
floor.
There are national emergency dec-
larations still in effect from the Bush
administration. There are national
emergencies still in effect from the
Clinton administration. Mr. Speaker,
there are national emergencies still in
effect from the Carter administration.
This House has made not a single effort
to draw back that power from 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.
Those are legitimate questions.
Those are important questions. Those
are things that bring us together as the
people’s representatives in this House,
not bills designed just to poke a stick
at a President who has real passion and
real conviction about issues of real im-
portance.
Do you know what is in this resolu-
tion today, Mr. Speaker, what is in this
disapproval resolution today, that will
make a difference on the border in
terms of ending human trafficking?
Not one thing.
Do you know what is in this resolu-
tion today that, if we come together to
pass, will make a difference in terms of
drug trafficking on the border? Not one
thing.
What about if we come together to
pass this resolution today for the very
serious issue of weapons trafficking
across our border? Do you know what
we will do today to fix that? Not one
thing.
Victims of sexual assault as they are
being trafficked into this country, do
you know what we are going to do to
fix that today? Not one thing.
Do you know how many Dreamers
are going to have their hopes realized
today with a pathway to permanency
here in the United States of America?
Not one.
Man, we are good at bringing issues
that are designed to poke each other in
the eye. We are so good at bringing
issues designed to try to embarrass one
and boost another. But I have to tell
you, Mr. Speaker, we are not so great
with actually solving real problems.
For the first time in my congres-
sional career just last Congress, Mr.
Speaker, we brought a bill to the floor
that would have provided permanency

for our Dreamers and that would have
provided solutions on our border for
human trafficking, for weapons traf-
ficking, and for drug trafficking. You
know how many Democratic votes we
got on that bill, Mr. Speaker? Not one.
Now, to be fair, it wasn’t one bill; it
was two bills. Folks said, hey, if this
one is not the right one, let’s bring an-
other one. Maybe this is going to bring
people together.
Do you know how many votes we got
on the second bill, Mr. Speaker, from
the other side of the aisle? Not one.
The only bills that have come to the
floor to provide a pathway for Dream-
ers in my 8 years in Congress, and we
got not one vote from the other side
the aisle.
Is that because the other side of the
aisle doesn’t believe in those solutions?
No, that is not why. It is because the
other side of the aisle, in its wisdom,
deemed that to be a resolution not de-
signed to support the Dreamers, but de-
signed to divide. I disagree with that
conclusion, but that is the conclusion
that was made. Thus, the only oppor-
tunity in a decade we have had to sup-
port Dreamers, not one Democrat stood
up and said yes.
I call that a failed opportunity, and I
am not interested in figuring out who
is to blame for that failed opportunity.
This is a failed opportunity today,
too, Mr. Speaker. Sadly, it is another
in a series of failed opportunities here
in 2019.
I believe my colleagues are going to
see through the divisiveness of this res-
olution, through the charade of con-
stitutionalism right down to the very
core of partisanism that underlies this
resolution.
But just remember, 1 minute and 6
seconds, Mr. Speaker. Before I took to
the microphone today, 1 minute and 6
seconds from the Reading Clerk is all
the time this new Congress has dedi-
cated to an issue that you are going to
hear from my colleagues again and
again is one of critical national impor-
tance, international importance, con-
stitutional importance. How can those
things be true?
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself as much time
as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I can think of many
other things that we could be talking
about that truly, truly, truly call out
and scream out for a national emer-
gency.
Homelessness in our communities:
Thousands of people in our commu-
nities sleep on a street, under a bridge,
children sleeping in vehicles every sin-
gle night.
I think about the opioid epidemic,
and how many of our families are sim-
ply immune to the issues around drug
abuse and how addiction overcomes
them?
I think about last year around
Christmastime when 800,000 of our Fed-
eral workers were going without a pay-
check and went without a paycheck for
35 days. Yet my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle could not find 1 minute
and 6 seconds to give them a paycheck,
to open up the Federal Government, to
do their duty.
Instead, in the Rules Committee, we
took up an emergency order on label-
ing of cheese curds. They found that to
be more important than the lives and
the families of 800,000 Federal workers.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let
me thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for her astuteness, and, cer-
tainly, the manager of this legislation,
and our friends on the other side of the
aisle.
Mr. Speaker, I simply want to try to
craft the importance of H.J. Res. 46
that we will ultimately be debating
today. As an original cosponsor, I was
quick to try to bring order and to rec-
ognize the importance of the Constitu-
tion.
Clearly, the statute might be inter-
preted to be used in a reckless manner.
But it is precise in that it deals with
the necessity of building military con-
struction and other matters in the
course of war that are an emergency.
It might even cover rising gun vio-
lence, the fact that we have more guns
in the United States than we have citi-
zens.
It might be that if there was a pend-
ing war on the southern border, one
might determine that that is the case.
It might be that, in 2001, the first
sense of terrorism came when an indi-
vidual crossed the northern border to
attack the United States. If that had
continued with throngs of terrorists
coming across the northern border, the
President then might have declared a
national emergency.
But we do not have that, Mr. Speak-
er. What we have is a person’s desire.
We understand that the apprehen-
sions at the southern border have actu-
ally gone down. The combined 521,000
apprehensions for border and Customs
agents for fiscal year 2018 was 32,288 ap-
prehensions fewer.
Those who are coming across the bor-
der in the last 6 to 8 months are com-
ing across as mothers and children flee-
ing the catastrophe of bloodshed in
Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
These are people desperate for help.
They are coming through legal ports of
entry.
How do I know that? I have stood and
watched them come. I have spoken to a
mother whose baby was 45 days old.
She had birthed on her road here, not
because she just wanted a vacation, but
because they had committed to decapi-
tating her if she did not leave town im-
mediately, meaning leave one of the
countries. It was my plea that got her
to be able to go to a hospital. I held lit-
tle Roger in my hands, who is 9 months
old. He had been separated at the bor-
der from his family.
These are the issues that are being
addressed at the border. There is no ca-
tastrophe.
Let me be very clear, as my friends
always cite illegal immigration, I want
to make sure that any criminal, no
matter who they are, who does any in-
jury to anyone in the United States,
count me as standing on the side of
bringing that person to justice. But
that is not what is happening at the
border.
b 1245
Therefore, I would ask the adminis-
tration to attend themselves to the
Constitution, to recognize the dif-
ficulty or the wrongness of distorting
the purposes of the United States Con-
gress, the House, that has the purse
strings by calling it a national emer-
gency. My God, if we were to have one,
would this Nation even understand how
to implement it because they are hear-
ing it being declared in a very foolish
way?
I conclude by simply saying that 58
people in national security, Mr. Speak-
er—58 of them—have indicated this is
wrongheaded and jeopardizes our na-
tional security.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
vote for the resolution that I have co-
sponsored, H.J. Res. 46.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, it is my
great pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Alabama (Mr.
BROOKS).
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, in fiscal year 2018, more than 2,000
illegal aliens were apprehended by Fed-
eral agents for homicides committed
on American soil. Worse yet, roughly
31,000 Americans die each year from
heroin and cocaine overdoses, 90 per-
cent of which floods across America’s
porous southern border. Hence, we can
expect at least 33,000 dead Americans
each year until America secures our
porous southern border.
For perspective, the 9/11 terrorist at-
tacks killed roughly 3,000 people. In re-
sponse, America invaded Iraq and Af-
ghanistan at a cost of trillions of dol-
lars and, roughly, 7,000 lost military
personnel lives.
Saving Americans should be a bipar-
tisan issue, yet here we are. Repub-
licans seek to prevent another 33,000
dead Americans this year, while par-
tisan Democrats seek to embarrass and
stop President Trump from securing
America’s porous southern border and
saving American lives.
For emphasis, no national emergency
in history has been prompted by more
dead Americans than President
Trump’s national emergency declara-
tion. As such, I support President
Trump’s national emergency declara-
tion and will vote accordingly.
Mr. Speaker, how many dead Ameri-
cans does it take for open border advo-
cates to support border security? How
much American blood must be on
guilty hands before Congress recog-
nizes the national emergency we face
at America’s southern border? Amer-
ica’s military protects the borders of,
and lives in, South Korea, Iraq, Syria,
Afghanistan, many other countries,
and Europe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2115
February 26, 2019
I thank President Trump, as Com-
mander in Chief, for understanding
that America, and Americans, deserve
no less protection.
Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by not-
ing that dead Americans, Americans
killed by illegal aliens as a con-
sequence of porous borders, had
dreams, too. We, as a Congress, should
remember and honor those dreams and
act accordingly and protect this na-
tional emergency to protect American
lives by securing our porous southern
border.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, we can talk about the
scary people from our southern border.
I am not that scary looking, am I? I
think not. The fact is that the number
one trading partner for California and
Texas is Mexico, a friendly country.
For Central America, we are standing
up for our responsibility to uphold de-
mocracy in the Northern Triangle, to
address the root cause of migration.
That is where our focus should be.
Do we need an immigration reform
package that brings 11 million people
out of the shadows? Absolutely. These
are the 11 million people who our agri-
cultural partners depend on to deliver
fresh food to our table. But we are not
doing that here. What we are doing
here, what the President has chosen to
do, is political theater, political the-
ater for 2020.
In essence, a vote against this resolu-
tion means a vote against the families
of the military people who are depend-
ing on us to provide infrastructure,
schools for their children to learn, and
quality housing.
Do Democrats think and believe that
fortifying our borders is important?
Absolutely. We have committed bil-
lions of dollars to ensure that we stop
the narcotrafficking that happens at
our ports of entry. That is where it is
happening.
We need to work together on these
issues, not relinquish our responsibil-
ities, our legislative responsibility, and
the power of the purse that we hold.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. BURGESS), a member of the Rules
Committee.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor to
urge Members to vote against this ill-
advised resolution to disallow the
President’s declaration for emergency
funding on the border.
In 2006, I was in Congress, and Con-
gress voted for the Secure Fence Act.
With the Secure Fence Act, under
President Bush, 400 miles of border
fence was built. Under President
Obama, an additional little over 100
miles was built. Now President Trump
has asked for a little over 200 miles to
be built to provide security for Amer-
ica.
Now, is it a national emergency? I
will tell you, I had as my guest to the
State of the Union someone who is re-
ferred to as an angel dad. This is an in-
dividual who went and put on the uni-
form and fought for his country in
Iraq. While he was there, unfortu-
nately, his wife got ill and died, and he
came home. Now he is a single dad, and
he is taking care of his only child, a
daughter. That daughter, unfortu-
nately, was hit by a car on the street
that was driven by someone who did
not have legal status to be in this
country.
Several months later, Chris came to
me and said: Congressman, I did my
job. I put on the uniform. I went and
defended my country. Mr. Congress-
man, I did my job, and if you had been
doing yours, my daughter would be
here today.
President Trump has taken that
mantle very seriously. It is his goal, it
is his requirement, to defend our coun-
try at the southern border, and the
President will do just that.
If you read the history of emergency
declarations in the past, you will find a
number of them. Some, perhaps, you
might agree with; some, perhaps, you
might disagree with. But since the
founding of our country, it has been
recognized that it has been the purview
under Article II powers for the Presi-
dent of the United States to be able to
exercise that emergency declaration. It
was codified in the 1970s in a law that
is now the one that brings this forward
today, that brings forward this resolu-
tion of disapproval.
If you don’t like the law that allows
the President to declare an emergency,
change the law. You are the majority.
You control the Rules Committee.
Change the law.
What is interesting about this is, last
night, in the Rules Committee, when
we considered Mr. CASTRO’s resolution,
we didn’t consider it. We didn’t have a
single witness. Mr. CASTRO, I felt like
sending Capitol Police out to find him.
There was no one there to testify in
favor of his resolution. The Rules Com-
mittee seemed perfectly agreeable to
accepting this without any debate
whatsoever.
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote
against this ill-advised motion to dis-
allow the President’s declaration of an
emergency. Allow the President to do
the job he was elected to do and secure
the southern border.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, political theater, political
posturing for 2020, that is what we are
hearing.
This is the law. This is the Rules
Committee moving forward a piece of
legislation that will prevent the Presi-
dent from calling a bogus national
emergency, from stealing money from
our troops, from taking from those who
don’t have and those who are giving ev-
erything that they have to protect our
Nation. Political posturing for 2020.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to bring up the text of
H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to
the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, if we
pass the resolution, as my friends on
the other side of the aisle have pre-
sented it, we will save not one single
life. If we defeat the previous question
and move on to H.R. 962, we will, in
fact, save lives.
Mr. Speaker, to speak to that issue, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER), my
friend and a great leader in our con-
ference.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, if we, indeed, defeat the
previous question, we will allow consid-
eration of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive
Abortion Survivors Protection Act.
I introduced this legislation because
the Constitution clearly states that all
persons born in this country are enti-
tled to life, liberty, and equal protec-
tion under the law. The Constitution
does not put age limits on those who
are entitled to life.
I am horrified, Mr. Speaker, that
many in the United States Senate,
many Democrats, flagrantly violated
the United States Constitution last
night and voted down the Born-Alive
Act, embracing, in fact, infanticide.
Pro-abortion politicians used to say
life begins at birth. Now it is more un-
clear than ever when they believe that
life actually begins or whether they
even believe that living and breathing
human beings should be protected
under the law.
I would like to commend three Demo-
crats, in fact—Senators BOB CASEY,
JOE MANCHIN, and DOUG JONES—who
defended the basic rights of newborn
children and voted for my legislation
last evening in the United States Sen-
ate.
I introduced this legislation because
it is just common sense. I am shocked
that there are prominent American
legislators who believe in denying ba-
bies lifesaving medical care when they
are born.
As a mother, a grandmother, a legis-
lator, and an advocate who came to
Congress to serve as a voice for the
voiceless, I believe that life begins at
conception and that it is wrong to kill
a child no matter how many weeks old
he or she may be. But I am grieved to
find that I now must defend something
that I never thought we would have to
fight for: lifesaving care for babies born
alive.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2116 February 26, 2019
In response to radical legislators who
are promoting not just late-term abor-
tions but infanticide, it is essential
that we come together to protect chil-
dren.
b 1300
So today, I am here to ask—no, Mr.
Speaker, I am here to implore—my col-
leagues to right the wrong that the
Senate has committed and defeat the
previous question, and at least allow
the debate to support H.R. 962, the
Born-Alive Act here in the people’s
House.
Mr. Speaker, this should not be a
partisan issue. Congress must never
stop fighting to ensure that every sin-
gle newborn baby in the United States
of America receives lifesaving care, no
matter their sex or their race or eth-
nicity or whether or not they are want-
ed and cuddled and wrapped into that
first warm hug that they deserve.
The Born-Alive Act is the simplest
vote any of us can take: Do you sup-
port babies receiving lifesaving care
after they are born, or would you deny
these innocent children that care and
allow them to be left to die and be dis-
carded?
This is bipartisan legislation, Mr.
Speaker. Last year, six of my Demo-
cratic colleagues joined me in voting
for the Born-Alive Act.
I hope that we will bring this bill to
the floor for debate so that many more
of my colleagues can go on the record
and vote to stand with America’s
mothers and children.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
defeat the previous question.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker,
let me thank the gentlewoman for
yielding and, also, for her tremendous
leadership on the House Rules Com-
mittee.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of the rule and Congressman
CASTRO’s resolution to stop President
Trump’s fake, so-called national emer-
gency at the border.
Let me be clear: This emergency dec-
laration is a blatant attempt to sub-
vert the Constitution and get around
Congress’ sole power of the purse. Let
me remind you also, that this is a de-
mocracy, not a dictatorship. We have
three branches of government, not one,
and Congress has the power of the
purse strings.
Also, let’s make one thing clear:
There is no emergency at the border.
The only crisis at the border is the hu-
manitarian crisis that the President
created himself through his hateful
family separation policies.
And instead of protecting our na-
tional security, this President is doing
just the opposite: He is stealing money
from military construction projects to
try to build an unauthorized wall.
As a member of the Appropriations
Committee, I can tell you that we will
not allow this President to circumvent
our authority at any cost. I am proud
to cosponsor this resolution to put a
strong check on this President and ter-
minate his ability to declare this fake
national emergency.
I call on my Republican colleagues
and the Senate to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this
rule and ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution. It is
past time to stand up for the Constitu-
tion and to stand up for our immigrant
communities and to stand up for our
three branches of government.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President and to refrain from wearing
communicative badges while under rec-
ognition.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, at this
time, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), an
appropriator and ranking member of
the Rules Committee.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
WOODALL), my good friend, for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors
Protection Act. If we defeat the pre-
vious question, we will bring up the
text of this important piece of legisla-
tion to defend life.
Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I am mystified
as to why the majority is loath to ac-
tually make this vote. Indeed, they
have been doing backflips to avoid al-
lowing the House to actually go on
record on this important issue.
This bill is a commonsense approach
to protecting our Nation’s most vulner-
able. It amends the Federal Criminal
Code simply to require that any doctor
present when a child is born alive fol-
lowing an abortion or attempted abor-
tion must provide the child with the
same degree of care as he or she would
provide any other child. The bill also
requires that any such child is imme-
diately admitted to a hospital.
Mr. Speaker, as we have seen in re-
cent weeks, many people in elected po-
sitions do not appear to appreciate the
need to provide for protections for our
most vulnerable Americans newly
born, but it is clear that current law
fails to provide adequate protections
for newborns who survive an abortion
attempt. This bill draws a sorely need-
ed bright line of protection around
abortion survivors and requires that
they be given the same level of care as
any other premature infant.
As stewards of the law of this coun-
try, Mr. Speaker, protecting the most
vulnerable, including the unborn,
should be one of Congress’ basic re-
sponsibilities.
Since entering Congress, I have made
the protection of life one of my highest
priorities. I believe that all Members
should have that same priority. Today,
we can take a step toward making this
a reality by defeating the previous
question and bringing up the Born-
Alive Survivors Protection Act for a
vote.
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the
previous question.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
CICILLINE).
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding, and I
rise in strong support of the rule and
resolution to rescind the President’s
unnecessary and unconstitutional na-
tional emergency declaration.
Mr. Speaker, having visited the
southern border multiple times in the
past year, including just last month
when I met with Customs and Border
Patrol officials, I can say without any
question that there is no emergency at
the border.
We as a nation face serious chal-
lenges in reforming our immigration
system and stemming the flow of ille-
gal drugs into our country. However, a
border wall will do nothing to address
these challenges.
Research consistently shows that the
vast majority of illegal drugs coming
to this country through the border are
smuggled through legal ports of entry,
and most illegal immigration is as a
result of people overstaying their visas.
All this declaration will do is divert
$6.7 billion away from critical military
construction projects and drug inter-
diction operations, hampering our Na-
tion’s military readiness and making it
more difficult to address real chal-
lenges. These are funds that would be
better used on projects to improve and
build new military family housing or
make improvements to National Guard
and Reserve facilities throughout our
country.
Mr. Speaker, we should not be spend-
ing a single day wasting time on this
ridiculous, misguided executive order
from the President. There is no emer-
gency at the border. Illegal border
crossings are at a 40-year low. The
President’s own intelligence commu-
nity, when they did their worldwide
threat assessment, testified and didn’t
mention the southern border—and cer-
tainly did not identify it as an emer-
gency.
Instead of wasting time on this, we
should be getting back to the work of
driving down prescription drug prices,
focusing on rebuilding the infrastruc-
ture of our country, and passing H.R. 1
to get government working again for
the people of this country and not the
special interests.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
approve the rule, vote for the resolu-
tion, and end the President’s unconsti-
tutional, excessive use of power at-
tempting to circumvent the will of the
American people.
The American people decide through
their elected Members of Congress how
their tax money will be spent. The
President is attempting to throw the
Constitution away, circumventing that
process, and we cannot permit that to
happen.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, at this
time, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. REED), a
member of the class of 2010.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2117
February 26, 2019
Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
WOODALL) for yielding.
I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in support
of the underlying rule, but also in op-
position to the action that is being pro-
posed by my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle.
But I will join them in one senti-
ment: I do believe there is an emer-
gency crisis at the border. I do believe
that the President, given the years and
decades of delegation of authority from
Congress to the President’s Office, has
the authority to take the action that
he is taking in regards to this proposed
issue at the border.
But where I agree with my colleagues
on the other side is that the Presi-
dential authority is something that we
need to take into consideration and re-
form going forward.
It should not be because it is Presi-
dent Trump; it should not be because it
was President Obama; but each and
every time the executive branch uses
its authority and reaches into areas
that go beyond the constitutional lim-
its of that office, we should stand to-
gether as Members of Congress to as-
sert our authority.
That is why, Mr. Speaker, there is a
bipartisan group of us working over the
last few weeks, and we intend to drop a
resolution sometime soon, that will
amend the National Emergencies Act
to make it clear that, when there is a
national emergency declared in this
country, that we speak as one nation,
one body here in Congress with the
President.
We have to affirmatively take a vote
here in Congress, go on record, and not
hide any longer as Members of Con-
gress. We should be held accountable
by putting our voting cards in that box
to stand before the American people.
When a national emergency is de-
clared by the President, we have to
vote whether or not, guaranteed vote,
to see if that is something we agree
with the President on. That is a funda-
mental reform that will reestablish Ar-
ticle I of the Constitution.
And to my colleagues who are up
today: Where were you when President
Obama overreached in his executive of-
fice?
So I ask you to remember those days
and stand with us who are looking to
take on the root cause of this problem
and reestablish the congressional au-
thority that rightfully is contained
under the Constitution.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms.
VELÁZQUEZ).
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the
rule and the underlying resolution.
We should be absolutely clear: There
is no crisis at our border. In fact, ap-
prehensions of illegal border crossings
are at a 40-year low. This is a fake
emergency being used as a pretext for
Donald Trump to build a monument to
hate on our southern border.
But this is more than that. This ad-
ministration’s actions would do vio-
lence to our Constitution, undermine
our separation of powers, and set a ter-
rible precedent for the future. Every
single Member of Congress, regardless
of party, needs to stand up and make
their voice heard.
To all my Republican colleagues who
so frequently extolled the Constitu-
tion’s virtues, I say to you: Make your
voice heard today. Now is the chance
to show your true colors, to defend Ar-
ticle I, and to stand up for Congress’
constitutionally vested powers of the
purse.
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule; vote ‘‘yes’’ on
the resolution; stand up for the Con-
stitution; and reject this illegal power
grab by this President.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, you just heard an im-
passioned plea from my friends on the
other side of the aisle about the impor-
tant constitutional questions that are
before us today, about how the Presi-
dent’s emergency declaration violated
those sacred constitutional principles.
Candidly, I don’t know if my col-
leagues are right or not because we
have not had one legal expert come to
talk about the National Emergencies
Act. Most of us were not in Congress
when it passed several decades ago, but
it is a delegation of authority from
Congress to the executive.
b 1315
You just heard my friend from New
York come to the well and say, listen,
we have been working in a bipartisan
way to offer a bill to rein in those au-
thorities. I think that is important
work. I think that is work that we
ought to all be able to agree on. We
should be doing that work first.
I told you earlier, Mr. Speaker, the
sum total of all of the time this insti-
tution has spent working on these im-
portant constitutional questions is the
1 minute and 6 seconds our Reading
Clerk Josef spent reading us the resolu-
tion today.
We will vote on this rule today. We
will vote on the underlying disapproval
today, having never had the commit-
tees of jurisdiction hold even a single
hearing.
Now, lest you think there is just no
time in the calendar, this resolution is
referred to the Transportation Com-
mittee on which I sit. In fact, I had to
leave a Transportation Committee
hearing in order to come up here to do
the rule today.
We are working on the Green New
Deal in the Transportation Committee
today. We are working on electric vehi-
cles and how to reduce carbon emis-
sions across the country. Now, I am not
saying that is not important work, but
I have not heard one of my colleagues
talk about the dearth of electric vehi-
cles and how that is threatening the fu-
ture of our land.
I have heard my colleagues talk
about this important constitutional
question that this disapproval brings
before us, and, yet, there was not one
hearing on it.
Now, lest you think, Mr. Speaker,
that if we deal with this today, we
won’t deal with it again. No. We are
going to have some hearings on this
resolution. When? Later in the week
after it passes.
Now, I don’t know if that is a pattern
that we are going to get into. I hope
that it is not. Having had no hearings
and no witnesses testify on this issue,
we are going to have an Appropriation
Subcommittee hearing later this week
to talk about exactly these issues,
where the money is coming from, what
the impact of that is, and whether or
not it is wise.
We are going to have a hearing later
this week in the Judiciary Committee
talking about the National Emer-
gencies Act, and whether or not it per-
mits this kind of activity, and what
kind of changes ought to be made.
This resolution will have already
been considered. This vote will have al-
ready been taken, but we will eventu-
ally get around to having thoughtful
conversation about this.
Mr. Speaker, I close where I began.
There is more that unites us as Ameri-
cans than divides us. And even in poli-
tics, there is more that unites this in-
stitution than divides us. Making sure
that 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue only is
exercising those authorities delegated
to it by either the Constitution or this
Congress, is a shared value.
But if you listen to the debate here
on the floor, from the Speaker’s chair,
you had to caution our colleagues
against engaging in attacks of person-
ality against the President. We heard
debate, not of thoughtful constitu-
tional principles, but of hateful admin-
istration policies.
Mr. Speaker, I will tell my friends, I
don’t believe those words, those ac-
tions, or those efforts are going to
bring us one bit closer to the shared
values that we have in this institution.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
reject the rule today and vote against
the previous question so that we can
bring up a bill that will save lives. This
bill will save not one life; will prevent
not one drug trafficker from coming
into the country; will protect not one
migrant family. It will do nothing, Mr.
Speaker, to solve real problems that
face this country.
If we defeat the previous question, we
can at least take a commonsense step
toward doing exactly that. Vote ‘‘no’’
on this rule, vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous
question, and let’s commit ourselves to
finding a way to come together.
If you believe there is more that di-
vides us than unites us, these first 45
days of this session have been just per-
fect for you. But if you believe, as I do,
that we can do better, let today be the
end of the partisan attacks. Let today
be the end of bringing bills to the floor
designed to make a point instead of
make a difference, and let’s make to-
morrow better.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2118 February 26, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Mr. Speaker, fact-checking the Presi-
dent is not an attack against the Presi-
dent. The facts matter. As a matter of
fact, the President himself at his press
conference said: ‘‘I didn’t need to do
this, but I’d rather do it much faster.’’
What does he mean by that? Last
year, Republicans gave him $25 billion
if they read the bill, but I actually
brought it to their attention on the
floor that the bill actually read $75 bil-
lion that they were allocating for a
border wall. The facts didn’t matter
then for one side of the aisle.
The President himself said it. ‘‘I
didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do
it much faster.’’ That is not an emer-
gency. I was a 911 emergency dis-
patcher for 17.5 years. I can cite many
examples of what an emergency is.
Building a wall much faster is not an
emergency. That is political theater.
That is political posturing for 2020.
Where is the President stealing this
money from? Certainly, he is not get-
ting it from Mexico as he promised.
Mexico said ‘‘no.’’ The President is
stealing $2.5 billion that Congress ap-
proved to combat illegal drug activi-
ties around the world.
I know that my colleagues believe
that fighting international drug orga-
nizations is important. I know this be-
cause I traveled with Republicans and
Democrats to the jungles in South
America. We talked about eradication
of narcotrafficking.
What about the $3.6 billion that the
President is stealing from military
construction? A study earlier this year
found that 16 percent of military fami-
lies had a positive view of their base
housing. That means 55 percent had a
negative one.
Many families reported unsafe condi-
tions, including lead-based paint,
rampant mold, exposed asbestos, faulty
electrical wiring, vermin infestations,
and gas leaks. Is that not an emer-
gency? Is that not worthy of the bipar-
tisan vote that we took to allocate
that money so that they can make
those fixes?
I know my Republican colleagues
support military families. I know that
because I have traveled with them to
Afghanistan. I have traveled with them
to other countries. I know that this is
wrong. This so-called national emer-
gency is wrong, and I know my col-
leagues know that this is wrong too.
This is undemocratic. This puts us at
the cusp of a constitutional crisis.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the previous question and the
rule.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our
Constitution and in defense of our republic
and urge all members to join me in voting for
H.J. Res. 46, which terminates the phony dec-
laration of emergency issued by the President
on February 15, 2019.
The reason this resolution is before us
today is because of the petulant intransigence
of a single person, the current President of the
United States.
As a senior member of the Committee on
the Judiciary and the Committee on Homeland
Security, I have visited the southern border on
numerous occasions in recent weeks and
months and can state confidently that there is
no national emergency or national security cri-
sis that justifies the President’s reckless and
unconstitutional decision or compels the Con-
gress to abdicate its responsibilities under Arti-
cle I to check and balance the Executive
Branch.
The President is only pursuing this tactic of
declaring a national emergency after realizing
that Speaker NANCY PELOSI was absolutely
correct when she informed him that he did not
have the support in Congress to require the
taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that
‘‘Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!’’
In fact, according to the latest Marist Poll,
the most recent polling data available, Ameri-
cans overwhelmingly disapprove of the Presi-
dent’s national emergency declaration by a 61
percent–36 percent margin.
The President’s decision is opposed by both
men and women in every region of the coun-
try, by every income group and education cat-
egory.
National security experts across the political
spectrum are unanimous in their assessment
that the situation on the southern border does
not constitute a national emergency, an as-
sessment echoed by leading former Repub-
lican senators and Members of Congress.
They understand that after failing to con-
vince the American people or Congress to pay
for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multi-
billion dollar concrete wall, the President has
now embarked on a course of conduct that is
deeply corrosive of the constitutional system
of checks and balances wisely established by
the Framers and which has served this nation
and the world so well for nearly 250 years.
Having failed miserably to achieve his ob-
jective in the constitutional legislative process,
the President is trying a desperate 11th hour
end-run around Congress with an unlawful
emergency declaration that contravenes the
will of the American people and negates the
awesome power of the purse vested exclu-
sively in the Congress of the United States.
The Congress will not tolerate this.
Despite being repeatedly admonished and
in the face of overwhelming evidence to the
contrary, the President continues to propagate
false information regarding the state of our
southern border.
Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.
Net migration from Mexico is now zero or
slightly below (more people leaving than com-
ing) because of a growing Mexican economy,
an aging population and dropping fertility rates
that have led to a dramatic decrease in unau-
thorized migration from Mexico.
Migrant apprehensions continue to be near
an all-time low with only a slight increase from
2017.
The combined 521,090 apprehensions for
Border Patrol and Customs agents in fiscal
year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer
than the 553,378 apprehensions in 2016.
To put this in perspective, on average, each
of the 19,437 Border Patrol agents nationwide
apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in
2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 appre-
hensions per month.
In the last few years, an increased propor-
tion of apprehensions are parents seeking to
protect their children from the violence and ex-
treme poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and
Guatemala.
But even with more Central Americans arriv-
ing to our southern border seeking protection,
total apprehension rates are still at their lowest
since the 1970s.
The absence of a massive wall on the
southern border will not solve the drug smug-
gling problem because, as all law enforcement
experts agree, the major source of drugs com-
ing into the United States are smuggled
through legal ports of entry.
The southern border region is home to
about 15 million people living in border coun-
ties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and
Texas.
These communities, which include cities
such as San Diego, Douglas, Las Cruces, and
El Paso, are among the safest in the country.
Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer
dollars to immigration enforcement agencies
(more than $21 billion now) than all other en-
forcement agencies combined, including the
FBI, DEA, ATF, US Marshals, and Secret
Service.
The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection (CBP), with a
budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and
more than 59,000 personnel.
CBP is the largest law enforcement agency
in the country, and more than 85 percent of
the agency’s Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605
of 19,437) are concentrated on the southern
border.
Expanded deployment of the military to the
border to include active-duty troops could cost
between $200 and $300 million in addition to
the estimated $182 million for the earlier de-
ployment by the President of National Guard
to the border.
Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated
legislatively by Congress, a co-equal branch of
government, the President wants to finance
border wall vanity project by diverting funds
that the Congress has appropriated for dis-
aster recovery and military construction.
The funds the President wants to steal were
appropriated by Congress to help Americans
devastated by natural disasters, like Hurri-
canes Harvey, Irma and Maria, or for other
purposes like military construction.
Congress did not, has not, and will not, ap-
prove of any diversion of these funds to con-
struct a border wall that the President repeat-
edly and derisively boasted that Mexico would
pay for.
In fact, the President has admitted he
‘‘didn’t have to do this,’’ but has opted to do
so because ‘‘I want to see it built faster.’’
Mr. Speaker, just yesterday a bipartisan
group of nearly 60 national security officials in-
cluding former secretaries of state, defense
secretaries, CIA directors, and ambassadors
to the UN issued a statement declaring that
‘‘there is no factual basis’’ justifying the Presi-
dent’s emergency declaration.
Instead of protecting our national security,
the President’s declaration makes America
less safe.
The President is stealing billions from high-
priority military construction projects that en-
sure our troops have the essential training,
readiness and quality of life necessary to keep
the American people safe, directly under-
mining America’s national security.
The President’s declaration clearly violates
the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse,

and, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter
the balance of powers, violating our Founders’
vision for America.
Opposing the President’s reckless and anti-
American decision transcends partisan politics
and partisanship; it is about patriotism, con-
stitutional fidelity, and putting country first.
That is why nearly two dozen distinguished
former Republican Members of Congress are
urging Republicans in Congress to vote for
H.J.R. 46 and uphold ‘‘the authority of the first
branch of government to resist efforts to sur-
render’’ our constitutional powers to an over-
reaching president.
To quote Thomas Paine’s Common Sense:
‘‘In absolute governments, the King is law; so
in free countries, the law ought to be King.’’
Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to uphold
the rule of law and the Constitution, and reject
the President’s power grab; I urge a resound-
ing YES vote on H.J. Res. 46.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows:
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this
resolution, the House shall proceed to the
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R.
962) to amend title 18, United States Code, to
prohibit a health care practitioner from fail-
ing to exercise the proper degree of care in
the case of a child who survives an abortion
or attempted abortion. All points of order
against consideration of the bill are waived.
The bill shall be considered as read. All
points of order against provisions in the bill
are waived. The previous question shall be
considered as ordered on the bill and on any
amendment thereto to final passage without
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of
debate equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of the
Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one mo-
tion to recommit.
SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not
apply to the consideration of H.R. 962.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I yield back the balance of
my time, and I move the previous ques-
tion on the resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, on that

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
be given 5 legislative days in which to

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules
Committee met and reported a rule,
House Resolution 145, providing for
consideration of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan
Background Checks Act of 2019, and
H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background
Checks Act of 2019.
The rule provides for consideration of
each bill under a structured rule. The
rule also provides 1 hour of general de-
bate on each bill equally divided and
controlled by the chair and ranking
minority member of the Committee on
the Judiciary.
The Bipartisan Background Checks
Act of 2019 and the Enhanced Back-
ground Checks Act of 2019 arrived at a
time of emergency for America—a real
emergency. Every year 120,000 Ameri-
cans are shot in our country, and 35,000
of them are shot dead. Seventeen thou-
sand of the people wounded or killed
each year are children or teenagers,
their families devastated, their lives
forever changed.
In 2017, gun deaths in America hit the
highest level in 40 years, with 40,000
Americans killed.
We have lost more Americans to gun
violence in our own communities than

H2120 February 26, 2019
War, the Civil War, World War I, World
War II, the Korean war, the Iraq war,
and the Afghan war, combined. This
war at home never stops. Each day—
yesterday, today, and tomorrow—an-
other 100 people in America are shot
and killed by gun violence.
Mr. Speaker, this is not a global
problem; it is an American problem.
While 35,000 Americans are killed by
gunfire here each year, it is 146 people
in the United Kingdom, 142 in Por-
tugal, and 30 in Japan.
We lose more people to gun violence
in a single weekend than England loses
all year. We lost more people in the
Las Vegas massacre alone, in one
bloody night, than the nation of Japan
lost to gun violence in 8 years.
No other developed, high-income
country’s lethal gun violence even
comes close to the American carnage
allowed by our loophole-ridden gun
laws. The gun-related murder rate in
the United States is 25 times higher
than the average of other high-income
countries and hundreds of times higher
than some of them.
Now, the good news is that we know
what to do to begin to end this crisis.
We must close the loopholes.
In 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act went into effect and re-
quired licensed firearm dealers to con-
tact the FBI to run a background
check through NICS, the National In-
stant Criminal Background Check Sys-
tem.
The Brady Act made it illegal to sell
a firearm to felons, to fugitives, to peo-
ple who had been committed to mental
institutions, to drug addicts, to domes-
tic abusers, to undocumented immi-
grants, and to other disqualified cat-
egories.
The Brady Act worked as far as it
went. It stopped more than 3 million il-
legal purchases of firearms by con-
victed felons, violently abusive part-
ners, fugitives, the mentally ill, and so
on. But there are gaping loopholes in
the law because unlicensed gun sellers,
the people who sell guns online today
or at gun shows or in other private
transactions, can sell firearms without
having to run any background check
whatsoever.
More than one-fifth of U.S. gun own-
ers acquired their most recent firearm
without any background check at all,
which means that millions of people
obtained millions of firearms without
going through the Brady system, and
people who commit gun crimes over-
whelmingly obtain their firearms from
the unlicensed sources. A 2013 study
found that 80 percent of all firearms ac-
quired for criminal purposes were ob-
tained from sources that were not re-
quired to go through the background
check.
The criminals are not stupid. They
follow the loopholes. They go to the
internet. They go to the gun shows.
They go to the convenience store park-
ing lots to get their weapons of mass
destruction without any background
check at all.
Our legislation will close these dan-
gerous loopholes by guaranteeing that
there is a thorough NICS background
check on every gun sale or transfer,
with only a few carefully defined ex-
ceptions for intrafamily gifts and a few
other cases.
Mr. Speaker, there are three primary
things you need to know about this
legislation:
First, it is backed by more than 90
percent of the American people—fully,
97 percent of Americans, including 97
percent of gun owners, 97 percent of
Republicans, and 99 percent of Demo-
crats. It is the very essence of common
sense, the sense we all have in com-
mon, to make the background check
system comprehensive and universal,
leakproof, foolproof, and not ridden by
the loopholes.
A background check doesn’t work if
criminals know that there are massive
and lawful ways to cheat and get
around it. So America, today, stands
up to close the loopholes, and that is
why this is a day of great triumph for
the gun safety movement that has
swept America in response to Park-
land, Las Vegas, Newtown, and the
other massacres that our people have
endured.
Second, this legislation is perfectly
constitutional. As Justice Scalia found
for the Supreme Court in the District
of Columbia v. Heller decision, the Sec-
ond Amendment permits reasonable
regulation to exclude from gun owner-
ship violent felons, the mentally unsta-
ble, and so on.
Despite all of the solemn invocations
of the Second Amendment that we con-
tinue to hear bouncing off of the walls
of Congress, the opponents of this leg-
islation could not muster a single wit-
ness to actually argue that this legisla-
tion is unconstitutional, and that in-
cludes the George Mason University
Antonin Scalia School of Law professor
of constitutional law and the Second
Amendment who was brought in and
just expressed her policy misgivings
about the bill without articulating any
constitutional analysis at all and re-
jected the opportunity to say that this
legislation is unconstitutional.
The reason 97 percent of Americans
favor this legislation is because it is
perfectly consistent with the letter and
spirit of the Second Amendment, and it
sweepingly advances public safety at
the same time.
Third, this bill will dramatically
lower gun violence in America. More
than 90 percent of Brady background
checks take less than 90 seconds to
complete. But these checks have lit-
erally stopped more than 3 million ille-
gal gun purchases by felons, fugitives,
domestic offenders, the violently men-
tally ill, undocumented aliens, and so
on. Every day, background checks stop
170 felons and 50 domestic abusers from
purchasing a gun. Imagine how much
more effective this system will be when
we close these gaping loopholes.
Yet, even in the face of the shocking
death toll which distinguishes our soci-
ety from the other wealthy societies on
Earth, despite the overwhelming public
support for this legislation, and despite
its clear constitutionality, our friends
across the aisle oppose closing the
internet, the gun show, and the private
sale loopholes.
Instead of getting on our side to close
the loopholes, what do they give us?
More loopholes. They brought us doz-
ens of amendments to try to suggest
more loopholes to the current law.
That is obviously not the direction
that America needs to go in, and you
will hear some more about that today,
Mr. Speaker. They have given us a
veritable loophole factory. But now is
the time to close loopholes, not repro-
duce them.
Let’s focus on the public safety,
which is the cardinal purpose of law in
the social contract in a democratic so-
ciety. Let’s pass this excellent bill, and
let’s pass H.R. 1112, the Enhanced
Background Checks Act of 2019, which
closes the Charleston loophole, the
loophole that made it possible for a
guy to go out and get a gun because the
dealer decided to give him a gun after
3 days because they were still doing a
background check.
This loophole says that if it has
taken 3 days or more, you have a right
to go ahead and get your gun. We are
going to close that one, the so-called
default proceed provision. We are going
to close that one, too, so that we don’t
see any repeat massacres like the one
that took place in June of 2015 at the
Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal
Church in Charleston, South Carolina.
I reserve the balance of my time, Mr.
Speaker.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume,
and I thank Mr. RASKIN for yielding me
the customary 30 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, all of us, Republicans
and Democrats, want to reduce gun vi-
olence. I think there is just a difference
of opinion on how we get there.
Unfortunately, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112,
although well-intentioned, will not re-
duce gun violence as Mr. RASKIN said,
and instead it will turn everyday, law-
abiding individuals into criminals and
could actually do more harm than
good.
I grew up in a family that didn’t have
guns. After my dad returned from
World War II, he stopped hunting. So,
because I wasn’t around them, I have
to admit I had an irrational fear of
guns for awhile. It wasn’t until I be-
came an adult that I got educated.
I remember I first went to a debate
where the person who was talking for
gun rights said: Do you know who fol-
lows the laws? Law-abiding people fol-
low the laws. Who doesn’t follow the
laws? Criminals do not follow the laws.
So although well-intentioned, often
laws are unenforceable, and criminals
just do not follow them.
H.R. 8, again, I believe is well-inten-
tioned. But it will not solve the prob-
lem. H.R. 8 would not have prevented
any of the mass shootings in the last 20
years, not one of them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2121
February 26, 2019
I studied them because I am on the
Judiciary Committee along with Mr.
RASKIN, and we heard this bill in that
committee. In most cases, guns were
obtained legally. Recent attackers
have passed background checks to ac-
quire their firearms, including the
attackers at the Thousand Oaks, Cali-
fornia, shooting; the Tree of Life syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
shooting; the attacker in the Marjory
Stoneman Douglas High School, Park-
land, Florida, shooting; the shooting at
the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Flor-
ida; and the Las Vegas, Nevada, shoot-
ing. None of these attacks would have
been prevented if H.R. 8 or H.R. 1112
were law.
Then, the attackers in the Columbine
High School Colorado shooting used
straw purchasers for their weapons, an
act that is already illegal and has been
illegal since at least the 1960s.
Adam Lanza, the attacker in the
Sandy Hook Elementary School, New-
town, Connecticut, shooting used his
mother’s firearms which were legally
purchased by his mother. So as you can
see—and I have each one of them listed
how the attackers got their guns—H.R.
8 and H.R. 1112 would not have pre-
vented any of these shootings.
Not only would none of the mass
shootings be prevented by H.R. 8 and
H.R. 1112, but the Department of Jus-
tice under President Obama said that
in order for universal background
checks to actually work and be en-
forceable, a Federal gun registry is
needed. Yet this legislation in H.R. 8
specifically prohibits a registry; thus,
again, it is unenforceable.
The fact is criminals don’t get their
guns legally and will not go through a
background check to get their guns
even if this bill were signed into law.
b 1345
A recent Department of Justice re-
port of prison inmates that used guns
in their crimes showed that 56 percent
obtained their guns illegally and an-
other 25 percent received them from
family members—which, by the way,
family members are still allowed to get
the guns under this law.
It is obvious, then, that they did not
get their guns from a gun show or pri-
vate sales, as Mr. RASKIN is concerned
about.
H.R. 8 will also turn everyday, law-
abiding citizens into criminals if it be-
comes law.
Let’s look at the amendments that
were rejected by the Democrats in the
Rules Committee and in the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary that offered to
protect law-abiding citizens from be-
coming criminals.
First, there was an amendment—I
thought commonsense—that someone
thinking of committing suicide would
be exempted from temporarily turning
over their gun to a friend, and it is not
allowed under this bill. They would be-
come a criminal.
So, somebody who wants to commit
suicide could not transfer their gun to
someone else.
If a law-abiding citizen wanted to let
someone temporarily use their gun on
their own property, they would become
a criminal under this bill.
If a farmer or rancher wanted to tem-
porarily lend a gun to a ranch hand for
the purposes of ranch activities, the
farmer would become a criminal under
this law.
If a domestic violence victim was in
fear for her life and wanted to tempo-
rarily borrow a gun from a friend to
protect herself, she would become a
criminal under this law.
Let’s also look at some commonsense
amendments rejected by the Democrats
that would have prevented undue bur-
dens and duplication on law-abiding
citizens who have already passed a
background check but now have to go
through another background check
under this law.
People who have security clearances.
This is the application to get a govern-
ment security clearance, page upon
page, background check, extensive
background check. Yet, someone who
has this and has gone through this still
has to get another background check.
People who have a concealed carry
weapon issued by a State, they have to
go through another background check.
People who have already gotten a
gun permit from States which require
them; they have to go through another
background check.
People who have global entry, who
have gone through a background
check, they have got to do it again
under this bill.
Even law enforcement officers. Law
enforcement officers have to go
through another background check
under this bill.
This is placing undue burden on law-
abiding citizens.
Now I want to share testimony from
a young woman from the Judiciary
Committee. This woman was a victim
of rape on her college campus. And the
reason I am bringing it up is because
well-meaning gun control laws actually
prevented her from carrying a gun to
school because the State she traveled
through did not allow her to carry a
gun in order to defend herself.
This is a clear example of how law-
abiding citizens—not criminals, law-
abiding citizens—who follow the law
and how this young woman and others
like her were actually harmed by well-
intentioned gun control laws.
As a survivor of domestic violence, I
know all too well how hard it can be to
protect oneself or find a lifeline out.
My abuser often controlled all my fi-
nances. I wouldn’t have been able to
pay for a background check or a gun.
Sometimes getting a gun from a
friend could actually be your only op-
tion; yet, unfortunately, under this
bill, I tried to offer an amendment, but
it was rejected.
Now let’s turn to H.R. 1112, which
changes the length of time that a back-
ground check has to be completed from
the current 3 days to 10 business days
and then another 10 business days for
an appeal. So it could be 20-plus days.
The reason I am bringing this up is I
want to tell you a story—a real story—
about Carol Bowne. She was a New Jer-
sey woman who was stabbed to death
while waiting to be approved for her
firearm application.
She already had an order of protec-
tion through the courts, but that
wasn’t enough. She needed more than
just that piece of paper.
H.R. 1112 will make the realities of
Carol’s story happen across the coun-
try, putting millions of women and
law-abiding citizens in danger. Women
who seek avenues of protection will be
forced to wait almost a month—20 days
to a month—like Carol. How many
women will potentially suffer like
Carol?
H.R. 8 also has other problems.
Unfortunately, the debate in the Ju-
diciary Committee was cut short.
Many commonsense amendments were
not even heard. Only 10 amendments
out of 100 were heard before the chair-
man cut off debate.
Because of the rush to get this bill
through, there is another problem.
There is vague language that is not de-
fined and, thus, is open to interpreta-
tion.
I know, in some of the amendments,
the majority party has tried to give an
alternative to my good, commonsense
domestic violence amendments, but it
doesn’t do any good. And this is the
reason; it is because the language is so
vague.
It says: Under H.R. 8, a person is al-
lowed to temporarily transfer a firearm
if it is necessary to prevent imminent
death or great bodily harm.
The question is: There is no defini-
tion of this, so how long is a temporary
transfer? Who determines that? Does
the victim determine it?
Who determines if there is imminent
death? Does it qualify if a victim of do-
mestic violence thinks they will be
killed? Or does the person transferring
the gun have to be in the same room
and there be some kind of shootout and
they throw a gun to them?
What do ‘‘imminent danger’’ and
‘‘imminent death’’ mean?
With something as important as the
Second Amendment, I think we owe it
to the American people to do our work
and take as long as we have to in order
to have a fair and open debate on major
pieces of legislation.
Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge oppo-
sition to the rule, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2122 February 26, 2019
federal protections for survivors of domestic
violence, dating violence, sexual assault and
stalking, oppose any amendments to H.R. 8,
the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of
2019, that exempts any persons from the fire-
arms background check requirement. This
includes amendments exempting victims and
survivors of domestic violence or sexual as-
sault, including those with protective orders.
Firearms pose a significant danger to vic-
tims of domestic violence, and this is true no
matter who owns the firearm. Research
shows that a male abuser’s access to a fire-
arm increases the risk of intimate partner
femicide fivefold and does not support the
contention that firearm possession is a pro-
tective factor for the victim. The testimony
of Christy Salters Martin, a professional
boxer and experienced gun user, to the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee illustrates this.
Despite her boxing prowess and familiarity
with firearms, her abuser was able to take
her gun from her and shoot her with it, nar-
rowly missing her heart. Firearms do not
make victims of domestic violence safer;
firearms put victims at greater risk.
Furthermore, domestic abusers are adept
at using the justice system against victims.
Abusers often accuse the victim of being the
perpetrator of violence, making police re-
ports and seeking protective orders. Abusers
are also adept at finding loopholes. If persons
with protective orders are exempted from
the background check requirement, many
abusers who are prohibited from possessing
firearms would seek protective orders in
order to circumvent the background check
requirement to obtain firearms to terrorize
their victims.
Moreover, requiring a victim to undergo a
firearms background check is not a hurdle to
obtaining a firearm. Most firearm back-
ground checks are completed in under a
minute. A victim seeking to purchase a fire-
arm would still be able to do so quickly, un-
less the victim was legally prohibited from
possessing firearms.
Rather than adding dangerous exemptions
to a law that is supposed to protect victims
and survivors of domestic violence, Congress
should focus on ensuring that adjudicated
domestic abusers do not possess firearms.
This includes ensuring federal firearms
prohibitors protect all victims of intimate
partner violence, including dating partners,
and ensuring that domestic abusers who are
prohibited from possessing firearms relin-
quish their firearms. The best way to protect
victims is to disarm abusers.
Mr. RASKIN. Just to quote a small
part of it: ‘‘Firearms pose a significant
danger to victims of domestic violence,
and this is true no matter who owns
the firearm. Research shows that a
male abuser’s access to a firearm in-
creases the risk of intimate partner
femicide fivefold and does not support
the contention that firearm possession
is a protective factor for the victim.’’
And there is more in here of interest.
I would like to thank my distin-
guished colleague from Arizona for her
thoughts on the question of sexual and
domestic violence.
We, indeed, have a provision within
the legislation which allows for an ex-
emption from the background check
requirement in cases of an imminent
threat of great bodily harm.
The question has been raised: Does
that include sexual assault, dating
partner violence, stalking, and so on?
We thought it was self-evident that it
did, but, in any event, Representatives
Horn from Oklahoma and Murphy from
Florida are introducing a clarifying
amendment to be very specific that it
is included.
At that point, perhaps we could wel-
come the support of the distinguished
gentlewoman from Arizona, because we
are being very clear at that point that
our exception for imminent bodily
harm and violence includes sexual as-
sault and so on.
I am certain that the gentlewoman’s
intentions are good, just as are the in-
tentions of the offerers of the amend-
ment in the bill.
Let me just address, in case the gen-
tlewoman hasn’t decided to come over
to our side now, some of the general
points that were made against the leg-
islation.
The gentlewoman articulated an ar-
gument we have been hearing a lot of
from our counterparts, which is that
criminals don’t follow the law and,
therefore, there is no reason to get rid
of the loopholes and strengthen the
law, because criminals won’t follow the
law.
Now, the fallacy of that argument is
plain to see. It is an argument against
all law.
It is an argument against the law
against murder because murderers ob-
viously don’t follow the law against
murder.
It is an argument against the law op-
posed to theft because thieves don’t
follow the law against theft.
But I think anyone who takes time
to really study what law is understands
that the purpose of the law is to deter
people from negative, socially harmful
action, the way that the Brady Act has
deterred more than 3 million people—
felons, fugitives, the mentally unsta-
ble, and other unauthorized cat-
egories—from accessing a weapon.
Now, that argument sweeps so broad-
ly that it is an argument against hav-
ing the Brady Act that we have now,
and perhaps that is the intention, sim-
ply to take down the law that we have
got now.
Another purpose of law, of course, is
to punish people who violate it and
then, again, to send a moral message
about what the social norms are.
And we have got social norms about
driving, for example. Would we say we
are not going to have driver’s licenses
in America because people who drive
without a driver’s license ignore the
law requiring you to have a driver’s li-
cense?
It is a completely nonsensical argu-
ment.
Let’s come back to reality and talk
about what the Brady Act actually re-
quires the gun dealers to ask people.
Here are the basic questions that are
being asked:
Are you under indictment for or have
you ever been convicted of a felony?
Are you a fugitive from justice?
Are you an unlawful user of a con-
trolled substance?
Do you suffer from mental illness?
Have you been dishonorably dis-
charged from the Armed Forces?
Are you subject to a court order re-
straining you from harassing, stalking,
or threatening your child or an inti-
mate partner?
Have you ever been convicted of a
misdemeanor crime of domestic vio-
lence?
Have you renounced your United
States citizenship?
Are you unlawfully present in the
United States?
Mr. Speaker, those questions have
created a dragnet that has allowed us
to stop more than 3 million people
from getting weapons who shouldn’t
have them.
But there are these big, gaping loop-
holes out there that they can go on the
Internet and get one, or they can go to
the parking lot of a convenience store
in a private sale and get one, or they
can go to a gun show and negotiate a
private sale and get one without hav-
ing to answer those questions.
Well, the American people have spo-
ken on this. That is really why this is
the first legislation advocating gun
safety to hit the floor of the House of
Representatives in a quarter of a cen-
tury.
This is a great day for the gun safety
movement that has overtaken Amer-
ica, rejecting the unconscionable toll
of 100 people dead every single day in
communities across the land.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from California (Mr. THOMP-
SON), the sponsor of the underlying bill,
H.R. 8, who has done such a magnifi-
cent job advocating this cause through
thick and thin.
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise in strong support of this
rule and for the underlying legislation,
a bipartisan measure that will make
all of our communities safer and will
save lives.
I would like to thank Chairman
MCGOVERN for his fair consideration of
H.R. 8 and the proposed amendments
that came before the Rules Committee.
This is an important time in our Na-
tion’s history. Over 80 percent of Amer-
icans have come together to support
universal background checks. This is a
new day, and this is the time to act
now.
Since the tragedy in Newtown about
61⁄2 years ago, this House has held 54
moments of silence, but we have not
held one moment of action.
With Speaker PELOSI’s leadership, we
now have a chance to vote for two—
two—bipartisan bills which will help
save lives.
As a gun owner and a strong sup-
porter of the Second Amendment, I was
proud to introduce H.R. 8 with my bi-
partisan colleagues. I look forward to
its consideration tomorrow, and I urge
my colleagues to support this rule
today and the bill tomorrow.

Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. HUDSON), my good friend.
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2123
February 26, 2019
We all share the same goal: to end
gun violence. But in the course of this
debate, House Democrats say they
want to do something to end gun vio-
lence and anyone who disagrees with
their policies doesn’t care.
I believe in my heart that the gen-
tleman from Maryland and the folks on
the other side of this debate care about
the victims of gun violence and the
children in this country, and I know in
my heart that my colleagues on this
side of the aisle and I care, too.
It is a shame that in their rush to do
something, anything, Democrats have
made this a partisan show. They won’t
even allow my bipartisan concealed
carry reciprocity bill that passed this
House last Congress to be debated on
the House floor today.
What about the single mother victim
of assault, like Shaneen Allen? Does
she not have the right to defend her-
self?
Instead of working on commonsense
solutions that can actually help pre-
vent tragedies—like supporting local
law enforcement, ensuring laws and
protocols are followed, improving men-
tal health, and implementing my con-
cealed carry reciprocity—they are tar-
geting law-abiding citizens, and they
are disregarding existing Federal law.
There is no gun show loophole. Fed-
eral law already requires a background
check on every commercial gun pur-
chase in America no matter where it
takes place. Federal law already pro-
hibits so-called straw purchases.
Let’s make one thing clear: H.R. 8
would not have stopped Newtown. H.R.
8 would not have stopped Parkland. It
would not have stopped Las Vegas or
Sutherland Springs or San Bernardino
or the tragic attack on our former col-
league, Congresswoman Gabrielle Gif-
fords.
But the proponents of gun control
don’t want you to judge them based on
outcomes; they want you to judge
them based on intentions. And they say
anyone who points out the facts, any-
one who dares observe the obvious
flaws in their legislation, does so be-
cause they don’t care.
In their rush to do something, House
Democrats ignore that House Repub-
licans have done many things, like
strengthening the background check
system, which would have prevented
Sutherland Springs; improving mental
healthcare, which would have pre-
vented many of these shootings such as
Newtown and Charleston and Parkland;
and giving schools the tools they need
to protect students. All these bills re-
ceived bipartisan support in the last
Congress, but we don’t get credit for
real action because they say our inten-
tions weren’t good enough.
We owe it to the American people to
look past the intention and the emo-
tion and focus like a laser on out-
comes. What can we do to actually end
gun violence once and for all?
So what is this bill actually going to
do?
It is going to turn a law-abiding
American into a criminal when you
loan your shotgun to your buddy to go
dove hunting.
It is going to make it illegal for a
victim of stalking to borrow a gun
from a neighbor for protection.
It is going to make the cost of back-
ground checks so expensive that the
average American can’t afford to buy a
gun. Meanwhile, criminals are going to
continue to get their firearms, whether
it is through theft or the black market
or on the street.
I applaud President Donald Trump
for standing with us against this inef-
fective legislation, and I encourage my
colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’
The American people want us to
work together to solve this problem
and stop gun violence. Can’t we come
together in a bipartisan way and not
just do something, but do something
that will actually make a difference?
I am calling on my colleagues to put
partisanship aside. Work together on
ideas that will actually make a dif-
ference. I stand ready to continue this
work. I will work with anyone to end
gun violence while also protecting the
rights of law-abiding citizens, and I re-
ject the false dilemma that we can’t do
both.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I suppose that we are in a rush to do
anything, something, anything that
works in order to curb the terrible toll
of gun violence on our society.
In the last Congress it is true there
was other legislation that was brought
to us. One was a proposal to legalize si-
lencers in America, which sounds to me
more like an agenda of organized crime
than it is of the U.S. Congress trying to
seek public safety.
But there was this bipartisan Con-
cealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which
was a massive assault on federalism
and States’ rights. It would have de-
stroyed every State’s concealed carry
law in the country to a level at the
lowest common denominator. So if you
could get a license to carry a concealed
loaded weapon in one State—and in
some States there are more than a mil-
lion people who have been able to get
them through completely permissive
and lax laws—then you could go any-
where in the country. That is their pro-
posal. That is what is coming out of
the loophole factory.
I just would like to assure my friend
that we have a provision in our legisla-
tion, if you read it carefully, which
says that you can temporarily transfer
a gun at a shooting range, at a shoot-
ing gallery, or for purposes of hunting,
so he doesn’t have to worry about this.
Our friends are either not reading
carefully enough or they are over-
looking very clear passages in our leg-
islation which deal with commonsense
concerns.
This is bipartisan legislation. It is
backed by more than 90 percent of the
American people, and it is going to ad-
vance common safety. So rather than
searching for mysterious reasons to op-
pose it, why shouldn’t everybody get
together to say this is something that
will promote the public safety?
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CAS-
TOR).
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker,
I thank Mr. RASKIN of the Rules Com-
mittee for yielding the time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of this rule and H.R. 8, the Bipartisan
Background Checks Act of 2019. I am
proud to be a cosponsor, and I thank
Congressman THOMPSON for his leader-
ship.
Our bill is intended to ensure that in-
dividuals who are prohibited from own-
ing a firearm are not able to possess
one.
Representative RASKIN is right.
America is in the midst of a gun vio-
lence emergency. Each year, 120,000
Americans are injured by a firearm;
35,000 Americans die; and of those,
17,000 who are injured and killed are
children.
No other country in the world suffers
the ravages of gun violence, and I am
afraid we have become numb to it. But
we don’t have to accept it, and we are
not, because we are going to finally
pass legislation here today.
Mass shootings are on the rise. Mili-
tary-style assault weapons are deadlier
than ever. People are being gunned
down in churches, schools, movie thea-
ters, nightclubs, and synagogues.
For so many years, the Republican-
led Congress blocked action on com-
monsense gun safety laws. But, finally,
to the American people: We heard you;
to the students who marched for their
lives: We are finally going to act.
It is time now. I urge adoption of this
bipartisan bill, the rule. It is a vote for
the safety of our communities and our
families.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to address
a couple of things that were said pre-
viously.
I had sponsored an amendment, as a
survivor of domestic violence, to allow
victims of domestic violence and sex-
ual abuse who have orders of protec-
tion to be able to get transferred a gun
if they might be in fear for their life.
As I have said, often victims of do-
mestic violence don’t have the finan-
cial means or they are so restricted by
their perpetrator that it is difficult for
them to go out and purchase a gun, let
alone get a background check, and so
they might have a friend whom they
can borrow it from.
Now, in response, I think, Mr.
RASKIN, if I am not mistaken, said that
the Democrats did help domestic vio-
lence victims. I just don’t think that
their amendment cuts it, and I am
going to read the amendment if this is
the one that the gentleman is talking
about.
It says: A temporary transfer that is
necessary to prevent imminent death
or great bodily harm, if the possession
by the transferee lasts only as long as
immediately necessary to prevent the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2124 February 26, 2019
imminent death or great bodily harm—
and then here is the amendment—in-
cluding the harm of domestic violence,
dating partner violence, sexual assault,
stalking, and domestic abuse.
I would say just because you add the
words ‘‘domestic violence,’’ ‘‘victims of
domestic abuse’’ doesn’t mean this is
going to help; and the reason is simply
because of what I said before, that
these terms in here are really unclear.
I really would like somebody to ex-
plain, and they are not defined any-
where, who determines prevent immi-
nent death or great bodily harm?
So, let’s say I am a victim of domes-
tic violence and I think my perpetrator
is going to kill me. Does imminent
death and, in this word, say, last only
as long as immediately necessary to
prevent the imminent death? So does
that mean the person who—my friend
who can lend me a gun has to be right
there in the same room and see that
there is imminent death coming?
I mean, there is no definition here.
So it is unclear to me that this would
help at all.
Also, what is the definition of ‘‘tem-
porary transfer’’? How long is that?
How long is temporary transfer? Does
that mean, you know, just enough time
you can throw somebody a gun while
they are imminently in death? I mean,
do you have to be right there? What
does this mean? There is no definition.
So, if we are going to proceed with
this, I think that we should at least de-
fine what these terms mean. Therefore,
I really wish that my amendment that
said that victims of domestic violence
or sexual abuse that have an order of
protection through the court—through
the court—would be allowed to at least
borrow a gun to defend themselves
from, maybe, a friend.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I want to thank my colleague for ad-
vancing our discussion here because I
think now we are really starting to get
somewhere.
The gentlewoman suggested an
amendment which allows for the trans-
fer of a firearm to a victim of domestic
violence or sexual assault who has an
order of protection issued by a court.
That is an extremely narrow exception.
Most women who are enduring do-
mestic violence don’t have a civil pro-
tection order. Part of that is because of
the incompetence of the laws in a lot of
States, and part of it is because they
haven’t had the wherewithal to go and
get one.
But our legislation and our amend-
ment sweeps much more broadly. It al-
lows any woman who is a victim of do-
mestic violence, who faces a threat
from their attacker, to be loaned a gun
by a family member or be loaned a gun
by a friend until the threat is resolved.
My friend suggests that there is
something ambiguous about the words.
I just don’t see the ambiguity. Their
original argument attacked the utility
of all criminal law, saying we shouldn’t
have criminal laws, essentially, be-
cause criminals won’t follow them.
This seems like an attack on law
itself. Law depends upon language. But
the language is clear here that if there
is a threat and if you are suffering
from the threat of domestic violence,
sexual assault and so on, then you can
get the gun.
Who interprets it? Well, you have got
the right to go out and get it. If some-
one were to prosecute you for doing
that, the prosecution would clearly
lose.
So I am afraid that our friends are
looking for problems in this bipartisan
legislation which simply don’t exist.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as
a senior member on the Judiciary Com-
mittee and senior member on the
Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Secu-
rity Subcommittee, I, too, am glad of
the underlying discussion regarding
the protecting of women.
I rise today to support H.R. 8, the Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act of
2019, to close the gun show loophole,
supported by 80 percent of the Amer-
ican people, so unlicensed dealers can-
not, undercover, out of the back of
their trunk, sell to people who would
create and perpetrate either mass mur-
ders or individual abuse and gun vio-
lence.
I also support H.R. 1112, the En-
hanced Background Checks Act of 2019,
that would, in fact, have stopped the
deaths at the Mother Emanuel Church
in Charleston, South Carolina, where
worshippers were shot down, nine of
them.
To listen to the debate in the Judici-
ary Committee, 10 hours of rebuffing
these simple legislative initiatives, I
beg of my colleagues to stand with us.
It is clear that we have an amendment,
Horn and Murphy, that clarifies great
bodily harm, includes domestic vio-
lence, dating partner violence, sexual
assault, stalking, and domestic abuse.
We want women to be protected and
others involved in domestic abuse cir-
cumstances.
My amendment that will be brought
up as well will provide the information
as to how many times the FBI has had
to deal with petitions that have been
denied.
Let us not have another 20 years be-
fore we have bills that deal with gun
safety legislation. Let’s do it now.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the
rule governing debate on H.R. 8, the ‘‘Bipar-
tisan Background Checks Act of 2019’’ and
H.R. 1112, the ‘‘Enhanced Background Check
Act of 2019,’’ as well as the underlying legisla-
tion.
These legislative proposals address and
strengthen the background check system that
is already in place to purchase a firearm.
A 2013 study found that approximately 80
percent of all firearms acquired for criminal
purposes were obtained from sources who
were not required to run a background check,
and that 96 percent of inmates who were not
prohibited from possessing a firearm at the
time they committed their crime obtained their
gun this way.
This loophole exists largely because unli-
censed sellers need not conduct any back-
ground check under current law, even if the
sellers sell a large number of guns.
H.R. 8, the ‘‘Bipartisan Background Checks
Act of 2019,’’ would make it illegal for any per-
son who is not a licensed firearm importer,
manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to
any other person who is not so licensed with-
out a background check.
Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm
under this measure would be required to visit
a licensed firearms dealer to run the nec-
essary background check before the transfer
could be finalized.
H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate
and speedy manner to ensure firearms do not
end up in the wrong hands.
An internal assessment by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation (FBI) demonstrated that
NICS background checks are approximately
99.3 percent to 99.8 percent accurate, and in
90 percent of cases, are processed within 90
seconds.
H.R. 1112, the ‘‘Enhanced Background
Checks Act of 2019,’’ would strengthen the
background check procedures federal firearms
licensees or dealers follow before selling or
transferring a firearm.
As under current law, firearms dealers
would be required to run a background check
on prospective buyers using the NICS.
Over 90% of checks are completed within
90 seconds so if the NICS system has not re-
turned an answer to the licensed firearms
dealer within ten days, the prospective fire-
arms purchaser may file a petition with the At-
torney General for review.
After another ten-day period has expired,
the licensed firearms dealer may sell or trans-
fer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if
it has not received a response through the
NICS system and the dealer has no reason to
believe that the purchaser is prohibited from
obtaining a firearm under federal, state, or
local law.
Thus, under this measure, licensed firearms
dealers could not sell or transfer under the
‘‘default proceed’’ provision until at least 20
days have passed, since the initial background
check.
Mr. Speaker, the American people are de-
manding effective action to reduce, if not pre-
vent altogether, the countless mass shootings
and gun violence in our country that continue
to claim so many innocent lives.
Newly released data from the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention found
firearm-related deaths rose for the second-
straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in
gun violence.
In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary
mortality data shows that there were more
than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.—
4,000 more than 2015.
An Associated Press analysis of FBI data
shows there were about 11,000 gun-related
homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.
Congress must act to keep our country safe
through gun safety and violence deterrence.
There is nearly one mass shooting per day
in the United States—355 mass shootings in
2018.
In December 2012, a gunman walked into
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,

Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults,
and himself.
Since December 2012, there have been at
least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least
1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.
On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman
opened fire on a large crowd of concertgoers
at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the
Las Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and
527 injured.
And on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting
occurred at the First Baptist Church in Suther-
land Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-
year-old Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 and in-
jured 20 others.
Every day, on average, 92 Americans are
victims of gun violence, resulting in more than
33,000 deaths annually.
States with higher gun ownership rates have
higher gun murder rates—as much as 114
percent higher than other States.
A recent study by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention looking at 30 years of
homicide data found that for every 1 percent
increase in a State’s gun ownership rate, there
is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm
homicide rate.
Gun death rates are generally lower in
States with restrictions such as safe storage
requirements or assault weapons bans.
Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians
in the past 33 years: 0.
Because more than 75 percent of the weap-
ons used in mass shootings between 1982
and 2012 were obtained legally, stronger leg-
islation is needed to prevent guns from getting
into the wrong hands.
And that begins with passing H.R. 8, the
‘‘Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,’’
and H.R. 1112, the ‘‘Enhanced Background
Check Act of 2019.’’
I urge all Members to support the rule and
the underlying legislation when it comes to the
floor.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I would like to refute some of the
things, or talk about some of the
things said by my friends on the other
side.
One of the things that I do want to
talk about is that Mr. RASKIN said that
my amendment is such a narrow excep-
tion for domestic violence victims. I
had a broader one in Judiciary Com-
mittee, if the gentleman remembers,
and Chairman NADLER told me that it
was too broad, that it was too vague, so
that is why I made it very specific.
If the gentleman would like, I will
make it broad again.
b 1415
Also in the Rules Committee, there
was another amendment as well, and
we are both on Rules, too, of course.
There was a broader one from Mr.
SCALISE, who is a victim of gun vio-
lence. He had an amendment that was
ruled out of order. That basically said
any victim of domestic violence, which
was broad, but then he had another
subsection that said victim of domestic
violence or sexual abuse that has an
order of protection. So we covered
both, yet it was ruled out of order. So
we really tried.
Now, the other thing that you
brought up, that it is very clear what
imminent danger means, and that
would cover somebody, and surely a do-
mestic violence victim would not be-
come a criminal under this law. Well, I
don’t think it is very sure.
So I ask Mr. RASKIN, my colleague, if
he would be open to removing the word
‘‘imminent’’ and just say ‘‘danger,’’ in-
stead of ‘‘imminent danger,’’ because
to me, ‘‘imminent danger’’ means you
have to be right in the same room, you
know, and throw somebody a gun or
something. I mean, to me, the word
‘‘imminent’’ needs to be removed from
the language.
The other thing I would like to talk
about is the number of times now my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
have said: Oh, so many people support
this universal background check.
Well, I disagree. I disagree, because
there is proof right in Maine. They had
a ballot measure, and it was rejected
by the majority of the people.
I suppose it depends on how you ask
the question, but I just don’t think
that when you get into the details of
how it takes away our fundamental
Second Amendment rights and actually
burdens law-abiding citizens and actu-
ally may harm people, some of these
laws—like was the case with the young
woman who testified in Judiciary who
said that good-intentioned gun laws ac-
tually prevented her from defending
herself, and she was raped.
So I would say I have some disagree-
ments with some of your statements.
I also want to point out that there
are many things that we can do on a bi-
partisan basis, and this obviously is
not bipartisan. I am a co-chairwoman
of the Women’s Caucus in Congress,
and I have talked to my counterpart, a
very nice woman and Congresswoman.
We really do want to work on bipar-
tisan solutions to gun violence. I would
say one of those is let’s really con-
centrate on mental health issues.
Now, we have done some things in
the past. We did the Fix NICS Act,
which we passed last year on a bipar-
tisan basis, which really is an attempt
to fix the national background system
so that local jurisdictions actually re-
port when there are problems, which I
think is very valuable.
We also did legislation in a bipar-
tisan manner that would protect our
schools more.
Here is another thing we could do in
a bipartisan manner. As you have
noted, 3.5 million people have been
stopped by NICS since 1994 from get-
ting guns, and 112,000 were stopped just
last year. But you know what? Only 12
of those 112,000 were actually pros-
ecuted. Why? I mean, we have laws on
the books now, and we are not even en-
forcing them. So I think that is an-
other thing we can do on a bipartisan
basis.
Again, this bill, I believe, does more
harm than good. I do think my col-
leagues are well intentioned. I do be-
lieve that all of us, whether we are Re-
publican or Democrat, want to reduce
gun violence.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself as much time as I might con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, first, to clarify one
thing, this is bipartisan legislation. We
have at least five Republicans who are
cosponsoring and supporting this legis-
lation. I assume my friend doesn’t
mean to read those five Republican
Members of the House of Representa-
tives out of her caucus.
I am not quite sure what happened in
Maine, but I know that there are
around a dozen States and the District
of Columbia that have already gotten
rid of the loopholes that we are going
to get rid of today in this Federal legis-
lation.
My friend also invokes Second
Amendment rights. I thought that we
had put that red herring to rest in 2008
in Heller v. District of Columbia. Jus-
tice Scalia said that reasonable regula-
tion to screen out felons and fugitives
and the mentally unstable is perfectly
consistent with the Second Amend-
ment.
Everybody on both sides of the aisle
favors the Second Amendment, along
with the rest of the Bill of Rights. If
you are going to oppose this legisla-
tion, you have to base it on some pub-
lic safety rationale and not pretend
like anybody has made a constitutional
argument, because nobody has made a
constitutional argument.
Finally, on the question of the do-
mestic violence amendment, I would
invite my friend to come on over, and
we would gladly have unanimous con-
sent to have her added to the amend-
ment, which is the broader amendment
she is talking about. Of course, her
amendment was the narrow one, which
required you to have a civil protection
order before there would be an excep-
tion from the provisions of the legisla-
tion.
She said she was misdirected by the
chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
All I can say is the legislative process
is a treacherous place and a rocky road
for people in the minority. I have been
dealing with that for several years. In
any event, we would love to have you
join the amendment now. Mr. Speaker,
I make that offer to my friend.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to
the gentleman from Massachusetts
(Mr. MCGOVERN), who is the great and
distinguished chairman of the Com-
mittee on Rules.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Maryland
(Mr. RASKIN) for yielding me the time,
and I thank him for his leadership on
this important issue.
Let me remind my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle who are opposing
this legislation that people are watch-
ing this debate, and I know many are
scratching their heads wondering what
is going on, because what we are trying
to do here is close loopholes that allow
violent criminals to get access to guns,
not create more loopholes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2126 February 26, 2019
Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, I spoke
at a town hall sponsored by students at
Bancroft High School in Worcester,
Massachusetts. Those young people de-
manded action on gun violence, not un-
like other young people all across my
district and all across this country.
They are terrified, and they are tired of
seeing one massacre after another after
another after another. They are
sickened by the unacceptable high rate
of gun violence in this country.
We have an obligation to be on their
side, not on the side of the gun lobby.
In fact, most gun owners agree with
what we are doing here today. Ninety-
seven percent of gun-owning house-
holds support universal background
checks. You don’t see support like that
on very many things, but on this issue,
the public is speaking loud and clear.
The question is whether Congress is
going to listen.
My office has been flooded with calls
on this year after year after year, and
I have heard from loved ones of victims
killed and from those injured. I know
many of my colleagues can say the
same thing. It is heartbreaking.
Each of us is in a unique position. We
can do more than just listen. We can
act. We can actually vote to help save
lives.
Sadly, past majorities have turned a
deaf ear. In fact, it has been nearly a
decade since the Judiciary Committee
held a hearing on a major bill to com-
bat gun violence. When they were in
charge, my Republican friends on the
other side instead held a hearing on a
bill that would have actually brought
more guns from out of State into local
communities.
Their indifference on this issue of
gun violence, their silence, has been
stunning. But this majority is not sat-
isfied with inaction. We will not be
cowed by the gun lobby.
We are moving legislation, in the
case of H.R. 8, that has been in the
works for more than 20 years. The time
for inaction is over.
Listen to the young people in your
districts. They are not content with a
future where gun violence is the norm.
They want and they deserve better.
Last night in the Rules Committee,
my Republican friends tried to pass ex-
ception after exception after exception.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN).
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, they
tried to pass exception after exception
to this universal background check
bill, essentially trying to gut the bill.
Well, this is a modest reform in the
right direction. We are trying to save
lives. We are tired of massacres. We are
tired of comforting parents whose
loved ones were killed in gun violence.
We are tired of inaction. We are tired
of the gun lobby dictating what Con-
gress does and doesn’t pass.
This majority is going to be run by
the people of this country, and the ma-
jority of the people of this country
overwhelmingly support these bills.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to vote for this
rule and vote for the underlying legis-
lation.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Congressman RASKIN for yield-
ing and for his tireless leadership.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of the rule and H.R. 8, Con-
gressman THOMPSON’s bipartisan bill
that makes gun sale background
checks universal.
This bill is an important step to en-
sure that individuals who should not be
allowed to purchase a gun are no
longer able to purchase a gun.
Since 2014, nearly 400 of my constitu-
ents have died by gun violence. Our
community feels their loss every single
day. Here are just a few of their names
and tragic stories.
Davon Ellis: Davon was a star foot-
ball player and an excellent student at
Oakland Tech High School. He was
shot and killed while walking home
from school. My nephew was walking
with him when he was gunned down.
Travon Godfrey: Travon was killed in
2016 while sitting in a car with his
friends in front of his home. Every
time I think about Travon, my heart
breaks. Travon came to a town meet-
ing that I held on gun violence in Janu-
ary of 2016.
Sadly, these heartbreaking stories
are all too familiar in communities
across the country. More than 30,000
Americans lose their lives to gun vio-
lence each year. Shootings now kill as
many Americans as car accidents, and
that is why this bill is so important.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman very much for
yielding me additional time.
Mr. Speaker, this bill is a good first
step to ensure that our background
checks are strengthened, that we keep
guns out of the wrong hands, and that
we close these loopholes.
Mr. Speaker, we must end this epi-
demic of gun violence in our country.
This is a national emergency. This bill
will save lives, so I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and ‘‘yes’’ on
the bill.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to make my amend-
ment in order, which would allow do-
mestic violence and sexual assault vic-
tims with orders of protection to be ex-
empt from the gun transfer prohibi-
tions. This amendment is crucial to
saving lives.
As a survivor of domestic violence, I
know what it is like to be in fear for
our lives.
This commonsense amendment is
clearcut. If you are a victim with an
order of protection, you can borrow a
firearm or transfer a firearm to you. It
is important, because victims don’t
often have the means to purchase or go
pay for a background check.
The Democrats have presented a let-
ter from the National Task Force to
End Sexual and Domestic Violence as a
reason for not needing my amendment.
However, with all due respect, the Na-
tional Task Force does not speak for
every victim, and they certainly do not
speak for me. In fact, they never even
contacted me, and I have been an out-
spoken person saying I am a survivor
of domestic violence since I ran for
Congress. I am also the person who
sponsored the amendment to extend
the Violence Against Women Act, yet
they have never talked to me or
reached out to my office.
The majority offered a political
amendment on domestic violence,
which I have already talked about,
which really does not do any good, be-
cause the definitions of imminent dan-
ger are not defined, and it will not be
carried out and will not be effective.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to
the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
PRICE of North Carolina). Is there ob-
jection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Arizona?
There was no objection.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, in closing,
we all want to solve gun violence in the
United States, but H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112
will not solve the problem.
b 1430
As co-chairwoman of the bipartisan
Women’s Caucus, I am committed to
working across the aisle on solutions
we can all agree on. However, this is
not one of them. We can talk about
mental health. We can talk about
strengthening the NICS background
check system even more. We can talk
about enforcing the laws that are al-
ready on the books.
H.R. 8 will turn law-abiding citizens
into criminals by making everyday gun
transfers a crime and putting those
who seek to protect themselves in jail
for wanting to do so.
H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 will place an
undue burden on citizens who already
have a background check. For in-
stance: security clearance, global
entry, State-issued permits, et cetera.
These pieces of legislation put law-
abiding citizens in danger by disarming
them and emboldening criminals. The
bad guys never follow the law. In fact,
I believe that this legislation violates
the Second Amendment of the Con-
stitution because it does not prohibit
undue fees for background checks and,
thus, some people cannot afford them

and, thus, not be able to get a gun to
defend themselves.
Mr. Speaker, I urge ‘‘no’’ on the pre-
vious question, ‘‘no’’ on the underlying
measure, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, far from trying to turn
law-abiding citizens into criminals, our
legislation will save law-abiding citi-
zens from criminals, simply by expand-
ing the successful Brady law, which has
been in effect for decades now.
The gentlewoman introduces a con-
stitutional argument at the last
minute here, saying that our legisla-
tion is unconstitutional because there
may be undue fees imposed. Of course,
those are the fees that are currently
imposed under the Brady law, so I am
afraid that my friend has just made an
argument for the unconstitutionality
of the current law, which has saved us
from more than 3 million felons, fugi-
tives, mentally unstable people, drug
abusers, and undocumented aliens from
acquiring firearms in the country.
Mr. Speaker, our country is a social
contract. I know we have got a lot of
young people here today. We are a so-
cial contract. If you go back and read
any of the social contracts—there is
Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, or Thom-
as Jefferson—any of them say, we leave
a state of nature, which is a state of
war and a state of violence, in order to
live in a civilized way.
But how civilized is it when tens of
thousands of Americans, every year,
are being killed in firearm violence?
Every day, another hundred Americans
are killed with guns.
In 2017, the highest level in 40 years,
nearly 40,000 Americans died from gun
violence. That is not a civilized state.
That is a state of war. That is a state
of violence.
We know what the loopholes are, and
we are going to close the loopholes
with our bipartisan legislation, which
has support from Republicans and it
has support from Democrats. The pub-
lic opinion polls show that more than
95 percent of the American people sup-
port what we are trying to do here—
close the gun show loophole, close the
private sale loophole, close the inter-
net loophole—make sure that every-
body who purchases a gun in America
is purchasing it only with the universal
comprehensive mental and criminal
background check.
We have amendments for the discrete
exceptions that are necessary, includ-
ing in cases of imminent violence, in-
cluding rape and sexual assault via do-
mestic violence. We think that this
legislation is excellent legislation that
every Member of Congress should feel
proud voting for.
Mr. Speaker, I submit both H.R. 8,
the Bipartisan Background Check Act,
as well as the bill to close the Charles-
ton loophole, so that criminals are not
given guns after 3 days. We are able to
delay that process in the event that
more investigation is needed.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in support of H. Res. 145, the rule providing
for consideration of the Bipartisan Background
Checks Act of 2019 (H.R. 8) and the En-
hanced Background Checks Act of 2019 (H.R.
1112).
These critical bills would ensure that there is
a comprehensive background check on every
firearm purchase, something that 97 percent
of American voters, including 97 percent of
gun-owning households, support.
H.R. 8 requires background checks on all
firearm sales, including those conducted by
unlicensed gun sellers, closing what has be-
come known as the ‘‘gun show loophole.’’
H.R. 1112 closes another loophole in cur-
rent statute that allows gun dealers to transfer
a firearm after three business days if they
have not received a definitive response from
the background check system.
Tragically, this gap became known as the
‘‘Charleston loophole’’ when it contributed to
the brutal murder of nine people at the Eman-
uel African Methodist Episcopal Church in
Charleston in 2015.
Congress must act immediately on the
ABCs of gun violence prevention.
A is for Assault Weapons Ban.
B is for Background Checks Reform.
C is for Closing the Gun Show Loophole.
These measures make progress on B and
C, and I urge my colleagues to support them.
The material previously referred to
by Mrs. LESKO is as follows:
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
Sec. 4. Notwithstanding any other provi-
sion of this resolution, the amendment print-
ed in section 5 shall be in order as though
printed as the last amendment in part A of
the report of the Committee on Rules accom-
panying this resolution if offered by Rep-
resentative Lesko of Arizona or a designee.
That amendment shall be debatable for 10
minutes equally divided and controlled by
the proponent and an opponent.
Sec. 5. The amendment referred to in sec-
tion 4 is as follows:
Page 3, line 17, strike ‘‘or’’.
Page 4, line 15, strike the period and insert
‘‘; or’’.
Page 4, after line 15, insert the following:
‘‘(G) a transfer to a victim of domestic vio-
lence or sexual assault who is to be protected
under an order of protection issued by a
court of law.’’.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time, and I
move the previous question on the res-
olution.

question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the

TERMINATION OF NATIONAL
EMERGENCY DECLARED BY THE
PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 15,
2019
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, pursuant to House Resolution 144, I
call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res.
46) relating to a national emergency
declared by the President on February
15, 2019, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration in the House.
The Clerk read the title of the joint
resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 144, the joint
resolution is considered read.
The text of the joint resolution is as
follows:
H.J. RES. 46
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That, pursuant to section
202 of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622), the national emergency declared
by the finding of the President on February
15, 2019, in Proclamation 9844 (84 Fed. Reg.
4949) is hereby terminated.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON)
and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.
GRAVES) each will control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Georgia.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I ask unanimous consent that all
Members may have 5 legislative days
in which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material
on H.J. Res. 46.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
President Trump’s decision to de-
clare a national emergency at the
southern border to siphon funds for his
border wall is an unconstitutional, gro-
tesque abuse of power.
An emergency declaration is not a
last-ditch maneuver to employ when
all negotiation attempts have failed.
The House of Representatives has re-
jected the President’s border wall. The
Senate has rejected the border wall.
And the American people have rejected
this useless wall.
The President does not get to over-
ride Congress in a raucous temper tan-
trum over his inability to broker a
deal. The National Emergencies Act
was enacted in 1976 to expedite the al-
location of resources for real emer-
gencies to save American lives and
mitigate damage caused by natural dis-
asters and acts of terror. It was not
fashioned to allow a President to deny
the will of Congress and the American
people.
Both Democrats and Republicans
alike should be very concerned about
the ramifications of this unprecedented
executive action. It is a direct threat
to the balance of power that our coun-
try was built upon and a violation of
our Nation’s Constitution.
There is also no factual basis for the
emergency declaration. Immigration
from the southern border has signifi-
cantly decreased in the last 10 years.
Any attempts to characterize the bor-
der as a crisis zone are flagrant abuses
of statistics, which have shown that
border crossings are at the lowest they
have been in 40 years.
President Trump has long proved he
is not married to the truth or facts,
and he has no proof to substantiate his
wild claims about the status of the
United States and the Mexican border.
We cannot abandon our commitment
to responsible governing and the truth
because President Trump is outraged
at his inability to fulfill a campaign
promise.
There is wide bipartisan support for
this measure, and our democracy de-
mands that we condemn this subver-
sion of our Constitution and this mis-
use of Presidential power.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, the President clearly
laid out the case for the declaration of
a national emergency in his State of
the Union Address right here. National

security is obviously the President’s
highest priority, and I support his ef-
forts to build a wall.
There is a crisis. There is a crisis at
the border that could have been ad-
dressed much sooner and prevented.
Open border policies of the last admin-
istration compounded this growing
problem.
We have schools, hospitals, and other
services that have become over-
crowded. American workers have been
hurt by reduced job opportunities and
lower wages. At the same time, human
and drug trafficking has thrived.
In many communities, the notorious
MS–13 gang has grown. We have seen
tragic cases of crimes committed by il-
legal aliens who have been deported
not once, not even twice, but multiple
times.
I want to cite just one example from
my home State of Missouri. A man
named Pablo Serrano-Vitorino was de-
ported to Mexico after a felony convic-
tion in 2003. He later returned to this
country illegally and was arrested
again in 2014 and 2015 after several
more violent incidents, but he re-
mained in the U.S.
Then, in 2016, this individual, who
had no right to be in this country, was
charged for murdering five people in
Kansas City, Kansas, and Montgomery
County, Missouri.
Stories like this are not unique to
Missouri, Mr. Speaker. These horri-
fying events are happening across this
country.
This is a crisis. The men and women
who put their lives on the line every
day to bring order and security to our
borders deserve the tools that they
need to do the job, and now this Presi-
dent is taking decisive action to finally
address the crisis using the authority
provided to him by the Congress.
The National Emergencies Act is
very clear. The provisions the Presi-
dent will use under title 10 explicitly
provide the President with clear au-
thority.
I support the President’s efforts. I be-
lieve he is well within the law in mak-
ing this declaration, and I urge my col-
leagues to oppose H.J. Res. 46.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. CASTRO).
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
about 6 weeks ago, when the rumors
began that the President might declare
a national emergency to build his bor-
der wall, my staff and I began working
with legislative counsel to make sure
that Congress would have a say in what
amounts to constitutional cannibalism
by the President.
This is the most consequential vote
we will take in a generation on the bal-
ance of powers between the legislative
and the executive branches of govern-
ment, whether we will respect the sepa-
ration of powers enshrined in our Con-
stitution, stand up for Congress, for
this country, and for the Constitution,
or whether we will stand down, in favor
of the President.
The precedent that may be set today
and this week, or next week when the
Senate votes if Congress allows this
President’s emergency declaration to
stand will not have ramifications only
on this matter or the building of a bor-
der wall. If the President is successful,
he will likely come back for more. He
will likely circumvent Congress again,
in the same unconstitutional way.
Not only will this President do it, fu-
ture Presidents will do it.
I ask you this: How are we to tell a
future President, if this President is
successful, that gun deaths, which
number in the tens of thousands, are
not a national emergency, that opioid
deaths are not a national emergency,
that climate change is not a national
emergency?
This will allow a President to side-
line Congress from much of domestic
policy.
Bear in mind, over the years, Con-
gress has already, on its own, I believe,
given up a lot of its authority with re-
spect to foreign policy.
It is also clear that there is no emer-
gency at the border. Border crossings
are at a four-decade low. The folks who
are coming today are presenting them-
selves to Border Patrol agents seeking
asylum, not trying to get around the
border.
There are more law enforcement offi-
cers at our border—Federal, State, and
local officers—than at any time in our
Nation’s history.
Since its founding, this country has
become the most powerful and pros-
perous on the face of the Earth without
a border wall. That is why most Ameri-
cans disagree with the President usurp-
ing the power of Congress to build his
border wall.
In fact, not only do they disagree
with that, they disagree with using
military construction money on this
border project. Cities like mine, San
Antonio, stand to lose millions of dol-
lars in military construction.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote for this resolution.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, let’s be clear: Congress explicitly
authorized the President to undertake
certain military construction projects
that are not otherwise authorized by
law when it passed the National Secu-
rity Act. The President is working
within the legal boundaries that the
Congress gave him.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MEADOWS).
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, the
gentleman from Missouri is exactly
right. It is the statutes that allow this
President to do this.
The statutes don’t provide for na-
tional emergencies on climate change.
They don’t allow for national emer-
gencies on gun violence. But they do
allow it in terms of this particular
issue.
The President is exactly right. There
is a crisis at the border, Mr. Speaker.
But not only this President recognizes
it. The previous President, Obama, in
2014, did as well when he requested $3.7
billion in emergency spending to se-
cure the border.
Where was the outrage then? Where
was the outrage from my colleagues
across the aisle?
President Obama even went further
to say that we needed to secure our
border to deter both adults and chil-
dren from the dangerous journey that
they embarked on.
Where was the outrage across the
aisle then, Mr. Speaker? It was not
there.
Keeping criminals, human traf-
fickers, and drug smugglers away from
our communities is paramount.
b 1545
Yes, indeed, we do have an opioid
problem. We have actually appro-
priated billions of dollars to address
that. And yet, somehow, the drugs
flowing across our southern border are
not a crisis?
Again, President Obama seemed to
agree with this and declared a national
emergency for transnational criminal
organizations, specifically calling out
Mexico’s Los Zetas gang, and provided
more authority for ICE to actually
combat that; a national emergency.
Where was the outrage across the aisle
then?
But we don’t even have to look just
at the previous administration. Presi-
dent Clinton also declared a national
emergency to go after narcotics traf-
fickers.
Mr. Speaker, I just find it just unbe-
lievable that here today, that we have
got these newfound constitutionalists
across the aisle, wanting to rein in the
President’s authority.
This is about defeating President
Trump. I encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote on this
resolution.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
The American people should know
that there are not any statutes that
would allow a President to declare an
emergency to build a border wall, not
one piece of legislation would allow
that.
Previous Presidents have declared
emergencies, but they have never ven-
tured into the legislative prerogative
to allocate funding, and that is the dif-
ference that we have here.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. NAD-
LER), the chair of the Judiciary Com-
mittee.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, President
Trump’s declaration of a national
emergency, as an excuse to build a wall
that Congress explicitly rejected, is an
abuse of his constitutional oath, and
cannot be tolerated by a coequal
branch of government under the Con-
stitution. We must reject this unlawful
power grab and reassert Congress’ au-
thority to exercise the power of the
purse.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2132 February 26, 2019
The Constitution could not be clear-
er: ‘‘No money shall be drawn from the
Treasury, but in consequence of appro-
priations made by law.’’ That com-
mand reflects a fundamental principle
that is older than our democracy itself:
The chief executive cannot unilaterally
spend taxpayers’ money or redirect a
budget set by the people’s representa-
tives.
Earlier this year, Congress reached a
bipartisan compromise to fund the gov-
ernment, and it was signed by the
President. Congress allocated limited
funding for fencing in certain areas,
but squarely rejected the President’s
request to build a medieval barrier
across the southern border.
Almost immediately, the President
decided to rewrite the budget set by
Congress, and he told us exactly why.
He was not satisfied with what he got
from the process that the Constitution
dictates, so he did an end run and made
it an emergency.
He and his aides have barely even
tried to pretend that the so-called
emergency is a real one. They know
that illegal immigration is at histori-
cally low levels. They know that chil-
dren and families fleeing violence are
coming here to make lawful asylum
claims, not as some kind of invading
army.
They know that illegal drugs over-
whelmingly get smuggled through
ports of entry, and that a wall would do
nothing to change that. But they
refuse to let the facts and the law
stand in the way of their political
agenda.
Even worse, the emergency law that
President Trump invoked allows the
military to redirect funds only if an
emergency ‘‘requires the use of the
armed forces.’’ And those funds can be
used only for construction projects
that are ‘‘necessary to support such use
of the armed forces.’’
But a wall cannot possibly be ‘‘nec-
essary to support’’ a military operation
on the border because our laws prohibit
the military from engaging in law en-
forcement activities. The military can-
not enforce an immigration law, so the
President’s actions are doubly unlaw-
ful. There is no real emergency; and
even if there were, the President could
not redirect military funds for a pur-
pose expressly prohibited to the mili-
tary.
Fortunately, the Constitution does
not get suspended based on President
Trump’s preferences about what is con-
venient or ‘‘faster.’’ Our Nation’s
Founders left it up to all of us, includ-
ing those of us in Congress, to act as
guardians against exactly this type of
assault on our constitutional order.
In that spirit, I proudly support this
joint resolution, and I call upon my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
stand up and do the same.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS), who is on
the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on February 15, the President exer-
cised his clear authority under a clear
Federal statute, duly-enacted by Con-
gress, to use funds already appro-
priated by Congress for the purpose of
securing our southern border.
Mr. Speaker, I am glad about one
thing today coming here. I am glad
that, for many of the years I have been
here, I came through the Rules Com-
mittee, and others, and talked about
Article I authority. I am glad now to
see that we have others who have now
figured that Article I probably needs to
be enforced.
What is interesting is it is selective
enforcement against a President they
don’t like, for a purpose they don’t
want, for a wall that they don’t want
to have because securing a border is
not the top agenda for them.
I get it if you don’t like it. But argue
with the law. The statute itself and the
President’s actions, in accordance with
it, rest solidly within the separation of
powers, and are certainly constitu-
tional.
If you are citing the Supreme Court
case of Youngstown against the Presi-
dent’s action today during this debate,
then I suggest you haven’t read the
case. That reasoning of the Youngs-
town case only applies when the Presi-
dent is acting unilaterally and not pur-
suant to a duly-elected statute by Con-
gress.
Maybe the selective memory here is
because the previous President actu-
ally did that when he instituted the
DACA program under no things that he
could have found to actually work on.
Then we discuss the issue of, is there
an actual emergency on the border?
You know, a President once noted, he
said: ‘‘We have seen a significant rise
in apprehensions and processing of
children and individuals from Central
America who are crossing into the
United States in the Rio Grande Valley
areas of the Southwest border. The in-
dividuals who embark upon this per-
ilous journey are subject to violent
crime, abuse, extortion, as they rely on
dangerous human smuggling networks
to transport them through Central
America and Mexico.’’
Most may think that was from the
current President. It was not. It was
from President Obama when he was re-
questing more money for the emer-
gency on the border.
The problem is the factual basis is
there. We sat in a hearing today in the
Judiciary Committee, and I had to look
at the faces of our Border Patrol
agents and ICE agents, and others deal-
ing with this on a day-to-day basis
while all they get, many times from
this body, is hate and derision when
they are doing their job that we sent
them to do.
My problem comes back here—if we
can argue about different things—this
was under the law and done by Repub-
licans and Democrats for the last al-
most 40 years. If you want to fix this,
then you have done what you should do
under law. You have brought your reso-
lution of disapproval.
But if you really wanted to take Ar-
ticle I authority, then actually look at
the law itself. If you actually want to
change it that is what this body ought
to be doing.
If you don’t like the fact that the
President can do something and espe-
cially my friends across the aisle who
don’t want this President to do any-
thing, then fix the law. Go into this
emergency declaration and say, we will
define what a national emergency is.
We will do that.
They don’t want to do that because
they don’t want to bind the hands be-
cause they know that the law was writ-
ten for a purpose that has been upheld
for over 40 years. This is simply a
show. It is a farce.
Let’s just get to the political aspect
of this and say, Mr. Speaker, we don’t
like the President. We don’t like what
he is doing. Oops, we forgot about this
law, and the President said, I will act
under the authority given to me by
Congress.
You can have all the arguments you
want, but at the end of the day, Mr.
Speaker, when you cast this vote, don’t
hide behind Article I. Don’t hide be-
tween separation of powers. Go to the
law and look at what the law says and
vote ‘‘no.’’
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, may I inquire as to how much time
is remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 22 minutes
remaining.
The gentleman from Georgia has 221⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
We have heard a lot of cries from the
administration about there being a
problem on the southern border with
caravans loaded with people being
human trafficked, and this is just sim-
ply unsubstantiated and unfounded.
There are no reports that this hap-
pening. This is a figment of the imagi-
nation of some in the administration.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands
(Ms. PLASKETT).
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, the
President’s emergency declaration is,
in fact, a power grab to go outside the
bounds of the law and get what he
failed to achieve in constitutional leg-
islative process. After failing to con-
vince the American people and Con-
gress to pay for his ineffective, waste-
ful, multi-billion-dollar concrete wall,
the President is now trying a desperate
end run around Congress with his un-
lawful emergency declaration.
The President is declaring an emer-
gency over a crisis that does not exist.
The statute only applies to national
emergencies that require use of the
armed forces for military construction
projects ‘‘that are necessary to support
such use of the armed forces.’’ The bor-
der wall is not a military construction
project. It does not require the use of
the military.

February 26, 2019
The immigration law is the responsi-
bility of the Federal immigration en-
forcement agencies, not the military.
The President’s declaration violates
Federal law and that is the crisis. This
is a crisis, a crime against our Con-
stitution. It is an assault; it is a rape,
what the President is doing now,
against the Constitution, against this
legislative body.
I am just in another world that I, as
a constitutional, strict constructionist,
am on this side of the aisle on an issue
like this.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I might remind my colleagues that
Title 10, Section 2808, explicitly au-
thorizes the President to change the
appropriation for military construc-
tion. He is operating within the law.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROG-
ERS), who is also the ranking Repub-
lican of the Committee on Homeland
Security.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, without a doubt, there is a crisis at
the border. Changing demographics
have created unprecedented challenges
for the Border Patrol.
In the early 2000s, most illegal border
crossers were young Mexican men and
our laws allowed us to quickly return
them back to Mexico. But today, that
flow of Mexican men has been replaced
with a mix of men, women, and chil-
dren from Central American countries.
Human traffickers are exploiting the
loopholes in our laws and understand
how our immigration system is broken.
These smugglers tell vulnerable fami-
lies that their child is like their ‘‘visa’’
to stay in the U.S., if they can just get
themselves turned in to the border pa-
trol. And these smugglers and their
propaganda are effective.
Family apprehensions for fiscal year
2019 are already 572 percent higher than
fiscal year 2013. And these traffickers
don’t care about the people they smug-
gle. The result is that immigrants of
all ages are arriving on our doorstep in
terrible health.
Border Patrol projects a 133 percent
increase over last year in migrants
needing medical treatment after cross-
ing the border. These changing migrant
flows force our law enforcement offi-
cers to act as paramedics, rather than
enforcing the laws that Congress has
passed.
We need an ‘‘all-of-the-above’’ ap-
proach to border security, and that in-
cludes manpower, 21st century tech-
nology, and barriers. With this ap-
proach, we will deter human smugglers
and others crossing hundreds of miles
of open desert with innocent children.
We know this approach works. In
areas where we have built a wall sys-
tem, such as Yuma, illegal traffic has
plummeted by 95 percent. Let’s build
on this success.
I encourage my colleagues to stand
by President Trump’s decision to use
executive authority to carry out this
approach and keep America safe.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I am glad that the other side ac-
knowledges that the people approach-
ing our southern border are not men
from Mexico, but they are families
with children fleeing violence in Cen-
tral America. That is an important dis-
tinction.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
BROWN), vice chair of the House Armed
Services Committee.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-
er, there is no national emergency on
our southern border. There are no ter-
rorists who are being apprehended.
There is no invading hostile force, and
border crossings remain at a 40-year
low.
Pulling resources from military con-
struction projects, as President Trump
would do, projects meant to improve
readiness and support our servicemem-
bers, impacts our national security. It
will hurt military families who are al-
ready dealing with military housing
with mold and lead poisoning, and out-
dated schools and medical facilities.
This declaration of national emer-
gency will keep thousands of Active-
Duty troops needlessly deployed at the
southern border and away from their
scheduled training activities and oper-
ational readiness.
This is a fake emergency; and for
President Trump to claim we need to
build a wall to support our Armed
Forces, it is absurd and ridiculous.
This emergency declaration is just an
overreaching and dangerous power grab
to push forward the President’s anti-
immigrant agenda and supposedly
boost his re-election chances.
There is no national emergency; only
a crisis in the Oval Office.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I might point out to my colleagues
just how much of a national emergency
this is.
b 1600
It was President Obama who recog-
nized the crisis at the border. In 2014,
President Obama requested $3.7 billion
in emergency supplemental funding for
what he described as a humanitarian
crisis, a humanitarian crisis at the bor-
der. He specifically cited an increase in
family units trying to cross the border
and the lack of resources to accommo-
date them.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ADER-
HOLT).
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my colleague for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose
the joint resolution to overturn the
President’s declaration. I think it is
very clear that there is a national
emergency that exists on our southern
border because of the high rate of un-
checked, unregulated illegal immigra-
tion, illegal immigration that is di-
rectly contributing to the flow of
drugs, human trafficking, and gang
members into this country, not to
mention the humanitarian crisis of
those who feel compelled to make this
journey to illegally enter this country.
I think there seems to be some confu-
sion among many of my colleagues and
maybe many across the country about
the action of the President.
President Trump is clearly acting
within the authority that is provided
by Congress to confront a border secu-
rity and humanitarian crisis that con-
stitutes a national emergency.
The threat to our border security is
evident from the sheer number of mi-
grants seeking to gain illegal entry
into this country, and especially the
number of criminal aliens in the form
of cartels, traffickers, and gangs. These
people will continue to take advantage
of our weak borders for their own gain.
I recognize that Congress has law-
fully enacted the authority for the
President to use military construction
funds to support Armed Forces to en-
gage in accordance with the National
Emergencies Act.
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to oppose this joint resolution,
as the crisis at the border is real.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other
side keep invoking the mantra,
‘‘Obama, Obama.’’ Even though they
opposed each and every initiative that
he put forward, regardless of merit,
now they want to come back and cite
him for what he said and what he did.
But one thing he did not do was to allo-
cate funding that he was not entitled
to. He always requested from the Con-
gress funding authority.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from New York (Mr.
ESPAILLAT).
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, less
than 2 weeks ago, after a failed at-
tempt to establish consensus on border
security funding, President Trump, a
self-proclaimed master negotiator,
failed to get a border wall that he
originally said Mexico will pay for, so
then he fraudulently invoked a na-
tional emergency declaration to rob
taxpayers of funds from other pro-
grams.
The President’s brazen decision not
only violates Congress’ constitutional
powers of the purse laid out in Article
I, Section 9, Clause 7, it is also a fab-
ricated emergency propped up by fake
statistics, racist undertones, and the
blatant hypocrisy of a party that had
complete control of Washington for 2
years and didn’t see fit to fund this
useless, medieval wall themselves.
By diverting funds from military
projects, the President has determined
that national security takes a backseat
to his political priorities. Today, in the

Senate, the head of the U.S. Northern
Command said that border crossers do
not pose a military threat.
Mr. Speaker, there is no emergency.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD).
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to
this resolution.
When President Trump declared a na-
tional emergency, he did so in response
to the ongoing humanitarian crisis at
our border and with full statutory au-
thority vested in laws passed in this
very Chamber.
The majority claims that this resolu-
tion of disapproval is in response to a
power grab by a President acting out of
line. Yet, by merely disapproving of
the emergency declaration, they are
preserving his statutory powers they
claim are inappropriate.
If my colleagues across the aisle are
so concerned about separation of pow-
ers, why don’t they simply reform the
laws in title 10 and title 50 that the
President is using to respond to this
crisis? The answer is because this reso-
lution is not about the division of pow-
ers; it is not even about border secu-
rity. The only reason this legislation is
being considered on the floor today is
to obstruct the President’s agenda.
The President has made it clear that
he will use all statutory tools at his
disposal to secure the border, and that
is exactly what he is doing in declaring
this emergency.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this legislation.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, may I inquire the amount of time
remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 163⁄4 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Geor-
gia has 18 minutes remaining.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. GARCÍA).
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
my colleagues make some very good
points. They make convincing argu-
ments about executive overreach and
the misuse of Federal funds. I thank
them for those statements, and I would
like to ask a more personal question.
Since when do we call human beings
in need a national emergency? Have all
of President Trump’s other arguments
failed? Is he running out of insults for
people like me, people who came from
Mexico to have a better life in this
country?
He used to call people like me bad
hombres. When that failed, he turned
to other insults. And after they lose
their shock value, he calls us rapists,
then murderers. At that point, he ran
out of insults for people like me, so he
referred to us as coyotes.
Now, when all other labels have
failed to achieve his central campaign
promise to build a medieval border
wall, he calls people like me a national
emergency?
We must reject this premise as the
presence of people like me in this coun-
try, of people like my constituents in
my district, a national emergency.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from West Virginia (Mrs. MILLER).
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today because we must secure our bor-
der. We are in the midst of a national
security and humanitarian crisis on
our southern border which must be ad-
dressed.
Earlier this month, Congress secured
important and necessary funding to
protect over 55 miles of our most dan-
gerous border where it has been so des-
perately needed. We have also provided
funding for over 600 new border offi-
cers.
This was a good step in the right di-
rection, but as we see again today, our
colleagues from across the aisle remain
unwilling to address our intensifying
border crisis. With the national emer-
gency declaration, President Trump is
taking the steps our country needs to
stay safe and secure.
Yes, this is an emergency. Cartels,
human traffickers, and drug smugglers
take advantage of our weak border for
their own gain, and it must be stopped.
We need to stop traffickers from
bringing young girls and women into
our country where they are sold into
prostitution and slavery. As a mother
and a grandmother, this breaks my
heart.
We need to stop violent gangs like
MS–13 from entering our cities and
bringing their violence and evil onto
our streets.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), our
Caucus chair.
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the distinguished gentleman for yield-
ing.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to
this so-called declaration that is an-
chored in a phony, fraudulent, and fake
national emergency.
There is no crisis at the border.
There is no basis in law or in fact for
this unconstitutional emergency dec-
laration.
Illegal border crossings have not in-
creased; they have decreased. There is
no evidence of increased criminal ac-
tivity on the border. There is no evi-
dence of increased drug trafficking on
the border. There is no evidence that
terrorists are pouring into the United
States of America on the southern bor-
der.
This is a fantasy made up by a
xenophobic administration to support a
medieval border wall that this Article I
Congress rejected. That is why House
Democrats will work to defeat it.
Mr. Speaker, vote ‘‘yes’’ on the reso-
lution of disapproval.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. OLSON).
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my
friend from Missouri for yielding, as I
want to share my thoughts on this
purely political effort by the new
Democratic majority.
Mr. Speaker, the U.S. and Mexico
border is 2,400 miles long. My home
State of Texas is half that border, 1,200
miles.
Texas knows something others in
this Chamber apparently don’t know:
We are at war on the southern border
with the drug cartels.
I say it again. We are at war on the
southern border with the drug cartels
from Mexico.
The drug cartels are at the heart of
every single problem we have on our
southern border. They have a war
going with our families, our kids, and
our schools with record numbers of
heroin, cocaine, and deadly fentanyl.
The drug cartels are at war with our
world values by financing modern-day
sex slaves or forced laborers.
All of Texas, 254 counties—from
Amarillo to Texarkana, to Beaumont,
to Brownsville, to Marfa—are im-
pacted. They are at war with these
drug cartels.
The majority had better wake up and
have no more figments of imagination.
It is time to put politics aside and
admit we are at war with the drug car-
tels.
Mr. Speaker, let’s fight this war to
win and vote against the resolution
that surrenders to the drug cartels.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON), the
chair of the Homeland Security Com-
mittee.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
Georgia for yielding to me.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of the resolution.
I was in west Texas this past week-
end and saw nothing to justify the
President’s designation of a national
emergency. There aren’t gangs of vio-
lent criminals and terrorists over-
taking our southern border.
If there were a crisis, it is hard to
imagine a worse or less effective re-
sponse than a border wall, which will
take months, if not years, to build.
What I did see there are efforts to
harden ports of entry. In fact, just days
before I arrived in El Paso, sharp
barbed wire was installed in the middle
of a busy port of entry. This barbed
wire did not give off the impression
that this busy port of entry was wel-
coming commerce or visitors to the
United States. When questioned, offi-
cials could not say who had signed off
on this project or how it fits into bor-
der security.
It is time for the administration to
stop fear-mongering and accept reality.
The only crisis on the border is a hu-
manitarian crisis, one created by this
administration, and a border wall will
do nothing to alleviate the suffering.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in voting for this resolution to

stop the President from stripping Con-

purse.
b 1615
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from West Virginia (Mrs. MILLER).
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, we need
to stop violent gangs like MS–13 from
entering our cities and bringing their
violence and evil onto our streets. We
need to stop the drug smugglers from
devastating our communities and
flooding our towns with opioids, like
heroin and fentanyl.
My home State of West Virginia has
been hit hard by the opioid epidemic
and especially from illegal drugs smug-
gled across the border. Just several
weeks ago, Customs and Border Protec-
tion seized enough fentanyl to kill
every person in West Virginia 32 times
over. Imagine how much more is still
slipping through the unsecured areas.
Our country cannot afford inaction
any longer. We need to build this wall.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER),
the distinguished majority leader of
this House of Representatives.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this issue
is not about a wall. It is about the Con-
stitution. It is about this institution.
It is about the balance that we say is
equal between the Article I institution
and the Article II institution.
That is important to remember. That
is why this argument is so very impor-
tant.
It is not about just a single policy. It
is about the kind of government that
our Founding Fathers instituted,
which has been the envy of the world
and the example to many.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Con-
gressman CASTRO of Texas, and the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus for in-
troducing this resolution.
I was at the border in California and
in New Mexico just a few days ago. I
was at the border in El Paso with my
distinguished colleague, the former ex-
ecutive, called judge, of that area. She
will speak shortly. Ms. ESCOBAR will
say there is no war at the border and
there is no crisis at the border. She
will explain that better than I can. She
lives there.
At the border, I saw a lot of heart-
break and challenge, but I did not see
a national emergency that would jus-
tify the President ignoring the Con-
stitution and trying to make funding
decisions without congressional ap-
proval. That is the issue.
For my colleagues to say this is a
partisan issue, let me call your atten-
tion to the statements of approxi-
mately 20 Members of the United
States Senate.
The President admitted on February
15 that this is not a true emergency
when he said: ‘‘I could do the wall over
a longer period of time. I didn’t need to
do this, but I’d rather do it much fast-
er.’’
Not that he needed to do it much
faster, but he would just rather do it
much faster. Of course, if the Mexicans
were paying for it, perhaps he could
have.
Congress has a chance to answer the
President and make it clear that he
cannot make an end run around the
Constitution and claim powers reserved
for the taxpayers’ representatives.
Mr. Speaker, the Congress of the
United States needs to have a spine
and not lay at the feet of the President
of the United States and say, ‘‘What-
ever you want, sir.’’ That is not what
the people elected us to do. We are
their representatives, not the Presi-
dent’s representative, whether it is
President Obama, President Trump,
President Clinton, President Bush, or
President Reagan, all of whom I have
served with—two Bushes.
Our Founding Fathers had enough of
King George, so they adopted a Con-
stitution that said: We are not going to
have a King George. We are not going
to have an authoritarian regime. We
are not going to have the executive set-
ting policy. They said the Congress
sets policy.
By the way, 300 of us in this body
voted for the funding levels for border
security. It didn’t squeak by, by some
partisan advantage—300 of us, which is
to say well over 66 percent.
Now, Congress has a chance to an-
swer the President and make it clear.
He demanded that the American tax-
payers give him billions for the wall
that Democrats and Republicans alike
say is expensive and ineffective.
Again, this is not about the wall.
This is about our Constitution, our in-
stitution, and our self-respect.
He has chosen to ignore the will of
the American people, as expressed by
their representatives. He has opted to
set aside the wisdom of our Founders
for the expedience of getting his own
way.
Constitutional law professor Roger
Sloane of Boston University noted, last
week: ‘‘To my knowledge, no President
has ever tried to use national emer-
gency funding to appropriate funds
Congress refused to appropriate.’’
Overwhelming Senate vote; over-
whelming vote in this body.
He went on to say: ‘‘Politically, it
would mean the President would be
seeking . . . to override a bipartisan
judgment of Congress.’’
Have we no self-respect? Have we no
sense of the balance between the execu-
tive and the legislative branches of
government?
We are the Article I branch, the pol-
icymakers, the people who raise money
and spend money, not the President—
any President, Republican or Demo-
crat. And a lot of Republican col-
leagues, including Senator MCCONNELL,
said: Mr. President, don’t do this.
Right up until the time Senator
MCCONNELL said: I will support you,
Mr. President.
First, he was against this, and now
he is for it.
The respected Harvard Law School
constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe
said of the President, on Thursday: ‘‘He
is simply trying to do what emperors
and kings do, not what a President of
the United States should do.’’
In The Washington Post this week-
end, columnist Max Boot noted why we
are now at a pivotal moment for Mem-
bers of the President’s party in the
Congress, who are being asked to
choose between loyalty to the Presi-
dent and fidelity to the Constitution.
I am sorry the Chamber is not filled.
I thought of asking for a quorum call.
I didn’t.
Fidelity to the President or fidelity
to the Constitution, that is the choice
we make today. That is why this is a
pivotal moment. We choose between
the Constitution and its principles,
which have made our country the
world’s envied democracy for almost
two and a half centuries.
Boot continued with this: ‘‘Trump’s
action is an affront to all that Repub-
licans stand for.’’
The premise is you continue to stand
for this institution and our Constitu-
tion.
‘‘They claim to be pro-military, but
Trump’s action would take money
away from the defense budget. They
claim to be pro-property rights, but
Trump’s action would result in the
taking of private property along the
border. And they claim to be constitu-
tional conservatives, but Trump’s ac-
tion is an obvious violation of Article I
of the Constitution: ‘No Money shall be
drawn from the Treasury, but in Con-
sequence of Appropriations made by
Law.’ ’’
I used to have people coming up here
and taking out the Constitution and
saying: Have you read this document?
Do you know what it says?
Let me repeat it: ‘‘No Money shall be
drawn from the Treasury, but in Con-
sequence of Appropriations made by
Law.’’
Now, I have heard the scare rhetoric,
and I suggest to my colleagues, with
all due respect, that kind of rhetoric
has preceded every despot’s takeover of
power in the world. There was a crisis.
They had to declare military law. They
had to suspend the constitution and
suspend the laws.
That is how despots take power. We
stand at the gate to ensure that doesn’t
happen. But we will say more with our
votes.
If we vote yes, we will say that Con-
gress is still the voice of the American
people. We will say that we are still
faithful to the oath we took to protect
the Constitution and laws of our land.
And we will say that America, as our
Founders promised, has no sovereign
but we, the people—‘‘we,’’ not me, not
I. We, the people.
We must not allow the President to
set a dangerous precedent stripping
Congress of its power of the purse. This
is the first time. You can say there are
a lot of other emergencies. That is cor-
rect. But this is unique. We must not

allow him to set the precedent whereby
any chief executive, Republican or
Democrat, can declare an emergency
any time he or she doesn’t agree with
Congress’ funding.
This is not a partisan resolution. It is
supported and encouraged by former
and current Republican Members who
recognize how dangerous it would be
for the Congress not to act. A group of
23 former Republican Members of Con-
gress, including former Senators Olym-
pia Snowe, Dick Lugar, Chuck Hagel,
and John Danforth have sent a letter
to currently serving Republican Mem-
bers yesterday. In it they wrote this:
‘‘It has always been a Republican fun-
damental principle that no matter how
strong our policy preferences, no mat-
ter how deep our loyalties to Presi-
dents or party leaders, in order to re-
main a constitutional Republic, we
must act within the borders of the Con-
stitution.’’
Today, a conservative Senator from
North Carolina, a Republican conserv-
ative Senator from North Carolina,
said this: ‘‘I have grave concerns when
our institution looks the other way at
the expense of weakening Congress’
power.’’
b 1630
Senators MURKOWSKI and COLLINS
have already said they would support
this resolution.
So let us act and do so in one power-
ful voice—not as Democrats, not as Re-
publicans, as Americans; as representa-
tives; as people who have put their
faith in us to make a judgment to pro-
tect their country, their Constitution;
as Americans who believe in our Con-
stitution and the wisdom of our Found-
ers who gave Congress alone the au-
thority to appropriate funds and gave
the representatives of the people and
the States a powerful check on the ex-
ecutive.
I ask all my Republican colleagues:
How would you vote if Barack Obama
were President of the United States
today? Think of that. Because if you
cannot answer ‘‘I would vote the same
way,’’ then you are not being true to
your country, to our Constitution, and
to your oath.
If any Member cares at all about the
equal status of the Article I branch of
the Constitution, he or she should vote
for this resolution. Vote for conscience
and Constitution, not party and poli-
tics.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER), who just
came back from deployment down at
the southern border.
Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
I want to start by saying something:
Everybody here in this Chamber means
well. Everybody here in this Chamber
believes they are fighting for the right
thing for this country.
Unfortunately, sometimes with these
debates, they get heated and we begin
to ascribe bad motives to the other
side. I ascribe no bad motives to my
colleagues on the other side of the
aisle, and there are no bad motives on
our side. It is just a little bit of a dif-
ference in how we see it.
We are all passionate about this
issue, which is evident by the quality
of the debate we are having here. But I
am going to tell you why I came to be-
lieve that this was a national emer-
gency.
I was sent down to the border with
the National Guard. I went down and
did 2 weeks with my unit, which is
down there for 2 months.
As part-timers, we go down and we
fill in and augment different amounts
of time. I fly a surveillance aircraft. It
is called an RC–26.
We actually work with Border Pa-
trol, and what we would do is, through
technology, some of the technology
that exists, they would get indications
of a group coming over the border. We
would have a central authority that
would see these groups coming over the
border and would take the limited air
assets we had and put them on these
groups to surveil them and then coordi-
nate with Border Patrol, or whatever,
to come in and get them. And what we
saw, frankly, was pretty eye-opening
for me.
First off, Arizona has some very rug-
ged territory.
I have worked Texas, by the way,
three times doing this exact same mis-
sion. I am going to give you an oppor-
tunity to guess who the President was
when I did this mission three other
times. It was President Obama, because
he understood the need for the guard
on the border.
So we would see these groups come
over. They would go through this rug-
ged terrain.
By the way, I never worked an area
in Arizona where there was a barrier.
We never had to. But there is a lot of
area that isn’t.
We would then respond, and basi-
cally, 9 times out of 10, any time these
groups got any indication that Border
Patrol was nearby or there was an air-
craft overhead, they would do what we
call a bomb burst. It looks like that on
the infrared we are using. They would
run in all different directions, and
many people would get separated.
But do you know who the first to
bomb blast away from that group was?
The first people, every time, were the
coyotes who they paid their life sav-
ings to to bring them over the border—
every time.
In fact, one time that exact scenario
happened, and a lady was left lost in
the desert, hunkered down in a bush.
Had Border Patrol not found her—sure,
she will be deported for that because
she came in illegally. But if Border Pa-
trol had not found her, I believe that
there is a chance that she could have
been one of the at least 200 bodies that
they find every year in the desert be-
cause they are abandoned by their drug
traffickers, by their coyotes who are
paid for and who pay money to the
drug cartels.
That is a big part of where these car-
tels in Mexico get their money, fun-
neling people over the border, human
trafficking. We know the statistics of
the chance of assault during that. We
know that kind of stuff.
It wasn’t my mission, but my crew
was on a mission, the very first one,
where an illegal was apprehended, and
he had 70 pounds of methamphetamine
on him.
Now, I know there is way more than
70 pounds of methamphetamine out
there in the United States, but there
are way more people we are not seeing
come over that border as well.
People sometimes look at the rugged
terrain of Arizona and say, well, with
mountains and hills, that is the nat-
ural wall.
By the way, I went hiking on those
mountains and hills during my time
off, I will say that.
But the other interesting thing is a
significant amount of the people we
were following were actually on those
mountains and hills. They were on the
mountains and hills because that rug-
ged terrain is just as difficult for Bor-
der Patrol to navigate as them.
In fact, I watched as a Border Patrol
helicopter followed a man probably 100
feet away. This is on video. Border Pa-
trol can release this video if they want.
The man was running. The Border Pa-
trol cannot insert Border Patrol agents
to capture him. This guy is still gone
today. He had to have been a coyote or
a drug trafficker.
Seeing this repeatedly made me real-
ize this is not a national emergency be-
cause of immigration. I actually be-
lieve in comprehensive immigration re-
form. I want to work with the other
side of the aisle to fix all these prob-
lems that I think we really actually all
agree on. We just can’t admit we agree
on all this stuff. I look at this and I say
this is an 80 percent solution that we
can fix.
But when I came back from the bor-
der and I came back from seeing the
real issue that makes this a national
emergency—drugs, human trafficking—
that is when I realized something had
to be done.
A wall and a barrier is not
compassionless. I think border security
and compassion actually go hand in
hand. Because what we are saying is:
Come over to the United States of
America, but do it the right and legal
way, because, otherwise, these coyotes
in the cartel are going to take advan-
tage of you, take your life savings, and
take you through a very dangerous
route. And when the going gets tough,
they are going to leave you to die, be-
cause they did that to 200 of them last
year in Arizona.
It was an eye-opening experience.
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passion
everybody has in this. I respect
everybody’s debate in this. This is how
I came to the conclusion I did.
Please vote ‘‘no’’ on this.

er, it amuses me when my friends on

the other side cause the public to be-
lieve that there are people coming
across our border, trying to sneak in,
when the truth of the matter is the
people who are presenting themselves
at our southern border, primarily, are
people fleeing violence in Central
America, families, women, children
fleeing violence in Central America,
presenting themselves at lawful points
of entry, not trying to jump the Rio
Grande, but at lawful points of entry,
and seeking to apply for asylum. That
is the emergency that my friends on
the other side tried to make into some-
thing that would be such that Presi-
dent Trump is authorized to spend
moneys that have not been appro-
priated, and it is a farce.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS),
my dear colleague.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of this resolution.
Some of you may be old enough to re-
member when Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., traveled to Berlin in 1964. He re-
minded those gathered that a man-
made barrier could not change the fact
that the people on both sides of the
wall were God’s children.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you today: What
does it profit our Nation to gain a wall
and lose our soul? North and south of
the border, we are one people. We are
bound together by our common human-
ity.
Mr. Speaker, this executive action
betrays our values, our democracy, and
the very soul of our Nation.
As Members of Congress in a nation
of immigrants, we have a constitu-
tional mission and a mandate to pre-
serve the balance of powers and to op-
pose this monument to hate.
Today, each and every one of us has
a moral obligation to do what is right,
what is just, and what is fair by pass-
ing this resolution.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, may I inquire as to the time re-
maining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 73⁄4 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Geor-
gia has 111⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO).
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.
GRAVES) for yielding.
Today, I have heard a lot of amazing
things. My colleague on the other side
of the aisle, Mr. JOHNSON from Georgia,
said, I believe, caravans trying to cross
the border are a figment of our imagi-
nation. I don’t know about you, but I
think all we need to do is turn on the
news. I have seen thousands of people
traipsing thousands of miles to get into
our country. In fact, there has been
some violence. So I just don’t under-
stand that statement at all.
And Speaker PELOSI and CHUCK SCHU-
MER recently said the crisis at the bor-
der is manufactured. I tell you, ladies
and gentlemen, that I live in the State
of Arizona, a border State, and I have
visited the border, and I have met with
the border agents and border officials
at the border.
They have told me, firsthand, there
is a crisis at the border. They have told
me, firsthand, when I asked do we need
a border fence, they said, yes, it is part
of the solution.
You know, I am here today to ask for
reason. The Republican legislature, the
majority last year, tried to pass legis-
lation that would not only secure the
border but, as a compromise, would
have given legal status to the DACA
recipients. Not one Democrat voted for
it.
Can we please get together and solve
this problem?
It is unfortunate that the President
had to resort to this because Congress,
the Democrats, would not vote for bor-
der security. And so I support the
President in his declaration for emer-
gency. I support him in protecting our
Nation—his number one duty—and I
oppose this resolution.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I recall that the last 2 years have
been spent under the unified control of
Republicans—both Houses of Congress
and the President—yet there was no
emergency to construct the $5 billion
down payment on a border wall that is
going to cost about $30 billion. They
didn’t do it then; they want us to do it
now—or they want Trump to actually
be able to do it without the legislature.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from the great State of
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR).
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I come
from El Paso, Texas, which is right on
the U.S.-Mexico border. I live on the
border. My family has lived on the bor-
der for more than 100 years. I can as-
sure my colleagues that the border has
never been safer; the border has never
been more secure.
In fact, what I am more worried
about today than what is happening on
the U.S.-Mexico border, than those vul-
nerable asylum-seekers coming to our
front door asking for help, is I am more
worried that people in this Chamber
are willing to ignore the oath of office
that we took on the day that we were
sworn in, that we would violate the
Constitution that we promised to up-
hold.
I am also far more worried about the
fact that they are willing to divert
funding that is going to our U.S. mili-
tary in favor of a political prop, a
monument to xenophobia, a campaign
promise. In fact, Fort Bliss in El Paso,
Texas, stands to potentially lose $275
million.
Why didn’t they get it done when
they had an iron grip over the House,
the Senate, and the White House? Be-
cause there was no emergency.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, we did take an oath of
office to defend the Constitution. The
Constitution applies to citizens of the
United States. It does not apply to peo-
ple who are not citizens of the United
States.
Border security officers have made
266,000 arrests of criminal aliens in the
last 2 fiscal years.
These include criminal aliens
charged or convicted of assaults, sex
crimes, and killings. These are not
victimless crimes.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
b 1645
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from California (Mr. CISNEROS), my
good friend.
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, this
emergency declaration unconstitution-
ally attempts to override Congress.
The Constitution clearly grants Con-
gress the power of the purse. This dec-
laration took place after weeks of ne-
gotiations which resulted in Congress
rejecting the President’s wall in a bi-
partisan manner.
This declaration could take billions
of dollars of disaster relief aid from
families, endanger military construc-
tion, and impact our military readi-
ness. There is no national emergency
at the southern border, only a humani-
tarian crisis created by our President.
This President has repeatedly taken
actions that undermine our country’s
ability to defend against real threats
to national security.
Congress must act as a check on the
President’s abuse of executive power.
Congress has the opportunity to defend
and protect the Constitution and assert
its role as a coequal branch of govern-
ment, and it must do so in order to set
a precedent and protect our democracy.
It is absolutely unacceptable that
military families and communities
across this country should be made to
suffer from this unlawful and dan-
gerous action. That is why I urge my
colleagues to vote in support of this
resolution and move forward with end-
ing this fake national emergency.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, may I inquire how much time is re-
maining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 9 minutes re-

woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, what we are witnessing
is a President who poses a direct threat
to both our military families and
America’s national security.
First, as we have heard, there is no
border emergency. That is a fabrica-
tion. The administration’s own statis-
tics show that crossings and apprehen-
sions are at a historic low. The vast

majority of illegal drugs come in at our
ports of entry. A wall will not stop
that.
Many who cross our borders are
women and children. They are not run-
ning from border agents. They are
seeking them out for help and for asy-
lum.
Second, this will make life harder for
America’s military families, and, thus,
hurt our national security. Who would
ever intentionally make life tougher
for the brave men and women who
serve our country? It is monstrous,
really, when you think about the sac-
rifices that they already make for this
country.
As the chair of the Appropriations
Committee Military Construction, Vet-
erans Affairs and Related Agencies
Subcommittee, tomorrow I will hold a
hearing to ask our service Secretaries
exactly which projects they previously
told us they really needed, but now
should be sacrificed for a needless wall.
What will these leaders ask their
troops to give up just so Trump can
have a useless, wasteful wall? Training
or intelligence facilities? Hangars for
planes that cost billions? Schools for
our military families’ children? This is
a power grab.
After failing to get his way in a fund-
ing dispute with Congress, Trump is
throwing an unconstitutional temper
tantrum. He is using the tools of an au-
thoritarian, jeopardizing our military
readiness to steal himself a wall that
he could not get the lawful way. The
dangerous precedent he will set is one
that I hope all of my Republican col-
leagues will reject.
The President says a wall will keep
Americans safe, but stealing funds
from military families makes us all
less safe. Bypassing Congress and the
Constitution, and starving military
families of funding is not patriotism. It
is everything that true patriots fight
against.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing that
most drugs coming into this country
are coming in at ports of entry, and I
would make a correction: Most drugs
that are caught are caught at ports of
entry. We don’t have any idea what is
coming in across the border.
When we say that, this is like saying
we are going to reinforce the front
door, but we are going to leave the
back door wide open. We don’t know
how many drugs or the amount of
drugs that are coming across the bor-
der, particularly in rural areas, be-
cause we just simply can’t patrol it.
As the gentleman from Illinois point-
ed out, you can’t deploy Border Patrol
quick enough to catch much of this. So
we don’t know how many drugs are
coming through in other areas. We
have a pretty good idea at ports of
entry because we catch them there.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, it is harder for me to
imagine how a big, beautiful wall will
somehow bestow upon us knowledge
that people are jumping over it or
going under it.
Those kinds of things do not work
across the entire border. That may
have its place at some points, and I am
sure we have border wall and border
fencing in the locations where it is nec-
essary, but in the other locations, we
need—in addition to more Border Pa-
trol officers who are paid a living
wage—we need the technology and the
other assets that can surveil and help
with the apprehension of people who
are coming across the border at points
that are not legal points of entry.
But the point is, today’s crisis that
faces the people of Central America
and drives them to our southern border
is driving them to lawful points of
entry to seek asylum protection under
this Nation’s laws, and that is some-
thing that they are entitled to.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
The only crisis is the constitutional
crisis that has been created by the
President of the United States by his
direct and ill-conceived abuse of power
which is noted in the Constitution as a
violation of the Constitution.
It is sad that the President has de-
clared a national emergency for the
purpose of misappropriating funds from
previously designated and important
uses to build a wall, uses that would be
dealt with in a national emergency in
case of war that would then call for the
building of direct materials and build-
ings necessary for troops engaging in
war.
The only response to my good friend
who has come back from the border
and saw people going over the border is
to engage more Border Patrol agents
and train them to do the job that they
are designated to do. We, as Demo-
crats, support that.
Illegal border crossings are at a near
40-year low. Sixty national security
personnel, ambassadors, CIA, DNI, and
others have indicated that this is
wrongheaded. It is wrong.
The President’s declaration clearly
violates Congress’ exclusive power of
the purse, and if unchecked, would fun-
damentally alter the balance of powers,
violating our Founder’s vision for
America. That is unconstitutional.
To quote Thomas Paine in ‘‘Common
Sense,’’ it says, ‘‘ . . . in absolute gov-
ernments the king is law, so in free
countries the law ought to be king.’’
This is the abuse, the declaration, and
we should vote for the underlying reso-
lution to restore constitutional order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Texas.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me also indi-
cate that as a member of the Homeland
Security Committee, the numbers of
Mexicans from Mexico has decreased.
The numbers coming now are what
we call OTMs, other than Mexican.
They are coming and fleeing bloodshed
in countries where they are being
threatened with a decapitation of their
head.
Mothers are being told that if you
stay, we know you are pregnant, you
can have the baby, and we will kill you
after the birth. These are the stories
that those of us who visited the border
are hearing over and over again.
If there is a crisis, it is a humani-
tarian crisis. We, as Democrats, have
no problem with funding the resources
necessary for the border, including, as
indicated, the increase in personnel,
technology, and transportation equip-
ment.
I have been to the border when the
need for night goggles and other types
of equipment were rendered important.
Let us do the right thing. Vote on this
resolution, and do the constitutional
point of restoring order to this govern-
ment.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our
Constitution and in defense of our republic
and urge all members to join me in voting for
H.J. Res. 46, which terminates the phony dec-
laration of emergency issued by the President
on February 15, 2019.
The reason this resolution is before us
today is because of the petulant intransigence
of a single person, the current President of the
United States.
As a senior member of the Committee on
the Judiciary and the Committee on Homeland
Security, I have visited the southern border on
numerous occasions in recent weeks and
months and can state confidently that there is
no national emergency or national security cri-
sis that justifies the President’s reckless and
unconstitutional decision or compels the Con-
gress to abdicate its responsibilities under Arti-
cle I to check and balance the Executive
Branch.
The President is only pursuing this tactic of
declaring a national emergency after realizing
that Speaker NANCY PELOSI was absolutely
correct when she informed him that he did not
have the support in Congress to require the
taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that
‘‘Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!’’
In fact, according to the latest Marist Poll,
the most recent polling data available, Ameri-
cans overwhelmingly disapprove of the Presi-
dent’s national emergency declaration by a 61
percent–36 percent margin.
The President’s decision is opposed by both
men and women in every region of the coun-
try, by every income group and education cat-
egory.
National security experts across the political
spectrum are unanimous in their assessment
that the situation on the southern border does
not constitute a national emergency, an as-
sessment echoed by leading former Repub-
lican senators and Members of Congress.
They understand that after failing to con-
vince the American people or Congress to pay

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2139
February 26, 2019
for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multi-
billion dollar concrete wall, the President has
now embarked on a course of conduct that is
deeply corrosive of the constitutional system
of checks and balances wisely established by
the Framers and which has served this nation
and the world so well for nearly 250 years.
Having failed miserably to achieve his ob-
jective in the constitutional legislative process,
the President is trying a desperate 11th hour
end-run around Congress with an unlawful
emergency declaration that contravenes the
will of the American people and negates the
awesome power of the purse vested exclu-
sively in the Congress of the United States.
The Congress will not tolerate this.
Despite being repeatedly admonished and
in the face of overwhelming evidence to the
contrary, the President continues to propagate
false information regarding the state of our
southern border.
Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.
Net migration from Mexico is now zero or
slightly below (more people leaving than com-
ing) because of a growing Mexican economy,
an aging population and dropping fertility rates
that have led to a dramatic decrease in unau-
thorized migration from Mexico.
Migrant apprehensions continue to be near
an all-time low with only a slight increase from
2017.
The combined 521,090 apprehensions for
Border Patrol and Customs agents in fiscal
year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer
than the 553,378 apprehensions in 2016.
To put this in perspective, on average, each
of the 19,437 Border Patrol agents nationwide
apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in
2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 appre-
hensions per month.
In the last few years, an increased propor-
tion of apprehensions are parents seeking to
protect their children from the violence and ex-
treme poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and
Guatemala.
But even with more Central Americans arriv-
ing to our southern border seeking protection,
total apprehension rates are still at their lowest
since the 1970s.
The absence of a massive wall on the
southern border will not solve the drug smug-
gling problem because, as all law enforcement
experts agree, the major source of drugs com-
ing into the United States are smuggled
through legal ports of entry.
The southern border region is home to
about 15 million people living in border coun-
ties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and
Texas.
These communities, which include cities
such as San Diego, Douglas, Las Cruces, and
El Paso, are among the safest in the country.
Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer
dollars to immigration enforcement agencies
(more than $21 billion now) than all other en-
forcement agencies combined, including the
FBI, DEA, ATF, US Marshals, and Secret
Service.
The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection (CBP), with a
budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and
more than 59,000 personnel.
CBP is the largest law enforcement agency
in the country, and more than 85 percent of
the agency’s Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605
of 19,437) are concentrated on the southern
border.
Expanded deployment of the military to the
border to include active-duty troops could cost
between $200 and $300 million in addition to
the estimated $182 million for the earlier de-
ployment by the President of National Guard
to the border.
Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated
legislatively by Congress, a co-equal branch of
government, the President wants to finance
border wall vanity project by diverting funds
that the Congress has appropriated for dis-
aster recovery and military construction.
The funds the President wants to steal were
appropriated by Congress to help Americans
devastated by natural disasters, like Hurri-
canes Harvey, Irma and Maria, or for other
purposes like military construction.
Congress did not, has not, and will not, ap-
prove of any diversion of these funds to con-
struct a border wall that the President repeat-
edly and derisively boasted that Mexico would
pay for.
In fact, the President has admitted he
‘‘didn’t have to do this,’’ but has opted to do
so because ‘‘I want to see it built faster.’’
Mr. Speaker, just yesterday a bipartisan
group of nearly 60 national security officials in-
cluding former secretaries of state, defense
secretaries, CIA directors, and ambassadors
to the UN issued a statement declaring that
‘‘there is no factual basis’’ justifying the Presi-
dent’s emergency declaration.
Instead of protecting our national security,
the President’s declaration makes America
less safe.
The President is stealing billions from high-
priority military construction projects that en-
sure our troops have the essential training,
readiness and quality of life necessary to keep
the American people safe, directly under-
mining America’s national security.
The President’s declaration clearly violates
the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse,
and, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter
the balance of powers, violating our Founders’
vision for America.
Opposing the President’s reckless and anti-
American decision transcends partisan politics
and partisanship; it is about patriotism, con-
stitutional fidelity, and putting country first.
That is why nearly two dozen distinguished
former Republican Members of Congress are
urging Republicans in Congress to vote for
H.J.R. 46 and uphold ‘‘the authority of the first
branch of government to resist efforts to sur-
render’’ our constitutional powers to an over-
reaching president.
To quote Thomas Paine’s Common Sense:
‘‘In absolute governments, the King is law; so
in free countries, the law ought to be King.’’
Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to uphold
the rule of law and the Constitution, and reject
the President’s power grab; I urge a resound-
ing Yes vote on H.J. Res. 46.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I make a point of clari-
fication because the statement was
made that individuals from outside
this country coming to ports of entry
seeking asylum were entitled to that.
No one outside of this country is enti-
tled to anything in this country.
They can be heard, but they are not
entitled to asylum in the United States
just because they ask for it, just be-
cause they seek it. They aren’t entitled
to anything within this country.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I believe that most
learned colleagues in this Chamber un-
derstand that under U.S. law, we have
granted persons approaching our bor-
der the right to apply for asylum. That
doesn’t mean that asylum will be
granted, but they certainly have the
right to apply for it.
It is the humane thing to do in a civ-
ilized society. This is the law that
America has proceeded under for cen-
turies, and now we have a naked power
grab by the chief executive of this
great Nation, the President of the
United States, seeking to do the job of
the legislative branch, and his own job.
But there is a problem. It is only the
legislative branch that appropriates
funding for various occurrences.
The legislative branch has not given
this President what he has sought; that
is, a down payment on a border wall,
which is a monument to a campaign
promise that he made. This legislature
has not given him that authority, and
so in a naked power grab, he is seeking
to do it by declaring an emergency
when, in fact, no emergency exists.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON), my friend, and a
staunch advocate for the people of
Washington, D.C.
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I don’t even want to
speak to the underlying issue. I want
to speak to what it is we are doing here
with congressional power. The Presi-
dent signed a bill. He didn’t have to. He
could have retained his power.
Now he proposes to ignore the bill he
signed and act as if the Congress did
not exist. This is the road to dictator-
ship. Congress cannot ever agree with
an executive that takes our power.
That is what Trump is trying to do.
We have gradually given up our
power, sometimes for expediency sake,
sometimes to avoid controversy.
Today, we put all on notice that we
will not give the power that belongs
only to Congress to the President of
the United States.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, how much time is remaining?

H2140 February 26, 2019
‘‘We the people of the United States,
in order to form a more perfect Union,
establish justice, insure domestic tran-
quility, provide for the common de-
fense, promote the general welfare, and
secure the blessings of liberty to our-
selves and our posterity, do ordain and
establish this Constitution for the
United States of America.’’
b 1700
Immediately following that sacred
purpose, it says: Article I, the legisla-
tive branch.
Perhaps it is time for our country to
have a values-based civics lesson. I ap-
plaud our colleague, Congressman CAS-
TRO, for his leadership in ensuring that
this House was ready to reassert our
responsibility under the Constitution
and its systems of checks and balance.
In their wisdom, our Founders re-
jected the idea of a monarch. They
didn’t want to live under that. They
made that clear. They fought a War of
Independence to free themselves from
that. Therefore, in their wisdom, they
put forth in this Constitution a heart,
soul, and core of it: the separation of
powers, coequal branches of govern-
ment to be a check and balance on each
other.
They saw the wisdom of that and
then, of course, added the Bill of
Rights with further freedoms enumer-
ated. But the core of the Constitution
is the separation of power.
Today, we are on this floor of the
House, and our colleagues have spoken
eloquently about the reality or my-
thology of the crisis at the border that
the President contends. They have spo-
ken eloquently about the opportunity
cost of the money that the President
wants to use for this ill-conceived wall
and what it means to our national se-
curity.
But we in this House of Representa-
tives, each one of us, and everyone in
public service in our country, takes an
oath of office to support and defend the
Constitution of the United States. It is
our oath. We promise.
That Constitution is about the sepa-
ration of powers that is being usurped
by the executive branch. We in the leg-
islative branch cannot let that happen.
In fact, I appeal to our Republican
colleagues because I do believe and
trust that they are people of their
word, and if they take an oath to up-
hold the Constitution, they will honor
it with their vote on the floor today, in
keeping, by the way, with, under the
previous House Speaker, our colleagues
across the aisle placed a high priority
on the separation of powers and Con-
gress’ constitutional prerogatives.
The Republican A Better Way agen-
da, which they put forth in 2014, read as
follows: ‘‘The people granted Congress
the power to write laws, raise revenues,
and spend and borrow money on behalf
of the United States. There is no power
more consequential. . . . Yet for dec-
ades, Congress has let this power atro-
phy, thereby depriving the people of
their voice.’’
Their Better Way goes on to say:
‘‘The Founders insisted on a separation
of powers to protect our constitutional
liberties.’’
Their proposal goes on to say that
James Madison ‘‘warned that the Con-
stitution is a ‘mere parchment barrier’
unless each branch asserted its powers
to keep the others in check.’’
That is all in the Republican agenda
for A Better Way of 2014, so you would
think it would be in keeping with their
vote today.
In that spirit, then-Speaker Ryan
often lamented that Congress ‘‘keeps
forfeiting the game, yielding to the ex-
ecutive branch, giving the President a
blank check, not even bothering to
read the fine print in some cases.’’
We are not going to give any Presi-
dent, Democratic or Republican, a
blank check to shred the Constitution
of the United States. We would be de-
linquent in our duties as Members of
Congress if we did not overturn what
the President is proposing. He is asking
each and every one of us to turn our
backs on the oath of office that we
took to the Constitution of the United
States.
I do not believe that the Republicans
want to do that. I don’t think it is con-
sistent with what they had advocated
in the near term and historically.
Is your oath of office to Donald
Trump, or is your oath of office to the
Constitution of the United States? You
cannot let him undermine the strength
of your pledge to protect and defend
the Constitution.
Again, our colleagues have talked
about the opportunity cost of taking
money from our national security and
spending it in this way.
I was at the border this weekend. We
all have our stories and the rest, but
whatever you think about the wall,
let’s just put that aside for the mo-
ment. Whatever you think about where
you take the money from and where
you put it, which is substantial, put
that aside for the moment. The ques-
tion is: What do you think about your-
self, your Congress, your conscience,
and your oath of office? I trust that our
colleagues will be consistent in their
beliefs and join us in honoring the oath
we all take to support.
The resolution is not about politics.
It is not about partisanship. It is about
patriotism. It is about the Constitution
of the United States, which I hold in
my hand here. George Washington on
the cover of this says: ‘‘Its only keep-
ers, the people.’’
We in the people’s House are the
keepers of this Constitution. We in the
Congress are the keepers of this Con-
stitution. We in this Congress are in
Article I, the Congress of the United
States, spelled out very clearly in the
Constitution that the powers given to
the legislative branch are the power of
the purse, the power to declare war,
powers enumerated very carefully by
our Founders.
How can you ignore that? I urge
strong bipartisan support of this vital
resolution to honor our oath to bear
true faith and allegiance to the Con-
stitution.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, is the majority prepared to close?
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I have no further speakers, and I am
prepared to close.
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
I find it ironic, I guess, and actually
it is kind of ludicrous, that we talk so
much about how much this wall is
going to cost and how inhumane it is
and how immoral it is, yet we build
thousands and thousands of miles and
spend millions and millions of dollars
on noise abatement wall, 30 feet high
and 20 feet high, in our suburbs and our
urban areas all over the country. Yet
we can’t do something to protect our
border.
That is not a crisis, Mr. Speaker.
This is a crisis. What we are talking
about today is a crisis.
President Obama agreed when he re-
quested emergency funding in 2014 to
deal with the crisis on the border, when
he declared a national emergency be-
cause of transnational drug traffickers.
Since fiscal year 2012, Customs and
Border Patrol has seized 4 million
pounds of drugs at ports of entry and
more than 11 million pounds of drugs
between ports of entry. And nearly
three times as many drugs are seized
between ports, Mr. Speaker.
Many of our colleagues on the other
side of the aisle recognize the need for
a border wall, voting to authorize a
wall in 2016 and again under President
Obama in 2013. Last year, we passed bi-
partisan legislation to address the
growing impacts of opioids in our com-
munities, drugs that continue to flow
into our country through our southern
border. We all agreed, on a bipartisan
basis, that there was a crisis, but now,
suddenly, they are calling this a manu-
factured crisis.
The National Emergencies Act is
clear, Mr. Speaker. The President’s au-
thority is clear. The President is act-
ing within the authority that Congress
has given him.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on
this resolution, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
Mr. Speaker, in approving the joint
resolution terminating President
Trump’s illegal power grab, the House
will make clear that nothing is more
fundamental to the functioning of our
democracy than the separation of pow-
ers among three coequal branches of
government.
The facts are clear. President Trump
failed to convince a skeptical Congress
to pay for an ineffective border wall.

to the Constitution?
Vote to support this resolution.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back balance of

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-

President.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in
support of the joint resolution to terminate
President Trump’s phony declaration of an
emergency at the southern border.
Unable to convince Congress to pay for his
wasteful border wall, the president has de-
cided to make an end run around the legisla-
tive branch, upending democratic norms and
creating a dangerous precedent.
To pay for the wall, the Administration in-
tends to rob money from critical military con-
struction projects and from other parts of the
Defense Department and the Treasury.
This would threaten national security, under-
mine the readiness of our military, and could
disrupt critical infrastructure improvements that
benefit service members and their families—all
to prop up a political vanity project.
As a country, we should be focused on real
law enforcement needs, not a border wall that
will do virtually nothing to keep Americans
safe.
Today’s vote to block the president’s emer-
gency declaration is a critical first step, and I
am proud to cosponsor this resolution.
I hope my Republican colleagues recognize
that this isn’t about politics—it’s about defend-
ing our democratic institutions and the rule of
law from presidential overreach.
It’s about protecting our institution and our
Constitution in the face of an unprecedented
power grab from a president who rejects Con-
gress’ authority as a co-equal branch of gov-
ernment.
Mr. Speaker, the greatest power we have as
members of Congress is the power of the
purse. As we exercise that power, we should
invest responsibly in priorities that strengthen
and protect American families and commu-
nities.
We do not exist to rubber stamp the Presi-
dent. I urge my Republican colleagues to join
us in defending our constitutional prerogatives
and upholding the rule of law.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today had I
been present, I would have voted in strong
support of the bipartisan, privileged resolution
to terminate President Trump’s proclamation
‘‘Declaring a National Emergency Concerning
the Southern Border of the United States.’’ I
was detained due to severe weather and can-
celled flights in Oregon.
While there is no doubt that our immigration
system is broken, the president’s wall and his
proposed funding level is an irresponsible
waste of taxpayer funds for a structure that
would be ineffective and do very little for our
national security. The emergency declaration
is nothing more than a power grab by the
president to fulfill a campaign promise, vio-
lating existing law and our constitutional sys-
tem of separation of powers.
Congress has already rejected the presi-
dent’s proposed border wall, and alternatively,
by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, made
robust investments in our border security.
These investments include $1.375 billion for
approximately 55 miles of physical barrier
along the southern border, $564 million for im-
aging equipment at our ports of entry, $100
million for new, additional border security tech-
nology, serious investments in the Alternative
to Detention program to provide relief to over-
crowded detention facilities, and additional
funding for attorneys and courtroom expansion
to assist with our country’s growing immigra-
tion court system backlog.
Despite these important investments, the
president has proposed taking more than $6.7
billion to build his wall, including $3.6 billion
from the Department of Defense’s (DoD) high-
priority military construction projects. These
funds are meant to support much-needed im-
provements on military bases around the
world, and misallocating these funds could un-
dermine the training, readiness, and quality of
life for our men and women in the Armed
Forces. He has also proposed stripping $2.5
billion from the DoD’s drug interdiction pro-
gram, which could have serious impacts on
our ability to combat the flow of illegal nar-
cotics.
Furthermore, the Military Construction Codi-
fication Act only authorizes the Secretary of
Defense to reallocate funds for construction
projects during a national emergency if the
project is ‘‘necessary to support’’ a ‘‘use of the
armed forces.’’ Our Armed Forces are not re-
sponsible for enforcing our immigration laws
and using these funds in this way is in direct
violation of existing law.
Of serious additional legal concern is the
fact that the administration would need to
seize significant amounts of property not
owned by the federal government in order to
build a wall. Currently, more than two thirds of
border property is owned by private parties or
the relevant states. In 1952, the Supreme
Court held in Youngstown Sheet and Tube
that President Truman’s declaration of national
emergency, even in the midst of an inter-
national armed conflict, did not permit him to
unilaterally seize private property.
In recent days, more than two dozen former
Republican lawmakers and almost 60 former
senior national security officials have come out
in opposition to President Trump’s national
emergency declaration. These individuals are
united behind the idea that allowing the presi-
dent to ‘‘ignore Congress’’ will deprive the
American people ‘‘of the protections of true
representative government.’’
The bottom line is that the president’s na-
tional emergency declaration is an abuse of
his constitutional authority and an affront to
the separation of powers. Congress has the
exclusive power of the purse, and the Con-
stitution specifically prohibits the president
from spending money that has not been ap-
propriated. Congress entrusted the president
with authority to reallocate funds during un-
foreseen and urgent situations, such as wars
and natural disasters. By declaring an emer-
gency when Congress has overwhelmingly re-
jected his border wall in favor of compromise
legislation, President Trump is creating a dan-
gerous precedent for future political disputes.
Congress must reject this presidential over-
reach and assert its constitutional authority.
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to
express my support for this resolution to termi-
nate the President’s declaration of a national
emergency on February 15, 2019. No such
emergency exists on the U.S.-Mexico border.
The President is using this declaration as a
false pretense to divert taxpayer money, pri-
marily away from the Department of Defense,
toward the construction of a wasteful, ineffec-
tive wall along the southern border. This dec-
laration is an unacceptable abuse of power
that circumvents the constitutional authority of
Congress. For these reasons, I am a cospon-
sor of this resolution to terminate the declara-
tion pursuant to the provisions of the National
Emergencies Act.
I support taking action to make sure we
have the appropriate personnel, equipment,
facilities, and resources to protect our borders
from criminal activity like trafficking in drugs or
people. Building this wall is not a good invest-
ment and it will not stop crime or illegal immi-
gration along our southern border. Instead of
building walls, we should instead build bridges
to those who are fleeing violence and legally
seeking asylum in our country. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in rejecting the President’s
abuse of power by supporting this resolution.

Subtitle D—Wild and Scenic Rivers
SEC. 1301. LOWER FARMINGTON RIVER AND
SALMON BROOK WILD AND SCENIC
RIVER.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
(1) the Lower Farmington River and Salm-
on Brook Study Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–
370) authorized the study of the Farmington
River downstream from the segment des-
ignated as a recreational river by section
3(a)(156) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act
(16 U.S.C. 1277(a)(156)) to its confluence with
the Connecticut River, and the segment of
the Salmon Brook including its main stem
and east and west branches for potential in-
clusion in the National Wild and Scenic Riv-
ers System;
(2) the studied segments of the Lower
Farmington River and Salmon Brook sup-
port natural, cultural, and recreational re-
sources of exceptional significance to the
citizens of Connecticut and the Nation;
(3) concurrently with the preparation of
the study, the Lower Farmington River and
Salmon Brook Wild and Scenic Study Com-
mittee prepared the Lower Farmington
River and Salmon Brook Management Plan,
June 2011 (referred to in this section as the
‘‘management plan’’), that establishes objec-
tives, standards, and action programs that
will ensure the long-term protection of the
outstanding values of the river segments
without Federal management of affected
lands not owned by the United States;
(4) the Lower Farmington River and Salm-
on Brook Wild and Scenic Study Committee
has voted in favor of Wild and Scenic River
designation for the river segments, and has
included this recommendation as an integral
part of the management plan;
(5) there is strong local support for the pro-
tection of the Lower Farmington River and
Salmon Brook, including votes of support for
Wild and Scenic designation from the gov-
erning bodies of all ten communities abut-
ting the study area;
(6) the State of Connecticut General As-
sembly has endorsed the designation of the
Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook
as components of the National Wild and Sce-
nic Rivers System (Public Act 08–37); and
(7) the Rainbow Dam and Reservoir are lo-
cated entirely outside of the river segment
designated by subsection (b), and, based on
the findings of the study of the Lower Farm-
ington River pursuant to Public Law 109–370,
this hydroelectric project (including all as-
pects of its facilities, operations, and trans-
mission lines) is compatible with the des-
ignation made by subsection (b).

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona?
There was no objection.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise
today on behalf of a significant bipar-
tisan benefit for conservation in the
United States.
S. 47, the lands package, is the prod-
uct of many months of negotiation and
many years of committee process.
The bill benefits all Americans.
By protecting ecosystems, preserving
our cultural heritage, and connecting
the people to their lands, we dem-
onstrate this Congress’ commitment to
public lands that serve all Americans.
I am particularly proud that this
package will permanently authorize
the Land and Water Conservation
Fund, a program that supports recre-
ation access and conservation in all 50
States.
LWCF works for the people at no di-
rect cost to the taxpayer. It enhances
Americans’ enjoyment of public lands
across this Nation. It is time to guar-
antee the future of this very important
program.
In addition to LWCF, the package
would add over 1 million acres of wil-
derness, designate new national monu-
ments, and expand three national
parks, to name a few of the over 100
provisions.
I am proud to support LWCF; I am
proud to support S. 47; and I hope my
colleagues will similarly support this
bipartisan effort.
I want to offer my sincere thanks to
my fellow collaborators on the legisla-
tion: Congressman BISHOP and Sen-
ators MURKOWSKI, MANCHIN, and CANT-
WELL. Their willingness to work and to
compromise was crucial in turning this
bill into a reality. I congratulate them
on their efforts.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, when I became chair-
man of this committee, I vowed never
to do this kind of a package. I thought
that each bill deserved to be debated
and to be moved as a standalone.
Basically, we in the House did that.
Unfortunately, the Senate did not,
which is why there are at least 63
House-passed bills in this package, 62
of which were passed on suspension,
that have been sitting in the Senate,
languishing for up to a year and a half.
If somebody says they don’t have
time to look at all the stuff that is in
here, there have been months that they
have been able to look at this stuff as
it has been sitting over in the Senate.
Much of it is of parochial signifi-
cance, which means it solves local
challenges.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2212 February 26, 2019
The very basis of all the bills that
are in here is to put people above gov-
ernment. If indeed we are going to have
public lands, there should be access to
those lands.
That is one of the reasons why, for
the first time in years, we have had
some sportsmen’s activities that are
put into this particular bill. So the
sportsmen can assume if they are on
public land, it is going to be open for
recreational hunting and fishing and
shooting and all kinds of outdoor recre-
ation, unless it is specifically closed.
And a land manager cannot be arbi-
trary with that. If they are going to
close it, there has to be a public proc-
ess they go through that mandates
consultation with local officials.
It is extremely important that bow
hunters get some protection. Even
duck hunters get some certainty in
here. For the first time, we are going
to have special days for duck hunting,
for youth and veterans, as well as those
who are on Active Duty.
For the first time, there are real re-
forms of the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund. When that program was es-
tablished a half century ago, 60 percent
of all the land was supposed to go into
the State and local funds.
Those are the programs that your
constituents are calling you and say-
ing: These are the good things on why
this program should be reauthorized.
But when that cap was taken off, the
amount of money going to State and
local programs was reduced. In the
time of the Obama administration, it
was down to 12 percent. Everything
else was for land acquisition.
This bill reforms that permanently
by saying no less than 40 percent has to
go to those State and local funds that
your constituents like.
No less than 3 percent has to go to
fulfilling facility recreation access.
That means that we are, for the first
time now, really empowering people
and communities, State and local gov-
ernments, as well as sportsmen.
I have always said that I want to
shrink the Federal estate. This bill fi-
nally does shrink the Federal estate, in
my State as well as nationwide.
We create four new monuments in
this bill, but the right way; not expect-
ing the President to make a declara-
tion but, actually, for the Congress to
pass a bill, to debate the bill, and then
to pass the bill at the same time.
This administration actually did use
the Antiquities Act on one of these
monuments—nice and cute—but we are
going to do it the right way in this par-
ticular bill.
We are going to do wilderness the
right way. No longer should an agency
simply create wilderness by dicta or
fiat. Congress will make those deci-
sions of what is wilderness and what is
not going to be wilderness.
Let me talk for just a second about
wilderness, because it has some con-
troversy in here.
Over half the wilderness that is es-
tablished in this section of bills is in
my home State of Utah, but, as Mr.
CURTIS will tell you, the county com-
missioners, the local officials, endorse
this action. They are happy with it be-
cause they gain access to other areas
that can promote recreation and eco-
nomic development, which they have
been trying to get for several decades.
A quarter of this is also in California,
in one district. So we create wilderness
in the national park, but, at the same
time, we are taking wilderness study
areas and releasing those at the same
time. We are making exchanges so that
some of the lands go into trust funds
for education purposes, to fund the
education of our kids—something that
the East doesn’t need, but those of us
who live in the Federally controlled
West, we desperately need to do that.
For the first time we are taking
EAJA, and we will actually have some
transparency so we will really know
what it costs for environmental litiga-
tion.
These are all issues we have been
talking about for years in the House.
These are issues that we repeatedly
passed in the House. But, for now, we
have a chance of actually making it
happen.
Is this bill perfect? No. It is too big
to be perfect.
Is the process for creating this per-
fect? Hell, no. But I am perfectly satis-
fied and willing to vote for this, be-
cause without this there will be no
progress. The status quo will be main-
tained, and that is bad.
Senator GRAHAM used to say: If I am
going from Washington back to Hous-
ton and I get as far as Memphis, that is
not bad. If I end up in Boston, it is bad,
but for Memphis, that is not nec-
essarily bad.
We have been complaining for years
about elements that are in this pack-
age of bills, and now we have a chance
to actually be positive, to get to Mem-
phis and beyond, and to actually get
something done.
And if someone says: ‘‘It is not good
enough; I am holding out for something
better,’’ we are holding out for some-
thing that never has been and never
will be.
And it puts to the lie the complaints
that we have exaggerated in the past.
Congress is finally ready to act.
We should not refuse the solutions
that are in front of us right now. This
is a step forward, and this, obviously,
is better than the alternatives.
I urge adoption of this package of
compromise bills that have been
worked out in advance, and I appre-
ciate my colleagues on the Democratic
side who have worked so hard to try
and come up with a package of bills
that we can all support.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM), a member
of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I
am proud to stand here today in sup-
port of H.R. 972, the Reconstruction
Era National Historical Park Act.
I joined Majority Whip CLYBURN in
reintroducing the Reconstruction Era
National Historical Park Act, which
expands the Reconstruction Era Na-
tional Monument in Beaufort, South
Carolina, and makes it a national park.
This bill also creates a national net-
work of reconstruction era historical
sites so they can receive the recogni-
tion that they deserve.
The Lowcountry’s vibrant recon-
struction history is often overlooked or
misunderstood, and this act would seek
to correct that.
I am honored to work with Majority
Whip CLYBURN to preserve, protect, and
promote reconstruction history.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 972.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), the dean of the
House, someone who has forgotten
more about public lands than the rest
of us will ever know.
(Mr. YOUNG asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank former Chairman BISHOP and
Chairman GRIJALVA for their work on
this legislation.
This is a proud moment. We listened
to a lot of angst a while ago, and now
we look at two people working to-
gether to solve a problem. This is how
Congress should work.
I am especially proud of this legisla-
tion because, as the chairman men-
tioned, there are 62 pieces of legisla-
tion that passed this House that are in
this bill somewhere, including five
which are mine.
I think it is important to the State
of Alaska. What this bill does, as men-
tioned by the chairman and the past
chairman, is gives opportunity to ev-
erybody to be involved. As the chair-
man said, it may not be everything we
want. I had a couple of things we didn’t
get in it, but this is the beginning of
working together on public lands as
they should be, with those that are di-
rectly involved in it.
The legislation that was in this bill
that was mine: There was the Alaska
Native veterans and selection of
lands—first time. Been trying 15 years,
and we finally got it done.
It also has and expands the long over-
due sand and gravel mineral rights to
Alaskan Natives in Barrow. A lot of
this land surrounds Native villages, so
this legislation solves a lot of those
conflicts. And everybody supports it.
I am very excited about this legisla-
tion. I want to thank my senators for
working on it and finally getting it
done but, most of all, the committee,
the Natural Resources Committee,
where I was chairman for 6 years. This
is a good piece of legislation, and I urge
passage of this piece of legislation.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. NEGUSE), a member of the
Committee on Natural Resources.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2213
February 26, 2019
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today as a Coloradoan, an environ-
mentalist, and a conservationist to
support S. 47.
I want to thank my home-State col-
leagues in the Senate; of course, my
friends from the other side of the aisle;
and, most importantly, our chairman,
Chairman GRIJALVA, for his leadership
with respect to this bill.
In the great State of Colorado, we
understand the value of our public
lands. Our State’s outdoor recreation
economy brings in $28 billion and $10
billion in workers’ wages alone.
Investing in our public lands, con-
serving our wild places, is good for our
economy, and it is good for our future
generations.
I am proud that this bill not only in-
cludes nine measures that would im-
pact my State, but two provisions, in
particular, that I introduced earlier
this Congress that directly benefit
Colorado’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict.
First, the Bolts Ditch Access and Use
Act is an important provision that al-
lows the town of Minturn, in Eagle
County in my district, water access
with use of the Bolts Ditch headgate.
Secondly, the WEDGE Act incor-
porates 124 acres of land adjacent to
Rocky Mountain National Park into
Arapahoe National Forest.
I am excited to take up both of these
provisions on the House floor today,
both of which will have a real local im-
pact on the communities that I am so
honored to represent in Colorado’s Sec-
ond.
Not only this, but, of course, S. 47
provides permanent authorization of
the Land and Water Conservation
Fund, which is long overdue and a
milestone for future generations.
Mr. Speaker, I would urge my col-
leagues to support this bill and look
forward to continuing to work to con-
serve our public lands.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Utah (Mr. CURTIS), my colleague.
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of this very important
package, S. 47, the Natural Resources
Management Act.
This bill is comprised of dozens of
smaller bills, including two that I have
had the opportunity to sponsor: the
Emery County Public Land Manage-
ment Act and the Endangered Fish Re-
covery Programs Extension Act.
The Emery County bill has been a lo-
cally driven effort and will bring long-
term certainty to the area through
various designations and expanding
Goblin Valley State Park for better
management. It will also generate mil-
lions of dollars for Utah school kids
through the School Trust Land Ex-
changes.
Also in this package, the Endangered
Fish Recovery Programs Extension Act
will ensure access to critical water
sources and continue to promote the
recovery of four endangered species.
There are many, many who deserve
praise for their years and decades of
work on these bills. I would especially
like to thank Republican leader
BISHOP, who has been invaluable in
pushing these bills across the finish
line and, on a personal note, has
mentored me through very difficult
public lands issues.
Especially today, I would like to give
appreciation and recognition to Emery
County commissioners, who had the
ability to see into the future to under-
stand how important this was for their
county and to work through all the dif-
ficult issues.
Finally, I would like to thank my
colleagues on the Democratic side of
the aisle for their willingness to work
with me, to see this through our eyes
and to explain this through their eyes.
I am grateful for the friendships and
relationships that I have developed
through this process.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing
both of my bills headed to the Presi-
dent’s desk with the passage of S. 47.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LOWENTHAL), chair of the
Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral
Resources of the Committee on Natural

Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I
strongly support the passage of this bi-
partisan public lands package. This
broad, sweeping legislation is impor-
tant because it includes provisions that
will permanently reauthorize the Land
and Water Conservation Fund, but it
will also designate over 1 million acres
of wilderness on Federal lands in
States across the West, including over
300,000 acres in California alone.
The bill also includes the Wildlife In-
novation and Longevity Driver Act, or
the WILD Act, a bill I am proud to
colead in the House with my Alaska
colleague, Representative DON YOUNG.
The WILD Act reauthorizes the Part-
ners for Fish and Wildlife Program, as
well as the Multinational Species Con-
servation Funds, which will include
dedicated funds for rhinos, for tigers,
for great apes, for marine turtles, as
well as for African and Asian ele-
phants.
The WILD Act will also expand the
Marine Turtle Conservation Fund to
include tortoises and freshwater tur-
tles, establishing a new source of fund-
ing for these priority species.
As we all know, over 60 percent of
these 330 modern species are now either
threatened, are endangered, or, unfor-
tunately, are now extinct.
The WILD Act will also protect eco-
systems and wildlife from invasive spe-
cies through the development of stra-
tegic plans for reducing invasive spe-
cies populations on land or water man-
aged by Federal agencies.
Finally, the WILD Act also includes
a newly created Theodore Roosevelt
Genius Prize, a concept that will en-
courage innovation in wildlife con-
servation, combating wildlife traf-
ficking and poaching, protecting en-
dangered species, as well as other
areas.
The WILD Act, and S. 47 more broad-
ly, will help wildlife and land conserva-
tion efforts in the United States and
around the world. I strongly support
this legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS), one of the sen-
ior members from Kentucky who can
talk about how you do a monument the
right way.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr.
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member
BISHOP for yielding me this time and
mainly for his support of the Mill
Springs Battlefield National Monu-
ment Act, which is included in this
great package before us today. And he
did it the right way, Mr. Speaker.
The nonprofit Mill Springs Battle-
field Association has worked tirelessly
for nearly three decades to preserve
and maintain more than 900 acres to
honor and commemorate the first
major Union victory in the Civil War,
even constructing a 10,000-square-foot
visitor center and museum at the site
where the national cemetery is located.
I was proud to introduce legislation
that would add this historic battlefield
in Kentucky’s Wayne and Pulaski
Counties to the national park system.
Enactment of S. 27 today will ensure
that this national treasure is pro-
tected, preserved, and promoted well
into the future.
I, therefore, urge your support.
And especially to Mr. BISHOP, who,
over the years, as chairman of the com-
mittee, worked with us in great detail
on this project, I want to especially say
my thanks to Ranking Member BISHOP
and the committee.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from New
Mexico (Ms. HAALAND), chair of the Na-
tional Parks, Forests, and Public
Lands Subcommittee on the Natural
Resources Committee.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, as a
35th-generation New Mexican, I rise
today in support of S. 47. This bill rep-
resents a major victory for conserva-
tion, and I want to congratulate the
chairman and his co-drafters on its
success.
In my home State of New Mexico,
new protections in the Organ Moun-
tains, the Cerros del Norte, and San
Juan County will add over 250,000 acres
of new wilderness, the highest con-
servation protection this Congress can
bestow.
These lands will preserve our eco-
systems, protect access to clean, con-
sistent water flows, and help our State
to begin to adapt to the realities of cli-
mate change.
By permanently authorizing the
Land and Water Conservation Fund, S.
47 will help my home State and every
State in this Nation, and I strongly en-
courage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’

Oregon (Mr. WALDEN), someone who
used to be on our committee but went
over to the dark side and is now former
chairman somewhere else.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, as the
top Republican on the Energy and
Commerce Committee, I enjoy the rela-
tionship and camaraderie I have with
the Natural Resources Committee, and
I want to thank the gentleman from
Utah and my friend Mr. GRIJALVA, the
chairman of the committee for once
again bringing this measure forward af-
fecting Crooked River Ranch.
The Crooked River Ranch Fire Pro-
tection Act is essential to saving lives
in central Oregon. With another wild-
fire season just on the horizon, the peo-
ple of Crooked River Ranch are really
deeply concerned that they could be-
come the next Paradise, California, and
they are deeply concerned that their
community could be turned into ash as
wildfire feeds off the dense fuel loads
that surround this community of 5,000
people.
They are there because of a lack of
proper management to thin out the
fuel loads because this area is in a wil-
derness study area. What we are doing
is moving the boundary back about 800
acres. So at the BLM, it will all stay
public. The BLM can come in and use
mechanical treatment, literally, to re-
duce juniper and sagebrush so that the
firefighters can come in and fight fire
if they do get one.
We know what happens in this kind
of terrain, the tragedy, the loss of life,
loss of homes, the loss of community.
There are 5,000 people out on a rim, if
you will, in a canyon with only one
way in and one way out. The fire chief
has told me that if fire breaks out and
it is the wrong kind with enough wind,
he might not put his firefighters in
there. So today we are going to save
lives, thanks to your work.
Harry Ward, the fire chief, said this
‘‘has created a dangerous environment
and continues to threaten the people
that live here.’’
This legislation will adjust that
WSA. The important public safety leg-
islation will give peace of mind to the
residents of Crooked River Ranch.
Last year, a fire only a few miles
away burned 2,000 acres. It destroyed
two homes in less than a day. The next
fire season is not far away. We do not
want to see images like this of homes
turned to ash and lives destroyed in
central Oregon, where we have a real
opportunity to prevent that from hap-
pening thanks to this bipartisan legis-
lation.
So I want to thank my Senators who
worked on this. I want to thank Mr.
GRIJALVA and Mr. BISHOP for their
work on this, and I appreciate its being
brought in as part of the package of
bills that now will go to President
Trump, who I am convinced will sign it
into law.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), a member of
the Natural Resources Committee.
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Arizona for yield-
ing and for his leadership on this issue.
I rise in strong support of S. 47, the
Natural Resources Management Act.
And as my colleague from Utah so elo-
quently stated, this landmark public
lands legislation is the product of
years, decades of work at the com-
mittee level, and months of bipartisan,
bicameral negotiations. It includes
support from key conservation, sports-
men, and environmental stakeholders.
The outstanding provisions in this
bill will enshrine and safeguard our Na-
tion’s conservation legacy for decades
to come. This begins with permanent
reauthorization of the Land and Water
Conservation Fund. It should never
have expired. Permanent reauthoriza-
tion of LWCF will mean this program
and its important work can continue
unimpeded for future generations.
Almost 20 years ago, John Dingell led
the first effort to permanently reau-
thorize it with his friends DON YOUNG,
George Miller, Billy Tauzin, and Chris
John, a geographically and diverse
group of leaders who happened to like
the outdoors and, yes, hunting and
fishing.
LWCF funding has protected some of
our country’s most treasured natural
resources, while creating jobs, sup-
porting local economies, and providing
countless opportunities for recreation.
Since 1965, LWCS has provided over $3.9
billion for over 40,000 projects in every
county across this country, with every
$1 invested returning $4 in economic
value.
This benefits every congressional dis-
trict, every county, and every State in
this country. Preserving our beautiful
and iconic places matters to us all and
was the reason for initially starting it.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield the gentle-
woman from Michigan an additional 30
seconds.
Mrs. DINGELL. Being here today
with this bipartisan group of people
working to preserve our land, he is
looking from up above and saying: Well
done, all of you.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN), one of the
hardworking members of our com-
mittee.
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in strong support of S. 47, the
Natural Resources Management Act.
Mr. Speaker, this bill signifies a
strong bipartisan consensus and com-
mitment to protecting our Nation’s
public resources, including parks, wild-
life, habitat, and access to the out-
doors.
Today’s vote will help preserve thou-
sands of acres of public land so that
Americans can visit, explore, fish,
hunt, and enjoy wildlife in the out-
doors for generations to come.
I am particularly proud of the meas-
ure which will provide long-term sus-
tainability of the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. I am also proud to see
the important sportsmen’s titles in-
cluded in this bill that will expand ac-
cess for recreation, fishing, and hunt-
ing on public lands.
I would like to thank Ranking Mem-
ber BISHOP and Chairman GRIJALVA for
their tireless work to help make this
bill a reality.
As a lifelong sportsman and sup-
porter of our Nation’s refuges, parks,
and public lands, I urge every Member
of this body to support this legislation
so that we can provide permanent sta-
bility for the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund to improve access for
sportsmen and to conserve wildlife
habitat for future generations.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Ne-
vada (Mr. HORSFORD), a member of the
Natural Resources Committee.
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, as the
Representative of Nevada’s Fourth
Congressional District, a district that
is home to over 50,000 square miles of
geographically diverse land, including
several national monuments and parks,
I am proud to voice my support for the
Natural Resources Management Act.
As we have heard, this bill perma-
nently reauthorizes the Land and
Water Conservation Fund, an integral
conservation program that has pro-
vided the State of Nevada with $40 mil-
lion for investment in local parks and
another $60 million to benefit our pub-
lic lands.
Moreover, this bill expands access to
outdoor recreation opportunities for
communities across America. Outdoor
recreation is a vital aspect of Nevada’s
economy. In 2017, it supported nearly
90,000 jobs, contributed $4 billion in
wages, and spurred $12 billion of con-
sumer spending in our State.
I am proud to vote for this bill to ex-
pand outdoor recreation opportunities,
particularly for our underserved com-
munities, many of whom depend on
Federal funding to develop parks and
recreation.
As the 116th Congress continues, I
look forward to working with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
continue to develop conservation pro-
grams that work for all of America.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY), a gen-
tleman who has never been on our com-
mittee, but we have appreciated his
friendship and helping to move this
package.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I want
to thank the former chairman and the
ranking member for bringing this
package today, and the bipartisan
work that we are advocating for here
on the House floor.
I rise in support of this important
bill for two reasons, two reasons di-
rectly related to western North Caro-
lina, where I am honored to represent.
First, it has a permanent reauthor-
ization of the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. This is a very impor-
tant program that uses offshore energy

resources to fund protected lands that
are of national importance: our rivers,
our scenic byways, our lakes. Clean
water in western North Carolina, ac-
cess to the great outdoors has been a
great driver of our economy, and LWCF
has helped fund the preservation and
protection of those areas.
Second, I stand in support of this im-
portant bill because it reauthorizes the
Blue Ridge National Heritage Area.
These two pieces of legislation, the
LWCF reauthorization, and the Blue
Ridge National Heritage Area, are two
items that I have sponsored independ-
ently of this package, and I am glad
they are a part of this resolution before
us.
The Blue Ridge National Heritage
Area ensures the preservation of the
unique cultural history of western
North Carolina and provides access to
our land surrounding the Blue Ridge
Parkway.
So those two important areas are
just a small part of this larger package
that has been hammered out in a bipar-
tisan way. I commit it to my col-
leagues, and I ask for a ‘‘yea’’ vote.
b 1745
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. HILL).
Ms. HILL of California. Mr. Speaker,
I thank the chairman for yielding to
me.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.
47. In addition to permanently reau-
thorizing the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, which is, of course,
critically important, this bill also es-
tablishes a memorial for the St.
Francis Dam disaster. This memorial is
a project that has been a priority for
my hometown, the city of Santa
Clarita, for many years, and the site is
just miles from where I grew up and
where my sister now lives.
The St. Francis Dam was an integral
part of our city’s water infrastructure
back in the 1920s. On March 12, 1928, the
dam failed, and the resulting flood
killed over 450 people, cost millions of
dollars, and destroyed many homes and
other property. The collapse of the St.
Francis Dam is considered one of the
worst civil engineering failures of the
20th century and is the second dead-
liest disaster in California history.
I am proud that, in the 116th Con-
gress, we will finally be able to mag-
nify the stories of this tragedy and pro-
vide a constant reminder of how crit-
ical infrastructure is to the safety and
security of our communities.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). We are
sending out our members all over the
place. He used to be a member of our
committee. He has moved on to lesser
roles now.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Mr. BISHOP, as well as Mr. GRI-
JALVA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise enthusiastically
today to support this package that the
House is considering. It includes one of
my bills, the Yakima River Basin
Water Enhancement Project Phase III
Act. This legislation authorizes the
next phase of the Yakima Basin Inte-
grated Plan, which is a decades-long ef-
fort to address the vital water needs of
the ag community, conservationists,
and certainly my constituents
throughout the Yakima Basin.
Mr. Speaker, I have not only worked
on this project for the last three Con-
gresses, but I hate to say it, my efforts
go back even further, almost 30 years,
more than I would like to admit, as a
farmer, former State legislator, and as
director of the State department of ag-
riculture. Today demonstrates the
closest we have ever come to sending
this crucial legislation to the President
to sign into law.
I firmly believe that the Yakima
Workgroup and the Implementation
Committee are a model for the rest of
the Nation to follow to address divisive
issues. I invite all of my colleagues to
come see for themselves. This group
represents a diverse array of local,
Tribal, State, Federal, ag, environ-
mental, and private interests. They
have worked through decades of pains-
taking compromise, collaboration, and
efforts to find solutions.
So I rise to thank all of them for
their hard work, all of the Tribal lead-
ers, the State-Federal partners, the
commissioners of the counties, con-
servation organizations, the cities,
local irrigation representatives, and
certainly the Natural Resources staff
who have worked very hard on this all
along, including Mr. Bill Ball. Without
their hard work and deep commitment
to addressing this comprehensive issue,
we would not be as close as we are
today to getting this crucial step done.
Mr. Speaker, I urge the strong sup-
port of all my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle for this package of legisla-
tion that we consider today.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN).
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
commend the gentleman from Arizona
and his staff for their tremendous work
on this bipartisan bill.
I particularly appreciate its inclu-
sion of a provision originally authored
by my predecessor, Niki Tsongas, to
add the Nashua River to the Wild and
Scenic River System.
Seeking this designation has been a
labor of love for the communities in
the watershed and local leaders like
Marion Stoddart and Elizabeth Ainsley
Campbell.
I also value the bill’s funding cap ad-
justment for Essex National Heritage
Area.
Finally, it is outstanding to see the
bill’s renewal of the Land and Water
Conservation Fund, a program that has
benefited nearly every corner of the
Nation, including Minute Man and
Lowell National Parks in the district I
grew up in and am proud to represent
today.
Mr. Speaker, I urge the bill’s swift
passage.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE), who worked
very hard, especially in December, for
the passage of this package.
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in strong support of S. 47, this
lands package.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both
the chairman and the ranking member
for their bipartisan work on this im-
portant bill.
Our public lands define our Montana
way of life. Three principles guide my
approach: conserve our public lands, in-
crease public access, and trust our
local communities.
These principles guided me to protect
the gateway to Yellowstone National
Park. I met with the residents and
community leaders, and the consensus
is clear: They don’t want mining in
Paradise Valley. That is why I intro-
duced the legislation to permanently
ban mining on 30,000 acres of public
land just outside Yellowstone Park.
That measure is included in this pack-
age today.
This package also permanently reau-
thorizes the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund.
Susan and I raised our kids hunting,
fishing, and backpacking on our public
lands in Montana, and I know how crit-
ical LWCF is to Montana.
Permanently protecting the gateway
to Yellowstone and permanently reau-
thorizing LWCF will help preserve and
expand public access to our public
lands.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage
of this bill. It is so important to Mon-
tana.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon
(Mr. SCHRADER).
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to speak in support of the Natural Re-
sources Management Act, a bipartisan
package that includes my bill, the
Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers
Act.
This legislation would designate over
21 miles of the Molalla River as wild
and scenic, a Federal designation that
will permanently ensure its protection
and preservation as one of Oregon’s
many national State treasures.
The idea to designate the Molalla
River as a wild and scenic recreational
river was initiated over 12 years ago by
Molalla residents who were looking to
preserve and protect their river. Mr.
Speaker, I want to acknowledge and
thank these community partners, chief
among them the Molalla River Alli-
ance, American Rivers, Molalla River
Watch, Northwest Steelheaders, the
Oregon Department of Fish and Wild-
life, and the city of Molalla.
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to rec-
ognize the efforts of a few key individ-
uals: Mike Moody, John Atkins, Jack
Hammond, Mike Clarke, Kay Patter-
son, Craig Roberts, Bill Taylor, David
Moryc, Bob Rees, and, frankly, so

many others who have worked tire-
lessly on this project. It is because of
their hard work that the cultural, his-
torical, and recreational benefits of the
Molalla River will be protected for gen-
erations to come.
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the
Natural Resources Management Act.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN), a former
member of our committee, but also a
leader in the sportsmen’s community.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the chairman for yielding me time.
Mr. Speaker, as the former chairman
of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Cau-
cus and an avid outdoorsman, I rise
today in support of S. 47, the Natural
Resources Management Act.
But let’s be clear. Where does most of
the funding come from to fund the
Land and Water Conservation Fund?
The Land and Water Conservation
Fund is overwhelmingly funded by roy-
alties from offshore oil and gas leasing
on the Outer Continental Shelf. It is
funded mostly from money energy
companies that produce fossil fuels pay
the Federal Government.
Even though we are going to over-
whelmingly, even with bipartisan sup-
port, permanently reauthorize a pro-
gram that has enjoyed success since
1964, it will remain in jeopardy. Why?
Because many of the Democrats sup-
porting this have also supported this
asinine, illogical, and scientifically un-
founded proposal called the Green New
Deal. A shift under the Green New Deal
away from oil and gas to complete de-
pendence on renewables, and you can
kiss this fund good-bye.
How will they propose to pay for the
Land and Water Conversation Fund? I
can assure you it won’t be from royal-
ties generated by renewable energy. It
will be from higher taxes.
I support energy exploration. I sup-
port conservation and this bill with as
little cost to the American taxpayer.
That is why I rise in support, but I im-
plore everyone to think about how
counterproductive the Green New Deal
really is in actually conserving our
precious environment.
It is time we hold the Green New
Deal’s supporters accountable to the
lack of logic and science behind their
proposals that have been estimated to
cost up to $93 trillion.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER).
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Mr. GRIJALVA for yielding to me.
Mr. Speaker, I am excited to have the
opportunity to speak on this bill, and I
strongly encourage all of my col-
leagues to support this important lands
package.
Now, there is one section, the same
as DAN NEWHOUSE’s, that is particu-
larly near and dear to my heart and
critical for my district and for the
State of Washington. It is the Yakima
River Basin Integrated Plan that you
just heard about.
This forward-thinking legislation
will ensure water security for our
farmers, rivers, salmon, and commu-
nities for the foreseeable future. It al-
lows Tribes to make important infra-
structure improvements, protects local
salmon habitat, and, therefore, is also
instrumental in saving our dwindling
Puget Sound orcas.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud my Repub-
lican colleague, Mr. NEWHOUSE, and
also our Senators, MARIA CANTWELL
and PATTY MURRAY, and so many peo-
ple who worked hard on this plan to
make it come true, for the effort they
have put in over so many years to see
this legislation through.
The Yakima River Basin Integrated
Plan is a model for the rest of the
country on how to address water scar-
city in a changing climate. Partners
with very divergent interests all came
together with a common goal of pro-
tecting Washington’s environment and
wildlife and ensuring our communities
are resilient in the face of a changing
climate.
This agreement will help Washington
State for years to come.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK).
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in strong support of the Nat-
ural Resources Management Act. I am
especially proud this bill will perma-
nently reauthorize the Land and Water
Conservation Fund.
This vital piece of legislation will
benefit millions of Americans in innu-
merable ways, from promoting rec-
reational activity to contributing to
our Nation’s robust economy, along
with furthering environmental protec-
tion and wildlife conservation.
The Land and Water Conservation
Fund benefits 98 percent of counties
across the United States and contrib-
utes to an economy that encompasses 1
out of 15 American jobs.
Since its establishment over 50 years
ago, the Land and Water Conservation
Fund has greatly benefited my home
district in Bucks and Montgomery
Counties in Pennsylvania.
Treasured public lands, such as
Nockamixon State Park and Tyler
State Park, and cherished community
venues, such as Hatfield Community
Park, are all just a few of the examples
of the beneficiaries of this valuable
fund.
Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the
strong bipartisan support the Natural
Resources Management Act has re-
ceived, and I compliment my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle for
advancing this. It is long overdue, and
I urge all of my colleagues to vote in
favor of this bill.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from the
District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) for
her comments.
b 1800
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank
my good friends for working together
to produce this magnificent lands
package.
Mr. Speaker, this lands package
takes all our precious land seriously,
including our urban parks. I particu-
larly appreciate that this bill allows
the District of Columbia to receive full
State grant funding for our city parks.
First off is Franklin Park in down-
town D.C. to be rehabilitated with pub-
lic-private partnership money using
Federal, local, and private-sector fund-
ing.
This bill incentivizes the private sec-
tor to step up and do its part to see
that our public parks are as good for
business as they are for people. The
Founders of the Capital city made sure
that the Capital would be a city of
parks. Watch us set an example for
urban parks throughout the country by
supporting this important legislation.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
am pleased to yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.
BURCHETT).
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Ranking Member BISHOP for
yielding me this time.
Mr. Speaker, the Natural Resources
Management Act is notable for its bi-
partisan support and for the conserva-
tion of our natural treasures.
Tennessee’s Second District, the dis-
trict I represent, is home to a large
portion of the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park, Mr. Speaker, the most
visited national park in our Nation.
Last year, more than 10 million visi-
tors enjoyed the park, its wildlife, and
its beautiful views and vistas.
The Foothills Parkway traverses the
park, and it includes a bridge currently
called, creatively enough, Bridge 2. S.
47 would rename the bridge for the late
Dean Stone, a longtime editor of The
Daily Times in Maryville, Tennessee.
During his tenure at The Daily
Times, Dean advocated for the comple-
tion of the Foothills Parkway that en-
ables so many to view the park. I hope
to take my daughter, Isabel, and my
wife, Kelly, up there shortly.
Bridge 2 posed one of the greatest
challenges to the parkway’s comple-
tion. It has been described as an engi-
neering marvel, Mr. Speaker, for the
construction techniques that mini-
mized its environmental impact.
It is fitting that this bridge bears
Dean’s name, not only so we can con-
tinue our stewardship of these land-
scapes, but also so that we can honor
the people who pushed us to preserve
them and increase their accessibility.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I won-
der if I may inquire if the gentleman
from Utah has any additional speakers.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Yes, I have a
couple speakers.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. CARTER).
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2217
February 26, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encour-
age my colleagues to support S. 47, the
Natural Resources Management Act.
This legislation includes important
provisions for public lands across our
Nation, but specifically for three na-
tional parks in the State of Georgia.
One of those includes my own piece of
legislation, a boundary expansion for
the Fort Frederica National Monument
in the First Congressional District of
Georgia.
Designed by General James
Oglethorpe in 1733 on St. Simons Is-
land, Fort Frederica was built to de-
fend the young colony against attack
from the Spanish in Florida. Nine
years later, in 1742, General
Oglethorpe’s design was put to the test.
The Spanish invaded the Georgia col-
ony as part of the larger War of Jen-
kins’ Ear headed directly for Fort
Frederica.
The Spaniards numbered around 5,000
troops, while General Oglethorpe had
fewer than 1,000 regular soldiers, Na-
tive Americans, and local colonists
garrisoned inside the tabby structure.
The English detected the Spanish inva-
sion, waded into the marsh, and am-
bushed the enemy troops in an engage-
ment now called the Battle of Bloody
Marsh. Consequently, this battle
turned back the Spanish and was the
last of their offensives into the colony
of Georgia.
This story, battle, and fort is an im-
portant moment in Georgia history,
taught to elementary students
throughout the State as a marker of
our resolve and a turning point that
helped to create the State of Georgia
that we now know.
In passing years, specifically with up-
dates in technology, we increase our
knowledge of history through new find-
ings. That is exactly the opportunity
we have here with Fort Frederica and
why we need this legislation.
Studies now show that land just out-
side the national park boundary was
used as a campground and even a bat-
tery that protected the area from war-
ships. This bill adjusts the existing
Fort Frederica National Monument to
include those locations inside the
boundary, in an effort to better pre-
serve those locations and continue to
learn more about this area and the
critical events that unfolded here in
the First Congressional District of
Georgia to create our home State of
Georgia.
This legislation has been in the
works for the last 12 years, beginning
when the Saint Simons Land Trust
temporarily purchased the additional
land in 2007.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the committee
for their work on this. We need to pre-
serve this history for generations to
come.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate
those who have come down and spoken
on this particular bill, especially when
you can say the word ‘‘Oglethorpe’’ all
the time. It is one of the great names
in American history.
This is a good piece of legislation
that will make some solutions and
move this forward. It is not perfect,
but it actually solves some problems.
Many are parochial, but significant,
local concerns.
That is why this package is here. It
passed the 63 bills that we have passed
in the House but were sitting in the
Senate. This has a chance of actually
bringing some kind of cloture to all of
that.
Mr. Speaker, I urge favorable adop-
tion of this piece of legislation, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone who
voiced their support for S. 47.
Before we close and turn to a vote, I
again express my thanks to my col-
leagues who helped bring this bill be-
fore us today. It is a major win for con-
servation across the United States, and
I strongly encourage all my colleagues
to vote in favor of this legislation.
The American people need to know
from this Congress that there are op-
portunities to produce bipartisan wins,
whether it is for conservation or public
lands or, more importantly, for the
people of this country. I think this bill
represents that.
I extend my appreciation and my
thanks to respective staffs on both
sides of the aisle, for their hard work
in bringing this together.
As my friend from Utah said at the
outset of this conversation today, it is
not a perfect bill, but it is an effort on
the part of many of us who came to
this with disparate views, different
opinions, and opposition to some of its
content. It was an effort to try to do
something that reflected common
ground. I think this bill reflects com-
mon ground. I think it is a win for all
of us.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my col-
leagues to vote in support of S. 47, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker,
I rise in strong support of S. 47, the Natural
Resources Management Act.
This public lands package represents a real
investment in our natural heritage.
By protecting over 1.3 million acres as wil-
derness, and making significant expansions of
some of our most sacred national parks, this
legislation will ensure that our public lands are
pristine and accessible for our children and
grandchildren.
As a lifelong hunter and outdoorsman, I am
especially proud that this package includes
legislation from my ACCESS ACT that is cru-
cial to sportsmen and sportswomen across the
country.
This includes my legislation to permanently
reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation
Fund, our nation’s most successful conserva-
tion program in all 50 states, for over 50
years.
And, S. 47 includes my language to encour-
age innovative ways for citizens to work along-
side natural resource agencies to conserve
wildlife and its habitat.
I thank my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle who worked to negotiate this important
public lands package and I urge my col-
leagues to vote yes on S. 47.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, S. 47.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, on
that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

DIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF
THE SENATE TO MAKE A COR-
RECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT
OF THE BILL S. 47
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I send
to the desk a concurrent resolution and
ask unanimous consent for its imme-
diate consideration in the House.
The Clerk read the title of the con-
current resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona?
There was no objection.
The text of the concurrent resolution
is as follows:
H. CON. RES. 21
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the
Senate concurring), That in the enrollment of
the bill S. 47, the Secretary of the Senate
shall make the following corrections:
(1) Strike subsection (a) of section 1 and in-
sert the following: ‘‘(a) SHORT TITLE.—This
Act may be cited as the ‘John D. Dingell, Jr.
Conservation, Management, and Recreation
Act’.’’.
(2) Strike the header of section 9003 and in-
sert ‘‘JOHN S. MCCAIN III 21ST CENTURY CON-
SERVATION SERVICE CORPS ACT’’ (and conform

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-

Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, and ask for its immediate
consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, and recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, if this
unanimous consent request, which
would prevent the killing of a living
child, cannot be entertained, I wonder
what might be.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not been recognized for de-
bate.

HONORING SAMUEL D. ROBERTS
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Samuel D. Roberts for
his lifetime of service to the people of
New York.
Sam’s career began with General Mo-
tors, where he was a union worker who
served as chairman of the UAW Local
465 Education and Civil Rights Com-
mittees. While at GM, Sam served five
terms as an Onondaga County legis-
lator. Then the people of New York
State’s 128th Assembly District sent
him to represent them in Albany.
After 5 years in the State assembly,
Governor Andrew Cuomo tapped Sam
to serve as commissioner of New
York’s Office of Temporary and Dis-
ability Assistance, a $5.4 billion office
that oversees more than 2,000 workers.
Sam recently retired from govern-
ment to serve as a special advisor to
SUNY Oswego’s president.
Throughout it all, Sam has kept
community first. He has created posi-
tive change that will last for genera-
tions both in Onondaga County and
throughout the State of New York.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues join me in celebrating Samuel
D. Roberts, a pioneering community
leader.
f
COMMENDING CORRECTIONS
OFFICERS
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, this month I met with
representatives from two Federal cor-
rectional institutions located in the
15th District of Pennsylvania: FCI
McKean and FCI Loretto.
I thank the representatives for vis-
iting my Washington, D.C., office and
taking the time to discuss their prior-
ities for the year ahead. They shared
the need to increase staffing levels at
Federal prisons because low personnel
numbers can result in a more dan-
gerous working environment.
Today I commend corrections offi-
cers at FCI McKean and Loretto and
all across our country who help protect
our communities and uphold the values
of our justice system. Officers face dan-
gerous situations in the workplace
every day, but that does not deter
them.
Just like our first responders, correc-
tions officers are regularly risking
their lives to keep their community
members safe. They enforce the rule of
law, and they carry out their duties
without complaint. Their dedication
and sacrifice often goes unnoticed by
the public, but we owe them our grati-
tude.
Madam Speaker, let us always thank
them for the important work that they
do to keep us safe.

GUN VIOLENCE
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on an historic piece of legis-
lation that will make its way to the
floor tomorrow, H.R. 8, which will re-
quire background checks on all gun
sales in the United States.
In 2017, almost 40,000 Americans died
from gun violence—the highest total
on record since the Centers for Disease
Control began tracking the statistics
50 years ago. This is an epidemic that
for far too long has gone unaddressed
at the Federal level. But that stops
now.
Thoughts and prayers cannot stop
the never-ending string of gun violence
that terrorizes communities across the
Nation, but commonsense legislation
can. That is why I am so proud to co-
sponsor H.R. 8, which marks a signifi-
cant step forward in our efforts to keep
guns out of the wrong hands.

I urge my colleagues to vote in favor

TRAGIC FLOODING
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I
rise tonight concerned about residents
of my district dealing with flooding
that claimed one life there and has
damaged roads and private property
throughout the region. The loss of life
during this recent flooding is tragic,
and my family and I continue to pray
for everyone affected back home.
One group of people deserves to be
recognized for the work they do in
times of crisis, and they are our first
responders and other emergency per-
sonnel. When the rest of us are seeking
shelter from the storm, the men and
women who make up our fire and police
departments, rescue crews, and emer-
gency communications professionals
are going to work to coordinate a rapid
response that will save lives and help
limit property damage.
It is appropriate that during these
times of disaster we continue to pray
for those who are suffering and show
appreciation for those who work so
hard to protect us.
Madam Speaker, I ask that all my
House colleagues join me in doing that.
f
GUN VIOLENCE
(Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I
am here to tell a story about gun vio-
lence that spans multiple generations,
and it started in my hometown of Cam-
den, a city in New Jersey.
A tragic event happened in Camden
in 1949. Howard Unruh shot and killed
13 people. This event is now considered
the first modern mass shooting in our
country’s history.
During those horrific events that un-
folded, a 12-year-old boy hid in the
closet as his mother and father were
slaughtered. His name was Charles
Cohen, and nearly 70 years later in a
school in Parkland, Florida, his own
granddaughter, Carly Novell, hid in a
closet, just like her grandfather did.
Carly is with us today to see how true
democracy works.
I will end with Carly’s words. She
said: ‘‘This pain shouldn’t be genera-
tional.’’
She is right. It shouldn’t have hap-
pened, and we must do more for our
children, for our grandchildren, and for
everyone in our communities.
f
BLACK HISTORY MONTH
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, as
you know, this month is Black History
Month, and I am taking some time to
remember African Americans who have
made a difference in the community
where I live.
I rise today to honor one of my com-
munity’s civil rights and community
leaders, Mr. Nelson Polite, Sr., of Lan-
caster. Mr. Polite was one of the early
leaders in the civil rights movement in
Lancaster in the 1960s. He was a fierce
advocate who worked hard to change
the unjust policies of segregation.
Mr. Polite devoted his life to the
ideals of fairness and justice for every-
one, regardless of their skin color. He
organized protests against Whites-only
admittance at Rocky Springs pool and
followed in the footsteps of his father,
who helped found the Lancaster
NAACP.
Mr. Polite led by example and rep-
resented the goodness of our commu-
nity. He was active in his church and
worked to ensure that residents had
job opportunities, housing, and overall
quality of life.
He served as a Lancaster councilman
for 12 years. This month, Black History
Month, marks 3 years since he passed
away, but the evidence of the change
that he fought for is evident in our
community. I was proud to count him
as a personal friend, and it is my honor
to remember him today and, this
month, highlight the work that he did.
f
GUN VIOLENCE
(Mrs. HAYES asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to voice my support for two bills
that the House will consider this week:
H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112. These bills are the
first comprehensive gun violence pre-
vention bills to be considered in the
House since the Violent Crime Control
and Law Enforcement Act was signed
into law in 1994.
Far too often innocent lives are
claimed due to gun violence. Nearly
40,000 people die of gun-related injuries
per year.
While mass shootings often dominate
the headlines, we cannot continue to
turn a blind eye to the gun violence
happening on a daily basis in cities all
over the country and even my own
hometown of Waterbury, Connecticut. I
have lived in a neighborhood where the
sound of gunshots in the distance was
as normal as hearing church bells, and,
as a teacher and a mother, I have seen
firsthand how the fear of violence af-
fects our children.
For far too long, Congress has failed
our communities by remaining silent
on this issue. America is ready for
commonsense background check legis-
lation. I owe it to my community, I
owe it to my State, and I owe it to the
people of Newtown, Connecticut. That
is why I look forward to casting my
vote in support of H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.
THE STORY OF MICHAEL COHEN
(Mr. GAETZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I guess
tomorrow we will find out if there is
anyone that Michael Cohen hasn’t lied
to. We already know he lied to Con-
gress. We already know he lied to law
enforcement, lied to the IRS, lied to
three banks, and he is going to prison
for his lies. So I guess it will be rel-
evant for us to determine: Does he lie
to his own family? Does he lie to his
financiers? Does he lie to his financiers
who are members of his family?
It will be one heck of an inquiry for
us because this is someone who has
tangled such a web of lies that he is
not to be believed. I think it is entirely
appropriate for any Member of this
body to challenge the truthfulness, ve-
racity, and character of people who
have a history of lying and have a fu-
ture that undoubtedly contains noth-
ing but lies. That is the story of Mi-
chael Cohen.
We will see it play out tomorrow, and
I for one can’t wait to get to the bot-
tom of things and can’t wait to get to
the truth.
f
HIGH-SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker,
California’s high-speed rail system has
broken promise after promise and
made false claim after false claim.
I want to commend President Trump
for working to pull back the $928 mil-
lion that is still authorized, that could
be reachable, and turn this money into
something that could be useful for
more Americans or even for more Cali-
fornians.
Now, we also need to send a bill to
the State of California for $2.5 billion
for the money they wasted for a project
that has not fulfilled what was re-
quired in the proposition the people
passed by 52 percent to 48 percent. The
price has more than tripled since then.
We need to focus on doing the trans-
portation projects in the country that
would actually help move people in a
fashion that they can use.
Governor Newsom was right there
with his State of the State speech the
other day. I know he knows different.
Let’s go ahead and put a stop to this
project, put the money back into fixing
our highway system or our levee sys-
tem or our water system in the State
of California and not send the bill to
the other 49 States of this country
that, in good faith, initially sent that
as part of the stimulus package. Let’s
put it into good, solid projects.

minute and to revise and extend his re-

Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, it is a
shame that the new House majority,
instead of fully funding border secu-
rity, a few minutes ago actually passed
H.J. Res. 46, which would reverse the
President’s emergency declaration that
he signed 2 weeks ago that secures our
border.
Now, in Maryland, we have a real
problem. We are the second most ac-
tive State for MS–13, which just walks
across our border now because we don’t
have barriers. We have a huge problem,
like every State in the Union, with
drugs, with opioids that are just
walked across our border, which isn’t
secured. And, Madam Speaker, we have
a huge problem with human traf-
ficking.
If this resolution is passed by the
Senate, I hope that the President ve-
toes the resolution, we sustain that
veto, and we finally secure our border.
f
HONORING THE LIFE OF CARRIE
ANN LUCAS
(Mr. NEGUSE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today because, on February 24, Colo-
rado and our Nation lost a fierce and
fearless advocate, Carrie Ann Lucas of
Windsor, Colorado.
A mother, an activist, and an attor-
ney, Carrie practiced family law to pre-
vent discrimination against parents
with disabilities. She adopted four chil-
dren, and her accomplishments cen-
tered on her dedication to them. All
her children have significant disabil-
ities, and Carrie always ensured that
they were loved, respected, and sup-
ported in their individual hopes and
dreams.
Carrie devoted so much to ensuring
her wisdom never stayed with just her
but was shared throughout the dis-
ability rights community, the legal
world, and our Nation. She spoke out
strongly and protested each day for the
rights of people with disabilities to
comprehensive healthcare with dignity
and respect.
It is a permanent scar on our Nation
that Carrie was lost to the refusal of an
insurance company to cover one par-
ticular medication, which led to esca-
lating health issues and, eventually,
her premature death.
Carrie’s activism knew only the
bounds of freedom and of justice. She
was ceaselessly bold, brave, and self-
less.
My thoughts are with her family, and
I pray that this body will gain some of
the bravery that never faltered in her
and use it as an inspiration to ensure
that no American goes without
healthcare—ever.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD the obituary of Carrie Ann
Lucas.
OBITUARY FOR CARRIE A. LUCAS
The disability community lost one of its
fiercest advocates on 2/24/19. Carrie Ann
Lucas, a disability rights attorney who pio-
neered representation for parents with dis-
abilities, died after an arbitrary denial from
an insurance company caused a plethora of
health problems, exacerbating her disabil-
ities and eventually leading to her pre-
mature death. She was 47 years old.
Carrie Ann Lucas is known around the
state and the country for her strong advo-
cacy.
Carrie Ann grew up in Windsor, Colorado,
and had several careers including being a
teacher, ordained minister and legal assist-
ant before becoming an attorney. Carrie
graduated from Whitworth College in 1994,
traveled and taught in Saipan, and then re-
turned to the states to attend the Iliff
School of Theology. She received a Master’s
of Divinity with Justice and Peace Con-
centration from Iliff in 1999, but during her
time there, became increasingly involved in
disability advocacy. After she graduated, she
started working as an advocate and later
legal assistant for the Colorado Cross-Dis-
ability Coalition, investigating, preparing,
and monitoring disability rights cases and
providing informal advocacy on a wide range
of topics. While there, she was granted a full
scholarship as a Chancellor’s Scholar at the
University of Denver School of Law.
Following her graduation from law school
in 2005, she was awarded a prestigious Equal
Justice Works fellowship to create a pro-
gram to combat discrimination that impacts
parenting for parents with disabilities. This
program, initially started within the Colo-
rado Cross-Disability Coalition, spun off to
be Disabled Parents Rights, one of the only
organizations in the country devoted to this
issue. She also became a national expert and
trainer on the rights of parents with disabil-
ities and, through her legal advocacy, se-
cured decisions upholding and promoting
those rights here in Colorado. Most recently
she was recruited by the Colorado Office of
Respondent Parents Counsel to help set up a
program to train other lawyers around the
state to replicate the sort of impact she was
making.
In addition to these professional activities,
Ms. Lucas was an advocate with the dis-
ability rights groups ADAPT and Not Dead
Yet, speaking, teaching, writing, testifying,
and protesting on disability justice and the
rights of people with disabilities to
healthcare and respect. She was also a tal-
ented photographer and cook. Carrie Ann
was an activist at heart. She graduated from
EMERGE, ran for Windsor City Council in
2017, and was planning on additional political
activity. She was chair of Colorado Demo-
crats with Disabilities for the past several
years. She was a member of the ADAPT
group that protested in Cory Gardner’s office
and got arrested to help save the Affordable
Care Act in 2017, particularly Medicaid. She
served on the Board of Directors of the
American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado.
She was active with Not Dead Yet and fought
hard against physician assisted suicide and
the notion that life with a disability is not
worth living. She demonstrated every day
how amazing life with a disability can be.
She was given the Intersectionality Award
from The Civil Rights Education and En-
forcement Center in 2016. She was a leader in
passing HB 18–1104 which changed Colorado
law to make sure that disability was no
longer a reason to remove a child from a pa-
rental home. There is much, much more.
Carrie became a lawyer to practice family
law after lived experience of discrimination
against parents with disabilities firsthand.
In 1998 fostered and later adopted her oldest
daughter, Heather Lucas. Heather has sig-
nificant developmental disabilities and was
languishing in another state. She fostered
and was preparing to adopt a second child,
but that was disrupted due to prejudice
against parents with disabilities. Where
most people might be upset and feel helpless,
Carrie Ann was furious and went to law
school to represent parents with disabilities.
Carrie adopted three more children over
the years, Adrianne Lucas, Azisa Lucas and
Anthony Lucas. All of her accomplishments
centered on her dedication to her children
and her role as a mother. All of her children
have significant disabilities and Carrie Ann
always made sure that they were not only
educated and included in their communities,
but that they were loved, respected, and sup-
ported in their individual hopes and dreams.
Carrie had a severe neuromuscular disease,
a rare form of muscular dystrophy. She re-
lied on a power wheelchair, and had used a
ventilator for years. However, her death was
premature and caused by inappropriate and
brutal cost containment procedures of an in-
surance company. Because Carrie Ann
worked for the state, she had use state insur-
ance which was primary ahead of her Medi-
care and Medicaid. In January of 2018 she got
a cold which turned into a trach and lung in-
fection. Her insurance company
UnitedHealthcare, refused to pay for the one
specific inhaled antibiotic that she really
needed. She had to take a less effective drug
and had a bad reaction to that drug. This
created a cascade of problems, loss of func-
tion (including her speech). United
Healthcare’s attempt to save $2,000 cost over
$1 million in health care costs over the past
year. This includes numerous hospitaliza-
tions, always involving the Intensive Care
Unit which is par for the course for venti-
lator users.
Carrie Ann had hoped to spend a lot of
time in 2019 using her tragedy to work to fix
our broken health care system. Her blog
www.disabilitypride.com provides more de-
tails. For all intents and purposes a shero of
our community was murdered in the name of
cost containment. This is why we MUST
fight these measures with all we have. Insur-
ance companies and government programs
must not be allowed to deny people what
they need. Just last month she was having to
ration her insulin for her type 1 diabetes be-
cause of the same insurance company and
how impossible it is to work between private
insurance and Medicare and Medicaid. This
is a great example of why people with dis-
abilities should not be forced into insurance
or health plans and why we need Medicaid as
the primary health delivery system for this
country.
In addition to her four children, Carrie
Arm is survived by her parents Phil and Lee
Lucas, sister Courtney Lucas, brother Eric
Gover, her niece Danielle Mann, nephews
Cody Mann, Gavin and Colin Lucas,
Danielle’s partner Aaron Boone and their
sons Izaiah, Kyal and Eli, Gavin’s wife Kath-
leen and their daughter Emily and Colin’s
son Dakota. She is predeceased by a sister,
Kelli Mann and her grandparents. She is also
survived by her partner Dr. Kimberley Jack-
son, a CCDC Board member and activist in
the disability community. She will be missed
by a wide circle of friends and colleagues
throughout the country.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS
THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS) is recognized for 60
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the
topic of my Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona?
There was no objection.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, it is my
privilege to lead this Special Order to-
night as we consider the national debt
as a security threat to the United
States of America.
I thank Senator DAVID PERDUE for
his leadership. He introduced a con-
comitant resolution in the Senate. I
also thank the more than 50 Members
of this body who are original cospon-
sors to this resolution.
I also thank the more than one dozen
conservative groups that endorsed this
resolution and have come to under-
stand that a structural deficit that
nears a trillion dollars every year, a
national debt that exceeds $22 trillion,
is indeed a threat to our national secu-
rity.
Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend,
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY).
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank
my friend from Arizona for his leader-
ship on this matter, and I appreciate
his leadership very much on H. Res.
149, a resolution recognizing the na-
tional debt as a threat to our national
security.
In February 2000, the total national
debt, including intragovernmental
holdings, was $5.7 trillion. Federal
spending as a percentage of gross do-
mestic product was 17.5 percent. Today,
the total national debt now exceeds $22
trillion.
The last balanced budget was signed
into law in 1997, and the Congressional
Budget Office projects that Federal
spending as a percentage of GDP is pro-
jected to be 20.8 percent this year. In
February 2018, Congress passed a budg-
et agreement that busted the pre-
viously established spending caps by
almost $300 billion over 2 years.
All those numbers don’t mean any-
thing to the American people tuning in
to C–SPAN right now. They are giant
numbers. They are really difficult for
people to understand and comprehend.
But we are talking about the future of
our Nation and what we are leaving to
our children.
We are leaving them with an econ-
omy that is anchored by $22 trillion in
debt that is going to turn to $25, $30
and $40 trillion because, this year
alone, we are going to have a trillion-
dollar deficit, with no end in sight.
We are making it to where our chil-
dren can’t comprehend what freedom is
like in this country and what oppor-
tunity is like in this country because
they are going to have an economy
that is weighted down by this body’s
and the Senate’s irresponsibility.
Nobody in America balances their
budgets at home like this. I assure my
friend from Arizona, our States don’t
balance their budgets like this. Nobody
looks at the total number for income
you have, then blows it by 25 or 30 per-
cent, and then goes to the bank and
wonders why they might not give you a
loan or help you finance a car.
My concern is that we are allowing
this to happen on the backs of our men
and women in uniform. We are saying
that, as a need to defend the United
States of America and to spend
money—which our men and women in
uniform deserve to have the resources
necessary as we ask them to go around
the globe—we are using that as an ex-
cuse to continue to bust caps and to
bust the limits that we put in place to
hold us in check.
Of that $300 billion that I was talking
about the last 2 years, about 40 percent
of that is nondefense discretionary
that rode on the back of what we are
trying to do to help our men and
women in uniform have the tools they
need.
There used to be an adage of guns
and butter. We don’t have a choice any-
more about choosing between guns and
butter. Have we cut butter at all while
we go and increase money for the guns
for our men and women in uniform?
Have we even held it in check? No.
We have plussed it up and continued
to bust the caps, all while we know
mandatory spending—spending on
Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Secu-
rity—all go up.
The question I would ask is: When
are we going to stop? Is it going to
take placing a debt clock over the
chair of the Speaker? Do we need to
have something to remind us, sitting
here in the body, what we are going to
be leaving to our children? Because it
is our responsibility, what we leave be-
hind to our kids.
It is irresponsible when we look at
every bill, every one of these little bills
that comes across our desk.
People say, well, why did you vote
‘‘no,’’ Mr. ROY? Well, it was just an-
other $500,000. It was just another $5
million.
That is not how you spend at home.
It is time that this body gets serious
about spending restraint. It is time
that this body recognize—as I am very
happy that my friend from Arizona
has, and I am proud to join him in say-
ing that this is an impact on our na-
tional security and a threat to our na-
tional security.
When we know right now that the in-
terest on our debt is pretty soon going
to eclipse the amount of spending we
are spending at the Department of De-
fense, that is a threat to our national
security. We can’t sustain it.
When we say now that we are going
to spend more money for the tools that
our men and women need, how are we
going to afford to spend on those tools
in 2030 or 2040 when we are spending
more, literally, on interest than we are
on what they need?
I am proud to join my friend to make
the case here that this is a threat to
our national security. I call on my col-
leagues to join us, to join this resolu-
tion. I call on them to have the same
level of resolve to limit spending and
to make sure that we pass down the
greatest country to our kids that the
world has ever known.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, when
the gentleman from Texas talks about
the crowd-out effect, that is what we
see as one of the threats to our na-
tional security.
When you look at the spending that
is being bloated and plussed-up and in-
creased, the ramifications of borrowing
more and more money for an insatiable
appetite to spend the Federal revenues
and beyond to the tune of almost a tril-
lion dollars a year—and it will con-
tinue to rise, make no mistake about
that, unless we do something—it will
ultimately crowd out spending for
things like the military, spending for
things like transportation and infra-
structure, spending for any discre-
tionary item.
We are on that fast track today, so I
appreciate my friend from Texas talk-
ing and discussing the crowd-out and
the impacts on our future and our fu-
ture generations.
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
WILLIAMS).
Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congressman BIGGS for leading
this tonight.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2223
February 26, 2019
Madam Speaker, the national debt is
the single greatest threat to our na-
tional security. Since 1997, Congress
has failed to do its job and balance the
budget. Earlier this month, the na-
tional debt reached $22 trillion.
For this reason, I am proud to co-
sponsor Congressman ANDY BIGGS’ res-
olution to recognize the national debt
as a threat to national security. I com-
mend him for introducing this impor-
tant resolution in the U.S. House of
Representatives, and I also commend
Senator DAVID PERDUE for bringing it
to the U.S. Senate.
We must no longer rely on routine
debt ceiling increases, nor can we risk
the devastating effects that a growing
deficit will inevitably have on our mili-
tary and our national security agen-
cies.
In an effort to reduce the deficit and
regain responsible spending practices,
President Trump has laid out his Na-
tional Security Strategy that high-
lights this critical need to reduce the
debt through smart, fiscally respon-
sible decisions.
While it is clear we cannot undo the
past, it is also clear that Federal
spending cannot continue to go un-
checked and immediate action must be
taken. We can no longer defer to future
generations to solve our problem and
to bear this burden.
I will continue to support legislation
that cuts unnecessary spending and op-
pose legislation that recklessly adds to
the debt. I ask my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to get serious and
support this important resolution.
It is time we stopped writing blank
checks, and it is time to stop risking
the national security of the United
States of America. It is simple: Bal-
ance your books.
In God we trust.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
my friend, Congressman WILLIAMS from
Texas, for his willingness to take a
strong stand on this. I am particularly
impressed by his reference to President
Trump’s National Security Strategy,
which specifically mentions a portion
of it is to bring down our national debt,
to try to become a better fiscally situ-
ated nation.
That will help our national security,
now and in the future. This is exactly
what President Trump is talking
about. That is what we are talking
about. That is one of the issues that we
have before us today.
I am grateful to my friend, the gen-
tleman from Texas, who brought that
forward and is supporting this impor-
tant resolution.
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to
yield to my friend from Maryland (Mr.
HARRIS), the great congressman.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Arizona for
yielding time.
I thank the two gentlemen from
Texas for introducing the topic to the
American people. This is something
every American should be aware of.
They say a picture is worth a thou-
sand words. Every American should
look at a few pictures about our na-
tional debt.
This first picture is a 110-year period
going from 1930, before World War II, to
2050, just 30 years away. It shows what
our national debt has looked like as a
percent of our economy, and it is pret-
ty striking.
For the first 90 years of it, there is
one huge peak: World War II, a world
at war. At that time, our debt exceeded
the size of our gross domestic product,
the size of everything produced in the
United States. Our debt rose to that
amount after World War II.
The Greatest Generation spent the
next 30 years paying down our debt and
growing our economy, so that we had
an affordable debt.
We had a little bit of rise in the 1980s
and 1990s, as we defeated communism—
again, a war situation.
Then, following 2008 and following
the last administration, we have sky-
rocketing debt once again to the point
where, within 5 years, we will approach
the debt we had during World War II,
fighting the largest war this world has
fought.
Then, by 2048, 30 years from now, ac-
tually having a debt that is 150 percent
of everything we make in this country,
that is the level we see with failing
economies, some of the economies like
Greece, Italy, the ones that have
unsustainable debts. We are on a clear
path to that.
Now, let’s talk about the size of our
national debt. This chart goes from
2010. This is just 18 years, starting from
2010 and going to 2028. This is the inter-
est payment on our national debt be-
cause, Madam Speaker, like every
American knows, if you borrow money,
you have to pay interest on it.
b 1915
The fact of the matter is that right
now, our interest, total interest pay-
ment, is about $200 billion.
But, Madam Speaker, every Amer-
ican family knows, every senior who
has saved for retirement knows that
interest rates right now are very low.
If you go and get a CD, what are you
getting, a 1 percent, 2 percent return.
Those interest rates will return to nor-
mal.
And as the gentleman from Texas
mentioned, we are accruing debt at $1
trillion a year, so that by the time we
reach 2028, the interest payment on our
debt alone, due to the increased size of
our debt and the increased interest
rate is going to approach $1 trillion a
year.
Now, what does that mean?
Well, Madam Speaker, there are a lot
of things that the government funds.
Those of you who are interested in the
safety of Social Security, of Medicare
and Medicaid, of Federal pensions, they
know that we are approaching a zero
sum game. We can’t keep this debt
going forever.
In fact, this final chart I am going to
show is 10 years, starting now, it shows
the percent spending of GDP, so rel-
ative to our economy, what our net in-
terest on our debt is; and then other
things, like Medicaid, the Children’s
Health Insurance Program, things that
we think are important, defense. The
yellow line, the defense budget, non-
defense, discretionary spending, all
these are relatively constant. All of
them are going to be crowded out by
net interest on the debt.
Madam Speaker, Americans under-
stand, you can’t borrow forever. You
can’t do it on your cars; you can’t do it
on your houses; you can’t do it on your
credit cards; and we can’t do it here in
Congress anymore. This threatens our
security, when, in 5 years, we will pay
more interest on our national debt
than we pay defending this country. We
can’t do it.
Congress has to get its act together,
clean up its act, and get our budget in
balance.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Maryland, and I
appreciate his focusing on the interest,
because he is right. In just a few short
years, we will be spending more of our
budget on interest than we do on de-
fense; and then a couple of years after
that, more on our interest than we
spend on Medicare.
Think about that. Think about where
we are headed because of our profligate
ways.
In the first chart he showed, I was
struck, as I remembered growing up in
the Cold War era.
Madam Speaker, I think those of us
who grew up in the Cold War era re-
member that contest between us and
the former Soviet Union and the
amount of money spent by both sides.
It is dwarfed by the spending that we
are embarking on today as a percent of
our GDP. That is where we are. That is
where we have come. So it continues to
be a problem in so many ways and on
so many levels.
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege
now to yield to the gentleman from
Colorado (Mr. BUCK).
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I thank
my friend from Arizona for yielding,
and I thank him for his leadership on
this important issue.
Madam Speaker, we have $22 trillion
of debt, over $22 trillion of debt now.
We are accumulating debt at approxi-
mately $1 trillion a year. America is fi-
nancially bankrupt, and if we continue
to place this burden on our children
and grandchildren, we are also morally
bankrupt.
We are threatening our ability to
react to world affairs, our ability to
deal with the dynamic threats that we
face in this world, not just land, not
just sea, not just air, but space also.
We need to balance the budget, but it
requires us to make difficult decisions
today, to ensure a prosperous future.
And it requires us to make significant
cuts to our discretionary spending.
One of the amazing, unique charac-
teristics of this place, of Congress, is
that for some reason, we make a dis-
tinction between discretionary spend-
ing and mandatory spending.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2224 February 26, 2019
My grandchildren don’t care if they
have to pay back a debt that was cre-
ated by mandatory spending or a debt
that was created by discretionary
spending. They don’t care. A dollar is a
dollar to them, and it should be to us,
and we should take control of manda-
tory spending, just as we take control
of discretionary spending.
Since I was elected to Congress, I
have fought hard against our country’s
out-of-control spending, and I have ad-
vocated for a balanced budget amend-
ment to the Constitution that would
force Congress to pass a balanced budg-
et every year.
For the economic well-being of our
country, I am proud to join my col-
leagues in cosponsoring this important
resolution, and I would like to thank
my dear friend and colleague, Mr.
BIGGS, for recognizing our country’s se-
rious spending problem before it’s too
late.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
my friend from Colorado, Mr. BUCK,
and I appreciate him raising that im-
portant issue, that it is an oddity, isn’t
it, in Congress, that somehow we seg-
regate money. We segregate money and
say, oh, well, this money doesn’t mat-
ter so much. But it becomes fungible
when you are looking at the accumula-
tion of debt that we are heaping upon
our future generations.
I appreciate the gentleman bringing
that to our attention and reminding us,
and I would just say, I appreciate his
voting record, because I have watched
it closely, and he is a man of his word
when he says he has been fighting to
balance the budget and reduce our def-
icit since he got here, because his vot-
ing record is actually true to that, and
I appreciate that very much.
Madam Speaker, it is now my pleas-
ure to yield to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE).
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I want
to thank the gentleman from Arizona
for the time, and thank him for bring-
ing this issue to the forefront.
Madam Speaker, I am distressed by
the lack of numbers in the Chamber
right now because this truly is the
greatest threat to the security of this
Nation that we face.
When I ran for office last fall, I prom-
ised the citizens of Virginia’s Sixth
Congressional District that I would re-
introduce 4 words to Washington: ‘‘We
can’t afford it.’’ These are four words
that have been needed to have been re-
peated over the last 22 years, as the
last time a Federal budget with a sur-
plus was signed into law was 1997.
In Virginia, where I served in the
House of Delegates until last year, we
are required to balance our budget each
year. And because we have placed a pri-
ority on fiscal responsibility, Virginia
is frequently listed among the best
states in which to do business.
In contrast, the Federal Government
has an outstanding public debt of more
than $22 trillion. Every year, since 1997,
Congress has failed to maintain a fis-
cally responsible budget and, instead,
has relied too much on raising the debt
ceiling.
Because of this practice, on August 5,
2011, the credit rating of the United
States was reduced by Standard &
Poor’s from AAA to AA+, and has re-
mained at that level ever since.
Virginia, through its fiscal responsi-
bility, has maintained its AAA bond
rating, one of only a few States to have
that honor.
Not only is the current practice of
not passing a balanced budget fiscally
irresponsible, it poses a threat to our
national security. As part of his Na-
tional Security Strategy, President
Trump has highlighted the need to re-
duce the national debt through fiscal
responsibility, and I commend him for
it.
In September 2011, former Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Michael
Mullen warned: ‘‘I believe the single
biggest threat to our national security
is debt.’’ And at that time, our na-
tional debt was close to $15 trillion.
Now, almost 10 years later, our na-
tional debt has increased by $7 trillion,
a 46 percent increase.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand
with Congressman BIGGS, my fellow co-
sponsors, and a bipartisan group of na-
tional security leaders, in support of
this resolution:
Recognizing that the national debt
is, indeed, a threat to the national se-
curity of the United States;
Recognizing that deficits are
unsustainable, irresponsible, and dan-
gerous; and
Committing Congress to restoring
regular order in the appropriations
process and addressing the fiscal crisis
faced by the United States. The future
of our great republic depends on it.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
CLINE), for his comments and his ef-
forts and his willingness to stand on
this important issue and recognizing—
and promising to people and responding
to that promise; because I can tell you,
when I first considered even running
for Congress, one of the things that
motivated me was this horrific debt,
which I have watched explode even
more since I got here; not because I am
here, but in spite of my efforts.
So, today, we are preparing to intro-
duce our resolution, which will be later
this week, Senator PERDUE, his cospon-
sors, my 50 original cosponsors—more
than 50 original cosponsors. And we
recognize that, as of today, the na-
tional debt is more than $22 trillion.
You have heard that. Can you hear it
enough without taking action?
The resulting total interest expense
for the fiscal year 2019 is $192 billion.
$192 billion. Interest does not sleep. It
doesn’t take a holiday; it doesn’t take
a vacation. Interest accumulates with-
out ceasing until you pay your debt.
Our national debt as a percentage of
GDP is 104 percent. The last time a
Federal budget was balanced and was
signed was 1997.
Our total Federal tax receipts for fis-
cal year 2018 were $3.329 trillion. But
somehow—and we all know how—our
Federal outlays totaled $4.1 trillion,
with a deficit of $780 billion. And we
know how. We know how that hap-
pened. We look to each other in this
body.
Since the last time Congress bal-
anced the Federal budget in 1997, Con-
gress has failed to maintain a fiscally-
responsible budget and has relied on
raising the debt ceiling. How many
times have we raised the debt ceiling?
It is almost more than you can count.
Congress failed to pass a balanced
budget for fiscal year 2019 and failed to
restore regular order to the legislative
process by not allowing Representa-
tives to offer and debate amendments.
When we have regular order, it permits
the House to separately debate and
adopt all appropriation bills in a time-
ly fashion and facilitates congressional
oversight on Federal spending.
Estimates are Medicare will run out
of money in 2026, Social Security in
2034.
As my friend from Virginia, Mr.
CLINE, said: Congress’ ineffectiveness
has caused the U.S. credit rating from
Standard & Poor’s to drop from AAA to
AA+. Without a targeted effort to bal-
ance the Federal budget, our credit will
surely continue to fall.
President Trump’s National Security
Strategy highlights the need to reduce
the national debt through fiscal re-
sponsibility.
Former Secretary of Defense James
Mattis warned that: ‘‘Any nation that
can’t keep its fiscal house in order
eventually cannot maintain its mili-
tary power.’’
Director of National Intelligence Dan
Coats warned that: ‘‘Our continued
plunge into debt is unsustainable and
represents a dire future threat to our
economy and to our national security.’’
Former Secretaries of Defense Leon
Panetta, Ash Carter, and Chuck Hagel
warned: ‘‘Increase in the debt will, in
the absence of a comprehensive budget
that addresses both entitlements and
revenues, force even deeper reductions
in our national security capabilities.’’
And former Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen warned:
‘‘I believe the single biggest threat to
our national security is debt.’’
And so what must the House do?
First, we have to recognize that the
national debt is, indeed, a threat to our
national security. We must realize that
deficits are unsustainable, irrespon-
sible, and dangerous.
b 1930
We must restore regular order in the
appropriations process, and we must
commit to addressing the fiscal crisis
faced by the United States.
I mentioned it before, but when you
are spending a pot of money and you
have limited resources, regardless of
how great those resources are—I mean,
we have had record tax revenue for the
last 14 months, record revenue, more
than any time in the history of the
United States of America, and we still
outspend that revenue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2225
February 26, 2019
As we do so, we have to borrow
money, because we have created a
structural deficit. So, foundationally,
we put ourselves in a position where we
have to borrow money; and when you
have to borrow money, you have to pay
interest. As you have to borrow more
money, which we do, you are going to
start crowding out what you can spend
those limited resources on.
Who holds our debt? One of the big-
gest holders of our debt is also one of
our greatest potential adversaries, and
that is China. China has been, for the
last 25 years, expanding their military,
building a blue-water navy, expanding
their capacity for rockets and missiles,
and also taking in our debt.
This places us at risk if we are ever
in a conflict, which I pray we never
are. I hope we never are. But if we are
in a conflict with an adversary who
holds significant amounts of our na-
tional debt, we are at risk. And you
have to acknowledge that.
What has helped us out so far is the
fact that the U.S. dollar is the inter-
national medium of exchange in inter-
national transactions, economic trans-
actions. If we were to lose that, the
ability to borrow funds to sustain our
unsustainable spending would go away.
And I bring that back to China.
China has ambitions to make its own
currency a regional currency of ex-
change. They would like to replace the
United States dollar as the inter-
national medium of exchange as well.
What else is an actual physical prob-
lem when you have the kind of debt
and deficit spending that we have is
that you cannot pay to replace and
maintain your internal infrastructure,
and we see that today. Bridges, roads,
airports, all of these need maintenance.
They need upkeep. They need expan-
sion. We need new roads. We need new
highways, but we can’t pay for it, be-
cause we are going to be in a position
of being overextended. That places us
at risk, because you do need internal
infrastructure.
Madam Speaker, it is now my pleas-
ure to yield to my good friend, the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO).
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would
like to thank my colleague, Mr. BIGGS
from Arizona, for yielding. This is such
an important topic that we are talking
about, national debt.
I remember when I came to Congress
in 2013, Admiral Mullen said that the
biggest threat to America is our na-
tional debt. Hillary Clinton, Secretary
of State at the time, said she agreed
with that. One of the few times I have
agreed with Mrs. Clinton.
But national debt today is $22 tril-
lion. When I came into Congress, it was
$14.5 trillion. When President Reagan
left office, it was about $2.5 trillion. It
doesn’t matter who is in the White
House. Our debt is going up until this
body, Congress, addresses our debt.
If you do a pie chart of our debt, 71
percent of our debt is mandatory
spending, 29 percent is discretionary.
Discretionary was described to me as
the money we have left over at the end
of the month after we pay all of our
bills. That is discretionary.
The interesting thing is, in 1964,
those numbers were reversed. Manda-
tory spending was 29 percent, discre-
tionary was 71 percent. So we were a
cash-rich Nation. We could do things.
We could do a space program. We could
do the infrastructure bills that we did
that this Nation needed.
Today, that is flipped around to
where 71 percent of every dollar this
government takes in is already spent.
We don’t vote on that in Congress.
Those are things that happen without
us. The only things we vote and we
shut the government down on is that 29
percent.
If we do not address our mandatory
spending, mandatory spending will ad-
dress us as a Nation.
I was on an interview, and they said,
well, President Obama doesn’t want to
mess with mandatory spending, which
is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,
interest on our debt, retirement pro-
grams for our Federal employees. And I
reminded the interviewer, and they
said this about President Trump: He
doesn’t want to deal with mandatory
spending.
I said: I understand that. But either
this President or the next President
deals with mandatory spending or man-
datory spending will dictate to this Na-
tion what we have to cut, and those are
called austerity measures.
All you have to do is look at Puerto
Rico, Spain, Portugal, Greece, where
they had mandatory austerity meas-
ures where programs were cut, and
they were cut by other governments
that controlled their debt.
Today, about 30 percent of our debt is
controlled by foreign nations, the other
70 percent, the American taxpayer
owns, but it would be tragic to allow us
in this body to allow another nation to
say: You have got to get rid of that
program.
That is unconscionable. It is irre-
sponsible of us. And if we do not deal
with that debt, that debt will deal with
us.
Madam Speaker, this is something I
appreciate Mr. BIGGS standing up and
having this Special Order on. This is
something we talk about repeatedly in
our district. We have town halls on
this.
When you look at the discretionary
spending, that is the stuff that runs all
of government outside of Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, Medicaid, the retire-
ment programs. That means the De-
partment of Defense. That means the
Department of Education, Justice, the
Department of Homeland Security. All
the research money that goes into our
research universities comes out of the
discretionary funding of government.
I am telling you, as a Nation, if we do
not address this, this Nation will not
survive, and history will repeat itself
from great countries that have lasted
for a period of time. They have always
come to a demise, and it was because
they haven’t paid attention to the
things that are the very basic.
Madam Speaker, I appreciate my col-
league for bringing this up. This is
something that repeatedly—if you look
at this Congress, the Democrats have
been in charge of the House since Janu-
ary 2 or 3. We don’t have a budget. We
haven’t addressed anything dealing
with debt. But they have spent a lot of
time dealing with President Trump and
trying to remove him from office and
finding out reasons why he shouldn’t
be the President. Madam Speaker, we
as Americans need to come together
and deal with the debt, and I appre-
ciate the gentleman’s efforts.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
my friend from Florida for taking time
to come down and give us his insight
on this monumental problem.
One of the things that he talked
about, Madam Speaker, is that we have
got to take care of our processes, our
procedures. He is right. It doesn’t mat-
ter whether it is Republican or Demo-
crat; our processes have been broken.
I can’t even begin to tell you. I have
been here a little over 2 years. I bet
you we have done a dozen and a half
short-term spending bills, continuing
resolutions. I bet it is that many. It
seems to me like that many. I think we
did three government shutdowns last
year. I don’t know when the next one is
going to be. It wouldn’t surprise me if
it was 2 weeks from now, whenever it
is. But the reason we do those things is
because our budget process fails.
I remember sitting in a meeting and
I heard someone say: We have got a 10-
year budget plan to balance our budg-
et. And I heard somebody else stand up
and say: Well, I have been here 10
years. Ten years ago, I was told we had
a 10-year budget plan, so we ought to
be up to snuff. We ought to be balanced
by now, because it is 10 years since
that 10-year budget plan.
I think it was Mr. YOHO who said
that.
Madam Speaker, I yield back to Mr.
YOHO.
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman yielding, because I
came here and they said: Well, don’t
worry about this, because this will bal-
ance in 5 years or this will balance in
10 years.
And I laugh, but I shouldn’t be laugh-
ing. We should be crying, because here
I am, 7 years, and guess what: It will
balance in 10 years.
It will not balance. And, again, it is
up to us, the Members of the House and
the Senate, because we control the
purse strings. But we have done a ter-
rible job at it, and it goes back to lead-
ership on both sides.
This is something that should not be
a partisan issue. This is something
that should be an American issue, be-
cause America is at stake here. It is
not a Republican Party or a Demo-
cratic Party. We don’t serve a party is
what I tell people in my district, and I
am sure you do the same thing. I serve
a Nation, and that Nation is the great-
est Nation on Earth. If we don’t get our

fiscal house in order, this Nation will
not be the Nation it is.
So, again, I don’t think it will bal-
ance in 10 years. It won’t balance in 20
years unless we change the dynamics,
and they need to change now.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for his comments.
Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time
from the gentleman from Florida, when
we look at that and the promises con-
stantly, this is getting to my point:
The process needs to get back to reg-
ular order. It needs to get back to 12
individual bills—this is what we talked
about—12 individual bills that go
through a process where there is de-
bate; there are amendments; there is
discussion; and there is accountability.
Nothing provides more account-
ability than bills that have single sub-
jects; nothing provides more trans-
parency than bills that have single sub-
jects; and nothing allows the American
people to see what we are doing in Con-
gress like single subjects.
So when you take 12 subjects, which
are your budget bills, and you combine
3 or 4 of them into a minibus and 6 or
7 into an omnibus, and you say vote on
these things—usually we are given just
a short period of time to read those
things and analyze them anyway; usu-
ally they come in under some closed
rule or some highly structured rule—
well, you are preventing a couple of
things:
Number one, we are not going to get
to a balanced budget because, ulti-
mately, what you are also preventing
is accountability, because when the
American people can see how you voted
in a single area on a single issue, they
know whether they agree with you or
not. They know whether you should be
doing that, and they will let you know.
They give you the feedback. That is
the accountability that we need if we
are going to balance this budget over
time and correct our course.
Now, there is an economic theory
called path dependence. Sometimes it
is called increasing returns. Kenneth
Arrow wrote a lot about this, and what
it boils down to is this: It is an anal-
ysis, really, of why decisionmakers
make suboptimum decisions and then
persist on the course even after they
know it is a suboptimum decision.
Well, what typically happens is re-
gimes and institutions are built up.
There is feedback, and people will per-
sist on that because they are building
up regimes and institutions; and, ulti-
mately, they have propelled them-
selves so far down, they are what we
call locked in. To exit that path, the
cost is so high that they don’t want to
exit that suboptimal path and move to
a more optimal path.
But I am here to tell you tonight
that as long as we stay on this sub-
optimal path where we don’t have
these 12 budget bills, we don’t get back
to regular order in budgeting, as long
as we do CRs and then claim that we
have done a normal budgeting path
when we have created cromnibus bills
or omnibus bills or minibus bills, we
are not going to be able to exit the
path that we are on.
If we are going to sustain this Na-
tion, we are going to need to exit the
path that we are on and move to a
more optimal path.
b 1945
That is really what this resolution is
about. It is encouraging people from
both sides of the aisle. I am not blam-
ing one side or the other. I am just say-
ing that if we are going to get this
done, everybody in this House has to
look internally. Everybody in this
House needs to say: What are we doing
with our process? Everybody needs to
recognize that if we continue on this
path, at some point there is no more
path to run down.
We just heard from a series of speak-
ers that the numbers go up and, at
some point, you reach a tipping point,
and that tipping point says you cannot
go forward. I would rather we move
over to a suboptimal path now and pay
that price, which is typically a short-
term, corrective price. In the scheme of
things, it may take longer than just a
short-term, but we have to move over
because, if we don’t, our choices are
taken away from us.
I will tell you that if we would have
gotten on the path 2 years ago, we
would have had more choices and more
options. Every day we go further down
this path, the fewer options we have
until the end. Mr. YOHO is correct, and
all of my friends who have spoken to-
night were correct, and the more than
50 cosponsors here, they are all correct:
If we don’t do something, it will be im-
posed upon us.
If it is imposed upon us, we won’t
have control. We will not be able to
handle this in a way where we hurt the
fewest people, where we can feather the
landing as much as possible, where we
can maintain our economic status,
where people can still find jobs, and
where people can achieve the American
Dream that they perceive that they
want to achieve. Those things get
taken away from us because, ulti-
mately, this country is built on indi-
vidual freedom and individual account-
ability.
If we have to take that horrible
measure of receiving something like
our debts being called in, or we can’t
find lenders, or the cost of our loans—
imagine if the cost of our debt today
would just move up a couple of points—
imagine what that would look like. If
we can’t do this of our own volition, we
will be subject to someone else’s will
and the very essence of the American
Dream—individual freedom and indi-
vidual accountability—will go away.
And why? Because that accountability
will be foisted upon us by coercive
forces.
Madam Speaker, I conclude tonight
with gratitude to the 50-some-odd men
and women who have signed on to this
resolution. I implore all in this body to
join myself, to join me, to join Senator
PERDUE and those who have signed on
and sponsored a companion resolution
in the Senate, and let’s make the hard
choices today so that we might pre-
serve the freedoms for our children and
grandchildren.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
f
AMERICAN VOTING SYSTEM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) for
30 minutes.
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, my col-
leagues and I rise today in opposition
of H.R. 1. This bill is nothing more
than a thinly veiled attack on the
American voting system designed to
allow Democrats to keep the majority
in the House of Representatives, and I
will explain and illustrate.
As a Member of Congress, we have a
responsibility to ensure that every
American vote is counted and pro-
tected, especially because our demo-
cratic society relies on participation in
the democratic process through free
and fair elections. While I support ef-
forts to involve all Americans in our
electoral process, I cannot support this
unconstitutional legislation.
Madam Speaker, let me lay out for
you some of the most absurd provisions
in this legislation.
H.R. 1 creates Federal Government
subsidized elections. For the people
watching on C–SPAN, if they don’t
have insomnia, I want them to hear
that again. H.R. 1 creates Federal Gov-
ernment subsidized elections through a
6–1 ratio for government matches to
small donor contributions for congres-
sional or Presidential campaigns.
For the government to give
matches—subsidized elections—that
means they are taking money from you
to go to candidates, hopefully of your
choice, but not necessarily. So the
donor contributions for congressional
or Presidential campaigns, which
means for every $200 an individual do-
nates, the Federal Government will
take $1,200 of the American taxpayers’
money and distribute it.
Additionally, H.R. 1 removes the
checks our current voting system has
in place to ensure eligible voters are
casting ballots by forcing States to ac-
cept online and same-day voter reg-
istration. I don’t think that has ever
happened before, where H.R. 1 removes
the checks our current voting system
has in place to ensure only eligible vot-
ers are casting vote ballots by forcing
States to accept online and same-day
voter registration with no penalties for
ineligible voters.
That means somebody could show up,
an individual, and cast multiple ballots
or votes, or vote without meeting the
current requirements, and they will
not be reprimanded. There is no re-
course. Who is going to go after some-
body after they have already cast their
vote and they weren’t an eligible

voter? Nobody will go after these peo-
ple, so it can sway elections. That is
what H.R. 1 does.
By removing the consequences of il-
legal voting, this bill is, in turn, en-
couraging it. It should be doing the op-
posite. The right and privilege of us as
American citizens to vote is something
we should all garner and protect as
American citizens. And, again, this is
not a partisan issue, it is not Demo-
crats or Republicans, this is an Amer-
ican issue, and I think people would be
incensed on all parties.
Additionally, this bill allows Federal
employees to take 6 days of paid leave
to be poll workers. So the American
taxpayers are going to pay Federal
workers to be poll watchers. This is
something that has always been done
voluntarily by our precinct captains,
both Republican and Democrat, in our
districts, where politics is always best
locally.
But the Federal Government wants
to intervene here and say: No, we are
going to give you guys 6 days off. How
many people do you think, that are
Federal employees, will take 6 days off
of paid leave? Probably a lot, wouldn’t
you expect?
Madam Speaker, we pay our Federal
employees to do the job they were
hired to do, not to be poll workers for
our districts. That is something that
the American voting process has done
for over 200 years by volunteers that
are passionate and care about this
country.
In fact, Federal employees already
receive paid leave that they can take
for any purpose they choose, including
being poll workers. Why should the
Federal Government pay? And I want
to reword that, because it is not the
Federal Government paying them. It is
the American taxpayers paying money
out of their paycheck that goes to the
Federal Government that the Federal
Government thinks they know better
how to spend that money than they do.
So why should the Federal Government
pay to give them additional leave that
can only be used for this purpose?
Madam Speaker, there are just three
provisions outlined in this almost 600-
page bill, and I would venture most
people will not read this when it comes
up for a vote. And while I can further
elaborate, I will let my colleagues
share their thoughts with you.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS).
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
my colleague for leading this Special
Order.
Madam Speaker, I want to speak to
two specific aspects of this.
First of all, I rise in opposition to
H.R. 1, the sweeping unconstitutional
attack on the electoral system that it
represents. It would federalize our elec-
toral system and usurp the authority
of States and their citizens to manage
their own elections by imposing unnec-
essary and unconstitutional restric-
tions that interfere with their funda-
mental democratic rights.
H.R. 1 would restrict freedom of
speech and undermine Americans’ con-
stitutional rights under the First
Amendment by increasing the power of
the Federal Government to regulate
and control political speech.
It would criminalize a vast range of
legal activities, increase government
censorship, and impose an enormous
administrative compliance burden on
candidates that would make it harder
for everyday Americans to participate
in our political system and even run
for office.
It would also weaken important safe-
guards to ensure the integrity of our
electoral system and guarantee that
every American vote is counted and
protected. This could expose future
elections to greater risk of cyber ma-
nipulation and mass voter fraud.
It could limit the ability of election
officials to ensure that only eligible
voter votes are counted and cripple the
effectiveness of State voter ID laws.
Now, I have to speak to an issue that
particularly impacts those of us who
live in States that have independent
redistricting commissions. I live in Ar-
izona. Many years ago, our voters said:
We don’t want the legislature design-
ing the congressional districts and the
State legislative districts anymore; we
want an independent redistricting com-
mission, so they voted for it. So we
have a five-member commission: two
Republicans, two Democrats, and an
Independent. They design the congres-
sional districts.
This bill would take that away from
them. It would bring it back to Wash-
ington, D.C., after creating an
unelected board that would then design
these districts for States. Now, I ask
you, why would that be better than the
independent redistricting commission
in Arizona that was approved by the
Arizona voters? It doesn’t make sense
to me, and it doesn’t make sense to my
constituents, I can tell you that.
We struggle enough. We struggle
enough with the independent redis-
tricting commission with Arizona ap-
pointees. Imagine if we have no connec-
tion to the appointees.
I am also always amazed at people
who don’t get to Arizona and don’t re-
alize the vastness of that State. It is a
unique State: 7 million people—5 mil-
lion of them in one county, one metro-
politan area; 1 million in another coun-
ty; and then another 1 million sprin-
kled throughout this vast State. That
takes local knowledge and it takes
local experience to create those dis-
tricts, there is no doubt about it. The
Arizona Constitution is filled with the
criterion on how to redistrict in Ari-
zona. This would usurp the Arizona
Constitution.
H.R. 1 is fraught with many, many
problems. I have just gone through a
couple of them for you tonight.
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend
from Florida for his leadership on this,
his fight, and I appreciate him sharing
time with me tonight.
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I thank
Mr. BIGGS. I appreciate his help.
I have got a top 10 list here—actu-
ally, it has turned into a top 11 list—of
the 10 most egregious provisions of
H.R. 1.
Again, I want to remind you that the
Democrats took over at the beginning
of the year. We are $22 trillion in debt.
And they will say: Well, it is President
Trump’s fault. Well, we can say: It is
President Obama’s fault. And they will
say: Well, it is President Bush’s fault.
And it can go all the way back to
George Washington, I expect.
But the fact is it is a bipartisan issue
that needs to be dealt with. So the top
11 most egregious provisions of H.R. 1:
It creates, again, a 6–1 government
match to any small donor contribution
of $200 or less in a congressional or
Presidential campaign, meaning for
every $200 the government will match
$1,200.
So let’s look at the facts. Where does
that $1,200 come from? You go to work,
you get a paycheck at the end of the
week, at the end of the week you no-
tice that you don’t get paid your gross
pay, you get paid your net pay. The
rest of the money comes to the govern-
ment and the government is going to
use that money, when we are $22 tril-
lion in debt, and give out subsidies to
support, hopefully, your candidate.
This has never happened before in our
government, and we are at $22 trillion
in debt. It does nothing to solve our na-
tional debt.
b 2000
Number two on the list: Creates a
new voucher pilot program—a pilot
program.
And I have to hand it to the Dems.
They love programs that give out mon-
eys and grants, this voucher pilot pro-
gram that grants eligible voters a $25
voucher of hard-earned taxpayer dol-
lars to donate to any campaign of their
choosing.
The Federal Government has no need
to do this. Again, they are taking
money from people and using it for
that which the government is not man-
dated by our Constitution to do.
Number three: Authorizes an inap-
propriate use of Federal workers and
taxpayer dollars by granting Federal
employees 6 days of paid vacation to
serve as poll watchers.
I would venture that come election
day, the largest majority of Federal
employees for 6 days will be poll watch-
ers and not running the government.
This is just bad policy.
Number four: Weakens the voting
system of the American people by in-
creasing the election system’s vulnera-
bility and failing to implement the
necessary checks and balances regard-
ing who is registering to vote. H.R. 1
will force States to allow online voter
registration, automatic voter registra-
tion, and, I think the most dangerous
and egregious, same-day voter registra-
tion.
So that means I can show up in Flor-
ida, my home State, and I can register
to vote that day. I can drive to Georgia

and register to vote that day. I can go
to Alabama, Louisiana, North Caro-
lina, South Carolina, and I can possibly
vote in every one of those States, be-
cause the driving distance, I could
make that.
So I could vote in possibly seven or
eight States as a single person on the
day of voting. Nobody could validate
that. Yet the election gets calculated
and determined on those kinds of vot-
ing, and I don’t think that is what any-
body wants.
I would hope, regardless of your po-
litical affiliation, you would stand up
to say this is wrong. We need to make
sure these safeguards are in place to
protect that one very, I think, sacred,
precious right of all voters, of all
American citizens, the right to vote.
Number five: Diminishes the process
of election day voting by expanding
‘‘no excuse’’ absentee voting and allow-
ing for eligible voters to be able to cast
their ballot by mail with no additional
safeguards to this process.
That means provisional ballots that
get sent in, their signature can’t be
questioned. It doesn’t need to be ques-
tioned. It doesn’t have to be the cor-
rect signature, but it will be counted as
a vote.
I would think a party that put that
in place would be afraid of that, be-
cause it really weakens the democratic
process we go through as a constitu-
tional republic.
Number six: Disregards State voter
identification laws by allowing sworn
statements to be used in place of iden-
tification and allowing for signature
verification, which can be submitted
through a photo if the voter registers
online.
Let me read that again.
Disregards State voter identification
laws by allowing sworn statements to
be used in place of identification and
allowing for signature verification,
which can be submitted through a
photo if the voter registers online.
Now, think about that. I can’t get on
an airplane without a picture ID. I
can’t purchase medication, over-the-
counter cold medication with phenyl-
ephrine in it, without a picture ID, but
we are going to allow people to vote
without a picture ID just by signing an
affidavit saying I am who I say I am.
And, again, that won’t be verified until
after the election.
It has fraud written all over it, and I
think it is unconscionable that the
Democrats would even consider such a
thing on something that we hold so sa-
cred in this Nation, that we brag about
and we boast about in the world as
being the longest serving democracy in
the world using a democratic process in
a constitutional republic, that we are
going to allow such shoddy type of ver-
ification.
Again, it is unconscionable that they
would even consider bringing this up.
Number seven: Fails to criminalize
fraudulent registrations.
Fails to criminalize fraudulent reg-
istrations. We have people going to jail
because they have lied to the FBI. We
have George Papadopoulos who lied to
the FBI, and he went to prison for 14
days. But I can lie and not be who I say
I am, and I can vote on this Demo-
cratic bill, H.R. 1, and I have no re-
course against me. There is no con-
sequence for me being a liar.
And I just think a party that wants
to have those kinds of policies in place
as a whole needs to look in the mirror
and say: What are we trying to do?
Number eight: Impedes States’ abil-
ity to determine their registration and
voting practices as protected under Ar-
ticle I, Section 4 of the Constitution
and violates separation of powers by
Congress mandating ethics standards
for the Supreme Court. H.R. 1 is a con-
stitutional overreach.
Number eight: Impedes States’ abil-
ity to determine their registration vot-
ing practices as protected, as I said,
under Article I, Section 4.
Number nine: Violates constitutional
rights under the First Amendment by
prohibiting any false statements relat-
ing to Federal elections, including
time, manner, place, qualifications of
candidates, or endorsements of can-
didates enforced by a partisan FEC,
which is the Federal Elections Com-
mittee.
Number 10: Empowers trial attorneys
by establishing private rights of action
by allowing candidates to litigate their
way to victory.
We saw this in the last Presidential
election. We saw this in the last guber-
natorial election in my State of Flor-
ida. We saw this in the senatorial race
in Florida, where people were going to
sue, and they didn’t have the legality
of doing that, but this bill would allow
that.
And I think one of the largest griev-
ances for H.R. 1 that all people ought
to be upset with is that it mandates
voter registration—mandates voter
registration. What that means is the
Federal Government says you must
register to vote.
I agree, we should all register to
vote, but can the government mandate
you?
We tried this with the Affordable
Care Act that the Democrats ran
through in a partisan manner in this
Chamber, no Republican support, man-
dated that people had to buy a product
even if they didn’t want that.
Madam Speaker, that is wrong, and
that is why that part got struck down,
the individual mandate got struck
down, as it should have, because the
Federal Government was saying: If you
don’t do what we say, we are going to
fine you.
You know, that sounds like China.
China does that. They have their good
citizen score, the Orwellian good cit-
izen score that they monitor what you
do, and if you don’t do it, you don’t get
the prizes of the Chinese Government.
Are we turning into that, mandating
voters to register?
Last Congress, I chaired the Asia, the
Pacific, and Nonproliferation Sub-
committee on Foreign Affairs. And it
was amazing because I got to travel to
countries around the world that have
just started free and open elections in
a Western, democratic style. It pains
me to see these countries with a new
democracy where 95 percent to 98 per-
cent of the people show up.
If you look at Iraq or Afghanistan,
they are walking around with the pur-
ple finger at risk of their lives, because
for once in their life they had an oppor-
tunity to vote, to vote for somebody
that they wanted in power—a foreign
concept to them. Yet in this country,
we want to take that away from peo-
ple.
As we continue on, there are some
myths on H.R. 1.
It has been designed to fund, elect,
and maintain Democratic majority,
and I want the American people to
know that. The Democrats introduced
this 571-page package of Democratic
priorities without allowing for input
from Republican Members or going
through the standard House Com-
mittee.
This is something that they railed
against us. All the 6 years I have been
in Congress, they have railed against
us about no open process, yet they
come out with a 571-page package of
Democratic priorities without allowing
for input from one Republican Member.
H.R. 1 will waste taxpayers’ money,
federalize the election system, weaken
safeguards surrounding voter registra-
tion, and violate Americans’ constitu-
tional right to free speech under the
First Amendment.
The estimated cost of this that we
got for H.R. 1, because of all the sub-
sidies and the other garbage that is in
this, is over $10 billion to the American
taxpayers—$10 billion—when we are al-
ready at $22 trillion in debt.
I would like to go through a few
myths.
Democrats are empowering citizens.
That is the myth. The facts are Demo-
crats are using citizens’ hard-earned
taxpayer dollars to fund their can-
didates:
Voucher from the government to the
campaign: Through this bill, eligible
voters would receive a $25 voucher from
the Federal Government that they can
use to donate to the campaign of their
choice, meaning hard-earned taxpayer
dollars are going to be going to the
government, to their campaign of
choice;
Government matching campaign do-
nations in congressional races: Under
H.R. 1, the Federal Government will be
required to match small contributions
under $200 at 6 to 1. Taxpayer dollars
will be going to the government to
fund candidates;
Government matching campaign do-
nations in Presidential races: Also,
under H.R. 1, there is a 6-to-1 govern-
ment match of small contributions in a
Presidential campaign, up to $250 mil-
lion. A quarter of $1 billion would be
going towards the Presidential cam-
paign, and there is no limit to con-
tributions.

February 26, 2019
Another Democrat myth: Democrats
are promoting integrity. The facts are
Democrats are promoting the interests
of Washington, D.C., swamp, not yours:
Federal paid vacations: Federal
workers would get a 6-day paid vaca-
tion to serve as poll watchers;
16-year-old voters: H.R. 1 will open
the door to 16-year-old voters by re-
quiring States to allow them to reg-
ister and vote;
Free speech violation: Prohibits any
false statements related to Federal
elections, including time, manner,
place, qualifications, candidates, or en-
dorsement.
And I want to go back over this one
other myth. Democrats are creating
vulnerabilities in the voting system:
Automatic voter registration—auto-
matic voter registration, mandates
from the Federal Government, boy,
how the Dems like that—requires all
States to adopt an automatic voter
registration system that would be rely-
ing on the Federal Government for
records. There would be no criminal
punishment for an ineligible voter who
is registered in error.
Madam Speaker, as you have heard,
my colleagues and I have severe con-
cerns about H.R. 1. While my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
are marketing it as a fix to the Amer-
ican voting system, what it really does
is degrade the standards we have had in
place for over 200 years to protect
American voters and the voting proc-
ess.
As Members in Congress, we have the
responsibility to ensure that every
American has the right to vote and the
access to vote and that that vote is
guaranteed and protected. H.R. 1 does
not do this, and I encourage my col-
leagues to consider this implication
and not support this bill.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

FIVE PILLARS OF WHAT WE
BELIEVE SAVES US
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker,
many of us really appreciate when you
stay here and listen to us because we
know a lot of folks out there don’t ap-
preciate it. It is sort of a gift of your
time to be with us. When we were in
the majority, I spent much of my fresh-
man term sitting in that chair.
What we are going to do tonight is
this sort of a continuation of a theme.
We have already heard tonight, and
over the last couple weeks, discussions
of debt, discussions of what is hap-
pening in Medicare, and, actually, I
want to come here behind this micro-
phone and talk about what I believe is
a solution.
b 2015
I genuinely believe over the last few
years, we have put together at least
the backbone of enough math to talk
about the reality. But let’s first sort of
set up the discussion if you haven’t
watched some of our other floor presen-
tations since the beginning of this ses-
sion.
Every week, every other week, we try
to take a half an hour and walk
through our five pillars of what we be-
lieve saves us. Understand, in 9 years,
50 percent of all of the noninterest
spending that this Congress will do will
be to those 65 and over.
Understand, in 9 years, the 74 million
baby boomers will actually be in their
benefit cycle. They will be 65 and up.
In 9 years, two workers for one re-
tiree. And when you start to look at
the future of our debt, understand—and
this is hard because so many don’t
want to hear it, and it is not Repub-
lican or Democrat, it is demographics.
If you look at our society, we are get-
ting older very fast; our birth rates
have substantially collapsed. Family
formation, we have some real issues
out there.
So what do you do as a society? We
have promises that have been made,
earned entitlements out there, your
Social Security, your Medicare, and
you have earned those. That is part of
your societal contract with this gov-
ernment, but we don’t have the cash to
pay over the next 30 years.
How do we get there? I am going to
tell you. I am still optimistic there is
a path. I see some of these slides and
these boards through the eyes of my
daughter. I have a 3-year-old daughter.
Best little girl ever. We actually have a
coffee mug at home that says that.
Doesn’t she have the right to live as
well as the generations that have gone
before her? Doesn’t she have the right
to have that sort of optimistic oppor-
tunity? I actually believe that is not
lost in our society. But as you even saw
on the floor today, we do political the-
ater here because complex policy is
hard. It actually requires math, and
Congress is substantially a math-free
zone.
So we always start with this chart.
Understand, I believe there are five pil-
lars, and you can mix them up any way
you want to.
Immigration. How do you design an
immigration system in the future that
maximizes talent importation to the
Nation? Because you need to maximize
economic philosophy as soon as pos-
sible. That is what the rest of the
world has done. Australia, Great Brit-
ain, New Zealand, and Canada have
moved to talent-based systems because
they figured out that there is some-
thing elegant about that model.
Now, let’s be honest. I don’t care
what gender you are. I don’t care your
religion. I don’t care your race. I don’t
care who you cuddle with. I don’t care
about those things. We care about the
talent you bring to our society to
maximize economic growth. I actually
think it is a much more elegant model
than we use today in immigration.
Economic growth. We must hunker
down and embrace tax policy, regu-
latory policy, and trade policy that
maximizes economic vitality. The ve-
locity of the size of this economy must
continue to grow, and grow at a fairly
substantial rate. If you look at the
data, 91 percent of the spending in-
creases from this government from 2008
to 2028 are functionally three things:
interest, Social Security, and
healthcare entitlements.
So we are all going to talk about
debt. It is a threat to our society.
When we are going to have the honest
conversation, it is substantially driven
by our demographics and our
healthcare costs.
The next one we are going to talk
about is labor force participation. We
are going to spend time tonight on
that. I know it is a dry subject, but
this is actually trying to be intellectu-
ally honest. This is a moment where if
you are going to call our office and say
we want solutions, we are working
through it. But it is not trite.
My father used to have a saying. We
were just talking about it over in the
corner. For every complex problem,
there is a simple solution that is abso-
lutely wrong. It turns out, complex
problems require complex solutions.
We are going to talk tonight about
labor force participation. How do we
get as many Americans across the
board to participate in the economic
vitality? It turns out that has an amaz-
ing effect; everything from our
healthcare costs, to tax collections, to
just the economic growth.
The next two, there is a technology
revolution about to happen in
healthcare. It is also happening in en-
vironment. In the next couple of weeks
we are going to come here and show
some of the amazing technologies that
are out there that actually make some
of the environmental discussion seem
sort of passe when you understand the
technology that is on the cusp of roll-
ing out.
Let’s talk about healthcare right
now. I have come here to the floor over
the last couple of weeks and shown
things like—we nicknamed it in our of-
fice the flu kazoo—something a mate-
rial science professor has developed;
you blow into it, and it instantly tells
you if you have a viral infection, and in
the backbone, it could automatically
order your antivirals. Start thinking
about the revolution that would hap-
pen in the cost curve of healthcare if
we had substantial change in autono-
mous healthcare.
In the Phoenix area, we have an orga-
nization that now, I believe, has seven
of these autonomous healthcare clinics
where you go in, you sign up on an
iPad, you take a picture of your insur-
ance card, your driver’s license, you go
in and you put your arm in, you pick
this up, you shine it in your throat,
your ear, and your nose, and the algo-
rithm is able to do amazingly accurate
calculations of your health.
Think about that type of technology
when it is in your pocket. You have all
seen the pocket size, the size of your

smartphone that is now an ultrasound.
It is completely portable. We must, as
a body—and this is at our State legisla-
ture, but particularly this body—we
must break down these barriers to the
technology disruption that could be a
revolution in lowering healthcare
costs.
You have got to be intellectually
honest. The ACA, the Republican alter-
natives, in much of the discussion, we
are not actually having a discussion
about lowering healthcare costs. We
are having discussions about who gets
to pay.
It is time that we embrace and truly
draw in the technology that can be
that very disruption. We have a run-
ning joke in our office: Did you go to
Blockbuster Video last weekend? We
all live it. It is now time that we un-
derstand that our future healthcare
costs are an Achilles’ heel to this soci-
ety because of our demographics and
just where the costs are going.
There is another part of that. We are
going to actually do a floor presen-
tation, probably at the end of the
month. There are incredible disrupters
coming in the pharmaceutical world.
We just had some information and we
think, actually by the end of this year,
there may be a single shot cure for he-
mophilia A. That is only about 8,000 of
our brothers and sisters in the country,
and it is going to be really expensive,
but it cures.
What happens as we continue to see
these biological, genomic pharma-
ceuticals rolling out that actually
cure? Or the one that we were reading
about today, that stabilizes our popu-
lations who have ALS?
What does that mean to the cost
curve of the 50 percent of healthcare
spending that is to the 5 percent of our
population that have chronic condi-
tions?
The last one I am going to give you
is, it is time to rethink the incen-
tives—and this one will always be
tough—in Social Security, in Medicare.
How do we encourage an individual to
stay in the labor force? Are there
things we can do to encourage waiting
to take benefits? And these are math.
It is just actuarial science.
So today we are going to talk about
labor force participation. Isn’t that ex-
citing? The first slide I have already
mentioned, this is from the CBO report
3 weeks ago, and I was shocked it
didn’t get much press or discussion in
this body because it is math.
But if you look at this chart, what it
is trying to say is, in functionally 9
years, half of the spending of this
body—if you remove interest—half of
the spending will be to those 65 and
older.
It is just demographics. We got older
as a society. In 9 years it is the end of
the baby boomers, because they have
moved into being 65 and older.
But if you had seen this chart and
then matched it up to where you start
to see the debt and spending curves
move up, you understand they are in
sync: if you care about the debt, if you
care about spending, if you care about
opportunity in our society, understand
the demographic headwinds and what
we must do to face that.
So one of the reasons for this slide,
and I know these are a little tough to
watch, but what I want you to sort of
see is this is 2000. At that time, actu-
ally over 67 percent of our population
was in the labor force. It functionally
collapsed after 2008 and never returned.
The blessing is this last year we have
had a little bit of a blip. There were
these really smart economists who
said: Hey, you are never going to get
back up to 62, 63 percent of labor force
participation. I believe we are now
around 61 or 62. We actually need to
find a way to get back to that 67 per-
cent of our brothers and sisters all up
and down our society being in the labor
force, having the honor, the elegance of
working.
There were some amazing numbers
last December, if you actually broke
into what was in those statistics, of the
number of organizations, the number of
companies that were actually reaching
out to the handicapped community and
making accommodations and hiring.
There are actually—and we are going
to touch on this—some parts of our so-
ciety are moving into the labor force,
particularly in the millennials, and we
are seeing parts that are not. Countries
like Japan that actually have faced
this, are facing it, have actually been
trying to design incentives and pro-
grams for even those who are older,
who are healthy, who are capable, who
are desirous to be welcomed to stay or
enter back into the labor force.
It is a barbell. We have a problem
with part of our younger population,
and then, obviously, our older popu-
lation—which we have so much tal-
ent—that are retiring. We are going to
have to have an honest incentives dis-
cussion design to maintain this labor
force philosophy.
If you actually look at what is going
on in our society right now, if I had
come to you 2 years ago and said: Hey,
we are going to see all sorts of quar-
tiles in our society have some of the
lowest unemployment in modern his-
tory, I think I would have just gotten
blank stares. But it is happening. And
with that incredible, almost full-em-
ployment society, we are actually see-
ing—and particularly in markets like
Arizona—we are actually now seeing
wages really starting to move. This is
wonderful. This is something we need-
ed, functionally, for a decade or two.
We can do a much more complicated
discussion of some of the incentives
that were built in the tax reform last
year that encouraged investment in
plant and equipment to push up pro-
ductivity. Productivity allows you to
be able to pay people more. But those
are the sorts of things you talk about.
How do you maintain economic vital-
ity?
When we actually look at some of the
unemployment numbers, there is some-
thing missing. Understand, when we
look at unemployment numbers, we are
looking at people who are actively
looking, actively searching for employ-
ment. We actually have a real problem
in parts of millennial males and others,
so how do we reach out and design in-
centives to stay in?
We are also going to go to some of
the other tougher questions, and that
is: Is it time to rethink things like So-
cial Security disability and say, hey, if
you earn $24,000, or you hit this point,
you hit a cliff. Your benefits disappear.
If you are on other safety-net pro-
grams, if you earn a certain amount,
you hit a cliff, and it disappears.
We need to have a brutally honest
conversation of, is that incentive of
that cliff an incentive not to enter the
labor force? What would happen if we
would work out the math so it was a
much more gradual glide slope to draw
those individuals into labor participa-
tion? Because if we are almost a full-
employment society but we still had
millions and millions of Americans
who are choosing not to participate in
the economy and we really need them
in our economy, we have got to look to
what are the disincentives.
b 2030
It is about time that we actually
start to have those social entitlement
conversations. I know for both Repub-
licans and Democrats, these are tough
because it requires math. It requires us
to work through certain ideological
folklore. But if you want the wholistic
solution to make it through the next 30
years, this labor force participation is
one of those five pillars.
The reason I actually did this slide
is—this one is a little geeky—but it is
actually trying to walk through what
has been happening. I am not going to
walk through all the detail, but we re-
cently had this wonderful pop of sort of
in the population of 25 to 34 females en-
tering the workforce. That was one of
the great things that we actually saw
last December. Great.
We need to understand why millen-
nial women are entering the workforce
in these sorts of numbers, what we
learn from that, and what we do now
for the millions of millennial males
who are still dramatically underrep-
resented in the economy.
Data shows millennial women domi-
nating the current job market. Look at
this separation right here and why this
is so important. Remember how I was
just saying something has been hap-
pening in the last couple quarters
where millennial females are entering,
but millennial males is the lower line.
This is a conceptual problem, but it is
real math.
Remember we talked about our bar-
bell? We have those who are older. How
do we create incentives to enter and
stay in the labor force? How do we
reach out to our younger population,
get them, incentivize them, and work
with them to get them into the labor
force? Functionally, we just do not
have a choice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2231
February 26, 2019
Let me grab another slide. We will
put these up in our office. Remember,
this sort of presentation is for those
who really care about digging in to the
actual math of policy. So often, what
we end up doing on the floor is political
theater and folklore.
If you look at some of these lines—
and I know this is a long time ago—but
if you and I were to step back to 1967
and look at the data for males, we had
97 percent of working-age males in the
labor force. Today, if we did that same
thing, I think we are at about 88. It
falls, 87, 88.
One of the big things that helped us
grow the economy is female participa-
tion in the economy. But we need to
find a way to get this back up. We are
just talking a few points, but those few
points of a few more million stepping
back into the labor market have sub-
stantial economic impact.
I want to talk about a story from Ar-
izona. I have had this discussion with a
couple of my Democratic friends. With-
in that, we have talked about incarcer-
ation rates and some of the other
things that end up becoming impair-
ments for young males to be in the
labor force.
In Arizona right now, we have such a
shortage of skilled trades—electricians
and carpenters—that a number of the
businesses in Arizona—actually, I ap-
proached our Governor, Governor
Ducey, and said: Help us. We are will-
ing to take our own money and go into
Arizona correctional facilities and do a
training program that is, when some-
one is going to be on parole in just a
few months, we will train them, and we
will guarantee that we will hire them.
It doesn’t mean a guarantee that they
will keep them.
So last year, we brought this young
man out from Arizona. We brought him
to the Ways and Means Committee. He
sat down in this beautiful room. The
Ways and Means Committee room, it is
just very big and very ornate. He didn’t
look like our typical witness, with a
number of piercings and a number of
tattoos around the neck. He looked up
when it was his turn to tell his story,
and he hesitated for a moment and
started with: I am a three-time con-
victed felon.
He went on to tell his story of how he
was an addict and the other times he
had gotten out of prison, he had re-
lapsed. He had lost his family. He had
lost everything. He had lost contact
with his child.
He was a few months from his oppor-
tunity to go on probation and leave the
correctional facility, and he saw this
flyer that said: We are doing training
for electricians. We guarantee we will
hire you—it doesn’t mean we are going
to keep you—if you pass this very basic
course.
He said: Why not?
He took this electrician course while
in prison, while it was paid for by pri-
vate industry because the job market
is so tight they are willing to take
risks on all sorts of populations to get
them back into the work environment.
He graduated. He started at just a
little over minimum wage. A year
later, he was making, I think, $23-
something an hour. He said he hadn’t
relapsed because he is working too
much. He said he is back with his fam-
ily. He gets to see his child. There are
these incredibly human stories.
If we are in a society right now that
is almost at full employment for those
looking for employment, how do we
reach out to those whom our society
gave up on or who gave up on them-
selves? How do we as policymakers de-
sign those incentives, design the social
entitlement programs, and design our
society where we want everyone to
have this opportunity within our com-
munities and our society?
It was one of the most touching and
amazing hearings, because when you
looked at those of us sitting up on the
dais, there were actually tears hearing
his story and realizing there is hope,
that this economic vitality provides
opportunity and hope.
We turn it into a political football
because it is not our side that wants to
get credit, or their side wants to get
credit. We need to get beyond that, be-
cause if we don’t get this math right,
my 3-year-old little girl won’t have the
same type of future I have had.
There is a path to make this work
and continue to have an economy, a
nation, that grows and provides oppor-
tunities. Understand, when the United
States grows, the world benefits.
But we have those five pillars. Is this
body capable of stepping up and doing
things that are complex without a sim-
ple solution?
Madam Speaker, I so desperately
hope so. With that, I yield back the
balance of my time.

Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2019 No. 35

The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was

tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Majestic God, we ask for the fruits of
Your unrivaled wisdom in these chal-
lenging times. Give our leaders the
strength and courage to triumph over
stagnation and conflict, and grant us
forgiveness for our shortcomings.
We praise You, O Lord, for we belong
to Your Kingdom, and we are Your
children. Bestow upon our great Nation
Your everlasting light, and let Your
perpetual goodness shine upon us.
Lord, our greatest debt of gratitude
is owed to You, for without You, we
can do nothing. Give us, this day, light
to guide us, courage to support us, and
love to unite us.
We pray in Your merciful Name.
Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
HYDE-SMITH). The majority leader is
recognized.
f
S. 311
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
the Senate had an opportunity yester-
day to affirm our commitment to the
dignity of human life. We had a chance
to state plainly that newborn babies
who happen to have survived abortions
are entitled to the same legal protec-
tions and professional care as other
newborns.
In all honesty, the fact that this leg-
islation even needed to be written is a
sad reminder of the degree to which
our society is at risk of losing some
crucial moral bearings, and the fact
that the U.S. Senate could not even
vote to advance this bill is beyond dis-
maying.
The legislation was silent on the
abortion issue. All it would have done
is to have affirmed the rights of these
newborn babies, but apparently even
that was a bridge too far, not just for
the far-left fringe—not anymore—but
for the vast majority of our Demo-
cratic colleagues right here in the Sen-
ate.
We are no longer dealing with a nor-
mal, traditional Democratic Party; we
are looking at a party that has been
dragged so far to the left, it would have
been unrecognizable to folks just a few
years ago. In 1996, Senator Daniel Pat-
rick Moynihan condemned partial-
birth abortion by comparing it to in-
fanticide. He was a distinguished,
mainstream Democratic Senator from
New York about 20 years ago. And
today? Ninety-four percent of Senate
Democrats could not even vote to pro-
tect babies after they are born. The
only explanations they could offer were
bizarre euphemisms and vague ref-
erences to issues that have no bearing
once a child has already been born
alive.
It was a sorry display, but I can say
this: This fight isn’t over. The Repub-
licans will not let this stunning extre-
mism from our Democratic colleagues
be the last word on this subject.
f
NOMINATION OF ERIC D. MILLER
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on another matter, fortunately, the
Senate did make progress in another
area. Yesterday, we advanced what will
be the 31st circuit court nomination to
be confirmed so far during the Trump
administration.
As I discussed yesterday, Eric Miller
has a distinguished record in both pub-
lic service and private practice. He
holds degrees from Harvard and the
University of Chicago, and his legal ex-
perience includes holding prestigious
clerkships on our Nation’s highest
courts. Yet, rather than take my word
for it, I urge my colleagues to consider
the endorsements of those with whom
the nominee has studied and worked.
For example, 54 members of the Uni-
versity of Chicago Law School’s class
of 1999, with their wide-ranging views
on politics and judicial philosophy,
have offered a ringing endorsement for
Eric Miller. In a letter to our col-
leagues on the Judiciary Committee,
they cite Mr. Miller’s ‘‘diligent work
ethic, his keen legal mind, and his deep
consideration for every legal issue he
confronts.’’ All in all, his classmates—
many of whom have also been his col-
leagues over the years—say that Mr.
Miller is ‘‘extraordinarily well quali-
fied to serve as a Federal judge.’’
I urge each of my colleagues to join
me in voting to confirm this fine nomi-
nee soon.
f
VOTER FRAUD
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on a final matter, anyone who has been
attentive to the news these past few
days has learned about the complete
debacle that unfolded in last Novem-
ber’s election for North Carolina’s
Ninth Congressional District. Soon
after election day, allegations of illegal
ballot harvesting and vote tampering
clouded a close result. The wrongdoing
seemed to have benefited the Repub-
lican candidate over the Democratic.
Just last week, we saw the State Board
of Elections unanimously call for a new
election.
For years and years, every Repub-
lican who dared to call for common-
sense safeguards for Americans’ ballots

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1448 February 26, 2019
was demonized by Democrats and their
allies. We were hit with leftwing talk-
ing points that insisted that voter
fraud was not real—it never happens,
they said—that fraud just didn’t hap-
pen and that modest efforts to ensure
that voters are who they say they are
and are voting in the proper places
were really some sinister, rightwing
plot to prevent people from voting.
As you might expect, now that an in-
cident of very real voter fraud has be-
come national news and the Republican
candidate seems to have benefited,
these longstanding Democratic talking
points have been really quiet. We
haven’t heard much lately from the
Democrats about how fraud never hap-
pens. They have gone silent. Now some
are singing a different tune. There is a
new interest in ensuring the sanctity
of American elections.
I have been focused for decades on
protecting the integrity of elections, so
I would like to welcome my friends on
the left to their new realization. They
have just discovered that this subject
really matters, but I have yet to see
any evidence that they are actually in-
terested in cleaning up the conditions
that lead to messes like this one in
North Carolina.
At the root of the North Carolina de-
bacle is a practice that is known as
ballot harvesting. Essentially, it is a
means by which campaign representa-
tives can collect absentee ballots on
the premise of delivering them to a
polling place or an election office. That
is what ballot harvesting is. So think
about it. Who in American politics
keeps long lists of potential voters?
Who mobilizes networks of people to go
door-to-door? Who funds and stands up
to these kinds of canvassing organiza-
tions? Who does those things?
I am sorry to say that there are not
huge teams of politically neutral Eagle
Scouts who rove the country and hope
to use ballot harvesting to politely
make voters’ lives more convenient.
This is not an Eagle Scout activity.
The folks who really lick their lips at
the prospect of mass ballot harvesting
are political operatives, of course—po-
litical operatives, interest groups, and
one-sided political machines. This is
why many jurisdictions, including in
North Carolina, have outlawed the
practice altogether. I will say that
again. Many jurisdictions, including in
North Carolina, have outlawed this
practice altogether.
Ballot harvesting threatens to
change the nature of our representa-
tive democracy. Forget about per-
suading people and spurring them to
turn out to the polls; this practice
makes elections a kind of scavenger
hunt to see which side’s operatives can
return to headquarters with the most
ballots in the trunks of their cars, and
once those operatives take ahold of
these ballots, the voters have no way
to keep tabs on whether they were ever
delivered.
Of course, a system that invites po-
litical operatives to be rewarded for
turning up ballots will open the door to
misbehavior. Remember, it is illegal in
North Carolina and in most States for
the obvious reason, but I have noted
with interest that the Democrats’ new
focus on this practice has yet to extend
to California. I wonder why. Well, in
California, it is legal. It is a common
practice in California. California al-
lows anyone—not just family members
but anyone—to show up at polling
places on election day with ballots that
are not theirs. Welcome to California.
Reports suggest that Orange County
alone saw—listen to this—250,000 ab-
sentee ballots dropped off on election
day last year. The county’s registrar
told the newspaper that some individ-
uals dropped off hundreds of other peo-
ple’s ballots. We have no way to know
if those ballots were sealed or if the
people had even voted when they were
harvested. The only evidence we have
that the voter cast his or her ballot is
the signature.
This past election cycle turned out
favorably for California Democrats,
amazingly enough. These late-arriving
ballots seemed to help turn several
races their way. Maybe this helps ex-
plain why: When House GOP leaders ex-
pressed concern over ballot harvesting
in California, the State’s Democratic
secretary of state mocked their con-
cern by saying: ‘‘What they call
strange and bizarre we call democ-
racy.’’ Now ballot harvesting has
thrown out an election result in the
U.S. House of Representatives—legal in
California, illegal in North Carolina.
Maybe that helps explain why, as it
stands, the Democrat Politician Pro-
tection Act—Speaker PELOSI’s massive
new Federal takeover of the way
States and communities run their elec-
tions—contains no effort whatsoever to
crack down on ballot harvesting. It is
not in there. Instead, it contains provi-
sion after provision that would erode
the protections that are supposed to
ensure votes reflect the voices of the
voters whose names are on the enve-
lopes.
It contains provision after provision
that would erode the protections that
are supposed to ensure that votes re-
flect the voice of the voter whose name
is on the envelope.
Provision after provision would erode
commonsense protections and bring
the guardrails down. So would a seri-
ous reform bill aimed to take away
States’ abilities to impose meaningful
ID or signature requirements for vot-
ers. Would someone concerned about
restoring democracy dismiss signature
verification as an obstacle to be re-
moved? I don’t think so.
Perhaps these facts signal that
Democrats see a political advantage in
eroding commonsense protections and
would rather keep that advantage than
make episodes like the North Carolina
mess less likely to happen in the fu-
ture.
An example of real-live voter fraud is
staring the country right in the face
right now in North Carolina. Yet
Democrats choose at this moment to
propose a sprawling Federal takeover
of election law that would erode the in-
tegrity of our elections even further.
So that, I think, pretty well under-
scores what the priorities of today’s
Democrat Party is.

DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
today, the House of Representatives
will take up a motion to terminate the
state of emergency proclaimed by
President Trump. For many reasons,
the measure should pass with bipar-
tisan support.
First, Members of both parties know
there is no actual emergency at the
border. Nearly 60 former national secu-
rity advisers—Democrat and Repub-
lican, bipartisan—including former
Secretaries of State and Defense, have
written a statement saying there is
‘‘no factual evidence of an emergency
at the border.’’ The President himself
said, when announcing the state of
emergency, that he ‘‘didn’t need to do
this.’’
An emergency, by definition, is some-
thing you need to do. It is an emer-
gency. In the President’s own words,
this is not a state of emergency.
If we let Presidents, whomever they
be—Democrat or Republican—willy-
nilly, because they want to get some-
thing done, just declare an emergency
when it is clear it has been a long-term

condition, a long-term issue, this coun-
try is a different country.
That leads to my second point. Mem-
bers of both parties should be con-
cerned about the President diverting
money away from military construc-
tion projects in their districts.
Again, the President doesn’t like you
for some reason. He says there is an
emergency and takes money away from
a project in your State that you have
worked hard for. That is no way to gov-
ern.
But at the top of the list is this: the
Founding Fathers looking down upon
this Chamber and upon these United
States of America. They set up an ex-
quisite balance of power. They were
worried about an overreaching Execu-
tive. They knew what King George was
all about. So they named the Congress,
the House and Senate, the article I—ar-
ticle I, not II, III or IV—part of the
government. Second, they gave the
Congress one of the greatest powers
any government has, which is the
power of the purse.
When the President tries to take
these powers away, which clearly he is
doing in this case—he called for an
emergency when he couldn’t get his
way in Congress, not because some new
facts came on the scene—it is a change
in the fundamental, necessary, and,
often, exquisite balance of power.
I know many of my friends on the
other side of the aisle understand that.
In fact, true conservatism worries
about too much power being central-
ized in any place because conservatism
exalts the freedom of the individual.
So to look the other way because
Donald Trump wants this—because he
is almost sometimes in a temper tan-
trum about this issue—is so short-
sighted and is so detrimental to the
long-term health, stability, and viabil-
ity, even, of how the balance of power
works.
So I implore my friends on the other
side of the aisle to contemplate what it
might portend for our democracy to
allow this emergency declaration to
stand. What would stop any future
President from claiming an emergency
every week and doing what they want-
ed—a total subversion of the balance of
powers, a derogation of huge power to
the Executive, which has plenty of
power already?
The National Emergencies Act has
been used only once in its relatively
short history, and that was to take ac-
tion after 9/11—clearly, an emergency.
Now President Trump is trying to bend
the law to his will, not to address a
military emergency, not to address any
real emergency. This has been an ongo-
ing issue. He would say ‘‘problem.’’
That is OK, but he is doing it for per-
sonal political gain, to accomplish
something Congress rejected and the
American people oppose.
He has tried several times to get this
wall. Congress has resisted. Congress
even resisted when Democrats didn’t
have control of the House, and now
they do. Elections do matter. We are a
democracy, President Trump. So it is
hard to imagine a more senseless and
destructive use of emergency powers
than what the President has proposed.
So let us, Democrats and Repub-
licans, House and Senate, rise to the
occasion. This will be a moment in his-
tory, a point where things may turn a
bit. If Congress stands up, it will be a
reaffirmation of our democracy. It will
be a reaffirmation of the democracy
the Founding Fathers wanted. If Con-
gress stands up—Democrats and Repub-
licans—when the Founding Fathers
look down on this Chamber after the
vote occurs, they will smile because
this is the democracy they wanted.
They did not want a democracy where
a President could simply declare an
emergency on a whim and overrule
what Congress has done.
So let us—Congress—first the House
and then the Senate, speak up with one
bipartisan voice to remedy this injury
that President Trump is trying to do to
our constitutional order.
Whatever you think of the best way
to secure our border, this is not the
way for a President—any President—to
exercise his authority. This is not
about whether you are for or against a
wall, and I, of course, am against it. It
is about what America is all about,
whatever your view on the wall.
GUNS
Madam President, on guns, the House
this week will take up a measure to
close the dangerous loopholes in the
background check system used to cer-
tify firearms. For years, Democrats
have tried to address these loopholes—
the gun show, online, and private sales
loopholes—only to be met with lock-
step resistance by a Republican Con-
gress beholden to the NRA. It is 90 per-
cent of Americans who favor strength-
ening the background check system,
not 51, not 52, 90—the majority of Re-
publicans, the majority of gun owners.
Any way you slice it, Americans are
strengthening background checks.
Americans believe felons, spousal abus-
ers, or those adjudicated mentally ill
should not have guns, but Congress is
paralyzed because of the other side’s
obeisance to the NRA—not even after
Newtown, not even after Charleston,
not even after Las Vegas, not even
after Orlando, not after Parkland.
On guns, the tide is turning. Make no
mistake about it, a strong majority of
the American people support these
policies now. The NRA has been consid-
erably weakened. They did not do very
well in the last elections. Finally,
there is a House in Congress that will
listen to the American people and take
action on guns—thoughtful, moderate
action on background checks.
With each measure that passes the
House, the pressure will build on the
Senate to take up these reasonable,
commonsense gun safety measures, and
I hope my colleagues will join us.
BUYBACKS
On another matter, buybacks. This
morning, the New York Times reported
on an interesting facet of the recent
stock market rally. Many investors,
according to the Times, are selling off
stock. Average investors are selling off
stock. Pensions, and mutual funds,
nonprofits, endowments, private equity
firms, and trusts are all, in the aggre-
gate, selling stock.
So then why is it rallying? The laws
of supply and demand should say the
stock market should go down. The
Times reports that it is corporate self-
investment buybacks. Companies are
buying back their own stock at such a
rapid clip that they are propping up
the market and, to a great degree,
themselves. It is another clear example
of how the recent explosion of stock
buybacks in corporate America is dis-
torting the market—artificially, some
would argue.
Some Democratic Senators, and even
some Republican Senators, have begun
to sound the alarm about the record-
breaking scale of corporate buybacks.
Over the last decade, based on analysis
of America’s largest corporations, 466
of S&P 500 companies, 92 cents out of
every dollar of corporate profit has
gone to share buybacks or dividends.
Some say, well, they have already,
before the profits, put money into their
workers and into their communities.
We are saying they should put some
more, for the good of the country.
Stock price, when so much of it is held
up by buybacks, shouldn’t be the only
indicia, the only measure, of how well
the country is doing, especially when
85 percent of the stocks are owned by
the top 10 percent of Americans.
Most Americans would completely
agree that there are more productive
ways for corporations to allocate their
capital than this borderline obsession
with stock buybacks—the slavery to
short-term rises in price to please in-
vestors—while not doing much for
workers or for communities.
I hope corporate America will wake
up. Income inequality, along with cli-
mate change, to me, are the two great-
est problems America faces. We need
corporate America to propose some so-
lutions because when they say let gov-
ernment do it, much of corporate
America then opposes government
doing anything for workers or for com-
munities.
Let’s take a careful look at this, and
let’s see what the right solutions are.
The status quo is not acceptable.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Madam President, on climate change,
for decades we have known climate
change is not only a major national
challenge but an existential threat to
our planet and to our future. Despite
the gravity and scale of this challenge,
one political party in the United States
has largely denied the problem even ex-
ists, denied the overwhelming con-
sensus of the scientific community,
and denied most attempts in Congress
to tackle climate change.
President Trump’s record on climate
change is one of abject failure: denying
science, systematically rolling back
environmental protections that reduce

carbon emissions, and announcing
withdrawal from the Paris climate ac-
cords—Luddite, ostrich-like, if there
ever were, actions that can be de-
scribed that way.
Recently, we heard of a new effort by
the Trump administration to once
again push back against efforts to ad-
dress climate change. You see, it was
probably embarrassing for President
Trump when his own administration
released the National Climate Assess-
ment last year, as required by law,
which outlined the severe and imme-
diate impacts of climate change. Ac-
cording to reports, the White House
now has plans to set up a fake panel of
cherry-picked scientists who question
the severity of climate change in order
to counter the scientific consensus on
this terribly urgent problem, even
within the administration. This new
fake panel will reportedly be set up
under the National Security Council,
not the EPA, not NOAA, or any of the
Agencies where real scientists work—
real climate scientists.
This is maybe the most conspicuous
symptom of the disease of climate
denialism that has infected the Repub-
lican Party and the hard right. This is
beyond willful ignorance. This is the
intentional, deliberate sowing of
disinformation about climate science
by our own government. This cannot
stand.
This morning, I am announcing that
if the Trump administration moves for-
ward with this fake climate panel, we
will be introducing legislation to
defund it. I will be doing it, along with
several of my colleagues. It is long past
time for President Trump and Repub-
lican leaders to admit that climate
change is real, that human activity
contributes to it, and Congress must
take action to counter it.
So far, Leader McConnell and our Re-
publicans, when we ask them, do you
believe climate change is real? Silence.
Do you believe humans cause it? Si-
lence. Do you believe Congress has to
act to deal with it? Silence. That will
not stand, and they will not be able to
maintain that position over a period of
time.
NORTH KOREA
Madam President, finally, on North
Korea—and I appreciate the indulgence
of my friend from Illinois. There are a
lot of topics and a lot of things going
on today.
As the President continues negotia-
tions in Hanoi with the North Koreans,
I want to restate that his goal should
be complete, verifiable, and irrevers-
ible denuclearization of Korea. An
agreement that includes significant
U.S. sanctions relief in exchange for
something short of that will be woe-
fully insufficient. It will make North
Korea stronger and the world more
dangerous, not safer.
To simply say to North Korea that
we are going to let you continue to be
nuclear in exchange for something
else—a peace treaty or some words, a
photo op—that is not protecting the se-
curity of the United States.
I remind my colleagues, Congress
passed sanctions against the North Ko-
rean regime for its appalling record on
human rights. Congress would need to
repeal that law for President Trump to
give North Korea reliable sanctions re-
lief.
The North Koreans themselves
should realize many of us in Congress
will not, will not, will not—no matter
what President Trump does, many of
us in Congress will not remove this
sanction relief until North Korea
denuclearizes, verifiably and irrevers-
ibly.
Make no mistake about it, no matter
what President Trump does in Vietnam
this week, this Chamber will have a
significant role to play if President
Trump decides to reduce sanctions as
part of any deal with North Korea.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip.
S. 311
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last
night, for the second time in a month,
Democrats objected to a bill to ban in-
fanticide.
That statement to me is absolutely
chilling, but for the second time in a
month, Democrats objected to a bill
that would do nothing more than state
that a living, breathing baby born in
an abortion clinic is entitled to the
same protection and medical care as a
living, breathing baby born in a hos-
pital is entitled to.
It is a pretty basic bill. It just says
that living, breathing, born human
beings are entitled to protection even
if they are born in an abortion clinic,
but apparently that is not something
Democrats are prepared to say. This is
where Democrats’ support for abor-
tions has led them—to being unable to
condemn infanticide.
Let’s remember why we voted on this
bill last night. We voted on this bill be-
cause the Democratic Governor of Vir-
ginia implicitly endorsed infanticide—
because the Democratic Governor of
Virginia got up and said that you could
keep a living, breathing baby com-
fortable while you decided what to do
with it.
There is only one answer to what you
do with a living, breathing baby, and
that is to provide it with the care it
needs. A baby born alive in an abortion
clinic is no less valuable and deserving
of protection than a baby born in a de-
livery room.
It is horrifying that we are actually
having a debate about this. Honestly,
it is horrifying that the Democratic
Party can’t get up and say that infan-
ticide is wrong. My Democratic col-
leagues like to talk about protecting
the vulnerable, but how can they claim
to care about helping those in need if
they harden their hearts toward the
most vulnerable among us? If they are
willing to deny living, breathing babies
basic medical care, do you really stand
for the vulnerable if you can’t stand up
and say that infanticide is wrong?
It is terrible enough that we have so
far betrayed our founding principles as
to deny the right to life of living,
breathing unborn babies, but we are
not even talking about abortion here.
We are talking about withholding es-
sential care from babies who are born
alive. My Democratic colleagues can’t
even bring themselves to say this is
wrong.
I would say to my Democratic col-
leagues, do you really want to be the
party of Governor Northam? Do you
really want to be the party of infan-
ticide?
The American people don’t agree
with the Democratic Party on abortion
and on infanticide. Most Americans be-
lieve that babies born alive after an
abortion should be provided with med-
ical care. Most Americans think there
should be at least some limits on abor-
tion. In fact, most countries in the
world think there should be some lim-
its on abortion. The United States is
just one of a tiny handful of countries
that allow elective abortion past 20
weeks of pregnancy. Among the others
on that list are China and North
Korea—not exactly the company we
want to be keeping when it comes to
protecting human rights.
A recent poll found that 71 percent of
Americans oppose abortion after 20
weeks of pregnancy. Yet the Demo-
cratic Party is aggressively embracing
an agenda of zero restrictions on abor-
tion, ever, up to—and now, apparently,
after—the moment of birth.
I hope last night is not the last time
we vote on the Born-Alive Abortion
Survivors Protection Act. I hope my
Democratic colleagues have a chance
to recast their votes. I hope, next time,
they will decide to vote against infan-
ticide. I hope, next time, they can af-
firm what should be a basic,
foundational principle, and that is that
every baby, wherever he or she is born,
deserves to be protected.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I lis-
tened to the statements of my col-
league from South Dakota. I would like
to make a suggestion.
Since the Republicans are in control
of the U.S. Senate, since there is a Re-
publican chairman of the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee, I would suggest to
my colleague that perhaps we have a
hearing on this bill he just described.
You see, it came to the floor yesterday
without any hearing. And the reason
why we need a hearing is that many of
us—many of us—voted for an infan-
ticide law, which is currently on the
books—a law that says that a child
needs to be protected and that those
who don’t protect that child are sub-
ject to criminal penalties, as they
should be.
Now, if this is a different approach to
it, doesn’t it at least merit a hearing
from the Republican majority before it
comes to the floor for a vote? There are
many questions I would like to ask of
those who propose this. I want to un-
derstand why the law that has been on

the books now for 17 years, as I remem-
ber, is inadequate to the challenges it
faces.
I supported the infanticide law. I will
continue to. If there are any changes
that the Republicans want to make, is
it too much to ask them to have a
hearing in their own committee, which
they chair, on this subject matter? I
hope they will take it seriously enough
to do it. Critics have said this has
nothing to do with changing the law. It
is just a ‘‘gotcha’’ vote on the floor—an
amendment which may be used against
candidates in future elections.
When it comes to children, some-
thing as serious as life and death
should be taken much more seriously
by the Republican majority.
AURORA, ILLINOIS, WAREHOUSE SHOOTING
Madam President, today is February
26. Eleven days ago, on Friday, Feb-
ruary 15, an angry man with a history
of violence and a Smith & Wesson .40
caliber pistol opened fire on his co-
workers and police officers at a ware-
house in Aurora, IL, about 40 miles
from the city of Chicago.
In a matter of just a few minutes,
five of this man’s coworkers at the
Henry Pratt Company were dead. He
then shot and wounded five police offi-
cers who rushed to the scene. An hour
and a half later, he died in an exchange
of gunfire with other policemen.
The day before this horrible incident
marked the anniversary of two other
mass shootings: the 1-year anniversary
of the Parkland, FL, shooting, which
killed 17 high school students and staff,
and the 11-year anniversary of a shoot-
ing at Northern Illinois University
that left 5 students dead and 17 injured.
The gunman in the Henry Pratt
warehouse massacre had just been told
that day that he was going to be fired.
His response was not just anger. His re-
sponse was to pull out a firearm and
murder five of his coworkers.
I want you to meet the victims of
this man’s violence. This is Trevor
Wehner. Trevor was 21 years old. He
was on the dean’s list of Northern Illi-
nois University’s business college. He
was on track to graduate this May.
Why was he at the Henry Pratt ware-
house on that day? It was because he
was on his first day of an internship at
the business. Trevor was so excited
about this opportunity to work at this
business and to see what it was like to
actually be in the real world that he
showed up for his internship 45 minutes
early that day. It was earlier than he
should have. He was that excited. He
died at the workplace that day.
This is Clayton Parks. He was known
as ‘‘Clay’’ to his family and friends. He
was the human resources manager at
Henry Pratt. He was also an alumnus
of Northern Illinois University. He had
been working at the Henry Pratt Com-
pany for 4 months. He was 32 years old.
He was married to his wife Abby and
had a beautiful little 9-month-old baby
boy, Axel.
I met them at Northern Illinois Uni-
versity when we held a vigil for Trevor
and Clay that afternoon. I talked to
Clay’s mom for the longest time. She
wanted to tell me his whole life story,
hoping that she could preserve the
memory of this wonderful young man
and what he meant to her.
Russell Beyer is over here. I went to
his memorial service. He had been at
Henry Pratt for more than 25 years. He
was a mold operator and was the father
of two grown children. He was also the
chairman of the union at Henry Pratt.
In a terrible twist of fate, Russell had
helped the gunman get his job back
when the company first fired him 2
months earlier. Last Thursday would
have been Russell’s 48th birthday. In-
stead of a birthday party, his family
and friends gathered that day at his
wake. As I went into the funeral home
in Montgomery, IL, I was struck by
this fact. It turns out that the family
decided that since Russell was such a
passionate football fan, everybody
should wear NFL jerseys. The room
was filled with members of his family
remembering him and paying tribute
to him by wearing jerseys of all of the
different teams they supported. Russell
was a Patriots fan. He wore a Patriots
jersey in his casket on the day that
would have been his 48th birthday.
Vicente Juarez was a stockroom at-
tendant and a forklift operator. He had
been at Henry Pratt for 13 years, since
the year 2006. Mr. Juarez and his wife
of 38 years lived in a home in Oswego
with their three grown children and
eight grandchildren—all under one
roof.
I will not forget that scene at the fu-
neral home, either, because the family
had decided that everyone would wear
a T-shirt. It was a black T-shirt with a
color photograph of Vicente in front of
it and one of his favorite sayings on
the back of it. There they were—grand-
children, children, older folks—all
wearing those black T-shirts in honor
and memory of this man.
I met his sister. His sister told me a
story that Vicente was part of the fam-
ily who immigrated to Illinois in 1972.
There were five boys and five girls.
They didn’t have any money. Their fa-
ther died 6 years after they immi-
grated. Yet they struggled and worked
and stuck together as a family. That
beautiful family—that beautiful fam-
ily—had to shoulder this tragedy,
where this gunman walked into that
warehouse and killed Vicente.
Josh Pinkard’s photograph is here.
He was the plant manager. He joined
Henry Pratt’s parent company 13 years
ago at a facility in his native Alabama.
He and his wife had moved to Illinois
with their three little kids last spring.
As he lay dying, Josh pulled out his
cell phone and texted his wife. His mes-
sage was this: ‘‘I love you. I’ve been
shot at work.’’ He died shortly there-
after. Josh Pinkard was 37 years old.
How did the police respond to this
mass shooting? Every on-duty member
of the Aurora Police Department
rushed to the scene, where they were
joined quickly by off-duty members of
the police department. Then, once the
word got out that a policeman had
been injured, hundreds of other police-
men, firefighters, and other first re-
sponders all came to the scene.
I was on the phone with the Aurora
police chief, Kristen Ziman. Kristen
put out a statement, which I com-
mended her for. It was the most elo-
quent statement. It said many things,
but I want to repeat what it said. She
said: ‘‘Every time an officer was hit,
another one went in. No one re-
treated.’’
All told, five members of the Aurora
Police Department were injured by
gunfire: Officer Adam Miller, Officer
Marco Gomez, Officer John Cebulski,
Officer James Zegar, and Officer
Reynaldo Rivera. A sixth officer, Diego
Avila, suffered a knee injury. They and
hundreds of other police officers and
first responders who rushed to the
scene are heroes. Simply put, they are
heroes. Their quick and courageous re-
sponse certainly saved other lives.
Here is the cruel irony and tragedy
beyond the loss of life. The gunman
should never have had a begun. In 1995,
this gunman pleaded guilty in the
State of Mississippi to charges that he
had beaten a former girlfriend with a
baseball bat and stabbed her with a
knife. He was sentenced to 5 years in
prison. He served 3.
In January of 2014—19 years later—he
applied for an Illinois firearm owner’s
identification card. He lied on that ap-
plication. He said he had no felony
record, and he was given permission
under Illinois law to buy a firearm. He
got away with that lie because the
State of Mississippi had failed to sub-
mit his conviction record to the FBI’s
criminal background check system. He
wasn’t in the computer as being dis-
qualified.
In March 2014, this man bought a
handgun from a gun dealer in Aurora.
Two weeks later, he applied for a con-
cealed carry permit. This time he
slipped up. He voluntarily submitted
his fingerprints in the hopes that his
concealed carry permit would be expe-
dited. Those fingerprints finally ex-
posed his felony record in Mississippi
and his violent past.
The Illinois State Police got word of
it, rejected his concealed carry applica-
tion, revoked his firearm owner’s iden-
tification card, and sent him a letter
saying that he needed to surrender the
Smith & Wesson firearm, which he used
to kill these five innocent people and
to injure these policemen. Obviously,
he never surrendered the weapon. It
was that same weapon that he used to
kill these innocent people and to injure
these policemen.
Almost 7 years ago, a disturbed
young man opened fire in a movie the-
ater in a suburb of Denver, killing 12
people and injuring 70 others. The
name of that suburb was Aurora—Au-
rora, CO.

quent mass shootings have become in

Aurora, CO, tweeted after the killings
in Aurora, IL: ‘‘Months from now, as
people talk about the mass shooting in
Aurora, someone will ask, ‘‘Which Au-
rora mass shooting are you talking
about?’’
Mass shootings have become too
common in America. They make the
news, but tens of thousands of Ameri-
cans die every year from gun violence,
and many of those deaths are barely re-
ported or noted. They die in suicides
and gun accidents, alone or in small
groups, in domestic disturbances, in
gang disputes, and in crossfire.
I am honored to represent the city of
Chicago, but my heart breaks to know
that last year more than 2,700 people
were injured or killed by gun violence
in that great city.
Let’s face it, America is confronting
an epidemic of gun violence. We need
thoughts and prayers, but we need so
much more. We need action to do some-
thing.
Do the lives of these policemen mean
anything? Of course, they do. They
mean a great deal to their families, and
they mean a great deal to this Nation.
Do the lives of these victims who
died mean anything? I met the fami-
lies—four of them. They are heart-
broken, and their lives will never be
the same.
We need action to close the deadly
gaps in America’s gun background
check system. Much of the work needs
to take place at the State level. State
and local law enforcement agencies are
investigating how this tragedy might
have been prevented and how to pre-
vent another violent felon from slip-
ping through the cracks in the system.
We also have a responsibility here. It
is not enough for a moment of silence.
It is not enough for prayers to be of-
fered. We need to do more to keep guns
out of the hands of people who should
not have them.
This week, the House of Representa-
tives will vote on a measure to close
the gun show and internet loopholes in
our background check system. These
loopholes make a mockery of the law,
which says we want to make sure that
no dangerous person buys a firearm or
keeps a firearm in America. It is criti-
cally important, and I support the
House’s effort, but, sadly, I have to pre-
dict that this measure will not even
come up for a debate—let alone a
vote—in this Republican-controlled
Senate. There is just no way that they
will consider any gun safety measure.
After Columbine and nearly every
mass shooting and natural disaster
since, a carpenter who lives in Illinois
has crafted wooden memorials to honor
the fallen.
His name is Greg Zanis, 68 years old.
In 20 years, he has made and deliv-
ered—listen to this—more than 26,274
handmade wooden crosses, Stars of
David, and crescent moons to commu-
nities across this country.
Greg drove to Sandy Hook, CT, after
26 first graders and educators were
murdered in their grade school. He
drove to Las Vegas after 58 people were
killed at a music festival. He drove to
the First Baptist Church in Sutherland
Springs, TX, after 26 worshipers were
killed. He drove to Pittsburgh, PA, to
honor the 11 worshipers killed at the
Tree of Life synagogue.
Even after all that tragedy, the mass
murder at Henry Pratt hit Greg Zanis
especially hard. You see, Greg Zanis’s
hometown is Aurora, IL. Mr. Zanis told
a reporter from the New York Times
that he could drive away from all of
the other tragedies, but he said: ‘‘I am
not going to be able to get away from
this one.’’
To those who will say that the after-
math of a mass shooting is not the
time to talk about gun safety, I have
one simple question: When is the right
time to talk about gun safety? If we
are going to talk about it only on the
days when no one dies in America be-
cause of the use of guns, then, of
course, we will never talk about it.
Will you wait until this killing comes
to your community, your church, your
kid’s school? Is that what it will take
before Members of the Senate and the
people across this Nation feel as Greg
Zanis does, that you just can’t escape
this carnage anymore? I pray that is
not the case.
We need to work together. Let’s
start. Let’s do something sensible and
bipartisan in the name of gun safety to
make our background check systems as
effective as they can be.
Look at those faces. Eleven days ago,
they were alive, part of a family,
loved—sons, fathers, grandfathers—and
now they are gone because one man
who never should have owned a gun
took it to work in a fit of anger and
killed these five men. It is time for this
Senate and this Congress to do some-
thing.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is
the legislative situation?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
pending question is on the Miller nomi-
nation.
Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Presiding
Officer.
I ask unanimous consent to speak as
in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, President
Trump declared a national emergency 2
weeks ago. He did this in order to build
a pet project of his. In the process, he
said it was his intent to siphon billions
of dollars that Congress had appro-
priated to help our men and women in
uniform. Now, I am not sure what law-
yers he consulted, but those lawyers
seem to have overlooked our Nation’s
founding document—the U.S. Constitu-
tion.
I know the President likes to com-
municate in 280 characters or less, so I
will point him to a 77-character phrase
he may want to review: ‘‘No Money
shall be drawn from the Treasury, but
in Consequence of Appropriations made
by Law.’’
That is a short sentence, but our
Founders knew what it meant. They
enshrined it in article I, section 9 of
the Constitution, and they established
that Congress—and Congress alone—
possesses the power of the purse. That
Congress has exclusive power over our
government’s spending priorities is one
of the most critical checks and bal-
ances in our constitutional system.
The President can propose funding for
whatever project he wants. He has the
absolute right to propose funding, but
it is the job of Congress to decide
where to invest the American people’s
hard-earned tax dollars.
Let’s review the facts. For over 2
years, the President has repeatedly
tried and has repeatedly failed to con-
vince Congress that building his south-
ern border wall is a good idea. He has
failed to get a deal with Mexico despite
giving his word and promising his sup-
porters more than 200 times that Mex-
ico would pay for it. He promised that
Mexico would pay for it while knowing,
of course, that Mexico would not pay a
cent for it. Then he failed to get a deal
with his own party even during the 2
years when the Republicans controlled
the Presidency, the U.S. Senate, and
the U.S. House of Representatives. He
also failed to get a deal after he forced
the country into a 35-day government
shutdown over the issue—a shutdown,
incidentally, that cost our country at
least $11 billion, to say nothing of the
number of people whose lives were so
disrupted that many either lost their
apartments, were unable to pay their
mortgages, were unable to pay their
bills, or were unable to pay for the
medical care they needed.
Yet, in the face of all of these
failings, he has decided to go it alone.
He has decided to stretch his powers—
beyond all recognition—under the Na-
tional Emergencies Act. There is no ra-
tional basis to justify the use of this
authority. So we should look at what a
bipartisan group of Republicans and
Democrats wrote—a group of 58 former
senior national security officials who
had to help secure our country under
both Republican and Democratic Presi-
dents.
They wrote: ‘‘There is no factual
basis for the declaration of a national
emergency’’ on the southwest border.
I ask unanimous consent that the
Joint Declaration of Former United
States Government Officials be printed
in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
JOINT DECLARATION OF FORMER UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS

2. On February 15, 2019, the President de-
clared a ‘‘national emergency’’ for the pur-
pose of diverting appropriated funds from
previously designated uses to build a wall
along the southern border. We are aware of
no emergency that remotely justifies such a
step. The President’s actions are at odds
with the overwhelming evidence in the pub-
lic record, including the administration’s
own data and estimates. We have lived and
worked through national emergencies, and
we support the President’s power to mobilize
the Executive Branch to respond quickly in
genuine national emergencies. But under no
plausible assessment of the evidence is there
a national emergency today that entitles the
President to tap into funds appropriated for
other purposes to build a wall at the south-
ern border. To our knowledge, the Presi-
dent’s assertion of a national emergency
here is unprecedented, in that he seeks to ad-
dress a situation:
(1) that has been enduring, rather than one
that has arisen suddenly;
(2) that in fact has improved over time
rather than deteriorated;
(3) by reprogramming billions of dollars in
funds in the face of clear congressional in-
tent to the contrary; and
(4) with assertions that are rebutted not
just by the public record, but by his agen-
cies’ own official data, documents, and state-
ments.
3. Illegal border crossings are near forty-year
lows. At the outset, there is no evidence of a
sudden or emergency increase in the number
of people seeking to cross the southern bor-
der. According to the administration’s own
data, the numbers of apprehensions and un-
detected illegal border crossings at the
southern border are near forty-year lows. Al-
though there was a modest increase in appre-
hensions in 2018, that figure is in keeping
with the number of apprehensions only two
years earlier, and the overall trend indicates
a dramatic decline over the last fifteen years
in particular. The administration also esti-
mates that ‘‘undetected unlawful entries’’ at
the southern border ‘‘fell from approxi-
mately 851,000 to nearly 62,000’’ between fis-
cal years 2006 to 2016, the most recent years
for which data are available. The United
States currently hosts what is estimated to
be the smallest number of undocumented im-
migrants since 2004. And in fact, in recent
years, the majority of currently undocu-
mented immigrants entered the United
States legally, but overstayed their visas, a
problem that will not be addressed by the
declaration of an emergency along the south-
ern border.
4. There is no documented terrorist or na-
tional security emergency at the southern bor-
der. There is no reason to believe that there
is a terrorist or national security emergency
at the southern border that could justify the
President’s proclamation.
a. This administration’s own most recent
Country Report on Terrorism, released only
five months ago, found that ‘‘there was no
credible evidence indicating that inter-
national terrorist groups have established
bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug
cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into
the United States.’’ Since 1975, there has
been only one reported incident in which im-
migrants who had crossed the southern bor-
der illegally attempted to commit a terrorist
act. That incident occurred more than
twelve years ago, and involved three broth-
ers from Macedonia who had been brought
into the United States as children more than
twenty years earlier.
b. Although the White House has claimed,
as an argument favoring a wall at the south-
ern border, that almost 4,000 known or sus-
pected terrorists were intercepted at the
southern border in a single year, this asser-
tion has since been widely and consistently
repudiated, including by this administra-
tion’s own Department of Homeland Secu-
rity. The overwhelming majority of individ-
uals on terrorism watchlists who were inter-
cepted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol
were attempting to travel to the United
States by air; of the individuals on the ter-
rorist watchlist who were encountered while
entering the United States during fiscal year
2017, only 13 percent traveled by land. And
for those who have attempted to enter by
land, only a small fraction do so at the
southern border. Between October 2017 and
March 2018, forty-one foreign immigrants on
the terrorist watchlist were intercepted at
the northern border. Only six such immi-
grants were intercepted at the southern bor-
der.’’
5. There is no emergency related to violent
crime at the southern border. Nor can the ad-
ministration justify its actions on the
grounds that the incidence of violent crime
on the southern border constitutes a na-
tional emergency. Factual evidence consist-
ently shows that unauthorized immigrants
have no special proclivity to engage in
criminal or violent behavior. According to a
Cato Institute analysis of criminological
data, undocumented immigrants are 44 per-
cent less likely to be incarcerated nationwide
than are native-born citizens. And in Texas,
undocumented immigrants were found to
have a first-time conviction rate 32 percent
below that of native-born Americans; the
conviction rates of unauthorized immigrants
for violent crimes such as homicide and sex
offenses were also below those of native-born
Americans. Meanwhile, overall rates of vio-
lent crime in the United States have de-
clined significantly over the past 25 years,
falling 49 percent from 1993 to 2017. And vio-
lent crime rates in the country’s 30 largest
cities have decreased on average by 2.7 per-
cent in 2018 alone, further undermining any
suggestion that recent crime trends cur-
rently warrant the declaration of a national
emergency.
6. There is no human or drug trafficking emer-
gency that can be addressed by a wall at the
southern border. The administration has
claimed that the presence of human and drug
trafficking at the border justifies its emer-
gency declaration. But there is no evidence
of any such sudden crisis at the southern
border that necessitates a reprogramming of
appropriations to build a border wall.
a. The overwhelming majority of opioids
that enter the United States across a land
border are carried through legal ports of
entry in personal or commercial vehicles,
not smuggled through unauthorized border
crossings. A border wall would not stop these
drugs from entering the United States. Nor
would a wall stop drugs from entering via
other routes, including smuggling tunnels,
which circumvent such physical barriers as
fences and walls, and international mail
(which is how high-purity fentanyl, for ex-
ample, is usually shipped from China di-
rectly to the United States).
b. Likewise, illegal crossings at the south-
ern border are not the principal source of
human trafficking victims. About two-thirds
of human trafficking victims served by non-
profit organizations that receive funding
from the relevant Department of Justice of-
fice are U.S. citizens, and even among non-
citizens, most trafficking victims usually ar-
rive in the country on valid visas. None of
these instances of trafficking could be ad-
dressed by a border wall. And the three
states with the highest per capita trafficking
reporting rates are not even located along
the southern border.
7. This proclamation will only exacerbate the
humanitarian concerns that do exist at the
southern border. There are real humanitarian
concerns at the border, but they largely re-
sult from the current administration’s own
deliberate policies towards migrants. For ex-
ample, the administration has used a ‘‘me-
tering’’ policy to turn away families fleeing
extreme violence and persecution in their
home countries, forcing them to wait indefi-
nitely at the border to present their asylum
cases, and has adopted a number of other pu-
nitive steps to restrict those seeking asylum
at the southern border. These actions have
forced asylum-seekers to live on the streets
or in makeshift shelters and tent cities with
abysmal living conditions, and limited ac-
cess to basic sanitation has caused outbreaks
of disease and death. This state of affairs is
a consequence of choices this administration
has made, and erecting a wall will do noth-
ing to ease the suffering of these people.
8. Redirecting funds for the claimed ‘‘national
emergency’’ will undermine U.S. national secu-
rity and foreign policy interests. In the face of
a nonexistent threat, redirecting funds for
the construction of a wall along the southern
border will undermine national security by
needlessly pulling resources from Depart-
ment of Defense programs that are respon-
sible for keeping our troops and our country
safe and running effectively.
a. Repurposing funds from the defense con-
struction budget will drain money from crit-
ical defense infrastructure projects, possibly
including improvement of military hospitals,
construction of roads, and renovation of on-
base housing. And the proclamation will
likely continue to divert those armed forces
already deployed at the southern border
from their usual training activities or mis-
sions, affecting troop readiness.
b. In addition, the administration’s unilat-
eral, provocative actions are heightening
tensions with our neighbors to the south, at
a moment when we need their help to ad-
dress a range of Western Hemisphere con-
cerns. These actions are placing friendly
governments to the south under impossible
pressures and driving partners away. They
have especially strained our diplomatic rela-
tionship with Mexico, a relationship that is
vital to regional efforts ranging from critical
intelligence and law enforcement partner-
ships to cooperative efforts to address the
growing tensions with Venezuela. Addition-
ally, the proclamation could well lead to the

degradation of the natural environment in a
manner that could only contribute to long-
term socioeconomic and security challenges.
c. Finally, by declaring a national emer-
gency for domestic political reasons with no
compelling reason or justification from his
senior intelligence and law enforcement offi-
cials, the President has further eroded his
credibility with foreign leaders, both friend
and foe. Should a genuine foreign crisis
erupt, this lack of credibility will materially
weaken this administration’s ability to mar-
shal allies to support the United States, and
will embolden adversaries to oppose us.
9. The situation at the border does not require
the use of the armed forces, and a wall is unnec-
essary to support the use of the armed forces.
We understand that the administration is
also claiming that the situation at the
southern border ‘‘requires use of the armed
forces,’’ and that a wall is ‘‘necessary to sup-
port such use’’ of the armed forces. These
claims are implausible.
a. Historically, our country has deployed
National Guard troops at the border solely
to assist the Border Patrol when there was
an extremely high number of apprehensions,
together with a particularly low number of
Border Patrol agents. But currently, even
with retention and recruitment challenges,
the Border Patrol is at historically high
staffing and funding levels, and apprehen-
sions—measured in both absolute and per-
agent terms—are near historic lows.
b. Furthermore, the composition of south-
ern border crossings has shifted such that
families and unaccompanied minors now ac-
count for the majority of immigrants seek-
ing entry at the southern border; these indi-
viduals do not present a threat that would
need to be countered with military force.
c. Just last month, when asked what the
military is doing at the border that couldn’t
be done by the Department of Homeland Se-
curity if it had the funding for it, a top-level
defense official responded, ‘‘[n] one of the ca-
pabilities that we are providing [at the
southern border] are combat capabilities. It’s
not a war zone along the border.’’ Finally, it
is implausible that hundreds of miles of wall
across the southern border are somehow nec-
essary to support the use of armed forces. We
are aware of no military- or security-related
rationale that could remotely justify such an
endeavor.
10. There is no basis for circumventing the ap-
propriations process with a declaration of a na-
tional emergency at the southern border. We do
not deny that our nation faces real immigra-
tion and national security challenges. But as
the foregoing demonstrates, these challenges
demand a thoughtful, evidence-based strat-
egy, not a manufactured crisis that rests on
falsehoods and fearmongering. In a briefing
before the Senate Intelligence Committee on
January 29, 2019, less than one month before
the Presidential Proclamation, the Directors
of the CIA, DNI, FBI, and NSA testified
about numerous serious current threats to
U.S. national security, but none of the offi-
cials identified a security crisis at the U.S.-
Mexico border. In a briefing before the House
Armed Services Committee the next day,
Pentagon officials acknowledged that the
2018 National Defense Strategy does not
identify the southern border as a security
threat. Leading legislators with access to
classified information the President’s own
statements have strongly suggested, if not
confirmed, that there is no evidence sup-
porting the administration’s claims of an
emergency. And it is reported that the Presi-
dent made the decision to circumvent the ap-
propriations process and reprogram money
without the Acting Secretary of Defense
having even started to consider where the
funds might come from, suggesting an ab-
sence of consultation and internal delibera-
tions that in our experience are necessary
and expected before taking a decision of this
magnitude.
11. For all of the foregoing reasons, in our
professional opinion, there is no factual basis
for the declaration of a national emergency
for the purpose of circumventing the appro-
priations process and reprogramming bil-
lions of dollars in funding to construct a wall
at the southern border, as directed by the
Presidential Proclamation of February 15,
2019.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the re-
ality, of course, is that apprehensions
at the southwest border have dropped
75 percent since 2000. The reality is
that many of the southern border com-
munities have violent crime rates that
are lower than our national average.
The reality is that the vast majority of
the drugs that are apprehended at the
border are seized at the ports of entry,
and a wall would do nothing to stop
this. The President is either out of
touch with reality, willfully ignoring
it, or not even reading the material he
gets from his administration.
Presidents do have emergency pow-
ers, but they should be invoked only in
true times of crises. It is an abuse of
power to invoke these authorities sim-
ply as a political step to energize a
President’s base. It is an abuse of
power to invoke these authorities to
fulfill a cynical campaign promise he
never should have made. The President
knew he would never keep his word or
the promise he had made that Mexico
would pay for this border wall.
When Congress enacted the National
Emergencies Act of 1976 to convey
these powers to the President, it as-
sumed whoever sat in the Oval Office
would have enough respect for the of-
fice and the power being conveyed not
to abuse it. President Trump has failed
that test. Since 1976, Presidents of the
United States—Republicans and Demo-
crats alike—have upheld and passed
the test. President Trump has failed
the test. Look what he wants to do.
The President wants to raid money
that is meant for military housing and
military base improvements to pay for
his wall. This is at a time when studies
are coming out that show how our men
and women in the military are being
housed in inferior or dangerous condi-
tions. Sometimes the buildings have
mold and decay, and it affects their
health. The buildings are rat invested
and roach infested, but the President
wants to take the money away from
them to build a wall that we do not
need. The President has repeatedly de-
cried the amount of drugs coming
across our border. But now he wants to
raid money that Congress has appro-
priated for proven drug programs and
counter-drug programs to pay for his
wall.
Let me repeat that. In order to build
a wall that would do very little to stop
drugs from coming across our border,
President Trump wants to take money
away from law enforcement programs
that actually prevent drugs from com-
ing across our border or from programs
that enhance military readiness. I wish
I were making this up. It sounds like
something you hear on a comedy pro-
gram, but it is not comedy, it is re-
ality, and I have to ask, what is going
on?
In the days and weeks ahead, the
President’s emergency declaration—
which amounts to an end run around
both the Constitution and Congress—is
going to be challenged, and it should
be. Over the past 2 years, we have seen
the erosion of our institutional checks
and balances in the face of creeping
authoritarianism. The time has come
for Congress and members of the Presi-
dent’s own party to take a stand. Are
we a democracy, or are we an authori-
tarian government? It is a pretty basic
question.
I have been here with every President
since President Gerald Ford. They
upheld the Constitution, Republicans
and Democrats, and they believed in
the separation of power. All of them
did. We simply cannot afford to now re-
main silent in the face of such an un-
precedented violation of the separation
of powers.
It is interesting. As I sit here, I re-
member some of my Republican
friends—and they are my friends—when
President Obama was President. They
shouted from every rooftop about the
lurches of an imperial Presidency. In
every Executive order, they saw a
threat to Congress’s power. In every
speech, they surmised the machina-
tions of a lawless strong man—a man
Donald Trump claimed wasn’t born in
the United States. Now, when they are
faced with a President who is literally
using his Executive powers to fund
what Congress specifically would not,
my Republican friends should echo the
same concerns.
I am glad that some in the Repub-
lican Party have begun expressing
their reservations about President
Trump’s national emergency declara-
tion. Certainly a number of Repub-
licans who serve in national security
positions who signed on to the material

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1456 February 26, 2019
I have put in the RECORD did. But fleet-
ing comments to reporters in the hall-
way are meaningless unless they are
willing to follow up their words with
their votes.
Today, the House will vote to dis-
approve the President’s declaration. I
believe that joint resolution of dis-
approval will pass the House. In short
order, the Senate will have to vote on
it. That is going to be the true test.
That will be the metric history uses to
determine whether Republicans are
willing to put our country, our Con-
stitution, and Congress itself over
party.
While the President’s emergency dec-
laration stumbles its way through the
courts, I hope my Republican friends
take a moment to take stock of where
we are. President Trump will be just a
blip in our Nation’s history. But for the
sake of appeasing a man who hundreds
of times made a foolish campaign
promise, never grounded in reality, will
they forever change the course of the
separation of powers in our country?
For the sake of appeasing a President
who detests any limits or checks on his
authority, will they forever diminish
the role of Congress as a coequal
branch of government? We are the
longest surviving democracy on Earth
today because there are checks and
balances.
I am reminded of words of caution
written by George Washington, our
Founding Father and our Nation’s first
President, in his Farewell Address. The
words are as true today, and we read
this Farewell Address every year on
the floor of the Senate. Here is what
President Washington wrote over 223
years ago:
It is important, likewise, that the habits of
thinking in a free Country should inspire
caution in those entrusted with its adminis-
tration, to confine themselves within their
respective Constitutional spheres; avoiding
in the exercise of the Powers of one depart-
ment to encroach upon another. The spirit of
encroachment tends to consolidate the pow-
ers of all the departments in one, and thus to
create whatever the form of government, a
real despotism. . . . If in the opinion of the
People, the distribution or modification of
the Constitutional powers be in any par-
ticular wrong, let it be corrected by an
amendment in the way which the Constitu-
tion designates. But let there be no change
by usurpation; for though this, in one in-
stance, may be the instrument of good, it is
the customary weapon by which free govern-
ments are destroyed.
That is what George Washington
said. He warned us against despots. Re-
member, this was a man who could
have remained President for life, and
he voluntarily stepped down after a
second term. He was a man who did
that because he wanted democracy to
thrive.
He spoke of the three coequal
branches of government—the execu-
tive, the legislative, and the judici-
ary—and he was reminding us that if
you let one encroach upon the other,
you start down the path of despotism.
We don’t need that in this country, es-
pecially in this age. We don’t.
We know what despots are like. We
see them around the world. We see
them in South America today, in one
country in particular. We see them in
North Korea, where the despot had his
uncle executed, his own brother mur-
dered, and thousands of people are im-
prisoned, starved, and dying. A despot
who continues to build nuclear weap-
ons to keep himself in power even as
his people die of starvation. In a de-
mocracy, that doesn’t happen. We have
checks and balances for a reason.
I am going to vote aye on this joint
resolution of disapproval. I urge all
Senators to do the same. Have checks
and balances.
I remind the President to treat emer-
gency declarations the same way they
have been treated since 1976, the way—
certainly in my experience—Presidents
Ford, Carter, Reagan, both Bushes,
Clinton, and Obama did. That pre-
served democracy. Was it frustrating
to each of them at times? Of course it
was. I remember long discussions with
President Ford, President Carter,
President Reagan, President George H.
W. Bush, President George W. Bush,
President Clinton, and President
Obama. They would say: We want to do
this. A number of us had to say: You
don’t have the authority to do that.
And they realized that.
It is not the person who holds the of-
fice. It is not the Presiding Officer. It
is not me. It is not the other 98 Mem-
bers of this body. It is not the Presi-
dent of the United States. It is not the
Members of the House. It is not the
members of the courts. What rules this
country is our Constitution. We are a
democracy. We must keep it as a de-
mocracy. Look what happens in those
countries where they ignore democracy
and have despots. In Venezuela, people
are going without food and medicine.
In the Philippines, where there is a des-
pot, there have been murders of people
who are just under suspicion, encour-
aged by him. We have seen the deaths
of thousands of people in North Korea
because of a despot who does not care
and has no sense of morality.
America is so much better. Follow
our Constitution. Obey our Constitu-
tion. Realize there are checks and bal-
ances. Have both Republicans and
Democrats stand up and join. Remem-
ber what George Washington said. It
was good advice back then; it is good
advice today.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr.
President, I ask unanimous consent
that the order for the quorum call be
rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
S. 311
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr.
President, I was necessarily absent
from yesterday evening’s vote on clo-
ture on the motion to proceed to S. 311,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act. On vote No. 27, had I been
present, I would have been a yea vote
on the motion to invoke cloture.
Let me say that a little differently.
As I sat, waiting for my plane to leave
Charleston, SC, to come to the Na-
tion’s Capital—a trip that typically
takes about 63 minutes—3 hours later,
I had not yet arrived in Washington,
DC.
On a vote that, to me, should not be
a vote at all—this should be common
sense, but it certainly was not common
sense, so we had to have a vote on an
issue that is very near and dear to my
heart.
I will say without any question that
the frustration I felt at being late to
that vote was one that was incredibly
irritating and infuriating. I had
planned to be on the floor of the Senate
voting yes on a commonsense piece of
legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion
Survivors Protection Act, but was un-
able to make it because a 1-hour flight
took more than 3 hours, and I arrived
here about 4 minutes after the close of
the vote, which also is quite frus-
trating.
But what is even more frustrating
than that is that in a nation of good
conscience, we would be debating and
having a conversation about a child
who is born, sitting there, alive, sepa-
rated from her mother, that there
would be a question of whether that
child should be able to continue to live.
This is an issue that has been raised
by people coming out of New York and
more recently by people coming out of
Virginia and by the Governor—who
happens to be, from my understanding,
a pediatric surgeon—who suggested it
is OK to allow that child to die.
Whether you are pro-life, as I am, or
pro-choice, as others, I cannot imagine
that this would even be an issue of de-
bate or discussion between the two
sides. There is no side on this topic.
There cannot be a side about life sepa-
rated from the mother and whether
that life should continue to live. This
is common sense. This is human de-
cency. This is not an issue of being pro-
life or pro-choice. This is being pro-
child, which we all should be.
So I find myself at a loss for words,
standing on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate—where a vote yesterday failed by
several votes—having to discuss what
doesn’t make sense.
I have recently spoken to a group in
Charleston, SC, during Black History
Month, where the GOP and African
Americans were in the same room hav-
ing a great conversation about the
issues that are important to our Na-
tion. We talked about so many of the
powerful issues of economic oppor-
tunity and opportunity zones. There
may have been some disagreement on
whether we should have higher taxes or
lower taxes, but there was no disagree-
ment on the issue of infanticide. There
was no disagreement whatsoever. In

or to the right, there was one thing
that was common, and that was the
value of life.
I traveled to Little Rock, AR, this
weekend to speak at another Black
History Month event, where Repub-
licans and Democrats were coming to-
gether at the Governor’s Mansion to
have a conversation about moving this
Nation forward and about reconcili-
ation. In the room, we had conversa-
tions about the tragedies in Virginia,
from the blackface tragedy to the
issues with the three ranking members
in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
When I started talking about the value
of human life, the intrinsic value of
each human being, there was 100 per-
cent support that we are a nation that
should always value the life of a born-
alive child. There was not a single dis-
sent in a room of nearly 400 people.
To have to have a debate on the floor
of the Senate about something that
every American with whom I have spo-
ken, in airports or at events, agrees
there is nothing to debate, frustrates
me. So while I am saddened and frus-
trated, I have been encouraged by my
fellow Americans—from Arkansas to
South Carolina, to Tennessee—who
have all come to the same conclusion,
and that is that a born-alive child de-
serves to live.
We may disagree on other points, but
this is a place where there is universal
agreement with the folks I have spoken
to. These are folks who don’t vote for
Republicans or Democrats; they all
vote for children. They all vote for life.
We are a nation that must continue
to value life. For some reason, some-
how, this body missed that opportunity
to reinforce that value system before
the American public, to say to each
child born: No matter your State, no
matter your challenges, you have in-
trinsic value.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRUZ). The Senator from Washington.
NOMINATION OF ERIC D. MILLER
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I
rise in opposition to a nomination we
are going to be vote on very soon—the
confirmation of Eric Miller to serve on
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.
As a U.S. Senator, I take my obliga-
tion to advise and consent on judicial
nominations very seriously, and I be-
lieve Mr. Miller’s confirmation process
has gone against longstanding Senate
tradition and norms and limited our
role to advise and consent on his nomi-
nation.
This nomination has proceeded over
the objection of both myself and my
colleague from Washington, Senator
MURRAY. For more than 100 years, con-
ferring with Senators and allowing
them to advise and consent on judicial
nominees in their home State has been
our process.
Since 1936, only eight judges have
been confirmed when one home State
Senator objected. In every case, con-
firmed nominees have been supported
by at least one Senator from the nomi-
nee’s State, and to this day no circuit
court judge has ever been confirmed
despite opposition from their home
State Senators. All that would change
if Mr. Miller is confirmed.
His confirmation hearing was held
during a recess last Congress, when the
vast majority of Senators were back in
their States. In fact, only two Members
of the U.S. Senate were present at the
hearing, and neither one of them were
Democrats. Mr. Miller was questioned
for less than 5 minutes—5 minutes—
and when the Judiciary Committee
Democrats requested another hearing,
that request was rejected.
Confirming Mr. Miller without a full
vetting by both Democrats and Repub-
licans is the wrong way to proceed on a
lifetime appointment. Moreover, con-
firming Mr. Miller without approval
from Senator MURRAY and I would set
a damaging precedent.
I do have concerns about Eric Mil-
ler’s record. He has spent much of his
career fighting against the interests of
Tribal governments and Tribal sov-
ereignty. He has argued cases opposing
Tribal fishing rights, challenging Trib-
al sovereignty, and fighting against the
protection of Native American reli-
gious and traditional practices, so it is
no surprise that organizations rep-
resenting all 573 Tribal nations around
the United States, including the Na-
tional Congress of American Indians,
oppose Mr. Miller’s confirmation.
I urge my colleagues to stop this
process and oppose Mr. Miller’s con-
firmation to the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals.
S. 47
Mr. President, I also want to com-
ment on upcoming action in the House,
where they are scheduled to take up S.
47, the Murkowski-Cantwell lands
package later this afternoon, which re-
ceived 92 votes in the Senate earlier
this month.
It is my hope that the House will ap-
prove this bill with the same over-
whelming that it received in the Sen-
ate, and send this legislation quickly
to President Trump’s desk.
I want to take a moment to empha-
size four important provisions of this
legislation as we prepare for this year’s
upcoming fire season.
This legislation includes four provi-
sions that will help firefighters im-
prove their safety and effectiveness and
bring state-of-the-art technology to
combating wildfires. These provisions
will help firefighters and communities,
and we need to do everything we can as
we face longer fire seasons having more
catastrophic events. We need to give
communities and firefighters every
tool possible.
First, this legislation allows for the
use of drones to create real-time fire
mapping, as well as GPS to track fire-
fighter crews. These advances will help
enable real-time tracking and location
of both the fire and the firefighters.
Why is this so important? It is be-
cause our firefighters need real-time
data to do their job more safely and ef-
fectively. The combination of real-time
mapping and GPS locaters has been re-
ferred to by the industry as the ‘‘Holy
Grail of Wildland Firefighter Safety.’’
Last month’s report on the dev-
astating Mendocino Complex fire shows
why this is the case. According to this
report, one of the challenges frontline
firefighters had to face was the fact
that they weren’t sure exactly where
the fire was. The safety officers didn’t
always know where the firefighters are.
In one case, no one knew where six en-
trapped firefighters were. The result
was that all six suffered injuries be-
cause it took quite a while to locate
and rescue them.
Under this legislation that will be
voted on by the House today, we will
have more drones orbiting high over
the fires, constantly updating fire
maps and doing it more than just once
a day, which has been the standard
until now. These drones employ infra-
red cameras that can penetrate
through thick smoke and better iden-
tify hotspots. Air tankers will be able
to more accurately drop their fuel
retardants, and we can tell firefighters
on the frontlines how to steer away
from areas that are just too dangerous
to tackle.
When I heard the stories of brave
firefighters who battled fire that raged
in many parts of my State, I knew we
needed to do more to protect these un-
believable heroes. Whether it is in
Eastern Washington or Central Wash-
ington—in the Okanagon and
Wenatchee forests or around Spokane—
we have to do more to help those com-
munities and firefighters who are put-
ting themselves on the line for us.
This legislation also allows the For-
est Service to access NASA’s mapping
technology to help prevent mudslides
that are all too common after these
horrific fires. We all know erosion can
happen shortly after the devastation of
vegetation, and that creates more dam-
age in the community. The fact that
we will be getting NASA access, we
will then be able to come up with strat-
egies to prevent erosion, cutting the
time significantly from where it is
today.
The fourth provision is improving
smoke forecasting by assigning mete-
orologists to every large fire. I know
some people are thinking this probably
has already been done. Believe me, we
haven’t given the Forest Service every
tool it needs.
Over the last few years, summers in
the Puget Sound region have suffered
as fires have blanketed our normally
pristine air with smoke and unhealthy
air. We know this is becoming a new
normal. As the Western United States
continues to become hotter and drier,
fires become more and more likely, and
as the fuels get drier, the number of
fires increase and get even bigger.
This isn’t just an Eastern Wash-
ington problem. Our Washington State
Department of Natural Resources re-
sponded to 1,800 fires last year, and 40

percent of those were in Western Wash-
ington. According to researchers at the
University of Washington, just 20 years
from now, we will see the median an-
nual burned area in the Northwest dou-
ble from what we have seen in the last
50 years.
We know we need more tools to com-
bat these challenges, and the legisla-
tion we have already passed in the Sen-
ate and that is before the House today
will provide these new technology and
training tools to empower the Forest
Service to help our communities and
our firefighters: real-time fire map-
ping, more drone technology to give us
real-time information about the fires,
using NASA data to help us plan post-
fires, and giving us more smoke fore-
casting information to better help our
communities and to deal with those
who are impacted by heavy smoke.
I hope our colleagues will act expedi-
tiously on this legislation. We know
that wildland fire funding, as we in-
creased it in an agreement last year,
was so important, but we need to keep
working on this problem.
I thank my colleague from Colorado
for helping to sponsor the inclusion of
this legislation and hope that the
President will sign this legislation very
quickly so that tools can be put in
place for this upcoming fire season.

S. 311
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, yes-
terday evening the Senate had an op-
portunity to go on record and show our
constituents that we supported the
most vulnerable among us. The Born-
Alive Abortion Survivors Protection
Act would require doctors to treat a
baby, once it is born, with ordinary
medical assistance, something they
would do under any other cir-
cumstances, even though this entailed
surviving an abortion.
If you ask the American people, they
would say this is just common sense. In
a recent poll, more than three-fourths
of Americans said they support pro-
viding medical treatment for babies
who survive abortions. I can’t imagine
what the other 25 percent are thinking.
But there are no Federal laws requiring
healthcare providers to care for these
babies just as they would any other in-
fant in their care, and for some Mem-
bers of the opposing party, they are
just fine with that.
We all know that a few weeks ago,
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam
made disturbing comments about how
to not care for certain newborns. He
was asked: What would you do with a
child with birth defects?
He said: Well, the infant would be de-
livered. The infant would be kept com-
fortable. The infant would be resusci-
tated, if that is what the mother and
the family desired, and then a discus-
sion would ensue between the physi-
cians and the mother.
Let me be clear. The Governor, who
is a pediatrician, by the way, essen-
tially advocated for infanticide—kill-
ing a child who was born alive. Instead
of saying, ‘‘well, it is my duty as a phy-
sician under the Hippocratic Oath to
provide care to save the child,’’ he be-
lieves the child ought to be made com-
fortable, and then the mother and doc-
tor sit down and decide whether the
child should live or die.
That is not healthcare. That is mur-
der. I believe the Senate has a duty to
act and ensure that no child born alive
is subjected to the treatment described
by Governor Northam.
The bill we voted on last night would
protect newborns who have survived
abortions and ensure that they receive
the same level of care that any other
newborn baby would. It builds upon a
previous law, which the Senate passed
unanimously, called the Born-Alive In-
fant Protection Act. That bill passed
unanimously in 2002, and it clarified
that every infant born alive at any
stage of development is a person, re-
gardless of the manner in which they
were born. Yet yesterday, 44 Senators
voted to allow that same person’s life
to be ended with impunity.
The legislation we voted on yester-
day would simply clarify that the in-
fants who survive abortions are enti-
tled to the same lifesaving care that
other babies should receive. That is
why it is so shocking to me that 44 of
our colleagues chose to vote against
even proceeding to a debate and a vote
on the matter.
I am trying to think of a historical
counterpart to this. I was reminded of
a book I read not long ago called
‘‘Eichmann in Jerusalem.’’ This is
about the trial of Adolf Eichmann after
the atrocities of the holocaust, during
which 5 million Jews were killed. The
author, Hannah Arendt, was trying to
figure out what kind of monster could
basically provide for the machinery
that ultimately would take the lives of
5 million Jews.
What she saw when she looked at
Eichmann was not some monster that
looked different from you or me. Unfor-
tunately, what she saw was somebody
who looked exactly like you and me.
She wrote about the moral collapse as-
sociated with the holocaust. She noted
that ‘‘in the Third Reich, evil lost its
distinctive characteristic by which
most people had, until then, recognized
it.’’ She said that the problem is that
at that point it became a ‘‘civil norm.’’
She wrote:
Evil comes from a failure to think. It de-
fies thought, for as soon as thought tries to
engage itself with evil and examine the
premises and principles from which it origi-
nates, it is frustrated because it finds noth-
ing there.
‘‘That,’’ she said, ‘‘is the banality of
evil.’’
She concluded by saying:
Nearly everybody who attended the trials
of mass killers after the war, some of them
respected doctors and pharmacists, came
away with the disconcerting impression that
the killers looked pretty much like you and
me.
So while Republicans and Democrats
disagree on a range of issues, this
should not be one of them. If we have
one shred of our humanity left, we
ought to agree that protecting human
life is essential. This should have been
a simple vote for every single Member
of this body. I can’t tell you how dis-
appointed I am that 44 of our col-
leagues decided to vote no. I was proud
to vote yes on the bill, yes to pro-
tecting these newborn babies, yes to
equal medical care for all infants, and
yes to life.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES
Madam President, this morning, the
Senate Finance Committee held the
second in a series of hearings on pre-
scription drug pricing. We all know
that across the country, the rising
costs of prescription drugs is placing a
strain on families.
A survey last summer found that
many Texans are struggling to afford
the rising cost of healthcare, and three
out of five people surveyed reported
foregoing or postponing care because of
the cost. That includes cutting pills in
half, skipping or rationing doses, or
not filling a prescription because they
simply can’t afford to do so. Some,
though, are taking even more drastic
steps.
Last year, a widow in Austin consid-
ered selling her house to pay for the ex-
pensive drugs she needed to treat hepa-
titis C, which had killed her husband
years earlier. Many Texas families
have begun the dangerous practice of
buying their drugs in Mexico—even
though they may be counterfeit—be-
cause they think they are more afford-
able than filling a prescription in the
United States.
With healthcare costs continuing to
press more and more of our hard-work-
ing families, things aren’t expected to
get any easier any time soon. The Cen-
ters for Medicare and Medicaid Serv-
ices estimated that between 2018 and
2027, consumers could expect to see pre-
scription drug spending increase by an
average of 6.1 percent a year. That is a

faster increase than hospital stays,
doctors’ visits, or any other cost in the
healthcare sector.
This spending doesn’t just have an
impact on patients. It accounts for a
large portion of our national economy.
In 2017, the national health expendi-
tures totaled $3.5 trillion. That is 18
percent of our gross domestic product.
Prescription drugs account for 10 per-
cent of our total health expenditures,
more than $330 billion. They have an
impact on our entire country.
The Senate Finance Committee is
digging into the reason behind those
rising costs. The journey a drug takes
from research and development to the
manufacturing plant, to pharmacy
shelves, and to our medicine cabinet is
enormously complicated. I wonder
whether it is complicated by design.
Once a consumer has purchased a drug,
figuring out who gets each dollar spent
practically requires the forensic skills
of a Sherlock Holmes.
What I find particularly concerning,
and something we spoke about at
length today, are the rebates and other
discounts provided by manufacturers.
Pricing from one pharmacy to another
can be wildly inconsistent, and rebates
are often the root of the problem. In
another context, what is now called a
rebate might be called a kickback. Re-
bates are the key to determining if a
particular drug is covered by your in-
surance, and that can impact therapies
that you have access to. Despite the
impact they have, the terms of rebates
are mostly cloaked in secrecy. I don’t
think that is an accident. If you ask
pharmacy benefit managers and plans
about rebates, they will argue that
overall they are a good thing and can
help lower insurance premiums across
the board. The issue, though, is that
the extra money has to come from
somewhere. So list prices are often
raised to cover the difference. When
that happens, the consumers are the
ones who take the hit. For everything
you pay within your deductible—and
many deductibles in this post-Afford-
able Care Act era are up in the thou-
sands of dollars—you pay 100 percent of
the retail cost. You get zero benefit
from the rebate. As the list price goes
up, your out-of-pocket costs go up.
That is why the stories of families
struggling to cover costs are becoming
more and more prevalent.
Some of the people who suffer the
most from the rebate system are people
who take insulin. Diabetes is one of the
most common and pernicious illnesses
in our healthcare system in America
today. Because we eat too well and ex-
ercise too little, many people develop
diabetes, and the only treatment is to
take insulin. Unlike most of the pre-
scription drugs out there, insulin is a
biologic, meaning it is generally more
expensive to make and more expensive
to buy.
A few weeks ago, I spoke here on the
Senate floor about a woman from Indi-
ana who came to the first hearing we
had on prescription drug costs, Kathy
Sego. She told us about her family’s
struggle to pay for her adult son’s insu-
lin. Even though this drug has been
around for nearly a century, a 1-month
supply for Kathy’s son Hunter costs her
family $1,700 out of pocket.
Unlike many brand-name prescrip-
tion drugs that have lower-cost alter-
natives, like a generic, insulin does
not. Part of our discussion at today’s
hearing was the topic of ‘‘biosimilars,’’
or what could be considered a generic
version of a biologic type of drug. As
the FDA is moving to make insulin
subject to biologic competition in the
future, I asked our witnesses about this
move and how it could potentially
serve as a solution for families like
Kathy’s, who struggle with the out-of-
pocket costs and copays as a result of
the insulin with which they treat their
diabetes.
As part of that effort, last week,
Chairman GRASSLEY and Ranking
Member WYDEN launched a bipartisan
investigation into insulin prices. In let-
ters to leading insulin manufacturers,
they requested information on the re-
cent price increases—some as high as
585 percent.
As I expressed today to one of the
representatives from the drug com-
pany, I understand the need for drug
companies to do research and develop-
ment and that because they are grant-
ed patents for these innovative cures
that they come up with, they have the
exclusive right to sell those drugs dur-
ing the terms of the patents. Yet I
don’t understand why a drug that has
been around for decades, like insulin,
still costs $1,700 for somebody to pay
each month on an out-of-pocket basis,
and where we have seen recent price in-
creases as high as 585 percent, it makes
absolutely zero sense to me. I am eager
to hear from these manufacturers and
other players in the pharmaceutical
system about why these prices are ris-
ing so rapidly and how we, in working
together, can provide relief to families
who bear the brunt of manufacturers’
decisions.
I conclude by saying that I also had
an interesting conversation with one of
the witnesses from the drug companies,
the manufacturer of HUMIRA.
HUMIRA is one of the best-selling
drugs in the world for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis and other things.
The company that makes HUMIRA
earns $18 billion a year in revenue from
the sale of HUMIRA. When I asked why
it was necessary for the company to
have more than 100 different patents to
cover that drug when the drug is essen-
tially the same molecule, the gen-
tleman representing the drug company
did not give me a satisfactory answer.
I can understand the importance of
recouping those R&D costs and the
benefits of providing a patent for a rea-
sonable period of time to recoup those
costs and make a profit. I am OK with
that. Yet, when you see the patent sys-
tem being manipulated in a way that
maintains that exclusive right to sell
that best-selling drug by a drug com-
pany, that causes me grave concern. I
have talked to Chairman GRAHAM of
the Judiciary Committee, which has
jurisdiction over patent-related issues,
and he told me he would work with me
to find a solution to gaming the patent
system in order to protect that exclu-
sive right to sell a drug beyond the
normal patent period because it is, ul-
timately, the consumers who are being
cheated and being denied access to the
lower cost drugs.
As with insulin, there is no good rea-
son why, after all of these years, con-
sumers have to see price increases ap-
proaching 585 percent. We need answers
to those questions, and we will get an-
swers to those questions.
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF ERIC D. MILLER
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I
rise in opposition to the pending nomi-
nation of Eric Miller to serve on the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in a
seat based out of the State of Wash-
ington.
If the Senate chooses to confirm Mr.
Miller, it will be a historic decision be-
cause it will be the first time ever
since the introduction of blue slips
over 100 years ago that the Senate has
confirmed a nominee who is not sup-
ported by either of the home State
Senators from the State in which he
will be seated.
What is a blue slip? It is basically a
consultation with the Senate before we
move forward on a nomination. It is a
courtesy that has been extended. It is
an effort to try to find some common
ground, some understanding, perhaps
some moderation when it comes to the
choice of nominees. It has been abused
in some cases, but the two Senators
here—Senator CANTWELL and Senator
MURRAY—are well known in this body
for being reasonable people who try to
find solutions to problems and work
well with both sides of the aisle. Yet,
in this case, the Trump White House
has decided that they are going to push
this nominee for the Ninth Circuit in
their home State of Washington
against their wishes. If Mr. Miller is
confirmed, we will have taken away
yet another guardrail in the Senate ad-
vice and consent process.
If you follow what has happened in
the Senate over the last 2 years and a
few months, you know that the highest
single priority of Senator MCCON-
NELL’s—the Republican leader—is to
fill the Federal judgeships, to put in
place men and women who will serve
literally for a lifetime, as long as they
live. He is determined to do it. There is

acceptable. If you have been a law

clerk for Clarence Thomas, you check
the box, you are ready to go—a lifetime
appointment. If the Federalist Society
decides you are the right person for the
Supreme Court of the United States,
box checked, off we go.
Instead of relying on common sense,
moderation, and judgment, we are
going through a formula here to put
people on the bench for a lifetime—
those who have been approved on the
Republican side of the aisle. Make no
mistake—under Democratic Presi-
dents, we look to nominees who are
closer to our value system, for sure,
but we never walked away from the
blue slip process until this nominee—
the first time ever it has been done.
We have seen so many things change
under the Republican leadership in the
Senate when it comes to the selection
of judges.
We used to say that if you are found
unqualified—not qualified—by the
American Bar Association, forget it.
Go about your business. Do something
else. We are not going to put you on
the bench for life. Well, we have de-
cided, under the Republican leadership,
that is no longer the case. Simply
being unqualified is not enough to dis-
qualify you.
We have also said that when it comes
to the process of making these deci-
sions, we will have hearings where we
will consider multiple candidates in
the same day. Let’s run them through.
Of course, you know what happens
when you do that: You get in a hurry,
and you end up putting people on the
bench for life who shouldn’t be there.
We have also decided in this White
House that we will send people off to be
Federal judges who have never been in
a courtroom in their lives—not once.
Maybe they watched ‘‘Perry Mason’’ on
some retro channel, but that is about
as good as it ever was for some of
them.
I recall one of the nominees from the
Trump White House. It was a moment
in the history of the Senate Judiciary
Committee. Senator JOHN KENNEDY of
Louisiana asked him some basic ques-
tions about what it meant to be a judge
and some of the things he would have
to rule on. It was a sad moment. It re-
minded me of my worst days in law
school when I didn’t know the answers
to the test or to the question being
asked by the professor. This nominee,
thankfully, withdrew. He never should
have been nominated.
In this case, when it comes to Mr.
Miller, neither of the Washington Sen-
ators returned a blue slip on him, and
they have a reason. He is 43 years old;
he may serve on the bench for three
decades or more. In his relatively short
legal career, he has demonstrated that
his views are far outside the legal
mainstream, particularly when it
comes to one legal issue—the issue in-
volving Indian Tribes.
I don’t know if you watched the Os-
cars, but I did, and I was watching for
a movie that I saw that I was im-
pressed with. It was called ‘‘Roma.’’ It
was a movie about Mexico. It received
quite a few awards, and I thought it de-
served them. It raised some painful
questions for people living in Mexico. I
know because I have spoken to Mexi-
can Parliamentarians at a dinner a few
weeks ago. It is the treatment of indig-
enous people.
Most countries in the world, includ-
ing the United States, haven’t written
a very admirable record when it comes
to the treatment of people who were
here before we ‘‘arrived.’’ What we
have done to Native Americans in this
country, sadly, is nothing to brag
about. They were dispossessed, relo-
cated for their lands, and many times
treated in the poorest possible fashion.
The movie ‘‘Roma’’ was about indige-
nous people of Mexico who are serv-
ants, and some would say slaves, to
families who have more money in Mex-
ico. So the question of the treatment of
Native Americans is not something
that we can just push back in the pages
of history; it still confronts us in the
United States today, as it does in other
countries, like Mexico and Australia
and so many others.
So what does this have to do with
this nominee? It turns out that in a
rare moment, the National Congress of
American Indians weighed in against
Eric Miller for this circuit court nomi-
nation. The National Congress of
American Indians opposed his nomina-
tion. Here is what they wrote in a let-
ter to the Judiciary Committee, and I
want to quote it in its substance:
Our concern is that he chose to build a law
practice on mounting repeated challenges to
tribal sovereignty, lands, religious freedom,
and the core attribute of federal recognition
of tribal existence. His advocacy has focused
on undermining the rights of Indian tribes,
often taking extreme positions and using
pejorative language to denigrate tribal
rights. Indeed, his law firm website touts his
record, with over half of his private practice
achievements coming at the expense of trib-
al governments. Given his strong preference
for clients who oppose tribes, there are con-
siderable questions about whether he would
be fair in hearing cases regarding tribal
rights.
You might say to yourself: Well, that
has to be a narrow area of the law—
Tribal rights—and if he happens to con-
sistently get that wrong, how impor-
tant could it be?
Take a look at the fact that he has
aspired to be a nominee to the circuit
court—the second highest court in the
land—in the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth
Circuit includes 427 of the 573 federally
recognized Tribal nations of America.
That circuit he aspires to for a lifetime
appointment hears more cases involv-
ing Tribal issues than any other Fed-
eral circuit. It is deeply troubling to
see a Ninth Circuit nominee whose im-
partiality on Tribal legal matters is in
question.
Mr. Miller’s nomination is opposed
by not only the National Congress of
American Indians; he is also opposed
by a broad array of civil rights, envi-
ronmental, labor, and other organiza-
tions that are concerned about his
record and legal views. He is 43 years
old—43 years old—three more decades
to hand down decisions.
It is astonishing that the Senate
would vote to confirm a nominee this
controversial over the objection of
home State Senators and to break a
century-old tradition in the Senate to
do it. These Senators represent mil-
lions of people in the State of Wash-
ington. Their good judgment has been
recognized by election and reelection.
But when it comes to having a voice in
the selection of a circuit court nomi-
nee who will be serving their State for
the next three decades, they have been
shunned and pushed aside.
I think the Republican majority is
making a mistake. They are so bound
and determined to fill these vacancies
that they are abandoning basic Senate
traditions—which, in fact, will slow
things down from time to time, I am
ready to admit, but also put at least a
note of caution into a critical judg-
ment process.
Blue slips encourage consensus and
cooperation between the Senate and
the White House. There isn’t a single
one of us serving in the Senate who
hasn’t counted on that cooperation to
make sure that lifetime appointments
to the Federal judiciary are people who
can stand the test of time. Although
they may not agree with any Senator
every single time, they bring judg-
ment, experience, balance, and modera-
tion to their service. Blue slips ensure
that the voices of the American people,
through their Senators, are heard in
this process, and they help steer the
nomination process toward the middle
of the road. Without blue slips, the
White House can ignore home State in-
terests and pick extreme judges who do
not have the confidence of that State’s
legal community.
This decision—for the first time in a
century—to abandon blue slips for the
sake of putting this man in a lifetime
position on the circuit bench could af-
fect every one of our States someday. I
can’t understand why my Republican
colleagues want to diminish their au-
thority, their ability to safeguard
against judges who should not be ap-
pointed for life. That is what we are
doing on the vote to confirm Eric Mil-
ler to the Ninth Circuit.
I will oppose his nomination. I urge
my colleagues to do the same, if for no
other reason, so that when the time
comes—if it ever comes—that you ask
for the respect of this body when it
comes to the selection of an important
Federal judge, you will receive it re-
gardless of who the President may be.
Madam President, I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1461
February 26, 2019
Texas celebrates the 183rd anniversary
of its independence from Mexico.
Texas became a free republic—for 9
years our own nation—and soon after
became one of these United States.
As is tradition, in commemoration of
the brave Texans who fought and died
for liberty and the rule of law, let us
reflect a moment on the immortal
words of Colonel William Travis, the
leader of the besieged forces at the
Alamo. His clarion call for reinforce-
ments resounded around Texas and
still rings with strength today.
Indeed, it has a special place in my
heart because the very first time I
spoke on this Senate floor, I read from
Travis’s letter from the Alamo. It was
during Senator RAND PAUL’s extended
filibuster in defense of individual lib-
erty. It fit then, and it fits now. It is a
letter that has stood for the ages—
written to us today, demanding that we
stand with all good and free people
against oppression and reminding us
that there are some things worth dying
for.
The letter reads as follows:
Commandancy of the Alamo,
Bexar, February 24th, 1836
To the People of Texas & All Americans in
the World:
Fellow citizens & compatriots—I am be-
sieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexi-
cans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a
continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24
hours & have not lost a man.
The enemy has demanded a surrender at
discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be
put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have
answered the demand with a cannon shot, &
our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I
shall never surrender or retreat.
Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty,
of patriotism & everything dear to the Amer-
ican character, to come to our aid, with all
dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforce-
ments daily & will no doubt increase to three
or four thousand in four or five days.
If this call is neglected, I am determined to
sustain myself as long as possible & die like
a soldier who never forgets what is due to his
own honor & that of his country—Victory or
Death.
William Barret Travis
Lieutenant Colonel Commandant
P.S. The Lord is on our side—When the
enemy appeared in sight we had not three
bushels of corn—We have since found in de-
serted houses 80 or 90 bushels & got into the
walls 20 or 30 head of Beeves.

NOMINATION OF ERIC D. MILLER
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President,
there have been some days recently
when I kind of wonder why we even
show up to the Senate any longer. This
job is not what it used to be.
When I get the chance to read about
the history of the Senate, I read about
these things called debates that we
used to have on the floor of the Senate.
I read about something called an
amendment, which apparently is a way
that an individual Senator calls up a
proposal or an initiative and puts it on
the floor for an up-or-down vote.
Those things don’t really happen
anymore in the U.S. Senate. We don’t
have open-ended debates on the big
policies of the day.
I get it. When Republicans control
the Senate, they control the agenda.
When Democrats control the Senate,
they control the agenda. At the very
least, I would have hoped that the Sen-
ate majority, now in Republican hands,
would put their policy initiatives be-
fore the Senate so we could have an
open debate. That doesn’t happen any
longer. All we seem to be doing these
days is voting on judges.
Now, that is a really important func-
tion of the U.S. Senate, and I am glad
we are doing it, but today we are going
to do something truly exceptional,
which causes me, once again, to wonder
what my job here is and to feel a little
bit of sadness as to how it has changed
and how much less substantive the
input of each individual Senator is in
the direction of this country.
Today, for the first time in the his-
tory of blue slips, we are going to vote
and, I assume, confirm a judge who
didn’t get one blue slip from either of
the home State Senators from which
that judge comes from and is going to
serve.
This has never happened before. Yet
today we will vote on Eric Miller’s
nomination to be a judge on the Ninth
Circuit from Washington. He is 43 years
old, so he is going to be there for an
awfully long time.
Eric Miller did not get a blue slip
from either of Washington’s Senators.
Let me say that again. That has never
happened before in the Senate. In fact,
the last time a judge was confirmed
without both blue slips was in 1989.
That was the last time before this Con-
gress that any judge was confirmed
without both blue slips.
In that instance, it was a Democratic
chairman of the Judiciary Committee
who was confirming a judge over the
objection of another Democrat. This is
very different. These are two Demo-
cratic Senators from Washington, nei-
ther of them returning a blue slip on
Eric Miller. Yet the majority has de-
cided to go ahead and proceed with this
confirmation.
This is a serious break with prece-
dent. The last time Democrats con-
trolled the U.S. Senate, Chairman
LEAHY was the head of the Judiciary
Committee, and he did not hold a sin-
gle hearing on an Obama nominee who
did not have two blue slips—didn’t hold
a single hearing even when there were
exceptional circumstances. There was
one time when Senators initially re-
turned the blue slips but later re-
scinded them. Those are two Repub-
lican Senators who submitted them, re-
scinded them—did not go forward with
the nominee.
There was another circumstance in
which Senators had recommended a
nominee for the district court but then
refused to submit blue slips when that
judge was elevated to the appellate
court. Once again, Senator LEAHY hon-
ored that precedent.
Now Republicans have already taken
advantage of Senator LEAHY’s decision
to uphold precedent. I will just give
you a couple of examples.
In the Seventh Circuit, Michael Bren-
nan was confirmed for a seat that had
been held open by Republicans since
2010. So, had Chairman LEAHY decided
to move forward without blue slips,
that Seventh Circuit seat could have
been filled, but because he upheld tra-
dition, it was left open, filled by Re-
publicans.
Similarly, for a district seat in South
Carolina, Marvin Quattlebaum was
confirmed to a seat that had been held
open by Republicans, again, since 2013.
So Republicans have already taken
advantage of the fact that Democrats
upheld the blue-slip precedent, but now
they are taking it a step further.
In the past, when Republicans have
changed the rules here, as they did on
the number of votes required to elevate
a judge to the Supreme Court, they
claimed it was because Democrats
started it. I don’t agree with that ra-
tionale. If you found the change for dis-
trict court nominee so objectionable, I
am not sure why you would decide to
go further, but there is no excuse of
that kind here. This is just a brash
power grab because there is no claim
that Democrats, when they were in the
majority, violated the blue-slip prin-
ciple. This is a fresh violation of tradi-
tion here in the Senate.
There is a reason we give deference
to home State Senators. In these
States and in these districts, there are
particular issues that are important to
their constituents that may be unique
to their area in which they have more
knowledge than the rest of us do. Some
of the reasons Senators MURRAY and
CANTWELL are so concerned about this
nominee are his extremist views on the
issue of Tribal sovereignty, which is a
very big deal in the State of Wash-
ington, and the idea that they are
going to have somebody sitting in the
Ninth Circuit who has these extreme
views on limiting the rights of Tribes
is of great concern to their constitu-
ents. That is why, traditionally, we
have allowed for individual Senators to
have that kind of voice and that kind
of say. No longer.
I would just hope that my Republican
friends understand how this works.
Once the rule is gone, once the tradi-
tion is gone—listen, I am a relatively
junior Senator here, so I don’t want to
speak for those who are going to be the
chairman and ranking members of
committees in the future, but I would
imagine it is not coming back. I would
imagine—once we get through today
and Republicans have decided that in-
dividual Senators, unless they happen
to be a member of the majority party,

no longer have any say in who is ap-
pointed to their circuit courts—that
horse has fully run out of the barn and
across the field.
I don’t know if that is a good thing
for this body because it is just another
hit. It is just another assault on the
traditions of this place in which we
used to try to work things out to-
gether, in which we used to honor the
role that individual Senators have
some say over what happens in their
own States and their own regions.
I do sometimes wonder why we all
keep on showing up here if we don’t
really debate legislation as we used to,
if we don’t get to offer amendments
anymore, and if we don’t have any say
any longer in the judges who are ap-
pointed in our States and our districts,
and this is just another day that makes
me question that as well.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware.
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise
today to offer brief remarks on the
nomination of Eric Miller to serve on
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.
I have concerns about Mr. Miller’s
controversial record—some of his ideas
and his jurisprudence—which I have
spoken to on the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which informed my vote
against him on the committee.
But today, I want to speak about my
reservations about this body’s moving
forward with his confirmation, given
that neither of his home State Sen-
ators have returned a blue slip.
Let me briefly talk about what a blue
slip is and why it matters. It is not in
the Constitution. It was not something
imagined by the Founders. It was
something developed by the Members
of this body to put one further bumper
on the power of the President to nomi-
nate Federal judges and then for the
Senate to carry out its constitutional
advice and consent role. For a long
time, it worked fine, and I actually had
a terrific experience with the blue-slip
process. Don McGahn, as the White
House Counsel, and my senior Senator,
TOM CARPER, and I, when we had a va-
cancy—two vacancies, actually, in the
Federal district court in Delaware—
went to our local bar and asked for
them to put together a committee to
interview potential candidates.
We went to the White House Counsel
and spoke about the importance of the
Delaware district court and the process
we were following, and, in the end, out
of a very wide pool of initial candidates
and the folks who were interviewed by
a broad and nonpartisan selection com-
mittee of our local bar, we advanced
three names to the White House. The
White House picked two, and they were
ultimately nominated, and Senator
CARPER and I both returned the blue
slips on them. They proceeded. They
were both confirmed. They are now
seated as district court judges.
That is the way this ought to work.
Why does it matter? It matters because
our States are different. We are the
United States, and each of our States
has slightly different cultures, tradi-
tions, and communities. The point of
having a Senate made up of 100 rep-
resentatives of our 50 States is for each
of us to come here and carry forward
some of the values and traditions of
our States.
I am a member of the Delaware bar.
It is a bar with a great and proud tradi-
tion. It is a bar with a somewhat dif-
ferent culture—a much more collegial
culture, I would argue, than many
States around us, and it was important
to me to be able to advocate to the
President, to the White House, for the
nomination of folks who would rep-
resent the best of our bench and bar.
Look, the President and I are in dif-
ferent parties. I understand that we
will have different policy positions, but
in order to get the absolute best and
brightest of the American bar and to
have them reflect the values and prior-
ities of the State Senators are elected
from, the blue slip was developed.
We have had a difficult and divisive
and partisan period here in the Senate
for as long as I have been here. I don’t
think it is because I am here, but it has
been as long as I have been here—since
2010. We have had a number of regret-
table changes in the policies and the
practices and the culture of this place,
but proceeding with a confirmation
vote of a nominee who was not sup-
ported by either home State Senator
for a circuit court position is unprece-
dented.
I think, before we proceed, this body
should stop and reflect on what this
means for our future. In a district as
small as Delaware, it is likely the Sen-
ators actually know the nominees. In a
circuit as large as the Ninth, which is
the largest, geographically, in our
whole country, it is almost a certainty
that the Senators will not know the
judges nominated by the President to
represent their circuit.
The blue slip has long been a proce-
dural barrier to the President’s nomi-
nating people who did not reflect the
bench and bar of the States from which
they are drawn. The leader is pushing
this forward, even over several other
nominees pending on this floor.
One other piece of the process that
brought us to today to a vote on Eric
Miller’s nomination for the Ninth Cir-
cuit that is worth commenting on is
that the confirmation hearing on the
Judiciary Committee was held while
we were not in session. No Democrat
was present to question this nominee.
The questions that were raised and the
comments that were made were only in
writing and for the RECORD, and my un-
derstanding is, this questioning is very
brief—just 5 minutes before just a
handful of Republican Senators, I
think two.
This young man is going to be given
a lifetime appointment to one of the
most important judicial posts in our
country. Frankly, my own kids have to
work longer and harder and answer
more questions to get a good grade in
high school than this gentleman did in
terms of the confirmation process of
the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am
very worried about the precedent this
sets, about what it says—which is that
we continue to push past norms and
traditions in this body—and about
where we are headed.
It is my hope that some of my col-
leagues on the Judiciary Committee
will work with me in the months ahead
to recognize that there is a long, now-
bitter path of he said, she said, who
shot John, who acted first, which has
resulted in changes to the whole nomi-
nation process.
I think we can yet pull back to a
place where those who are nominated
are the best and brightest of our coun-
try, where, in the process, there are
protections for the minority and the
majority, and where we can all end up
voting proudly for those who are nomi-
nated to serve on the Federal bench of
the United States.
I increasingly hear commentators on
cable talking about judges as if you
can know how they will vote based on
the President who nominated them.
So-and-so is described as a Bush judge
or a Reagan judge or a Clinton judge or
an Obama judge, a Trump judge or a
Bush judge, as if that tells you every-
thing you need to know about a judge.
It should not.
In my State, it doesn’t, and it is my
hope that we can yet pull ourselves
back from the brink of one more step
to a place where our judges are seen
not as the black-robed individuals dis-
pensing independent justice but as
folks wearing blue and red jerseys ad-
vancing a partisan political agenda.
That way lies disaster for our constitu-
tional Republic.
Both parties have taken steps that
have led us here. Both parties need to
take steps that will heal this, and I in-
tend to vote against the nomination of
Mr. Miller because of my concerns
about these procedural changes that I
think are so destructive.
I yield the floor.

DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. TILLIS. Well, ladies and gentle-

think some people consider to be un-
popular—particularly some of my
friends back in my State—that I
thought I would come back and ex-
plain. It has to do with the President’s
Executive action. It also has to do with
communicating an important and som-
ber subject.
There is a crisis at the border. I have
been there. I didn’t read about it. I
didn’t watch it on TV. I didn’t read a
tweet about it. I invested time down

there, hours and hours with border se-
curity. I was on shallow draft boats. I
was on horseback. I have been on
ATVs. I spent a lot of time down at the
border, and the one thing I will tell you
is that the President is absolutely
right. There is a crisis on the border—
and not only on the southern border,
but I will state that ranchers on the
northern border also believe they have
challenges that this President is right
to address.
I also happen to agree with a good
portion of how the President is going
to do it after Congress failed to do its
job. Keep in mind that over the last
year, we have had on this floor Demo-
crats and Republicans voting for as
much as $25 billion for border secu-
rity—Democrats and Republicans—and
now we are fighting over a fraction of
that.
The President needs to act. He got an
appropriation of about $1.5 billion
through the negotiated settlement a
couple of weeks ago, and now he is tak-
ing the only action he can until Con-
gress acts, and that is to figure out
other sources of funding that he be-
lieves he can use within current statu-
tory limits. The way he has done that
is he has first taken the $1.3 billion
that Congress did appropriate. He has
another $2.5 billion and another $600
million that I believe he is right to re-
program, send to the southern border,
and probably make some investment in
the northern border.
Here is where I have a respectful dif-
ference of opinion with the President
and the administration: It is the emer-
gency order, that under the emergency
powers act, he is using his authority to
appropriate the remaining funds.
First off, those funds will come what
we call the MILCON budget. That is
military construction. Right now, we
are trying to find out what that
means—which projects we think are
critical to help the readiness of our sol-
diers, sailors, airmen and marines;
which investments that we were going
to make, that we have already deter-
mined we should make in military con-
struction, are going to be put on hold
while we reprogram those dollars to go
to the southern border.
The real problem I have is that this
is only a fraction of what we all know
we need to secure the border.
I want to go back to the humani-
tarian crisis, though. My wife and I had
an interesting discussion the other
night. She wasn’t too happy when I
took this position originally. I am still
not sure if she is happy.
But to understand why I respectfully
disagree with the President, you have
to understand, again, as I started this
discussion, that there is a crisis. There
are people dying. There are millions of
doses of poison coming across the bor-
der every single year that are killing
tens of thousands of people. That is a
crisis. There are thousands of people
crossing the border and dying. They
have what they call coyotes, human
traffickers who will get them across
the border, get people who will pay
thousands of dollars to cross the bor-
der, and then they will say: Civiliza-
tion is just an hour away.
It is an hour plane ride away. Most
people don’t understand the sheer size
and scale of Texas, particularly those
crossing the border in the dead of
night, working with basically orga-
nized crime. You have to pay a toll to
get through the so-called plazas that
run the northern border of Mexico.
My problem right now has to do with
an Executive order, the emergency dec-
laration that the President intends to
send to Congress.
My wife and I were having a discus-
sion. She said: You just said you agree
with the President that there is a crisis
on the border; you agree with the
President that we need to send re-
sources down to the southern border
and work on the northern border; you
agree that Congress has failed to act;
and you agree that if you were Presi-
dent, you would do exactly what he is
doing.
I said yes.
She said: Why don’t you support it?
I said: Because I am not the Presi-
dent. I am a Member of the U.S. Sen-
ate. I am a Member of a coequal branch
who actually believes that this action
falls within our purview. Now we are
going to find out because I am sure we
are going to be challenged in the
courts. But I also worry not so much
about this one—frankly, even the way
this money is going to be programmed,
I agree with. What I worry about are
future Presidents and what they may
do if we set this precedent going into
the future.
We actually have a Democratic can-
didate running for President—this is
one hypothetical. There have been
some far-flung ones that I am not sure
I completely agree with, but let me
give this one. It relates to border secu-
rity. We have someone who is a Mem-
ber of this body who has publicly said
that their priority, if they were elected
to be President, would be to tear down
borders, tear down walls, build bridges,
and open the borders. Well, if you
argue that there is a humanitarian cri-
sis—and I have said there is already is
one—what would prevent that Presi-
dent from issuing an Executive order
that would divert military construc-
tion funding to tear down the walls
that are going to be built now? If we
give this President—a President I sup-
port and a President whose policies and
priorities I agree with—that authority,
that could be aiding and abetting a fu-
ture President and empowering them
beyond what I believe their authorities
are, vested in the Constitution in arti-
cle II.
So I have come here today in part to
maybe take another stab at explaining
to my wife why I have taken this posi-
tion but also to explain to the Amer-
ican people and folks in North Carolina
and across this country. I agree with
the President. I know we have a crisis
we have to take care of. We have a na-
tional security crisis, a homeland secu-
rity crisis, and a humanitarian crisis.
It is not the end; it is a portion of the
means.
I applaud the President for taking
the action up here and getting things
going. I hope that over time, we can
find a way to fully fund the border
strategy on a bipartisan basis and also
address other immigration issues that I
believe are pressing for this Nation.
Madam President, thank you for al-
lowing me to come to the floor and ex-
plain my position.
If anybody in North Carolina has any
questions, I know they know how to
get ahold of me because my phones are
blowing up right now. But I do want to
explain it to them in a way that makes
sense. I am a steward of the U.S. Sen-
ate. I am a steward of the article I
branch. That matters to me.
Thank you, Madam President.

NOMINATION OF ERIC D. MILLER
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President,
I rise today to join many of my col-
leagues who have come to the floor and
to express my opposition to the nomi-
nation of Eric Miller to be U.S. circuit
judge for the Ninth Circuit. I have al-
ready expressed that opposition in my
vote in the Judiciary Committee, but I
would like to explain this in more de-
tail.
There are several troubling aspects of
Mr. Miller’s background, particularly
his consistent opposition to Tribal in-
terests and women’s reproductive
rights.
My State of Minnesota has a large
and diverse Tribal population. I have
always believed that our State history
has been drawn from the culture and
traditions of our Native Americans.
As a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I know that Tribal sovereignty
is a fundamental tenet of our laws. The
Ninth Circuit is home to more feder-
ally recognized Tribes than any other
circuit—more than 425. So many of the
cases that come before the court in-
volve Tribal issues. I am concerned
that Mr. Miller has a history of rep-
resenting interests that have sought to
undermine Tribal sovereignty. For ex-
ample, in a brief he filed before the Su-
preme Court, he urged the Court to
adopt a standard that would have un-
dermined the legitimacy of many fed-
erally recognized Tribal governments.
The National Congress of American
Indians and the Native American
Rights Fund have come out against his
confirmation. I know the Senator from
New Mexico, Mr. UDALL, is here and
understands the major concerns, since
he is the ranking member of the Indian
Affairs Committee, and how important
that concern is. It is only the third
time in the history of these two organi-
zations—the National Congress of
American Indians and the Native
American Rights Fund—that they have
opposed a judicial nominee.
In their letter to the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, they wrote that Eric

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1464 February 26, 2019
Miller ‘‘chose to build a law practice on
mounting repeated challenges to tribal
sovereignty, lands, religious freedom,
and the core attribute of Federal rec-
ognition of Tribal existence.’’
I believe we need judges, particularly
on the Ninth Circuit, who respect the
history and contribution of Tribal na-
tions, not one who seeks to undermine
their sovereign status.
Mr. Miller’s record on women’s repro-
ductive rights is no less troubling. Dur-
ing his time at the Justice Depart-
ment, he used ideological language in
cases in which he advocated for restric-
tions on a woman’s personal healthcare
decisions. I am concerned about what
this says about how Mr. Miller will ap-
proach these types of cases.
Finally, it pains me to say that this
is a historic moment for this body—for
the Senate—because of how we came to
be here today. It is not historic in a
good sense of the word. It is historic in
a bad sense of the word. We are voting
on this nomination today because of an
unprecedented disregard for the Sen-
ate’s traditions when it comes to judi-
cial nominations. According to the
Congressional Research Service, no
judge has ever been confirmed without
having both blue slips returned by both
home State Senators until now. We
have had instances where one blue slip
was returned, and the judge went on to
be confirmed, but what we have here is
not one blue slip from either of the
home State Senators from the State of
Washington was returned.
Senator CANTWELL, who also, by the
way, has been a major leader when it
comes to Tribal matters, did not return
a blue slip for Mr. Miller. Senator MUR-
RAY, a major leader when it comes to
women’s rights, did not return a blue
slip for Mr. Miller.
In the rush to confirm judges like
Mr. Miller, the Judiciary Committee
has chipped away at the traditions and
rules that allow us to properly advise
and consent on nominations, which is
our responsibility specifically enumer-
ated in the Constitution.
This goes beyond disregarding the
voices of home State Senators on judi-
cial nominations. This nominee’s hear-
ing was held during a monthlong recess
with no Democratic members of the
Judiciary Committee. Since this was
an established work period at home,
only two Republican Members were in
attendance. Mr. Miller’s questioning
lasted for less than 5 minutes for a life-
time appointment. Why would you
have this hearing at a time when we
were scheduled to be working in our
home States? That is what happened
because it was rammed through the
Senate without the support of either of
the home State Senators.
At a time when the American people
see this body shirking its responsibil-
ities to act as a check and balance on
the executive branch, and when they
see us divided on the basic question of
whether Congress has the power of the
purse, I am concerned about what mes-
sage we are sending to the country and
the world about the health of this Sen-
ate.
This is a lifetime appointment. It
should at least have had a normal hear-
ing. We should have at least respected
the views of the home State Senators
as we have so many times in the past.
There are no winners in a race to the
bottom when it comes to process in the
Senate—a democratic process, a proc-
ess of advice and consent, a process of
checks and balances set up by our
Founders so no one branch of govern-
ment would have all the power.
What do we see happening now? We
see judges being put forward without
blue slips. What that simply means is,
the home State Senators are OK with
that nominee. We have had blue slips
over the years in many administra-
tions for judges who perhaps were not
the first choice of the home State Sen-
ators, but they were someone they felt
could be a judge out of their State who
would have the right experience as well
as be fair and impartial in the adminis-
trative law.
What else do we have going on? We
have a President who, after an agree-
ment was reached in the Senate, which
is run by his own political party, on
how to do border security—and it was a
widespread vote in both the Senate and
the House—he then decided to declare
an emergency to do something which I
consider unconstitutional and has no
respect for the balance of powers. He
decided he would declare an emer-
gency, when, in fact, those kinds of
emergencies are things like Hurricane
Sandy and the weather we saw, and the
damage down in Florida, or the
wildfires we saw in Colorado and in
California. Those are emergencies. In
addition to that, it raises eminent do-
main issues at the border.
It also makes us question where the
money is coming from. That is why
you see these lawsuits. The money is
coming from the military budget, mili-
tary construction for our troops, and
the like.
While this may seem like a very dif-
ferent issue, it is not a different issue.
It is the same issue. The Senate should
be sticking up for the individual States
we represent and the power of those
States and the power of that balance
that is so important to running this
government and to the very Constitu-
tion that guides us.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico.
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I rise
to oppose the nomination of Eric Mil-
ler to be circuit judge for the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
Senate traditions command respect,
and if we are going to change them, we
should do so in a bipartisan way.
Changing rules midstream and chang-
ing traditions well into the Congress
causes bitterness, acrimony, and it
hurts our ability to work with each
other. Such Senate traditions as the
blue slip, where the nominee’s home
State Senators are given an oppor-
tunity to object—this courtesy has
been in place for more than 100 years as
part of the Senate’s advice and consent
responsibility.
If confirmed, Mr. Miller would be the
first circuit court nominee in history
to be confirmed without having a blue
slip returned from either of his home
State Senators. The lack of respect
shown for this Senate tradition by the
Republican leadership of the Judiciary
Committee is as saddening as it is
alarming.
Another Senate tradition again flout-
ed by the majority was holding Mr.
Miller’s confirmation hearing during a
Senate recess. The recess hearing—
lasting only 30 minutes, with only two
Republican Members in attendance—
was objected to by Democratic Mem-
bers who sought to question Mr. Miller
on a number of legal issues, including
Indian law. Instead, the questioning
lasted less than 5 minutes.
Bringing Mr. Miller’s nomination to
the floor without an adequate hearing
is an abuse of the confirmation process
by the Republican leadership of the Ju-
diciary Committee.
Putting aside these abuses of the
process, as significant as they are, Mr.
Miller’s repeated willingness to side
against Native American Tribes in
court and the likelihood that such will-
ingness will follow him to the bench
where he would have an outsized influ-
ence on the development of Indian law
for decades, concerns me deeply.
As vice chair of the Senate Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs, I pay special
attention to a nominee’s record on
Tribal issues, especially if a nominee
will preside in a jurisdiction that has
427 Tribal nations, as is the case with
Mr. Miller. I am concerned that Mr.
Miller’s record has not shown and does
not have the proper respect for Tribal
sovereignty.
As an attorney in private practice,
Mr. Miller consistently advocated
against Tribal interests and Tribal sov-
ereignty. In fact, Mr. Miller has do-
nated over 675 hours of pro bono work
against Tribal sovereignty, against Na-
tive American religious practices, Fed-
eral recognition, and numerous other
respected Tribal doctrines.
For example, in the case of Upper
Skagit v. Lundgren, Mr. Miller argued
that Tribal governments are not enti-
tled to sovereign immunity because it
interferes with the ‘‘State’s sovereign
interest in adjudicating disputes over
title to land within their territory and
frustrate[s] the ordinary adjudication
of competing [ownership] claims.’’ His
arguments in this case demonstrate he
does not understand the inherent sov-
ereignty of Tribal nations.
Mr. Miller has shown a lack of re-
spect for Native American religious
practitioners when he argued for a nar-
row application of the Religious Free-
dom Restoration Act when these prac-
titioners argued that the construction
of a solar farm would substantially
burden their ability to conduct their
religious practices.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1465
February 26, 2019
Mr. Miller has argued for an ex-
tremely narrow reading of the Indian
Reorganization Act when considering
the Federal recognition status of
Tribes. He asserts that only Tribes that
possessed federally managed lands
when the act was passed in 1934 should
be federally recognized. This narrow
view does not acknowledge the well-es-
tablished principles of Indian law and
can lead to the termination of Tribal
nations that do not meet his narrow
and arbitrary standard.
Mr. Miller’s record on Tribal issues is
one-sided and extreme. His history of
advocating against Tribal interests
does not give me confidence that he
would be a fair and impartial jurist on
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
when Tribes come before him.
I will vote no on Eric Miller’s con-
firmation. I urge my colleagues to do
so as well.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana.
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, be-
fore I start with my comments, I want
to associate my thoughts and views on
Mr. Miller with Ranking Member
UDALL’s points on Native American
sovereignty and Mr. Miller’s current
job and what he has done in that.
REMEMBERING JASON BAKER
Madam President, I come here today
in a sad time. As I speak, about right
now in Montana, a funeral is beginning
for Jason Baker.
Jason was originally from Fort Ben-
ton, MT, which is a town right down
the road from where I live in Big
Sandy. Jason was a firefighter. Jason
passed away on February 20, early in
the morning. He was far, far too
young—the age of 45. He had been a
firefighter for 16 years with Great Falls
Fire Rescue. He was incredibly tal-
ented and incredibly professional, and
he was somebody who loved being a
firefighter. His life of public service,
whether it was helping out kids or
helping out adults or helping out com-
munities, was a part of who he was as
a person.
Jason was also married to my wife’s
cousin Jill. They have two children,
Peyton and Porter, whose hearts have
to be aching. This day is a day, I am
sure, that they had to have planned for
the last 3 or so years after his diag-
nosis of stage IV lung cancer. I guess it
was 2 years ago.
I have a number of memories of
Jason from my days in the State legis-
lature, when he showed up as a rel-
atively young firefighter, to my days
as a U.S. Senator, when he showed up
to my offices here in Washington, DC,
to advocate for firefighters’ issues.
More important than all of that, Jason
was a friend. He happened to also be a
relative. He was somebody who, when
his wife’s grandfather passed away and
they had the funeral up in Havre, was
at the height of who he was as a human
being. He wasn’t sick and hadn’t been
diagnosed with anything. He was just
vibrant and full of life.
With cancer’s being the disease that
it is, it was a struggle for him, as it is
for anybody who gets it. He was some-
body who fought that disease bravely
and proudly, but in the end, it took
him. It took him last Wednesday, early
in the morning. We were driving to
Great Falls, and my wife sent a little
message to Jill that read our hearts
were with them because we knew that
Jason wasn’t good. She sent back a
text with hearts, and that was it. He
had already passed.
In the end, though, as I think back
on Jason’s life, there are some lyrics to
a song that say ‘‘Only the good die
young.’’ It could not be any more true
than with Jason Baker. If the world
were full of Jason Bakers, this would
be a better world, but life happens, and
you have to get through it.
I am sure that Jill and Peyton and
Porter will think back and remember
their dad proudly as he served proudly
as a firefighter, as a public servant—as
somebody who ran to danger while
other people were running away from
it.
As they proceed with the ceremony
today in Montana—and it is happening
as I speak—just know, Jill, Peyton,
Porter, and all of the firefighters who
are there, that we are very proud of
your dad and his service and what he
fought for.
Two years ago, there was a bill in the
Montana Legislature on presumptive
illness for firefighters. I do not believe
Jason would have contracted cancer if
not for his job, if not for the kinds of
fumes he breathed when he protected
neighborhoods and families. I think it
is only right that when people sacrifice
for their communities, we sacrifice for
them. Two years ago, the legislature
did not pass that presumptive illness
bill. I think it made a mistake.
When I gave my speech to the House
of Representatives in the Montana Leg-
islature, one of the points I made in
that speech was that they needed to
pass the presumptive healthcare bill
for firefighters. Jason was alive when I
gave that speech, and now he has
passed. I think, in memory of Jason
Baker, at the very least, the Montana
Legislature could pass that bill. I un-
derstand it has passed one of the
houses but that it hasn’t passed both of
them. If it passes both houses, I know
Governor Bullock will sign that bill.
So, with that, we bid adieu to a great
American, a great community man—
somebody who literally gave it all for
his country and his State and his town.
We will miss you, Jason Baker.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NOMINATION OF ERIC D. MILLER
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, we are in the midst of a stealth
campaign. Normally, we think about
‘‘stealth’’ as associated with bombers
or submarines, weapons platforms de-
signed to go, in effect, under the radar,
to avoid detection, to escape public no-
tice or the notice of our adversaries.
This stealth campaign is really hid-
ing in plain sight. It is a campaign to
remake our Federal judiciary in the
image of the far-right extreme of the
Republican Party, the far-right ex-
treme ideologically and politically, a
campaign, in effect, to outsource selec-
tions of judges to groups that reflect
those extreme points of view—the Her-
itage Society and other such groups.
Shortly, we will consider the nomina-
tion of the latest individual nominated
by the President, outsourced to those
groups: Eric Miller, of Washington, to
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
The effort here is to drastically re-
shape our judiciary but, in the process,
also dismantle the norms and practices
critical to the health of our democracy.
The judiciary is essential to the health
of our democracy.
In the future, when we look back on
this era—a dark and dangerous time
for our democracy—the heroes will be
our free press and our independent ju-
diciary because they have been se-
lected in the past by both Republican
and Democratic Presidents based on
qualities of integrity, intelligence, and
independence.
That norm, common to both Repub-
lican and Democratic administrations
in the past, has been broken by this
one. One of the norms that has been
broken in the U.S. Senate relates to
the use of blue slips. Most of the public
has no idea what blue slips are. They
are the traditional mechanism used
over decades to afford home State Sen-
ators the opportunity to express their
approval or disapproval for fitness, a
basic quality of a President’s judicial
nominee to a court that has jurisdic-
tion over their State.
What is the reason? Well, Senators
just happen to spend a lot of time talk-
ing with folks at home. We talk to
farmers, businesspeople, lawyers. A lot
of those lawyers know fellow lawyers.
Of course, we receive the ABA qualified
or unqualified ratings, but they are
single words based on fact gathering
that may or may not be as reliable as
our colleagues—the lawyers who ap-
pear in front of judges, who go to court
every day, who have settlement con-
ferences, who rely on the word of their
colleagues, which is either good or bad,
who know their integrity and intel-
ligence, who know whether they have
the temperament to sit in judgment of
cases that will have enduring and ir-
reparable ramifications for the liti-
gants who appear in front of them.
Respecting the blue-slip tradition en-
sures that when there is a Federal judi-
cial vacancy—for Connecticut, for ex-
ample—that the President nominate a
qualified candidate from Connecticut
with the advice and consent of Con-
necticut Senators. The same is true for
the Presiding Officer’s home State of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1466 February 26, 2019
Tennessee or any of the other States
involved here. I am sure my colleagues
from Texas or North Carolina or wher-
ever would want a Democratic Presi-
dent to consult them when making ap-
pointments to the courts that have ju-
risdiction over the people, the liti-
gants, the folks who have to go to
court with their grievances in their
States. Blue slips may be a courtesy,
but they are important to the func-
tioning of our society.
Until the Trump administration,
only five judges had ever been con-
firmed with only one blue slip in the
last 100 years. That means one Senator
from that State objected. Only five
went through with that one objection
and with the other Senator saying OK.
To our knowledge, no judge has ever
been confirmed without having both
blue slips from their home State Sen-
ators. Eric Miller would be a first.
Sometimes it is good to be a first but
not so here. We are witnessing another
norm being shattered in realtime. We
need to know from the majority: Is this
the road we really want to go down in
this Chamber?
I take my constitutional responsibil-
ities very seriously, especially when it
comes to the confirmation of judges, as
someone who has spent most of my
professional career in the courtroom,
either as a lawyer in private practice
or a U.S. attorney for Connecticut or
as attorney general in my State for 20
years.
This issue is important because not
only is it a matter of courtesy, but it is
a matter of completeness.
This nomination is a stealth nomina-
tion in a very important sense, also, as
far as the process for his confirmation
is concerned. Only one Senator—one
Senator—has actually asked him ques-
tions on the record in public. That is
because his confirmation hearing was
scheduled at a time when only one
Member of the U.S. Senate was there
to ask him questions.
It was held during a month-long re-
cess in October. Only two members of
the committee—Senators Hatch and
CRAPO—could attend the hearing. Only
Senator CRAPO questioned Mr. Miller
for a 5-minute round of questions.
All 10 Democratic members of the Ju-
diciary, including me, wrote to Senator
GRASSLEY to have the hearing resched-
uled. We asked, and he refused. We
wrote Senator GRASSLEY again to have
a second hearing so that the full com-
mittee could provide advice and con-
sent after questioning Mr. Miller’s
nomination. We had no success.
If Mr. Miller is confirmed, he will
have been questioned by that one Sen-
ator, Mr. CRAPO—out of 100—for a
grand total of 5 minutes. That is not
the way this system should work.
I do take my constitutional respon-
sibilities seriously. This process makes
a sham of the obligations we all have a
sworn duty to fulfill.
In conclusion, let me say that in No-
vember of 2018, the Ninth Circuit ruled
against the President. He described
that case as ‘‘a disgrace.’’ He painted
the ruling of the Ninth Circuit as bi-
ased by describing one of the judges as
an ‘‘Obama judge.’’ President Trump
ultimately stated that the Ninth Cir-
cuit is ‘‘not fair’’ because every case
the administration files in the Ninth
Circuit results in a loss.
He has made no secret of his frustra-
tion about judges generally, whether
they were chosen by Republican or
Democratic Presidents in the past. He
has made no secret of his contempt for
judges who uphold the rule of law and,
as Chief Justice Roberts said, ‘‘do
equal right to those appearing before
them.’’
Chief Justice Roberts also stated
that an ‘‘independent judiciary is
something we should all be thankful
for.’’
The nomination of Eric Miller be-
trays that essential principle of the
American judiciary. It diminishes and
reduces the independence of our judici-
ary at a level that we can ill afford and
at a time when independence is most
important. I think this nomination is
particularly objectionable in light of
that lack of independence.
Mr. Miller’s nomination is opposed
by the National Congress of American
Indians, the Native American Rights
Fund, Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska,
and NARAL Pro-Choice America be-
cause of positions he has taken. Those
positions are also objectionable to me,
but what is most important is his lack
of independence, the lack of proper
process in his confirmation, and his
lack of qualifications for this job.
I hope my colleagues will join me in
voting against him today.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada.
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President,
I rise today to speak in opposition to
the nomination of Eric Miller to the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
As an attorney and former attorney
general, like my good colleague from
Connecticut, I have a deep respect and
appreciation for our Federal judiciary.
I believe that carefully guarding the
professional reputation of our Federal
bench is critical to maintaining re-
spect for the rule of law in our country.
The American people must be able to
trust that our Federal judges will be
fair and neutral arbiters of any dispute
before them. So in considering whether
a nominee is deserving of the awesome
responsibility of a lifetime appoint-
ment to the Federal bench, we must
carefully evaluate their professional
and personal qualifications to ensure
that they are of the highest intellec-
tual, professional, and moral caliber.
I have carefully reviewed Mr. Miller’s
record, and I believe that he is the
wrong candidate to fill this judicial
seat. I believe my Republican col-
leagues know it. That is why they have
made every effort to jam this con-
firmation through.
The majority-led Judiciary Com-
mittee and Republican leadership have
taken extraordinary steps to rush this
nomination. Republicans held Mr. Mil-
ler’s confirmation hearing during an
October recess, without the consent of
minority members of the committee,
questioning him for just 5 minutes and
then gaveling out. As you heard, only
two Senators were at that hearing.
That is not regular order in the Senate.
Unfortunately, the Republican lead-
ership continues to attack regular
order in the Senate by attacking Sen-
ate precedent. This nominee, if con-
firmed, will be the first circuit court
judge advanced without the support of
either of their home State Senators.
That is the blue-slip process.
The blue-slip process is an essential
tradition of respecting the wishes of
each nominee’s home State Senators,
and it is the start of the advice and
consent process.
This is about our system of checks
and balances, respecting one another,
and the prerogatives of the Senate that
ensure every Senator has a voice in the
selection of judges in their home State.
This institutional check has never been
more important than it is today be-
cause we have a President who under-
mines the legitimacy and impartiality
of the courts.
By bringing up this confirmation for
a vote before the Senate, Republican
leaders are circumventing Senators, ig-
noring the people we were elected to
represent, and damaging our critical
role in appropriately deliberating on
lifetime judicial nominees and rep-
resenting the will of our constituents
who elected us. This is a dereliction of
the Senate’s duty, and it is an assault
on our institutions.
If confirmed, Mr. Miller will have a
lifetime appointment to one of the
highest courts in America. He will
make decisions on our Nation’s most
important issues and will have the
power to change Americans’ lives. Yet
this Republican leadership believes a 5-
minute hearing is enough for a circuit
court nominee who doesn’t have the
support of his own home State Sen-
ators.
When the confirmation process is
rushed like this, critical information
about the history and character of the
nominees will be missed. These lapses
undermine the integrity of our con-
firmation process and ultimately un-
dermine the public’s faith in our Fed-
eral judiciary.
I share many of the same concerns of
Senators CANTWELL and MURRAY about
Mr. Miller’s views on Tribal sov-
ereignty and other critical issues. Mr.
Miller’s past work in undermining
Tribal sovereignty and Tribal rights
raises questions about how he would
treat Tribes who come before him as a
circuit court judge. His confirmation
could have serious ramifications for
Native communities in Washington,
Nevada, and across the country.
Each one of us is elected to represent
our State and its people. Today’s move
by the majority is nothing less than an
assault on our oath to the Constitution
and our duty to serve our constituents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1467
February 26, 2019
I urge my colleagues to vote no on
this nomination and stand together in
a bipartisan way to confirm nominees
who reflect our States, our country,
and respect the Senators.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am
here joining my colleagues on the floor
to sound the alarm because right now,
this Senate is being steered down a
very dangerous path. I spoke last night
about this and laid out my case, and I
am here again to make it one more
time.
Republican leaders are now barreling
toward a confirmation vote on a Ninth
Circuit nominee—a flashpoint that, if
it succeeds, will mark a massive depar-
ture from the longstanding bipartisan
process that has been in place for gen-
erations. It is a bipartisan process that
has helped this Senate put consensus
nominees on the bench for as long as
we have all been here. This is wrong,
and it is the American people who we
represent who will be hurt.
Let’s recap the facts. Neither I nor
my colleague Senator CANTWELL re-
turned a blue slip on the nomination of
Eric Miller to serve on the Ninth Cir-
cuit court. I have deep concerns about
Mr. Miller’s work fighting against
Tribes. Despite our objections, Repub-
licans went ahead with Mr. Miller’s
confirmation hearing during a Senate
recess when just two Senators—both
Republicans—were able to attend, and
the hearing included less than 5 min-
utes of questioning. It was a sham
hearing. It was simply done to check
the box.
For this Senate to go ahead and con-
firm this Ninth Circuit court nominee
without the consent of or true input
from both home State Senators and
after a sham hearing—that would be a
dangerous first for this Senate.
This is not a partisan issue; this is a
question of this Senate’s ability and
commitment to properly review nomi-
nees.
The only logical conclusion I can
draw as to why we are here at these
crossroads is that Republican leaders
are hoping that most Americans won’t
notice, that they are doing everything
in their power to pander to President
Trump and in doing that are trampling
all over Senate norms in order to move
our courts to the far right.
We are standing here today because
this is too important and because the
short- and long-term consequences of
letting any President steamroll the
Senate on something as critical as our
judicial nominees are far too impor-
tant.
Abandoning the blue-slip process and
instead bending to the will of a Presi-
dent, by the way, who has dem-
onstrated time and again his ignorance
and disdain for the Constitution and
rule of law is a mistake. At a time
when we have a President whose poli-
cies keep testing the limits of the
law—from a ban on Muslims entering
the United States, to a family separa-
tion policy at our southern border, to
declaring a national emergency with-
out a real emergency—it is now more
important than ever that we have well-
qualified, consensus judges on the
bench.
This new precedent of my Republican
colleagues turning a blind eye to the
blue slip and shunning longstanding bi-
partisan processes should stop every
one of my colleagues, Republican or
Democratic, in their tracks because
today the two home State Senators left
holding their blue slips are me and my
colleague Senator CANTWELL, but in
the future, it could be any Member of
this body. Today it is Washington
State families who are getting cut out
from an important process. It is their
concerns about Eric Miller’s long his-
tory of fighting against Tribal rights
that will be cast aside. But tomorrow
it could be the concerns of any of your
constituents and any of your home
States that get tossed aside for a Presi-
dent’s crusade to reshape our courts
and satisfy their political base, and it
could be your constituents and your
home States hurt by Senate leaders un-
willing to stand up for norms and
precedents and our constitutional
duty.
Again, I am here today to urge my
colleagues to truly think about what
moving ahead with this nomination
means and to ask themselves, are we
still able to work together in a bipar-
tisan way and find common ground for
the good of the country and the people
we serve? Can we still even engage in a
bipartisan process to find consensus
candidates to serve on our courts, or
will our work in the Senate be reduced
to partisan extremes and political
gamesmanship? Will Republicans ac-
cept simply being a rubberstamp for
their leader in the White House? Will
my colleagues be complicit in allowing
our courts to be taken over by ideology
alone, abandoning pragmatism and a
commitment to justice for all? That is
a choice every Senator faces now and,
I sincerely hope, a choice for which
every Senator will be held accountable.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MCCONNELL. I know of no fur-
ther debate on the Miller nomination.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there

CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I
rise this evening to speak on a subject
that, with the groundswell of activism,
has once again captured national at-
tention—and rightfully so.
Many years ago, I was a young naval
flight officer stationed at a mock field
naval air station in the Bay area out in
California, preparing for the first of
what would be three tours of duty in
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam
war. I joined there with tens of thou-
sands of people one day to celebrate
our country’s first-ever Earth Day. I
will never forget it.
This was back when polluters
dumped waste into our waterways with
impunity. Garbage littered our shores,
and too many rivers oozed instead of
flowed. One of them was in Cleveland,
OH. The Cuyahoga River, north of
where I went to school at Ohio State,
actually caught on fire. Factories
spewed toxic fumes, and acid rain fell
from the sky. The urgency was clear
then, and it is even clearer today.
That very first Earth Day was a
transformative experience for me, and
it will serve as an inspiration for me
for the rest of my life.
As I look at what is happening across
our country today, I see the movement
for bold and transformative action to
save our planet. I see the faces of those
who were there with me that day in
Golden Gate State Park.
I have had a lot of different jobs since
then, but it is not lost on me that I
stand here today on the brink of yet
another watershed moment as the top
Democrat on the Senate Committee on
Environment and Public Works—the
committee that oversees our Nation’s
environmental laws—to talk about cli-
mate change.
In the days and weeks ahead, Senator
MCCONNELL intends to engage in a ploy
to try and undermine the Green New
Deal by calling a vote for a resolution
he does not even support. I believe he
hopes that, in turn, there may be some
disruption and damage inflicted on the
Democratic Party and the climate
change movement.
To the American people, hear this; it
is a simple message: We cannot—we
will not—allow cynicism to win, not
now and not with so much at stake.
When it comes to climate action,
there could not be a starker difference
in this Chamber between the Demo-
cratic Party and the Republican Party
in this debate.
We, as Democrats, may not agree on
exactly how we should address climate
change, but we all agree it is hap-
pening. We agree that human activity
is the main cause, and we agree that
we must act now.
Democrats know that climate science
isn’t part of some grand hoax. It is not
an alarmist prediction. It doesn’t come
from some left-leaning organization. It
doesn’t come from talk radio. It comes
directly from our Nation’s leading sci-
entists and leading scientists from all
around the world.
Just 3 months ago, 13 Federal Agen-
cies released a comprehensive climate
report that described the dire economic
and health consequences we face if we
fail to take meaningful action to ad-
dress climate change now. I may be
mistaken, but I believe those 13 Fed-
eral Agencies were acting under law
signed by a Republican President. I be-
lieve it was George Herbert Walker
Bush.
This report is the Fourth National
Climate Assessment. It was developed
over a 3-year period by more than 300
Federal experts and non-Federal ex-
perts who volunteered their time—who
volunteered their time.
Here is a brief summary of their re-
port: The science behind climate
change is settled. Let me say that
again. The science behind climate
change is settled.
From our warming oceans to our at-
mosphere, climate change is hap-
pening, and human activity, such as
burning fossil fuels, is greatly contrib-
uting to this crisis.
Our Nation’s scientists have found a
direct link between climate change and
the extreme weather we experienced in
2017, which altogether cost the Amer-
ican economy more than $300 billion—
that is $300 billion in economic dam-
ages, more than any year before.
Scientists are no longer asking if cli-
mate change is happening but rather
how bad is it going to be. How bad is it
going to be? Numbers and the facts
don’t lie. It will only get worse if we do
nothing.
If we don’t act on climate change by
2050, wildfire seasons could burn up to
six times—six times—more forest area
every year. If we don’t act on climate
change, we will see more extreme
flooding that devastates small commu-
nities like Ellicott City, MD, not far
from here, which has been hit by not
one 1,000-year flood in the past year
but two. These are floods that are sup-
posed to occur maybe once every 1,000
years. They had two of them in the last
2 years.
If we don’t act on climate change,
rising temperatures, combined with in-
creasingly frequent and severe rain,
mean farmers are likely to experience
a reduction in corn and soybean yields
by up to 25 percent. If we don’t act on
climate change, we will see more dead-
ly category 5 hurricanes and storm
surges like the ones we saw with Hurri-
canes Irma and Maria just 2 years ago.
If we do not act on climate change,
we will see economic pain across every
major sector of our economy in this
country. The 2018 National Climate As-
sessment concludes that at the end of
this century, climate change could
slash our gross domestic product by 10
percent.
How much is that compared to what?
Well, compared to the losses we sus-
tained in the great recession just a dec-
ade ago, 10 percent is more than double
those losses—more than double.
It doesn’t matter if you are from a
coastal State or from a landlocked
State. I have lived in both. It doesn’t
matter if you care about public health
or the environment or if you care
about our economy or national secu-
rity. The fact is, every person living in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1469
February 26, 2019
this country will eventually see or ex-
perience the effects of climate change
if they haven’t already done so today.
We have two options. We confront
this challenge head on—reduce carbon
emissions, enhance resiliency, and sup-
port millions of new clean energy
jobs—or we could choose to ignore the
problem and pass the buck. To whom?
To our children, to their children, and
to their children.
Senator MCCONNELL, President
Trump, and Andrew Wheeler at EPA
want to pass the buck. They prefer to
walk away from the growing threat we
face. Instead of pursuing any ideas to
address climate change and protect
Americans from its effect, sadly, the
Trump administration has promoted
policies that increase our dependency
on dirty energy.
President Trump has even said he
doesn’t believe in climate change. He
doubts the credibility of his own sci-
entists at NASA and at NOAA, as well
as 97 percent of the global scientific
community. Continuing to misinform
the American people and delay real cli-
mate action puts American lives and
our economy at risk.
It doesn’t have to be this way. As
Democrats, we choose to confront cli-
mate change. We choose to do so now.
We know our communities are feeling
the pain now from the climate crisis
because we see the effects of climate
change every day across this country.
We may not yet agree on exactly how
we must address climate change, but
we all agree on three things. Here they
are. One, we agree climate change is
real; two, human activity during the
last 100 years is a dominant cause of
the climate crisis we face today; and
three, the United States, and especially
the Congress, that is us, the House and
the Senate, and the administration
should take immediate action to ad-
dress the challenge of climate change.
That is why I will be introducing a
resolution that says just that. Demo-
crats know we can have a healthy cli-
mate and a strong economy. They are
not mutually exclusive. Anyone who
says otherwise is preaching a false
choice.
Democrats know this because of the
work we started with President Obama
in the White House, where we accom-
plished real actions to put this Nation
on a path of net zero emissions. Our
Republicans friends across the aisle
should know this because of the work
done by the former President, the late
George Herbert Walker Bush, years
earlier that I just alluded to a minute
ago.
During the Obama administration,
starting with the Recovery Act, the
Federal Government provided eco-
nomic incentives, environmental tar-
gets, and supported market develop-
ments to encourage investments in the
clean energy of the future.
Thanks to the investments during
the previous administration, con-
sumers are paying less for energy, and
more than 3 million people in this
country went to work today in the
clean energy sector—3 million and
growing.
Democrats know we must build on
this progress, and that is why we con-
tinue to support policies that reduce
our Nation’s carbon footprint, help cre-
ate a fair economy, and support those
most vulnerable to climate effects, but
in the U.S. Senate, as in most places, it
takes two to tango, and for over two
decades Democrats have put forth dif-
ferent policies that use market forces,
make big investments in technology,
or set strict standards. We have done
them all, and we don’t seem to get very
far with our friends on the other side of
this aisle. I know because I have co-
sponsored many of these efforts.
Let me just say this. We are not
going to give up. We are going to keep
on trying. We will not back down. We
are going to stand our ground.
Let me leave our colleagues with this
message today. This should not be an
issue. Climate action should not be an
issue that divides us as a body. It
shouldn’t divide us as a country or as a
world. It should unify us.
I thank Senator MCCONNELL in ad-
vance for allowing the Senate to devote
a fulsome period of time to this impor-
tant discussion. How we choose to act
today will not decide our fates. How we
choose to act today will decide the
fates of generations of Americans—not
just our fates but generations of Amer-
icans that will be on this Earth long
after the rest of us are gone. So let’s
get to work. Time is wasting. Let’s get
to work.
I yield the floor to the Senator from
Massachusetts, who has done great
work on this for as long as I have been
alive—almost as long as I have been
alive, my friend and my colleague who
has been a giant on these issues for a
long time and continues to be.
I yield the floor.
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I
thank our great leader on the Environ-
ment Committee for his visionary work
on this issue. I am here for the same
purpose today. I am here to talk about
climate change, about our climate cri-
sis, and about the mistake it would be
to put Andrew Wheeler in charge of the
Environmental Protection Agency.
Climate change is an existential
threat to our country and to the plan-
et. We know this because the world’s
leading scientists, the United Nation’s
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, just made that warning late
last year. It is an existential threat to
the planet.
The U.N. report told us we have very
limited time until we are past the
point of no return, and the most cata-
strophic impacts of climate change are
irreversible.
Our own Federal scientists across 13
Agencies also just warned in the Na-
tional Climate Assessment that the im-
pacts of climate change are not in the
future, but they are happening in our
communities right now.
Here is what all 13 U.S. Federal
Agencies said. They said our efforts do
not yet approach the scale necessary to
avoid substantial damages to the econ-
omy, environment, and human health.
These are Earth-shattering reports
about the state of our Earth. These are
the doomsday reports about what hap-
pens if we do not take bold action.
The dire consequences of climate
change, in fact, are arriving. A tenfold
increase in ice-free summers in the
Arctic, 99 percent loss of coral reefs,
and a doubling of species lost around
the world. In the Northeast, in worst-
case scenarios, by the end of the cen-
tury, both the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and Logan Airport will
be under water, and over 20 percent of
Boston’s population will face flood
risk.
The climate emissions are not slow-
ing down. In 2018, emissions increased
2.8 percent. We have the ‘‘Denier in
Chief’’ in the White House, and this
week Republicans in the Senate are
poised to confirm a coal lobbyist to
head the Environmental Protection
Agency.
During his confirmation hearing,
when I asked whether he agreed with
the conclusions of the National Cli-
mate Assessment report, Mr. Wheeler
said he still needed additional briefings
before he could make a public com-
ment on it. Let me repeat that. The
nominee of Donald Trump to run the
Agency charged with protecting the
planet from climate change had not
even sufficiently reviewed the climate
report from our own Federal Agencies
before his confirmation hearing. He
also said he considered the report to be
a representation of the worst-case sce-
nario and that what we face is ‘‘a cli-
mate issue.’’
Well, the worst-case scenario is one
in which the Republican Senate will
confirm a former coal lobbyist to head
the Environmental Protection Agency.
The worst-case scenario is the Trump
administration’s plans to roll back the
Clean Power Plan and the fuel econ-
omy emission standards, the single
largest steps we have ever taken to ad-
dress climate change. We are in a
worst-case scenario, and we need to
dramatically change course.
That should start by not confirming
Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist, to run
the Agency charged with protecting
our planet. Andrew Wheeler’s answers
on the climate crisis should be dis-
qualifying. His record as a coal lob-
byist should be disqualifying. We
should come together and reject An-
drew Wheeler as the head of the EPA.
The impact of climate change on or-
dinary families on their health, on our
Nation, on our security, and on our fu-
ture is too urgent. We must be bold. We
must be ambitious.
That is why I have introduced the
Green New Deal resolution. It lays out
a serious, bold, aspirational set of goals
VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:55 Feb 27, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G26FE6.039 S26FEPT1

that meet the scale of the threat we
are facing. It is a set of principles, not
prescriptions. The Green New Deal will
allow us to engage in massive job cre-
ation to save all of creation. It calls for
a massive 10-year mobilization to
transform our climate, our economy,
our democracy. It is about jobs and jus-
tice.
An overwhelming number of Ameri-
cans support climate action, and a ma-
jority of Americans support a Green
New Deal. Never in our history have
the interests of all Americans been so
united in a single issue: climate
change.
From the air we breathe to the jobs
that employ us, to the neighborhoods
we live in, to the economy we operate
within, climate change defines our ex-
istence. This is the time for serious so-
lutions. Global temperatures are the
highest in recorded history. Wealth in-
equality is at its highest point since
the era of the Great Depression. The
erosion of our coastlines, the erosion of
earning power of workers, the pollution
of our planet, the pollution of our de-
mocracy by Big Oil and Koch brothers
financing, the relationship between
these ills and injustices is undeniable,
but the challenge is not insurmount-
able.
It will only be through a historic
intergenerational commitment to end
climate change that we create the kind
of democracy that works for all Ameri-
cans. This Green New Deal mobiliza-
tion will make the United States the
global leader on clean energy and cli-
mate action.
This mobilization will be the greatest
blue-collar jobs program in a genera-
tion. This mobilization will be an op-
portunity to repair the historic oppres-
sion of frontline and vulnerable com-
munities that have borne the worst
burdens of pollution from our fossil
fuel economy—these communities that
also will be the most affected and the
least able to respond to the impacts of
climate change. The Green New Deal
represents an opportunity to lift up all
workers and all communities.
President Roosevelt was right when
he said about the New Deal that
‘‘statesmanship and vision, my friends,
require relief to all at the same time.’’
We are talking about a historic, 10-
year mobilization that will mitigate
climate emissions and build climate re-
siliency. We have acted on this scale
before, and we must do it again.
We have already laid the foundation
for our climate future. In 2008, we had
only 1,200 megawatts of total solar ca-
pacity in the United States. Today, we
have 65,000 megawatts. In 2008, we had
only 25,000 megawatts of total wind ca-
pacity. Today, we have 98,000
megawatts of wind capacity. In 2008,
there were only 2,500 all-electric vehi-
cles in our country. Today, we have 1
million, with 500,000 new all-electric
vehicles to be sold this year. Most of
all, what we have seen over the past 10
years is a growing movement for cli-
mate action. In wind and solar, we now
have 350,000 people who are employed.
That didn’t happen 10 years ago; it is
happening today.
The Green New Deal is not just a res-
olution; it is a revolution. Republicans
and climate deniers are taking mathe-
matical liberties to say it would cost
too much to act, but the cost of inac-
tion on climate will be far higher. Over
just the past 2 years, the cost of storms
and the cost of fires in our country cre-
ated over $400 billion in damages. By
the end of this century, it will be tens
of trillions of dollars that we will lose.
An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure. If we start today, we can
avoid the worst, most catastrophic
consequences. For those who say we
can’t afford to act to address this cri-
sis, I say we can’t afford not to.
The question is, Will any Republican
stand up to fight for these goals? The
Republican Party is about to confirm a
coal lobbyist to run the Environmental
Protection Agency. That is where we
are in 2019, with the worst scientific re-
ports coming from the U.N. and our
own scientists—a threat of an existen-
tial risk for the planet—and we are
about to confirm a coal lobbyist.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have to be
bold the way President Kennedy was in
1962 when he called for a mission to the
Moon to be accomplished within 10
years. He said it would not be easy. He
said we would have to invent metal
that did not exist and propulsion sys-
tems that did not exist. He said we
would have to bring that mission back
safely through heat half the intensity
of the Sun, and we would have to do so
safely within 10 years so that we could
control outer space. We did that, ladies
and gentlemen, and we can do it again.
We have to accept this challenge. We
can do it. We can unleash an innova-
tion revolution in our country, and
again we will do it to save all creation
by engaging in massive job creation, a
blue-collar revolution hiring millions
of workers to do this job.
I thank you, Madam President. This
is a very important week before us.
I yield back to my colleague.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am honored to follow the distin-
guished ranking member on our Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee
and one of the coauthors of the Wax-
man-Markey bill—the one significant
piece of climate legislation that has
passed a House of Congress—and to add
my voice.
Mr. MARKEY. Would the Senator
yield?
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Gladly.
Mr. MARKEY. I just want to say that
there is no climate warrior like SHEL-
DON WHITEHOUSE from Rhode Island. He
is up every day of his life on this issue,
and when he speaks, he speaks with au-
thority. I just want to say what an
honor it is to be here today.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It goes the other
way.
Sometimes it seems that our friends
on the other side of the aisle think
that the only people who are watching
this conversation are fossil fuel indus-
try lobbyists and CEOs and election-
eers.
So we are going through, shortly, a
truly preposterous exercise on the floor
of the Senate, which is that a party
that has brought up no significant leg-
islation in the time that Leader
McConnell has had the floor is now
going to bring its first measure related
to climate for a floor vote, and it is
something they intend to vote against.
It is something they intend to vote
against. When you bring a measure to
the floor that it is your intention to
vote against, that is not legislating.
Something else is going on.
Now I think this was a very clever
stunt. We don’t know quite where it
was cooked up, but we have observed
that the Wall Street Journal editorial
page is a relentless mouthpiece for the
fossil fuel industry, having published
climate denial articles literally within
the last year. The Wall Street Journal
editorial page called for this stunt
vote, and it was less than 24 hours be-
fore the Republicans in the Senate
jumped up, scampered out, and did ex-
actly what they were told to do by the
fossil fuel industry’s mouthpiece, the
Wall Street Journal editorial page.
I am sure there were champagne
corks banging into the ceilings of the
boardrooms for ExxonMobil, Ameri-
cans for Prosperity, and the Koch In-
dustries as all of these fossil fuel ex-
ecutives and lobbyists cheered this
stunt. But in the Senate, we actually
have a larger audience than just fossil
fuel donors; the country is watching
and the world is watching, and what
they are seeing right now is, frankly,
an embarrassment.
It is not just this stunt that reflects
a broken Senate; it is a much larger
problem of a Senate that cannot deal
with the climate change issue in a bi-
partisan fashion.
I would state that when I got here in
2007, the Senate could deal with cli-
mate change in a bipartisan fashion. In
2008, the Senate could deal with cli-
mate change in a bipartisan fashion. In
2009, the Senate could deal with cli-
mate change in a bipartisan fashion.
The reason I know that is because I
was here then, and I saw as many as
five bipartisan efforts to deal with cli-
mate change during that period, with
different Republican and Democratic
Senators. Then along came the Citizens
United decision in January 2010, and
from that moment after, it was like
watching a patient drop dead in the
emergency room. The heartbeat of ac-
tivity on climate change just flatlined
on the Republican side of this Cham-
ber.
I think the fossil fuel industry—I
know the fossil fuel industry asked for
that decision from the Supreme Court
and the five Republican Justices. I
think they anticipated what the deci-
sion was going to be, and they imme-
diately went to work to squelch and
crush any dissent from their orthodoxy

February 26, 2019
on that side of the aisle. The result has
been that there has been no significant
piece of climate legislation to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions and to deal
with this problem since Citizens United
that any of our colleagues now will co-
sponsor or support. It has just been si-
lent, and it is a dramatic failure in this
greatest deliberative body.
I will state, as others have stated, as
Ranking Member CARPER and Senator
MARKEY have said, that the science on
this is now beyond dispute. The science
on this is irrefutable. If we fail to deal
with this problem, the consequences
will be catastrophic and irreversible.
‘‘Irrefutable science.’’ ‘‘Catastrophic
and irreversible consequences.’’ I am
actually quoting somebody when I say
that. Do you know whom I am quoting?
I am quoting from 2009 Donald Trump—
Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Jr.,
Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and the
Trump Organization signed this full-
page advertisement in the New York
Times in 2009. ‘‘If we fail to act now,’’
they said, ‘‘it is scientifically irref-
utable that there will be catastrophic
and irreversible consequences for hu-
manity and our planet.’’ So as much as
the fossil fuel-funded mockery in which
the Republican Party has engaged,
challenges these facts, even the
Trumps knew this a decade ago.
In trying to describe the Green New
Deal, one might describe it as some-
thing that, if you invested in it, would
‘‘drive state-of-the-art technologies
that will spur economic growth, create
new energy jobs, and increase our en-
ergy security all while reducing the
harmful emissions that are putting our
planet at risk.’’ That is a pretty good
capsule of the Green New Deal.
Guess what Donald Trump and his
family said in the same advertisement.
Investing in a Clean Energy Economy will
drive state-of-the-art technologies that will
spur economic growth, create new energy
jobs, and increase our energy security all
while reducing the harmful emissions that
are putting our planet at risk.
All you have to do is listen to the
2009 Donald Trump to understand that
the science of climate change was then
irrefutable and it is even stronger now
and that the consequences of our fail-
ure to act and our obedience, our ad-
herence to fossil fuel-funded propa-
ganda and orthodoxy will lead to con-
sequences that are catastrophic and ir-
reversible—said a decade ago. We have
had 10 more years of unrestricted emis-
sions since then.
Just the basic tenets of the Green
New Deal are ‘‘a clean energy economy
[that] will drive state-of-the-art tech-
nologies that will spur economic
growth, create new energy jobs, and in-
crease our energy security.’’
With the words of Donald Trump, I
rest my case and yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, think
about what we just heard, first from
Senator MARKEY talking about a fossil
fuel lobbyist in the year 2019 being cho-
sen to head the EPA—a fossil fuel lob-
byist—when there has not been a bill
on this floor or any motion coming
from Senator MCCONNELL to deal with
climate change, to deal with one of the
greatest if not the greatest moral issue
of our times—nothing on this floor.
You heard what Senator MARKEY said.
This administration has done nothing
to address this issue, and President
Trump selects a fossil fuel lobbyist to
be head of the EPA. It is the same
thing over and over again.
We have to take aggressive action to
protect our planet and protect our fu-
ture now. That means accelerating our
transition to carbon-free power. It
means investing in technologies that
make our manufacturers the most en-
ergy efficient in the world. It means
creating jobs in clean energy all
around the country.
I have always, as a House Member
living in Lorain, OH, and as a Member
of the Senate—for years, I have always
refused to accept the idea that you
have to choose between good environ-
mental policy and good-paying jobs.
We have proved that is simply not true.
We have proved it in my State, where
we have lots of wind turbines, made
usually with American-made steel. We
have proved it in Toledo, where we
have one of the biggest solar energy
manufacturers in the country. We
proved it in the auto industry, where
the auto industry has generally had a
pretty good decade making more fuel-
efficient cars. We put Americans to
work, and we can change course on cli-
mate change before it is too late.
MITCH MCCONNELL and President
Trump seem to think climate change—
that is notwithstanding what Senator
WHITEHOUSE said—is a joke. I have
news for them. Climate change is not
something to play political games
with; it is a crisis we need to confront
and set an example around the world.
It is a crisis we need to confront and to
set an example for our partners around
the world.
It would be shameful enough to have
no ideas and no plan to confront our
biggest threats. But not only do Presi-
dent Trump and Leader McConnell
have no plan, not only are they deny-
ing the problem, and not only are they
standing in the way of solutions, but
they are actually working to make cli-
mate change worse. It is just des-
picable.
They are spreading lies and stacking
the administration with shills for the
fossil fuel industry. They stacked the
administration with Wall Street cro-
nies to do bank regulation. They
stacked the administration with fossil
fuel cronies and shills to do energy and
climate and environmental regulation.
We got news this week that the
White House is going to use your tax-
payer dollars to set up a panel to pro-
mote junk science and spread the de-
bunked conspiracy theory that climate
change is a hoax.
This week we will vote on the Presi-
dent’s nominee to head the EPA, a lob-
byist who would be overseeing the
same special interests who have paid
his salary. Andrew Wheeler is just the
latest in a long line of cronies from the
fossil fuel industry who President
Trump has put in charge at the EPA
and the Department of the Interior.
Climate change is not a future prob-
lem. It does damage to this country
right now. It is threatening thousands
of Ohio workers who rely on Lake Erie
for their livelihood, whether it is tour-
ism or other industries that rely on
clean water.
Climate change makes algal blooms
worse. Off the shores of Toledo, it con-
taminates our lake, threatens our
drinking water, and hurts small busi-
ness. Nobody on that side of the aisle
seems to give a darn.
I have talked to farmers who have
been farming in the Western Lake Erie
Basin for decades. They tell me they
are experiencing heavier rain events
more often and with greater intensity
compared to even 15 years ago. Hotter
summers and shorter winters will only
make this problem worse.
It is time for the President of the
United States to stop sabotaging the
country he is supposed to lead. It is
past time to rejoin the Paris Agree-
ment, to restart the Clean Power Plan,
and to implement aggressive fuel econ-
omy standards for cars and trucks. It is
time to create new jobs in clean energy
and energy-efficient manufacturing. It
is time for the United States to be the
leader the world looks to. It is time to
take this threat seriously to preserve
our country for our children, and their
children, and their children’s children
before it is too late.
S. 311
Madam President, yesterday we saw
yet another attempt by Republican
politicians to put themselves in the
middle of the sacred doctor-patient re-
lationship and to take away the free-
dom of women to make their own
healthcare decisions. Supporters of this
bill, including President Trump, have
spread lies and they spread misin-
formation.
This bill is about intimidating doc-
tors. It is about making it harder for
women to get comprehensive care, and
they simply don’t care. It is despicable.
That is why doctors and medical ex-
perts oppose this bill. Let me give you
a few: the American College of Nurse-
Midwives, the American College of Ob-
stetricians and Gynecologists, the
American Medical Women’s Associa-
tion, the American Public Health Asso-
ciation, the American Society for Re-
productive Medicine, and the Associa-
tion of Physician Assistants in Obstet-
rics and Gynecology. The list goes on
and on.
Yet President Trump and most Re-
publican politicians—most Republican
Members of the Senate—think they
know better than you and your doctor.
It is nothing new. We have seen it over
and over. Washington politicians—
most of them men—are obsessed with
trying to insert themselves into wom-
en’s private healthcare decisions. They

just can’t help themselves. But those
decisions should be and are between a
woman and her doctor—period. That is
why we defeated this bill yesterday. It
is why I will always support women’s
freedom to make their own healthcare
decisions.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT ACT
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President,
before I wrap for the end of the day at
the request of the leader, I want to
share my thanks, my appreciation—
truly, my appreciation—for an action
that the House just took up.
It was just about an hour or so ago
that the House took up the bill that we
had passed out of the Senate here, our
lands and water conservation bill,
which was a very significant measure
of about 120 different conservation,
lands, waters, and sportsmen’s bills—
all rolled into one package—that
passed out of here by 92 to 8. It just
passed out of the House by a signifi-
cant, significant margin.
It is, I think, a real testament not
only to the work that has been done
within this body on a very strong bi-
partisan basis but, really, to the work
that we have done with the House, in
our working with the other body in a
bipartisan, bicameral way. I think it
goes a long way to showing that we
really can come together as a Congress
on issues that are important to each of
us individually.
I give my thanks and my apprecia-
tion to Chairman GRIJALVA, to Mr.
BISHOP, who was the former chairman
of that committee and who worked on
this with us last year, and to all of
their teams, as well as to the House
leadership, which has helped to ad-
vance this to this moment in time.
We look forward to the President’s
signing that very, very shortly, and I
know that it will come as a real posi-
tive moment for so many. I thank all
who helped us with this.

ings and meetings of their respective sub-
committees after consultation with the
Chairman and other subcommittee chairmen
with a view toward avoiding simultaneous
scheduling of full Committee and sub-

respect thereto;
(2) (A) recommend to the Senate by report
or resolution by a majority vote of the full

notice and opportunity for a hearing, that
misconduct occurred warranting discipline
less serious than discipline by the full Sen-
ate;
(4) in the circumstances described in sub-
section (d)(3), issue a public or private letter
of admonition to a Member, officer, or em-
ployee, which shall not be subject to appeal
to the Senate;
(5) recommend to the Senate, by report or
resolution, such additional rules or regula-
tions as the Select Committee shall deter-
mine to be necessary or desirable to insure
proper standards of conduct by Members of
the Senate, and by officers or employees of
the Senate, in the performance of their du-

cers, and employees about the laws, rules,
regulations, and standards of conduct appli-
cable to such individuals in the performance
of their duties.
(b) For the purposes of this resolution—
(1) the term ‘‘sworn complaint’’ means a
written statement of facts, submitted under
penalty of perjury, within the personal
knowledge of the complainant alleging a vio-
lation of law, the Senate Code of Official
Conduct, or any other rule or regulation of
the Senate relating to the conduct of indi-
viduals in the performance of their duties as
Members, officers, or employees of the Sen-
ate;
(2) the term ‘‘preliminary inquiry’’ means
a proceeding undertaken by the Select Com-
mittee following the receipt of a complaint
or allegation of, or information about, mis-
conduct by a Member, officer, or employee of
the Senate to determine whether there is
substantial credible evidence which provides
substantial cause for the Select Committee
to conclude that a violation within the juris-
diction of the Select Committee has oc-
curred; and
(3) the term ‘‘adjudicatory review’’ means
a proceeding undertaken by the Select Com-
mittee after a finding, on the basis of a pre-
liminary inquiry, that there is substantial
credible evidence which provides substantial
cause for the Select Committee to conclude
that a violation within the jurisdiction of
the Select Committee has occurred.
(c) (1) No—
(A) adjudicatory review of conduct of a
Member or officer of the Senate may be con-
ducted;
(B) report, resolution, or recommendation
relating to such an adjudicatory review of
conduct may be made; and
(C) letter of admonition pursuant to sub-
section (d)(3) may be issued, unless approved
by the affirmative recorded vote of no fewer
than 4 members of the Select Committee.
(2) No other resolution, report, rec-
ommendation, interpretative ruling, or advi-
sory opinion may be made without an affirm-
ative vote of a majority of the Members of
the Select Committee voting.
(d) (1) When the Select Committee receives
a sworn complaint or other allegation or in-
formation about a Member, officer, or em-
ployee of the Senate, it shall promptly con-
duct a preliminary inquiry into matters
raised by that complaint, allegation, or in-
formation. The preliminary inquiry shall be
of duration and scope necessary to determine
whether there is substantial credible evi-
dence which provides substantial cause for
the Select Committee to conclude that a vio-
lation within the jurisdiction of the Select
Committee has occurred. The Select Com-
mittee may delegate to the chairman and
vice chairman the discretion to determine
the appropriate duration, scope, and conduct
of a preliminary inquiry.
(2) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry
under paragraph (1), the Select Committee
determines by a recorded vote that there is
not such substantial credible evidence, the
Select Committee shall dismiss the matter.
The Select Committee may delegate to the
chairman and vice chairman the authority,
on behalf of the Select Committee, to dis-
miss any matter that they determine, after a
preliminary inquiry, lacks substantial merit.
The Select Committee shall inform the indi-
vidual who provided to the Select Committee
the complaint, allegation, or information,
and the individual who is the subject of the
complaint, allegation, or information, of the
dismissal, together with an explanation of
the basis for the dismissal.
(3) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry
under paragraph (1), the Select Committee
determines that a violation is inadvertent,
technical, or otherwise of a de minimis na-
ture, the Select Committee may dispose of
the matter by issuing a public or private let-
ter of admonition, which shall not be consid-
ered discipline. The Select Committee may
issue a public letter of admonition upon a
similar determination at the conclusion of
an adjudicatory review.
(4) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry
under paragraph (1), the Select Committee
determines that there is such substantial
credible evidence and the matter cannot be
appropriately disposed of under paragraph
(3), the Select Committee shall promptly ini-
tiate an adjudicatory review. Upon the con-
clusion of such adjudicatory review, the Se-
lect Committee shall report to the Senate, as
soon as practicable, the results of such adju-
dicatory review, together with its rec-
ommendations (if any) pursuant to sub-
section (a)(2).
(e) (1) Any individual who is the subject of
a reprimand or order of restitution, or both,
pursuant to subsection (a)(3) may, within 30
days of the Select Committee’s report to the
Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or
order of restitution, or both, appeal to the
Senate by providing written notice of the
basis for the appeal to the Select Committee
and the presiding officer of the Senate. The
presiding officer of the Senate shall cause
the notice of the appeal to be printed in the
Congressional Record and the Senate Jour-
nal.
(2) A motion to proceed to consideration of
an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be
highly privileged and not debatable. If the
motion to proceed to consideration of the ap-
peal is agreed to, the appeal shall be decided
on the basis of the Select Committee’s report
to the Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be
limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided
equally between, and controlled by, those fa-
voring and those opposing the appeal.
(f) The Select Committee may, in its dis-
cretion, employ hearing examiners to hear
testimony and make findings of fact and/or
recommendations to the Select Committee
concerning the disposition of complaints.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of
this section, no adjudicatory review shall be
initiated of any alleged violation of any law,
the Senate Code of Official Conduct, rule, or
regulation which was not in effect at the
time the alleged violation occurred. No pro-
visions of the Senate Code of Official Con-
duct shall apply to or require disclosure of
any act, relationship, or transaction which
occurred prior to the effective date of the ap-
plicable provision of the Code. The Select
Committee may initiate an adjudicatory re-
view of any alleged violation of a rule or law
which was in effect prior to the enactment of
the Senate Code of Official Conduct if the al-
leged violation occurred while such rule or
law was in effect and the violation was not a
matter resolved on the merits by the prede-
cessor Select Committee.
(h) The Select Committee shall adopt writ-
ten rules setting forth procedures to be used
in conducting preliminary inquiries and ad-
judicatory reviews.
(i) The Select Committee from time to
time shall transmit to the Senate its rec-
ommendation as to any legislative measures
which it may consider to be necessary for
the effective discharge of its duties.

such testimony orally or by deposition; (7)
employ and fix the compensation of a staff
director, a counsel, an assistant counsel, one
or more investigators, one or more hearing

other assistants and consultants as it deems
advisable; and (8) to procure the temporary
services (not in excess of one year) or inter-
mittent services of individual consultants, or
organizations thereof, by contract as inde-
pendent contractors or, in the case of indi-
viduals, by employment at daily rates of
compensation not in excess of the per diem
equivalent of the highest rate of compensa-
tion which may be paid to a regular em-
ployee of the Select Committee.
(b) (1) The Select Committee is authorized
to retain and compensate counsel not em-
ployed by the Senate (or by any department
or agency of the executive branch of the
Government) whenever the Select Com-
mittee determines that the retention of out-
side counsel is necessary or appropriate for
any action regarding any complaint or alle-
gation, which, in the determination of the
Select Committee is more appropriately con-
ducted by counsel not employed by the Gov-
ernment of the United States as a regular
employee.
(2) Any adjudicatory review as defined in
section 2(b)(3) shall be conducted by outside
counsel as authorized in paragraph (1), un-
less the Select Committee determines not to
use outside counsel.
(c) With the prior consent of the depart-
ment or agency concerned, the Select Com-
mittee may (1) utilize the services, informa-
tion and facilities of any such department or

relies upon any provision or finding of an ad-
visory opinion in accordance with the provi-
sions of paragraphs (3) and (4) and who acts

ceding sentence shall be forwarded to the Ad-
ministrator of General Services for disposal

pose of such gift or decoration in such man-
ner as it considers proper, except that such

tions of the Committee with respect to any

shall be notified in writing of the nature of
the particular proceeding and the reason
that it appears that the member may be in-
eligible to participate in it. If the member

ber shall so notify the Chairman or Vice

pending before the Committee and the deter-
minations and recommendations of the Com-
mittee with respect to any such preliminary
inquiry or adjudicatory review.
(4) Whenever any member of the Com-
mittee is ineligible under paragraph (1) to
participate in any preliminary inquiry or ad-
judicatory review, or disqualifies himself or
herself under paragraph (3) from partici-
pating in any preliminary inquiry or adju-
dicatory review, another Senator shall be ap-
pointed by the Senate to serve as a member
of the Committee solely for purposes of such
preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review
and the determinations and recommenda-
tions of the Committee with respect to such
preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review.
Any member of the Senate appointed for
such purposes shall be of the same party as
the member who is ineligible or disqualifies
himself or herself.
(5) The President of the Senate shall be
given written notice of the ineligibility or
disqualification of any member from any
preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or
other proceeding requiring the appointment
of another member in accordance with sub-

the question before the Committee is the ini-
tiation or continuation of a preliminary in-
quiry or an adjudicatory review, or the
issuance of a report or recommendation re-
lated thereto concerning a Member or officer
of the Senate. In any such case an absent
member’s vote may be announced solely for
the purpose of recording the member’s posi-
tion and such announced votes shall not be
counted for or against the motion.
(2) On matters other than matters listed in
paragraph (m)(1) above, the Committee may
order that the record be held open for the
vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if
the absent Committee member has been in-
formed of the matter on which the vote oc-
curs and has affirmatively requested of the
Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that
he be so recorded.
(3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall
be delivered to the Chairman or Vice Chair-
man to be recorded.

ficial Conduct, or any rule or regulation of
the Senate relating to the conduct of any in-
dividual in the performance of his or her
duty as a Member, officer, or employee of the

Chairman, a Committee member, or a Com-
mittee staff member.
(b) SOURCE OF COMPLAINT, ALLEGA-
TION, OR INFORMATION: Complaints, alle-
gations, and information to be reported to
the Committee may be obtained from a vari-
ety of sources, including but not limited to
the following:

statement of facts, submitted under penalty
of perjury, within the personal knowledge of
the complainant alleging a violation of law,

ing to the conduct of individuals in the per-
formance of their duties as members, offi-

conduct or committed a violation;
(3) state the nature of the alleged improper
conduct or violation;
(4) supply all documents in the possession
of the party filing the complaint relevant to
or in support of his or her allegations as an

RULE 3: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING A
PRELIMINARY INQUIRY
(a) DEFINITION OF PRELIMINARY IN-
QUIRY: A ‘‘preliminary inquiry’’ is a pro-
ceeding undertaken by the Committee fol-
lowing the receipt of a complaint or allega-
tion of, or information about, misconduct by
a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate
to determine whether there is substantial
credible evidence which provides substantial
cause for the Committee to conclude that a
violation within the jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee has occurred.
(b) BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY INQUIRY:
The Committee shall promptly commence a
preliminary inquiry whenever it has received
a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or
information about, alleged misconduct or
violations pursuant to Rule 2.
(c) SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY:
(1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such
duration and scope as is necessary to deter-
mine whether there is substantial credible
evidence which provides substantial cause
for the Committee to conclude that a viola-
tion within the jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee has occurred. The Chairman and Vice
Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the
Committee may supervise and determine the
appropriate duration, scope, and conduct of a
preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary
inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman
and Vice Chairman or by the Committee as
a whole, the day to day supervision of a pre-
liminary inquiry rests with the Chairman
and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.
(2) A preliminary inquiry may include any
inquiries, interviews, sworn statements,
depositions, or subpoenas deemed appro-
priate to obtain information upon which to
make any determination provided for by this
Rule.
(d) OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE: A
preliminary inquiry may include an oppor-
tunity for any known respondent or his or
her designated representative to present ei-
ther a written or oral statement, or to re-
spond orally to questions from the Com-
mittee. Such an oral statement or answers

SENATE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1479
February 26, 2019
shall be transcribed and signed by the person
providing the statement or answers.
(e) STATUS REPORTS: The Committee
staff or outside counsel shall periodically re-
port to the Committee in the form and ac-
cording to the schedule prescribed by the
Committee. The reports shall be confiden-
tial.
(f) FINAL REPORT: When the preliminary
inquiry is completed, the staff or outside
counsel shall make a confidential report,
oral or written, to the Committee on find-
ings and recommendations, as appropriate.
(g) COMMITTEE ACTION: As soon as prac-
ticable following submission of the report on
the preliminary inquiry, the Committee
shall determine by a recorded vote whether
there is substantial credible evidence which
provides substantial cause for the Com-
mittee to conclude that a violation within
the jurisdiction of the Committee has oc-
curred. The Committee may make any of the
following determinations:
(1) The Committee may determine that
there is not such substantial credible evi-
dence and, in such case, the Committee shall
dismiss the matter. The Committee, or
Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly
on behalf of the Committee, may dismiss any
matter which, after a preliminary inquiry, is
determined to lack substantial merit. The
Committee shall inform the complainant of
the dismissal.
(2) The Committee may determine that
there is such substantial credible evidence,
but that the alleged violation is inadvertent,
technical, or otherwise of a de minimis na-
ture. In such case, the Committee may dis-
pose of the matter by issuing a public or pri-
vate letter of admonition, which shall not be
considered discipline and which shall not be
subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance
of a letter of admonition must be approved
by the affirmative recorded vote of no fewer
than four members of the Committee voting.
(3) The Committee may determine that
there is such substantial credible evidence
and that the matter cannot be appropriately
disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case,
the Committee shall promptly initiate an
adjudicatory review in accordance with Rule
4. No adjudicatory review of conduct of a
Member, officer, or employee of the Senate
may be initiated except by the affirmative
recorded vote of not less than four members
of the Committee.
RULE 4: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING AN
ADJUDICATORY REVIEW
(a) DEFINITION OF ADJUDICATORY RE-
VIEW: An ‘‘adjudicatory review’’ is a pro-
ceeding undertaken by the Committee after
a finding, on the basis of a preliminary in-
quiry, that there is substantial cause for the
Committee to conclude that a violation
within the jurisdiction of the Committee has
occurred.
(b) SCOPE OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW:
When the Committee decides to conduct an
adjudicatory review, it shall be of such dura-
tion and scope as is necessary for the Com-
mittee to determine whether a violation
within its jurisdiction has occurred. An adju-
dicatory review shall be conducted by out-
side counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1)
of Senate Resolution 338 unless the Com-
mittee determines not to use outside coun-
sel. In the course of the adjudicatory review,
designated outside counsel, or if the Com-
mittee determines not to use outside coun-
sel, the Committee or its staff, may conduct
any inquiries or interviews, take sworn
statements, use compulsory process as de-
scribed in Rule 6, or take any other actions
that the Committee deems appropriate to se-
cure the evidence necessary to make a deter-
mination.
(c) NOTICE TO RESPONDENT: The Com-
mittee shall give written notice to any
known respondent who is the subject of an
adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent
to the respondent no later than five working
days after the Committee has voted to con-
duct an adjudicatory review. The notice
shall include a statement of the nature of
the possible violation, and description of the
evidence indicating that a possible violation
occurred. The Committee may offer the re-
spondent an opportunity to present a state-
ment, orally or in writing, or to respond to
questions from members of the Committee,
the Committee staff, or outside counsel.
(d) RIGHT TO A HEARING: The Com-
mittee shall accord a respondent an oppor-
tunity for a hearing before it recommends
disciplinary action against that respondent
to the Senate or before it imposes an order of
restitution or reprimand (not requiring dis-
cipline by the full Senate).
(e) PROGRESS REPORTS TO COM-
MITTEE: The Committee staff or outside
counsel shall periodically report to the Com-
mittee concerning the progress of the adju-
dicatory review. Such reports shall be deliv-
ered to the Committee in the form and ac-
cording to the schedule prescribed by the
Committee, and shall be confidential.
(f) FINAL REPORT OF ADJUDICATORY
REVIEW TO COMMITTEE: Upon completion
of an adjudicatory review, including any
hearings held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside
counsel or the staff shall submit a confiden-
tial written report to the Committee, which
shall detail the factual findings of the adju-
dicatory review and which may recommend
disciplinary action, if appropriate. Findings
of fact of the adjudicatory review shall be de-
tailed in this report whether or not discipli-
nary action is recommended.
(g) COMMITTEE ACTION:
(1) As soon as practicable following sub-
mission of the report of the staff or outside
counsel on the adjudicatory review, the Com-
mittee shall prepare and submit a report to
the Senate, including a recommendation or
proposed resolution to the Senate concerning
disciplinary action, if appropriate. A report
shall be issued, stating in detail the Commit-
tee’s findings of fact, whether or not discipli-
nary action is recommended. The report
shall also explain fully the reasons under-
lying the Committee’s recommendation con-
cerning disciplinary action, if any. No adju-
dicatory review of conduct of a Member, offi-
cer or employee of the Senate may be con-
ducted, or report or resolution or rec-
ommendation relating to such an adjudica-
tory review of conduct may be made, except
by the affirmative recorded vote of not less
than four members of the Committee.

receipt of the report prescribed by paragraph
(f) of this rule, the Committee may make
any of the following recommendations for
disciplinary action or issue an order for rep-
rimand or restitution, as follows:
(i) In the case of a Member, a recommenda-

payment of restitution, recommendation to
a Member’s party conference regarding the
Member’s seniority or positions of responsi-
bility, or a combination of these;
(ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a
recommendation to the Senate of dismissal,
suspension, payment of restitution, or a
combination of these;
(iii) In the case where the Committee de-
termines, after according to the Member, of-

tunity for a hearing, that misconduct oc-
curred warranting discipline less serious
than discipline by the full Senate, and sub-

ture, issue a public or private letter of admo-
nition to a Member, officer or employee,

Senate.
(3) In the case where the Committee deter-
mines, upon consideration of all the evi-
dence, that the facts do not warrant a find-
ing that there is substantial credible evi-
dence which provides substantial cause for
the Committee to conclude that a violation
within the jurisdiction of the Committee has
occurred, the Committee may dismiss the
matter.
(4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the
adjudicatory review, the Committee’s report
and recommendation, if any, shall be for-
warded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a
copy shall be provided to the complainant
and the respondent. The full report and rec-
ommendation, if any, shall be printed and
made public, unless the Committee deter-
mines by the recorded vote of not less than
four members of the Committee that it
should remain confidential.
(h) RIGHT OF APPEAL:

reprimand or order of restitution, or both,
pursuant to subsection (g)(2)(iii), may, with-
in 30 days of the Committee’s report to the
Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or
order of restitution, or both, appeal to the
Senate by providing written notice of the ap-
peal to the Committee and the presiding offi-
cer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall
cause the notice of the appeal to be printed
in the Congressional Record and the Senate
Journal.
(2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to
proceed to consideration of an appeal pursu-
ant to paragraph (1) shall be highly privi-
leged and not debatable. If the motion to
proceed to consideration of the appeal is
agreed to, the appeal shall be decided on the
basis of the Committee’s report to the Sen-
ate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to
10 hours, which shall be divided equally be-
tween, and controlled by, those favoring and
those opposing the appeal.

information and documents to the Com-
mittee (see (A) and (B) of this subparagraph),

may recommend to the Senate that the of-

mittee for the issuance of subpoenas for the

timony or evidence is relevant and appro-
priate, as determined by the Chairman and

asked of that witness. If the Committee de-
termines that it is necessary, such questions
may be asked by any member of the Com-
mittee, or by any Committee staff member if
directed by a Committee member. The wit-
ness or witness’s counsel may also submit
additional sworn testimony for the record
within twenty-four hours after the last day
that the witness has testified. The insertion
of such testimony in that day’s record is sub-
ject to the approval of the Chairman and
Vice Chairman acting jointly within five

relevant and probative shall be admissible
unless privileged under the Federal Rules of
Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be ap-
plied strictly, but the Presiding Officer shall
exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious tes-
timony. Objections going only to the weight
that should be given evidence will not justify
its exclusion.

any question of the admissibility of testi-
mony or other evidence presented to the
Committee. Such rulings shall be final un-
less reversed or modified by a recorded vote
of not less than four members of the Com-

the Committee shall be guided by the stand-
ards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Fed-
eral Rules of Evidence, except that the Com-
mittee may admit evidence subject to the
provisions of this paragraph only upon a de-
termination of not less than four members of
the full Committee that the interests of jus-
tice require that such evidence be admitted.
(7) SUPPLEMENTARY HEARING PROCE-
DURES: The Committee may adopt any ad-
ditional special hearing procedures that it
deems necessary or appropriate to a par-
ticular adjudicatory hearing. Copies of such
supplementary procedures shall be furnished
to witnesses and respondents, and shall be
made available upon request to any member
of the public.
(k) TRANSCRIPTS:
(1) An accurate stenographic or recorded
transcript shall be made of all public and ex-
ecutive hearings. Any member of the Com-
mittee, Committee staff member, outside
counsel retained by the Committee, or wit-
ness may examine a copy of the transcript
retained by the Committee of his or her own
remarks and may suggest to the official re-
porter any typographical or transcription er-
rors. If the reporter declines to make the re-
quested corrections, the member, staff mem-
ber, outside counsel or witness may request
a ruling by the Chairman and Vice Chair-
man, acting jointly. Any member or witness
shall return the transcript with suggested
corrections to the Committee offices within
five working days after receipt of the tran-
script, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.
If the testimony was given in executive ses-
sion, the member or witness may only in-
spect the transcript at a location determined
by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting
jointly. Any questions arising with respect
to the processing and correction of tran-
scripts shall be decided by the Chairman and
Vice Chairman, acting jointly.
(2) Except for the record of a hearing which
is closed to the public, each transcript shall
be printed as soon as is practicable after re-
ceipt of the corrected version. The Chairman
and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may
order the transcript of a hearing to be print-
ed without the corrections of a member or
witness if they determine that such member
or witness has been afforded a reasonable
time to correct such transcript and such
transcript has not been returned within such
time.
(3) The Committee shall furnish each wit-
ness, at no cost, one transcript copy of that
witness’s testimony given at a public hear-
ing. If the testimony was given in executive
session, then a transcript copy shall be pro-
vided upon request, subject to appropriate
conditions and restrictions prescribed by the
Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any indi-
vidual violates such conditions and restric-
tions, the Committee may recommend by
majority vote that he or she be cited for con-
tempt of Congress.

(b) DEPOSITIONS:
(1) PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE
DEPOSITIONS: Depositions may be taken by
any member of the Committee designated by
the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting
jointly, or by any other person designated by
the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting
jointly, including outside counsel, Com-
mittee staff, other employees of the Senate,
or government employees detailed to the
Committee.
(2) DEPOSITION NOTICES: Notices for the
taking of depositions shall be authorized by
the Committee, or the Chairman and Vice
Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the
Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee
staff member or outside counsel designated
by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting
jointly. Depositions may be taken at any
time during a preliminary inquiry, adjudica-
tory review or other proceeding. Deposition
notices shall specify a time and place for ex-
amination. Unless otherwise specified, the
deposition shall be in private, and the testi-
mony taken and documents produced shall
be deemed for the purpose of these rules to
have been received in a closed or executive
session of the Committee. The Committee
shall not initiate procedures leading to
criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for
a witness’s failure to appear, or to testify, or
to produce documents, unless the deposition
notice was accompanied by a subpoena au-
thorized for issuance by the Committee, or
the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting
jointly.
(3) COUNSEL AT DEPOSITIONS: Wit-
nesses may be accompanied at a deposition
by counsel to advise them of their rights.
(4) DEPOSITION PROCEDURE: Witnesses
at depositions shall be examined upon oath
administered by an individual authorized by
law to administer oaths, or administered by
any member of the Committee if one is
present. Questions may be propounded by
any person or persons who are authorized to
take depositions for the Committee. If a wit-
ness objects to a question and refuses to tes-
tify, or refuses to produce a document, any
member of the Committee who is present
may rule on the objection and, if the objec-
tion is overruled, direct the witness to an-
swer the question or produce the document.
If no member of the Committee is present,
the individual who has been designated by
the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting
jointly, to take the deposition may proceed
with the deposition, or may, at that time or
at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by tele-
phone or otherwise on the objection from the
Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Com-
mittee, who may refer the matter to the
Committee or rule on the objection. If the
Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Com-
mittee upon referral, overrules the objec-
tion, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the
Committee as the case may be, may direct
the witness to answer the question or
produce the document. The Committee shall
not initiate procedures leading to civil or
criminal enforcement unless the witness re-
fuses to testify or produce documents after
having been directed to do so.
(5) FILING OF DEPOSITIONS: Deposition
testimony shall be transcribed or electroni-
cally recorded. If the deposition is tran-
scribed, the individual administering the
oath shall certify on the transcript that the
witness was duly sworn in his or her presence
and the transcriber shall certify that the
transcript is a true record of the testimony.
The transcript with these certifications shall
be filed with the chief clerk of the Com-
mittee, and the witness shall be furnished
with access to a copy at the Committee’s of-
fices for review. Upon inspecting the tran-
script, within a time limit set by the Chair-
man and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, a
witness may request in writing changes in
the transcript to correct errors in tran-
scription. The witness may also bring to the
attention of the Committee errors of fact in
the witness’s testimony by submitting a
sworn statement about those facts with a re-
quest that it be attached to the transcript.
The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting
jointly, may rule on the witness’s request,
and the changes or attachments allowed
shall be certified by the Committee’s chief
clerk. If the witness fails to make any re-
quest under this paragraph within the time
limit set, this fact shall be noted by the
Committee’s chief clerk. Any person author-
ized by the Committee may stipulate with
the witness to changes in this procedure.

FEDERAL DEBT
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, as I
stand before you, we are facing a finan-
cial calamity that could make the last
financial crisis look like the good old
days. I have become aware of a com-
mittee of respected financial industry
experts that has developed a Debt De-
fault Clock, which conceptualizes the
risk associated with a potential Fed-
eral debt crisis that leads to the insol-
vency of the government. The Debt De-
fault Clock is the same concept as the
famous Doomsday Clock, only in this
case illustrating how close we are to
fiscal meltdown.
The Debt Default Clock has 12 factors
that are used to measure the risk asso-
ciated with the burgeoning Federal
debt. The Clock currently stands at 4
minutes to midnight, which means
that insolvency of the Federal Govern-
ment is close at hand, and we have lit-
tle time to act. Although the 12 cri-
teria were developed on the basis of de-
fining the circumstances leading to
government insolvency and default,
they were also created with the idea of
identifying metrics that can be meas-
ured, watched, and compared over time
to identify the time remaining before
the sequence of insolvency and default.
Eight of these factors are already in
negative territory, and the others are
moving in that direction.
In 2010, I ran for the Senate out of
concern that our out-of-control debt
might finally take us off the cliff. It is
frustration with rampant, deficit-fi-
nanced spending that sparked the Tea
Party; yet the situation continues to
get worse. So I urge my colleagues to
find out more about the Debt Default
Clock and the role of Congress, the ad-
ministration, and the States as to how
each of the factors might be mitigated
if the political will exists to do so be-
fore calamity hits us square in the
face.
Accordingly, I respectfully request
that the following information related

There being no objection, the mate-

FOUR MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT: THE REVISED
‘‘FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEBT DEFAULT
CLOCK’’
[From the Default Clock Committee]
Beyond the troubling debt-ceiling
standoffs we witness every few years, looms
a far more dire threat: a true U.S. govern-
ment default, which economists warn could
lead to a collapse of confidence in the Amer-
ican economy, a run on the dollar, and per-
haps even a global economic meltdown.
How close are we to such a catastrophic
federal default?
To answer this question, a group of pri-
vate-sector economists and fiscal policy ex-
perts has formed a citizens’ committee,
called the Debt Default Clock Review Com-
mittee, to maintain an objective, fact-based
federal government Debt Default Clock. The
Clock is designed to help the public to see
and track the nearness of the danger. On
September 10, 2018, the Review Committee
announced significant revisions in the design
of the Clock from its original version to
make it more accurate. This announcement
is found at: https://debtdefaultclock.us/wp-
content/uploads/press-release-02a.pdf.
For the Committee’s purposes, ‘‘default’’ is
defined simply as a failure by the U.S. Treas-
ury to make a scheduled interest payment
on just one direct U.S. Government obliga-
tion such as a Treasury note or bond. ‘‘Insol-
vency’’ is defined as the point beyond which
default becomes a virtual certainty.
Since 2013, Congress has gotten into the
habit of temporarily suspending the govern-
ment’s statutory debt ceiling, for a year or
two at a go, during which time the Treasury
may incur unlimited amounts of debt. This
practice is dangerous. Repealing the debt
ceiling does not repeal the threat of a de-
fault. Indeed, to think that it would or could
is akin to thinking we can be assured of per-
petually sunny days if we simply destroy the
barometer! Congress seems to be telling
itself: ‘‘If I just increase the credit limit on
my credit card, I will never have to pay it
off!’’
The debt ceiling is our most important fis-
cal barometer, and we hope our new Debt De-
fault Clock will help the public to read that
important gauge more easily, by showing us
in a clear and simple way how close we are
to midnight. Its purpose is to spur fiscal pol-
icy makers to change course before it’s too
late.
THE TWELVE TESTS
The Clock continuously measures twelve of
the most relevant budget factors, or tests,
each of which is framed as a simple yes-no
question. At any given moment, the status
of ten of the twelve factors collectively de-
termines the number of minutes from mid-
night the Clock stands at any point in time.
The number of minutes, of course, changes
as time passes and new data is received.
Each factor assesses, not just where things
currently stand, but also where things are
projected to move over the course of the next
ten years. Each of the twelve tests is objec-
tive. None is arbitrary or influenced by opin-
ion.
Here are the twelve factors:
1. Do federal outlays exceed 17.5 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP)?
2. Is there a U.S. dollar-denominated debt
ceiling in law presently, and will the pro-
jected federal debt stay below that ceiling
during the ten-year budget period?
3. Does the debt held by the public exceed
70 percent of GDP, and does the gross federal
debt exceed 100 percent of GDP?
4. Do gross federal interest payments ex-
ceed 15 percent of federal revenues?
5. Do gross federal interest payments, on a
sustained basis, exceed 70 percent of the
money the federal government brings in
through the issuance of new debt?
6. Does the debt held by the public exceed
80 percent of the gross debt?
7. Does the debt held by foreigners exceed
50 percent of the debt held by the public?
8. Will short-term maturities and floating
rate obligations of the Treasury decline from
the current level of 73.1 percent of all mar-
ketable Treasury debt?
9. Are federal revenues below 17.5 percent
of GDP?
10. Does the rate of real U.S. economic
growth, as measured in GDP, exceed 3 per-
cent annually?
11. Has Congress enacted a law prohibiting
the Treasury from resorting to ‘‘extraor-
dinary measures’’ in the future?
12. Is Congress scaling back programmatic
‘‘mandatory spending’’ and eventually phas-
ing it out?
While economists and financial experts
will readily appreciate the relevance of each
of these factors, we realize that the lay read-
er may find them confusing. For everyone’s
benefit, the following is a detailed, plain-
English explanation of each factor, together
with all of its underlying data and assump-
tions.
WARNING: DEFAULT AHEAD
The United States will reach insolvency—
the point of no return—when the federal gov-
ernment fails at least ten of the twelve tests
set according to the questions listed above.
As of right now, the federal government is
currently failing in seven of them. These are
Factors 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 11 and 12, but one (Fac-
tor 9) is projected to right itself before the
end of the current ten-year budget period.
The design of the Clock permits the Review
Committee to discount up to two factors at
any one time. The Committee is currently
discounting Factor 9 in accordance with the
design. The federal government is passing
the remaining four tests now, but are pro-
jected to fail in all of them sometime during
the 10-year budget period.
As of today, the Federal Government De-
fault Clock stands at just four minutes from
midnight. If the federal government remains
on its currently projected fiscal trajectory,
the more politically difficult and economi-
cally painful its choices will become as time
passes.
The Default Clock is ticking.
DATABASES BEHIND TEN OF THE FACTORS OF
DEBT DEFAULT CLOCK
(Note: graphs for each of the factors are
shown at https://DebtDefaultClock.us)
FACTOR #1: DO FEDERAL OUTLAYS EXCEED 17.5
PERCENT OF GDP?
The data associated with Factor #1 in the
initial Debt Default Clock showed that fed-
eral outlays were already well above 17.5 per-
cent of GDP, and peaked in the final year of
the budget period (2027) at 23.1 percent of
GDP. The updated version shows that in the
final year of the current budget period (2028)
outlays will rise to 23.3 percent of GDP.
Thus, Factor #1 remains set at buying zero
minutes from midnight. The data bases for
this factor are as follows: (1) Congressional
Budget Office, ‘‘Budget and Economic Data,’’
under the headings ‘‘Historical Budget Data/
Revenues, Outlays, Deficits, Surpluses, and
Debt Held by the Public Since 1967 to 2017,’’
April 2018; and (2) ‘‘10-Year Budget Projec-
tions/CBO’s Baseline Budget Projections, by
Category,’’ April 2018.
FACTOR #2: IS THERE A DOLLAR-DENOMINATED
DEBT CEILING IN PLACE, AND IF SO, DOES THE
DEBT SUBJECT TO LIMIT STAY UNDER THE
CEILING DURING THE BUDGET PERIOD?
Currently, there is no dollar-denominated
debt ceiling in place because the debt ceiling

law has been suspended. Thus, Factor #2 also
buys zero minutes from midnight. Accord-
ingly, there are no data bases and graph as-
sociated with Factor #2 at this point. They
will appear when a dollar-denominated debt
ceiling is put back into place.
FACTOR #3: DOES THE DEBT HELD BY THE PUB-
LIC EXCEED 70 PERCENT OF GDP, AND DOES
THE GROSS DEBT EXCEED 100 PERCENT OF GDP?
Under the initial Default Clock setting,
the gross debt peaked in the final year of the
budget period (2027) at just under 110 percent
of GDP. The initial version did not include
data on the debt held by the public. The cur-
rent version shows that the gross debt will
again peak in the final year of the budget pe-
riod (2028) at over 113 percent of GDP. The
debt held by the public is also projected to
peak in 2028 at over 96 percent of GDP. Since
both the debt held by the public and the
gross debt exceeded 70 and 100 percent of
GDP respectively in 2012, and are projected
to grow, Factor #3 will continue to buy zero
minutes from midnight. The data bases for
Factor #3 are as follows: (1) Office of Man-
agement and Budget, ‘‘Historical Tables,’’
Table 7.1, February 2018; (2) Congressional
Budget Office, ‘‘Budget and Economic Data,’’
under the headings ‘‘10-Year Budget Projec-
tions/Federal Debt Projected in CBOs Base-
line,’’ Table 5, April 2018; and (3) Congres-
sional Budget Office, ‘‘Budget and Economic
Data,’’ under the headings ‘‘10-Year Eco-
nomic Projections/April 2018 Baseline Projec-
tion—Data Release (Fiscal Year).’’
FACTOR #4: WILL GROSS INTEREST COSTS
EXCEED 15 PERCENT OF FEDERAL REVENUES?
In the initial Default Clock assessment,
gross federal interest costs were projected to
exceed 15 percent of federal revenues in 2020.
The revised assessment shows the threshold
will be exceeded this year. This is shown in
the accompanying graph. While the actual
data is not yet available, the gross interest
costs may already be above 15 percent of rev-
enues, and are all but certain to remain
above this threshold during the budget pe-
riod. For the time being, Factor #4 continues
to buy one minute from midnight. It remains
likely, however, that Factor #4 will buy no
minutes away from midnight at the time of
the next assessment. If so, this will force the
Clock to three minutes from midnight if all
the other factors remain stable relative to
their thresholds. The data bases for this Fac-
tor are as follows: (1) Department of the
Treasury, ‘‘Interest Expense on the Debt
Outstanding,’’ at here (accessed April 12,
2018); (2) Congressional Budget Office, ‘‘Budg-
et and Economic Data,’’ under the headings
‘‘Historical Budget Data/Historical Budget
Data/ Revenues, Outlays, Deficits, Surpluses,
and Debt Held by the Public Since 1967,’’
April 2018, here; and (3) Congressional Budget
Office, ‘‘Budget and Economic Data,’’ under
the headings ‘‘10-Year Budget Projections/
CBO’s Baseline Budget Projections by Cat-
egory’’ and ‘‘Spending Projections by Budget
Account’’ (specifically Line 1682, ‘‘Interest
on Treasury Debt Securities (gross)’’), April
2018, also here. The formula for Factor #4 is:
gross interest costs ÷ federal revenues = per-
cent of federal revenues going to cover gross
interest costs.
FACTOR #5: DO GROSS FEDERAL INTEREST PAY-
MENTS, ON A SUSTAINED BASIS, EXCEED 70
PERCENT OF THE MONEY THE FEDERAL GOV-
ERNMENT BRINGS IN THROUGH THE ISSUANCE
OF NEW DEBT?
The original version of the Default Clock
estimated that the level of gross interest
costs would exceed 70 percent of the money
brought in by the issuance of new debt (in
net terms) in 2023. The updated version
shows the cross-over point should be reached
in the same year. Thus, Factor #5 continues
to buy one minute from midnight. The data
bases for this factor are: (1) Office of Man-
agement and Budget, ‘‘Historical Tables,’’
Table 7.1, February 2018, at https://
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/;
(2) Congressional Budget Office, ‘‘Budget and
Economic Data,’’ under the headings ‘‘10-
Year Budget Projections/Federal Debt Pro-
jected in CBOs Baseline,’’ Table 5, April 2018;
(3) Department of the Treasury, ‘‘Interest
Expense on the Debt Outstanding,’’ (accessed
April 12, 2018); and (4) Congressional Budget
Office, ‘‘Budget and Economic Data,’’ under
the headings ‘‘10-Year Budget Projections/
CBO’s Baseline Budget Projections by Cat-
egory’’ and ‘‘Spending Projections by Budget
Account’’ (specifically Line 1682, ‘‘Interest
on Treasury Debt Securities (gross)’’), April
2018.
FACTOR #6: DOES THE DEBT HELD BY THE PUB-
LIC EXCEED 80 PERCENT OF THE GROSS DEBT?
The original version of the Default Clock
estimated that the debt held by the public
would exceed 80 percent of the gross debt
starting in 2025. This same year is the esti-
mated cross-over point for Factor #6 under
the updated Default Clock. Once again, this
Factor will buy one minute from midnight.
The data bases for this factor are: 1) Office of
Management and Budget, ‘‘Historical Ta-
bles,’’ Table 7.1, February 2018, here; and 2)
Congressional Budget Office, ‘‘Budget and
Economic Data,’’ under the headings ‘‘His-
torical Budget Data/Revenues, Outlays, Defi-
cits, Surpluses, and Debt Held by the Public
Since 1967’’ and ‘‘10-Year Budget Projections/
CBO’s Baseline Budget Projections, by Cat-
egory,’’ April 2018, here.
FACTOR #7: DOES THE DEBT HELD BY FOR-
EIGNERS EXCEED 50 PERCENT OF THE DEBT
HELD BY THE PUBLIC?
The original version of the Default Clock
showed that the share of the debt held by the
public owned by foreigners would exceed 50
percent in 2021. The updated version of the
Clock shows this Factor’s cross-over date re-
mains 2021. Thus, Factor #8 continues to buy
one minute from midnight. The data bases
for this Factor are: 1) here, under the head-
ing ‘‘Ownership of Federal Securities;’’ 2)
here (accessed on April 13, 2018); and 3) here,
February 2018.
FACTOR #8: WILL SHORT-TERM MATURITIES AND
FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS OF THE TREAS-
URY DECLINE FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL OF
73.1 PERCENT OF ALL MARKETABLE TREASURY
DEBT?
The Monthly Statement of the Public Debt
of The United States (the ‘‘Monthly State-
ment’’) describes six types of securities com-
prising the marketable Treasury debt out-
standing. They are Treasury Bills (‘‘Bills’’),
Treasury Notes (‘‘Notes’’), Treasury Bonds
(‘‘Bonds’’), Treasury Inflation-Protected Se-
curities (‘‘TIPS’’), Treasury Floating Rate
Notes (‘‘FRN’s’’) and Federal Financing
Bank (‘‘FFB’’) securities. The Monthly
Statements, including attached Excel
spreadsheets, are available at https://
www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/
mspd/mspd.htm.
Treasury Bills are short-term obligations
with a maturity of less than one year. Treas-
ury Notes are issued with maturities of be-
tween one and ten years. Treasury Bonds are
issued with maturities in excess of ten years.
For purposes of the Debt Default Clock on
any given date, all Bills and previously
issued Notes and Bonds maturing within five
years of that date, along with all TIPS and
FRN’s, which are adjustable rate securities
subject to periodic adjustments in their in-
terest rates, are categorized as short-term
maturities and floating rate obligations
(‘‘STMFROs’’). The Monthly Statement does
not provide the maturity dates for FFB secu-
rities, but generally describes them as long
term. Thus, they are not included in
STMFROs and set aside here.
As of September 30, 2018, all the STMFROs
constituted 73.1 percent of all the market-
able Treasury debt outstanding, as measured
in dollars. This structure of the marketable
debt jeopardizes the financial position of the
Treasury by leaving it vulnerable to in-
creases in both the inflation rate and inter-
est rates. Specifically, Treasury interest
costs would rise very quickly with higher in-
flation and interest rates because of the cur-
rent structure of the debt. It is the view of
the Debt Default Clock Review Committee
that the portion of all Treasury marketable
securities made up by the STMFROs, as
measured in dollars, should be reduced to 50
percent of the total. Factor #8 of the Debt
Default Clock will move the minute hand
one minute away from midnight for every
five percentage points reduced from the 71.3
percent of marketable securities that con-
stitute the STMFROs at the end of fiscal
year 2018. Currently, Factor #8 buys zero
minutes from midnight. The formula for ar-
riving at this percentage at any particular
time is as follows: the value of the STMFROs
÷ the total value of all marketable securities
outstanding = percent of all marketable se-
curities in STMFROs.
FACTOR #9: ARE FEDERAL REVENUES BELOW 17.5
PERCENT OF GDP?
The data bases for this Factor are found at:
Congressional Budget Office, ‘‘The Budget
and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028,’’ April 9,
2018, pp. 67 and 145, here. There is no formula
for the projected data under this factor be-
cause CBO provides the amounts directly.
Federal revenues were at 17.3 percent of
GDP in 2017. CBO projects they will fall to
16.5 percent in 2019, but grow to the 17.5 per-
cent of GDP in 2025 and exceed 18 percent of
GDP before the end of the budget period.
Given that Factor #9 is the only factor
among the 12 that moves in the right direc-
tion over the course of the budget period,
this factor is currently discounted by the Re-
view Committee.
FACTOR #10: DOES REAL RATE OF U.S. ECONOMIC
GROWTH, AS MEASURED IN GDP, MEET OR EX-
CEED 3 PERCENT ANNUALLY?
The data bases for Factor #10 are found at:
1) Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), De-
partment of Commerce, here, Table 5 under
‘‘Tables Only,’’ under the heading ‘‘Gross Do-
mestic Product’’ (historical data); 2) Con-
gressional Budget Office, ‘‘The Budget and
Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028,’’ April 9,
2018, p. 140, here (projected data). There is no
formula for either the historical or projected
data on Factor #10 because BEA and CBO
provide the data directly.
GDP grew at the rate of 2.3 percent in real
terms in 2017. CBO projects will reach a rate
of 3 percent in 2019, but will fall below 3 per-
cent in each of the remaining years of the
ten-year budget period. Therefore, Factor
#10 currently buys no minutes from mid-
night.
FACTOR #11: HAS CONGRESS ENACTED A LAW
PROHIBITING THE TREASURY FROM RESORTING
TO ‘‘EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES’’ IN THE FU-
TURE?
This is a purely qualitative factor. It ad-
justs the minute hand on the Debt Default
Clock on the basis of the legislative actions
or the lack thereof taken by Congress in the
applicable legislative period. Specifically, if
either house of Congress has passed such a
bill during the current Congress, it will buy
one minute away from midnight. If such a
law is enacted and remains on the books at
the time of the applicable review by the Re-
view Committee, it will buy two minutes
from midnight. Therefore, there are neither

data bases, nor formulas, nor graphs associ-
ated with Factor #11. Since current law per-
mits the Treasury to undertake extraor-
dinary measures, Factor #11 buys no minutes
from midnight at this time.
FACTOR #12: IS CONGRESS SCALING BACK PRO-
GRAMMATIC ‘‘MANDATORY SPENDING’’ AND
EVENTUALLY PHASING IT OUT?
Mandatory programmatic spending, which
sets aside net interest payments, does not re-
quire the annual appropriation of money by
Congress. Effectively, these spending pro-
grams are on autopilot. According to CBO,
programmatic mandatory spending was more
than $2.5 trillion in 2017. It projects this
spending to grow to more than $4.5 trillion in
2028.
Congress needs to rein in these programs
by moving them back into the appropriated
accounts of the budget. By starting to take
such steps, Congress should be able to reduce
this category of spending dramatically. In
fact, it should phase it out altogether. Under
the Debt Default Clock, if Congress returns
enough of this spending to the appropriated
category so that by the end of the ten-year
budget period the mandatory category is less
than what it was in 2017, it will buy one
minute away from midnight. If the manda-
tory category is projected to be phased out
altogether by the end of the budget period, it
will buy two minutes from midnight. There-
fore, Factor #12 currently buys no minutes
from midnight.
The data bases for Factor #12 are found at:
the Congressional Budget Office, ‘‘The Budg-
et and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028,’’ April
9, 2018, pp. 44 and 148, here. The formula for
calculating whether mandatory spending is
increasing or decreasing during the projected
budget period under Factor #12 is: manda-
tory outlays (less offsetting receipts)—$2.5
trillion (mandatory spending in 2017) = dollar
level increase (decrease) in mandatory
spending. If mandatory spending is projected
by CBO to be at zero dollars before the end
of the budget period, it will be considered to
have been phased out.

GRAND CANYON CENTENNIAL
Ms. MCSALLY. Madam President, in
January 1908, President Theodore Roo-
sevelt famously declared, ‘‘Let this
great wonder of nature remain as it is
now. You cannot improve on it.’’ He
said these words while designating the
Grand Canyon as a national monu-
ment. Eleven years later, it became a
National Park, and today marks the
centennial of that designation.
Known as one of the Seven Natural
Wonders of the World, the Grand Can-
yon is more than history to Arizona, it
is a part of who we are. Millions of visi-
tors come to see this magnificent na-
tional park, from its archeological
sites to its one-of-a-kind trails; and for
centuries, this vast array of canyons
and mountains has served as a home to
many different peoples, including
many Native American tribes.
It was in 1869 that geologist John
Wesley Powell first led an expedition
down the hazardous Colorado River,
during which he noted the ancient
clues he found hidden in the layers of
rock that told the story of its creation.
His expedition led to future explo-
rations further chartering and mapping
the great canyon. By the time it offi-
cially became a National Park in 1919,
the Grand Canyon attracted some
44,000 visitors. Today, Arizona hosts
more than 6 million visitors each year,
and with a total economic impact of al-
most $1 billion a year, it is the greatest
attraction in our State.
All Americans, but especially Arizo-
nans, are truly blessed to have such a
natural wonder to visit like the Grand
Canyon. I share in Teddy Roosevelt’s
amazement, passion, and wonderment
of the Grand Canyon, and I will con-
tinue to advocate for this park so that
it may last for many more generations
to come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
f
RECOGNIZING THE FORT SMITH
NOON LIONS CLUB
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President,
today I wish to recognize and congratu-
late the Fort Smith Noon Lion’s Club
on its centennial celebration.
The Fort Smith Noon Lions Club
first met on March 8, 1919, only 2 years
after the creation of Lions Club Inter-
national. With 25 charter members, the
club’s mission was to encourage fellow-
ship and civic participation by local
businessmen. Many prominent business
leaders were part of that founding
group, including Dr. Charles Holt,
founder of Holt Crock Clinic; Fagan
Bourland, who served as the city’s
mayor for many years; and W.E. Har-
ding, the founder of Harding Glass, one
of the city’s largest companies at the
time.
The club met for many years at the
historic Goldman Hotel in downtown
Fort Smith and, later, at the Ward
Hotel on Garrison Avenue. Among its
earliest projects was supporting the
Victory Loan Campaign designed to
pay off debt from WWI. In the early
days, it held festivals, hosted free con-
certs, and played an annual baseball
game against the local Rotary Club.
In addition to supporting local causes
and providing a networking tool for
businessmen, the club’s mission came
into focus after Helen Keller spoke at
the Lions Club International conven-
tion in 1925. She concluded her speech
by saying, ‘‘I appeal to you Lions, you
who have your sight, your hearing, you
who are strong and brave and kind.
Will you not constitute yourselves
Knights of the Blind in this crusade
against darkness?’’ Her eloquent plea
transformed the Lions and made sight
conservation the organization’s pri-
mary mission.
Throughout its 100-year history, the
Fort Smith Noon Lions Club has con-
tributed greatly to this mission by
raising money to provide eye exams
and glasses to local students and
adults. Lions Club members have also
collected thousands of pairs of glasses
which are donated to the Southern Col-
lege of Optometry in Memphis where
students take the glasses on inter-
national mission trips.
In recent years, the Fort Smith Noon
Lions Club has donated more than
$100,000 to help local residents with
sight preservation and provided sup-
port to many local children’s organiza-
tions including the Fort Smith Boys
Club, Good Samaritan Clinic, Clearing-
house Backpack Program, Special
Olympics, and the Children’s Emer-
gency Shelter.
In addition, the club has provided all
of the equipment and support needed
for the Safety Patrol program in the
Fort Smith Public Schools since 1946.
As an optometrist whose hometown
is Fort Smith, AR, I am proud of the
great work done by this club and Lions
chapters around the world.
I congratulate the Fort Smith Noon
Lions Club on its 100th anniversary and
hope that these Knights for the Blind
continue to prosper in their mission.∑

TRIBUTE TO OLIVER DIEZ
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today
I recognize Oliver Diez, the Miami-
Dade County Teacher of the Year from
Palmetto Elementary School in
Pinecrest, FL.
Oliver received this award in recogni-
tion for his dedication to teaching chil-
dren a passion for music before they
leave elementary school. He begins
teaching students how to play an intro-
ductory instrument, the recorder, at an
early age. From there, they can join
one of his school’s before and after-
school offerings of chorus, concert
band, jazz combo, orchestra, and drum-
line. Once they join a music program,
his lessons focus on teaching them not
only how to play instruments, but also
its history. He believes this builds an
appreciation for music in his young
students.
Throughout his two-decade long
teaching career at Palmetto Elemen-
tary School, he has built a successful
music program at south Florida’s larg-
est elementary school. His fourth and
fifth grade student were invited to play
at Carnegie Hall in New York City this
March, the only elementary school stu-
dents to play. While he believes teach-
ing is messy at times, he knows it
unites students to work together for
the final performance.
Oliver graduated from Florida Inter-
national University with his bachelor’s
degree in 1999 and returned for his mas-
ter’s degree in 2016, both majoring in
music education. He also helped launch
a booster club at his school that is a
registered nonprofit for travel expenses
for performances.
I express my sincere appreciation to
Oliver for all of the accomplished work
with his students and wish him contin-
ued success in the years to come.∑

trajectories of his students for the bet-
ter. After receiving this award, Ian
noted that it was not just him being
recognized, but also his students for
their success.
Ian urges his students to strive for
greatness in their middle school and
high school coursework in preparation
for the college workload. He focuses on
ensuring his classroom feels like a sec-
ond home to his students when they
struggle and are in need of support.
Many of Ian’s students come from
difficult circumstances, so he works to
establish strong relationships and cre-
ate a positive environment for them.
He dedicates his time to listening to
the needs of his students and conveying
to them that he cares about their well-
being. Eighty percent of his students
are accepted into 4-year universities
and many stay in contact with him

indicated:
POM–6. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio
condemning the Boycott, Divestment, and
Sanctions movement and the increasing
incidences of anti-Semitism; to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 10
Whereas, the citizens of the State of Ohio
have a history of standing against bigotry,
oppression, discrimination, and injustice;
and
Whereas, Ohio and Israel have a long his-
tory of friendship and are great allies in sup-
port of each other’s interests; and
Whereas, the State of Israel, the only de-
mocracy in the Middle East, is the greatest
friend and ally of the United States in the
Middle East; and
Whereas, Ohio is committed to increasing
the ties and interactions in business, govern-
ment, the arts, culture, and education be-
tween the State of Ohio and the State of
Israel, further strengthening the historic
ties between our State and that country; and
Whereas, ties between Ohio’s and Israel’s
academic, research, business, and nonprofit
communities are both robust and long-
standing; and
Whereas, the elected representatives of
Ohio recognize the importance of expressing
their unabridged support for the Jewish peo-
ple and the State of Israel’s right to exist
and thrive, and their unabridged support for
Israel’s right of self-defense; and
Whereas, there are increasing incidents of
anti-Semitism around the world, including
across the United States and in Ohio, includ-
ing desecration of Jewish religious sites; and
Whereas, the international Boycott, Di-
vestment, and Sanctions movement is one of
the main vehicles for legitimizing anti-Semi-
tism on campus and advocating the elimi-
nation of the Jewish State; and
Whereas, anti-Israel activities and activi-
ties promoting the Boycott, Divestment, and
Sanctions movement against Israel are wide-
spread in the State of Ohio, including on sev-
eral university campuses and in other Ohio
communities, and contribute to anti-Semitic
and anti-Zionistic propaganda and threats to
both American and Israeli Jewish students,
and result in deliberate interference with the
learning environment of all students; and
Whereas, the dramatic increase in Boycott,
Divestment, and Sanctions campaign activi-
ties on college campuses around the country
has resulted in increased animosity and in-
timidation against Jewish students, nega-
tively impacting student programming of
vital importance to all American students
related to the State of Israel and politics in
the Middle East; and
Whereas, leaders of the Boycott, Divest-
ment, and Sanctions movement say their
goal is to eliminate Israel as the home of the
Jewish people, and signs and messaging at
anti-Israel rallies have adopted the Boycott,
Divestment, and Sanctions movement’s
theme slogan, ‘‘Palestine forever, Israel
Never Ever’’ meaning that the State of Israel
would cease to exist, falsely denying the
Jewish people’s and Israel’s historical con-
nection to its ancient home in the Land of
Israel, including the present day State of
Israel, and Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria,
which were the heartland of the ancient na-
tions of Israel and Judah; and
Whereas, Ohio’s elected representatives
who defend the inalienable right to free
speech understand that the goals and activi-
ties of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions
campaigns in Ohio are harmful to the State’s
relationships with Ohio’s Jewish citizens,
with Ohio’s non-Jewish citizens who support
the State of Israel and the Jewish people,
and with the Jewish homeland, Israel, and
have a deleterious impact on the educational
environment; and
Whereas, the Boycott, Divestment, and
Sanctions campaign’s call for academic boy-
cotts has been condemned by many of our
nation’s largest academic associations, over
two hundred fifty university presidents, and
many other leading scholars as a violation of
the bedrock principle of academic freedom;
and
Whereas, the members of the General As-
sembly condemn all groups, including white
nationalist, neo-Nazi, and national socialist
groups, that promote hatred, religious perse-
cution, or violence towards others; Now
therefore be it
Resolved, That the members of the General
Assembly condemn the international Boy-
cott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement
and its activities in Ohio for legitimizing
anti-Semitism and for seeking to undermine
the Jewish people’s right to self-determina-
tion, which they are fulfilling in the State of
Israel; and be it further
Resolved, That the members of the General
Assembly condemn activities that con-
tribute directly or indirectly to the denial,
violation, or delegitimization of any people’s
academic freedom, including, but not limited
to, promotion of academic boycotts by the
Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions move-
ment against Israel; and be it further
Resolved, That the members of the General
Assembly consider the international Boy-
cott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement
and its agenda inherently antithetical and
deeply damaging to the causes of peace, jus-
tice, equality, democracy, and human rights
for all peoples in the Middle East and in the
United States; and be it further
Resolved, That we, the members of the
132nd General Assembly of the State of Ohio,
reaffirm our support for the State of Israel,
recognize that the Jewish people are indige-
nous to the land of Israel, condemn all at-
tacks on the people of Israel, support Israel’s
right to engage in lawful acts of self-defense,
and oppose all attempts to deny the legit-
imacy of Israel as a sovereign state; and be
it further
Resolved, That we, the members of the
132nd General Assembly of the State of Ohio,
reaffirm our position that the trustees, ad-
ministrators, and educators at all levels in
our universities in Ohio, must take an active
stand against all anti-Semitic actions and
intimidation taken against Jewish students
on their campuses, whereby all students may
feel safe, and be safe, from harm due to these
pernicious activities; and be it further

February 26, 2019
Resolved, That the members of the General
Assembly encourage and support the exercise
of free speech and civil debate, particularly
on college campuses, and further encourage
university and college administrations to
curb any impediments to free speech and any
abridgment of free speech on campus by any
individuals or groups, and urge them to take
disciplinary action against all students, fac-
ulty, and administrators who engage in ac-
tions that abridge free speech on campus in
violation of the First Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States; and be it
further
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of
Representatives transmit duly authenticated
copies of this resolution to the President of
the United States, the Speaker and Clerk of
the United States House of Representatives,
the President and Secretary of the United
States Senate, the Chancellor of Higher Edu-
cation and each of the nine members of the
Ohio Board of Regents, the provosts and
chairpersons of the boards of trustees of all
Ohio public and private colleges and univer-
sities, and the Israeli Embassy in Wash-
ington, D.C., for transmission to the proper
authorities in the State of Israel.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED

S. 568. A bill to amend the Child Care
and Development Block Grant Act of
1990 and the Head Start Act to promote
child care and early learning, and for
other purposes; to the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions.
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I come
to the floor today to express my sup-
port for the Child Care for Working
Families Act, which I was proud to in-
troduce earlier this afternoon with
Senators MURRAY, CASEY, and 30 of our
Senate colleagues.
We know that investments in early
childhood programs are foundational
for future academic and social success.
Yet child care remains unaffordable for
too many working families in the
United States.
For parents worried about how to pay
for basic living expenses like housing,
food, education, and transportation, in-
creasing child care costs can place a
heavy burden on family budgets.
As a young immigrant from Japan
who was raised by a single, working
mother, I understand the difficult deci-
sions families have to make every day
to survive. I have experienced these
challenges firsthand. Yet, all these
years later, for many Hawaii families,
child care costs exceed all other ex-
penses besides housing.
On average, Hawaii parents can ex-
pect to pay $8,280 per year, or $690 per
month, in child care expenses. These
costs are 25 percent higher than they
were just a decade ago, but wages have
hardly kept pace. As a result, Hawaii
families will dedicate around 11 per-
cent of their family budget to child
care—exceeding the government’s
standard for affordable care.
Unfortunately, even for families that
can afford child care, finding that need-
ed care may be difficult. This is be-
cause our early childhood educators
and child care workers are overworked
and underpaid. In addition, there is a
severe need for more facilities to ac-
commodate the families that need
them. The need is great, and that is
why the Child Care for Working Fami-
lies Act is so important. This legisla-
tion will make sure working families
have access to high-quality, affordable
early childhood programs.
Specifically, the bill expands the ex-
isting Child Care and Development
Block Grant program to guarantee
that working and middle class families
have access to affordable child care—
ensuring that these families do not
have to pay more than 7 percent of
their income toward care, regardless of
how many children they have.
The bill also expands Head Start to
promote universal preschool for young
children.
Additionally, the bill also addresses
the need to support our early childhood
workers by making sure teachers, care
givers, and other workers responsible
for our children are fairly-compensated
and fully-supported with training and
professional development opportuni-
ties.
These are the core provisions of the
bill, which represents an essential in-
vestment in the stability and pros-
perity of working families in Hawaii
and across our Nation. Every family
deserves access to high-quality, afford-
able early childhood programs, and we
will continue fighting to make child
care more affordable for all children.
I thank my colleagues for their con-
tinued support in this effort, and urge
support for this important legislation.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS
SENATE RESOLUTION 78—RECOG-
NIZING THE NATIONAL DEBT AS
A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECU-
RITY
Mr. PERDUE (for himself, Ms. ERNST,
Mr. LANKFORD, Mr. MORAN, Mr.
ROUNDS, and Mr. SASSE) submitted the
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Finance:
S. RES. 78
Whereas, in February 2019, the total public
debt outstanding was more than
$22,000,000,000,000, resulting in a total inter-
est expense of more than $192,000,000,000 for
fiscal year 2019;
Whereas, on December 21, 2018, the total
public debt as a percentage of gross domestic
product was 104 percent;
Whereas the last balanced Federal budget
was signed into law in 1997;
Whereas, in fiscal year 2018, Federal tax re-
ceipts totaled $3,329,000,000,000, but Federal
outlays totaled $4,108,000,000,000, leaving the
Federal Government with a 1-year deficit of
$779,000,000,000;
Whereas, every year since the last bal-
anced Federal budget was signed in 1997,
Congress has failed to maintain a fiscally re-
sponsible budget and has typically relied on
raising the debt ceiling;
Whereas the Social Security and Medicare
Boards of Trustees project that the Federal
Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be de-
pleted in 2026;
Whereas the Social Security and Medicare
Boards of Trustees project that the Federal
Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund
and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust
Fund will be depleted in 2034;
Whereas the credit rating of the United
States was reduced by Standard and Poor’s
from AAA to AA+ on August 5, 2011, and has
remained at that level since that date;
Whereas, without a targeted effort to bal-
ance the Federal budget, the credit rating of
the United States is certain to continue to
fall;
Whereas the National Security Strategy
issued by President Donald Trump highlights
the need to reduce the national debt through
fiscal responsibility;
Whereas, on April 12, 2018, former Sec-
retary of Defense James Mattis warned that
‘‘any Nation that can’t keep its fiscal house
in order eventually cannot maintain its mili-
tary power’’;
Whereas, on March 6, 2018, Director of Na-
tional Intelligence Dan Coats warned: ‘‘Our
continued plunge into debt is unsustainable
and represents a dire future threat to our
economy and to our national security’’;
Whereas, on November 15, 2017, former Sec-
retaries of Defense Leon Panetta, Ash Car-
ter, and Chuck Hagel warned: ‘‘Increase in
the debt will, in the absence of a comprehen-
sive budget that addresses both entitlements
and revenues, force even deeper reductions in
our national security capabilities’’; and
Whereas, on September 22, 2011, former
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mi-
chael Mullen warned: ‘‘I believe the single,
biggest threat to our national security is
debt’’: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes that the national debt is a
threat to the national security of the United
States;
(2) realizes that deficits are unsustainable,
irresponsible, and dangerous; and
(3) commits to addressing the fiscal crisis
faced by the United States.

HOLLEN, Mr. WARNER, Mr. WICKER, Mr.
WYDEN, and Ms. ERNST) submitted the
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to:
S. RES. 79
Whereas a competitive global economy re-
quires workers who are prepared for skilled
professions;
Whereas, in the next decade, an estimated
3,000,000 new workers will be needed in infra-
structure positions in the United States, in-
cluding in positions for designing, building,
and operating transportation, housing, utili-
ties, and telecommunications facilities;
Whereas career and technical education
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘CTE’’) en-
sures that competitive and skilled workers
are ready, willing, and capable of holding
jobs in high-wage, high-skill, and in-demand
career fields such as science, technology, en-
gineering, mathematics, nursing, allied
health, construction, information tech-
nology, energy sustainability, and many
other career fields that are vital in keeping
the United States competitive in the global
economy;
Whereas CTE helps the United States meet
the very real and immediate challenges of
economic development, student achieve-
ment, and global competitiveness;
Whereas the United States has 30,000,000
jobs with an average income of $55,000 per
year that do not require a bachelor’s degree
yet increasingly require some level of post-
secondary education;
Whereas nearly 12,200,000 students are en-
rolled in CTE across the country at the sec-
ondary and postsecondary levels, with CTE
programs in thousands of CTE centers, com-
prehensive high schools, career academies,
and CTE high schools, and nearly 1,000 2-year
colleges;
Whereas CTE matches employability skills
with workforce demand and provides rel-
evant academic and technical coursework
leading to industry-recognized credentials
for secondary, postsecondary, and adult
learners;
Whereas CTE affords students the oppor-
tunity to gain the knowledge, skills, and cre-
dentials needed to secure careers in growing,
high-demand fields;
Whereas secondary CTE is associated with
a lower probability of dropping out of high
school and a higher likelihood of graduating
on-time;
Whereas CTE students were significantly
more likely than non-CTE students to report
having developed problem-solving, project
completion, research, math, college applica-
tion, work-related, communication, time
management, and critical thinking skills
during high school;
Whereas, according to an American Fed-
eration of Teachers poll, 94 percent of par-
ents approve of expanding access to CTE and
other programs that prepare students for
jobs;
Whereas students at schools with highly
integrated rigorous academic and CTE pro-
grams are significantly more likely to meet
college and career readiness benchmarks
than students at schools with less integrated
programs;
Whereas, last year, Congress affirmed the
importance of CTE by passing the Strength-
ening Career and Technical Education for
the 21st Century Act (Public Law 115–224),
which supports program improvement in sec-
ondary and postsecondary CTE programs in
all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puer-
to Rico, the United States Virgin Islands,
and outlying areas; and
Whereas February 23, 2019, marks the 102d
anniversary of the signing of the Act of Feb-
ruary 23, 1917 (commonly known as the
‘‘Smith-Hughes Vocational Education Act of
1917’’) (39 Stat. 929, chapter 114), which was
the first major Federal investment in sec-
ondary CTE and laid the foundation for the
bipartisan, bicameral support for CTE that
continues as of February 2019: Now, there-
fore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates February 2019 as ‘‘Career and
Technical Education Month’’ to celebrate ca-
reer and technical education across the
United States;
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Career
and Technical Education Month;
(3) recognizes the importance of career and
technical education in preparing a well-edu-
cated and skilled workforce in the United
States; and
(4) encourages educators, guidance and ca-
reer development professionals, administra-
tors, and parents to promote career and
technical education as a respected option for
students.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, our Na-
tion’s continued economic progress and
the social mobility of our citizens are
contingent on the education and skills
of the American workforce and its abil-
ity to adjust and fulfill the needs of the
21st century economy. Career and tech-
nical education (CTE) programs are an
essential piece of every student’s edu-
cation, providing them access to the
important knowledge, skills, and cre-
dentials needed to obtain careers in
rapidly growing, high-demand fields.
Today, approximately 12.2 million stu-
dents across the Nation are enrolled in
CTE programs offered by thousands of
career academies, comprehensive high
schools, CTE high schools, community
colleges, and CTE centers. Through in-
tentionally designed applied learning,
these students gain workplace skills
and technical training that mirror in-
demand positions in the workforce.
In the coming decade, a projected 3
million skilled workers will be needed
to fill infrastructure positions in the
United States, including jobs related to
designing, building, and operating
transportation, housing, telecommuni-
cation, and utilities facilities. CTE
programs intentionally match employ-
ability skills with workforce demands,
lowering the probability of students
dropping out of high school and in-
creasing their likelihood of graduating
on time. These skills-based training
programs will help fill the estimated 30
million U.S. jobs available with an av-
erage income annual income of $55,000
that do not require a bachelor’s degree
yet necessitate some level of postsec-
ondary education.
Across Virginia, I hear from manu-
facturers frustrated by the shortage of
qualified skilled production employ-
ees—roles that require the training and
instruction provided in CTE class-
rooms. It is essential that we elevate
the important role of CTE in the coun-
try’s ability to meet the inter-
connected challenges of economic de-
velopment, student achievement, and
global competitiveness. Last year, Con-
gress affirmed the importance of CTE
by passing the Strengthening Career
and Technical Education for the 21st
Century Act which supports CTE pro-
grams in secondary and postsecondary
education.
Today, with my Senate CTE Caucus
co-chairs Senator PORTMAN, Senator
BALDWIN, and Senator YOUNG and 47
colleagues in the Senate, I am pleased
to introduce a bipartisan resolution to
designate February as Career and
Technical Education (CTE) month.
CTE Month encourages students, par-
ents, counselors, educators, and school
leaders to learn more about the diverse
educational opportunities offered in
their communities, and recognize the
valuable role of CTE in developing a
well-educated and highly skilled work-
force in the United States.
By formally recognizing CTE Month
through this resolution, it is our aim
to raise greater awareness of the im-
portance of improving access to high-
quality CTE for millions of America’s
students and our nation’s ongoing eco-
nomic competitiveness.

COMMEMORATING THE JAPANESE
AMERICAN CITIZENS LEAGUE
DAY OF REMEMBRANCE ON FEB-
RUARY 19, 2019
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate February 19th as a
Day of Remembrance for the country and es-
pecially for the Japanese American commu-
nity. On that day in 1942, the President of the
United States signed and issued Executive
Order 9066, an action which ordered the Sec-
retary of War, ‘‘to prescribe military areas . . .
from which any or all persons may be ex-
cluded, and with respect to which, the right of
any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall
be subject to whatever restrictions the Sec-
retary of War or the appropriate Military Com-
mander may impose in his discretion.’’
Following this executive order, one of the
darkest chapters in American history began as
over 120,000 Japanese Americans throughout
Washington, Oregon and California were sum-
marily interned in prison camps. Those com-
munities, uprooted until the end of World War
II, were forced to abandon their lives as they
left behind homes, jobs, friends and loved
ones. No due process was granted and
throughout the years of imprisonment, no one
was charged or even convicted of any action
that would have betrayed the country that they
called home. Their only ‘‘crime’’ was that they
were of Japanese descent.
As the Representative of California’s 3rd
District I am proud to recognize our local Jap-
anese American Citizens League Chapter of
Marysville, California. Over the past few days
they have taken the opportunity to honor the
memory of the hardship that was forced on
Japanese Americans by engaging the commu-
nity-at-large to educate their neighbors on the
importance of defending the civil rights that
are due every American citizen. I commend
their work and aim to carry forward that very
message.
Especially at a time when our nation is so
divided, it is important to spend this time re-
membering what happened on that day in
1942 and the dangers that come from ignoring
our most basic civil rights guaranteed by the
Constitution. I call on my fellow Americans to
reflect on what took place during those terrible
years and to fight to protect the rights of all
Americans, no matter their heritage or race.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF MRS. ELLEN GREANEY
JACOBS
HON. SCOTT PERRY
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, today I offer
my heartfelt congratulations to Mrs. Ellen
Greaney Jacobs, a resident of Dauphin Coun-
ty, Pennsylvania, who is celebrating 100 years
young on Monday, April 1, 2019.
Mrs. Jacobs was born in Bound Brook, New
Jersey, and moved to New Bloomfield, Penn-
sylvania with her mother, brother and two sis-
ters after her father died. Ellen graduated from
New Bloomfield High School and the Carlisle
Commercial College. She married her hus-
band of 69 years, Cyrus D. Jacobs, in West-
minster, Maryland on September 24, 1938.
Ellen has three sons, six grandchildren, and
twelve great grandchildren.
Ellen is an active member of the Order of
the Eastern Star (Capitol City Chapter), Dau-
phin Middle Paxton Historical Society, Dauphin
Middle Paxton Area Senior Citizens, and still
delivers Meals on Wheels on a regular basis.
She is a longtime member of Hope United
Presbyterian Church in Dauphin, where she
enjoys Christian fellowship, Bible study, and
making Easter and Christmas candy. She en-
joys playing pinochle with her card club, read-
ing, gardening (especially her beloved roses),
watching the leaves change in the fall and
flowers bloom in the spring, and bird watching.
I join Ellen’s friends and family in extending
my best and warmest wishes to her on this
special day, and in celebrating her life and
contributions to our great Commonwealth and
Country.
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s Tenth Congres-
sional District, I extend God’s blessings and
my heartfelt congratulations to Mrs. Ellen
Greaney Jacobs on her 100th Birthday.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF ANNE MARIE LABELLE
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and legacy of Anne
Marie Labelle. Anne was a wonderful mother,
sister, grandmother, great grandmother and
aunt. She was a selfless community advocate
and will always be remembered for her
strength and love of family.
Anne was born in Troy, New York before
moving to Broward County, Florida as a teen-
ager. After high school, Anne became known
for her activism in Sunrise city politics, before
retiring far too young after suffering a stroke in
1982. In typical Anne fashion, she fought hard
in rehab and recovered to work for local real
estate developers in Plantation and Boca
Raton. Anne was appreciative of those who
helped her in her time of need, so she started
volunteering at the Sunrise Rehabilitation Cen-
ter and became a popular one-on-one volun-
teer for victims of stroke rehabilitation and
brain injuries. She served on the hospital’s
community advisory board, while also volun-
teering with Shake-a-Leg, a group for individ-
uals with disabilities who sailed monthly on
Biscayne Bay.
Madam Speaker, Anne’s commitment to her
community is a true testament to the person
that she was. Anne will be remembered by the
lives that she touched during her 77 years on
this earth. Many fond memories of her will for-
ever remain with her sons, Robert and Mi-
chael, her sister, Maureen, her grandchildren,
Amanda, Matthew, Courtney, Casey, and
Kelly, her great-grandchild, Parker, and her
nieces and nephews, Ryan, Lauren, Grant,
Logan and Abby. Anne’s love for her family
will be forever enshrined in her last words to
her son, Robert, when she told him ‘tell every-
one I love them’. I offer my deepest condo-
lences to her entire family during this time of
great sadness. Anne was truly a blessing to
our community. I am so pleased to honor her
memory. She will be dearly missed.

IN APPRECIATION OF ED
CANNADY UPON HIS RETIRE-
MENT FROM THE UNITED
STATES FOREST SERVICE
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pleasure and a little sadness that I rise
today to recognize Ed Cannady and the great
service he has given to our country, conserva-
tion and recreation as he retires from the
United States Forest Service.
One of the great aspects of serving in Con-
gress is meeting people, and Ed will be one
of the individuals I remember most. Over the
years, Ed has been a guide, a teacher and a
friend to me and my staff.
I first met Ed in the early 2000s when I
began working on my Boulder-White Clouds
Wilderness bill. I thought it would be important
to get a first-hand look at the lands I would be
proposing for wilderness designation so I
asked the Sawtooth National Forest Super-
visor to set up a backpacking trip for my staff
and me.
It was my good fortune that Ed was given
the assignment to take a Congressman and
his staff into the Boulder-White Clouds. I’m not

sure that Ed thought the same. He decided we
would hike to the foot of Castle Peak in the
Chamberlain basin. It was the middle of Au-
gust—summer mind you—and when we got
our tents set up that afternoon it began to
snow. It snowed more and blew some and
snowed more. When we woke the next day to
a winter scene and the chance of even more
snow, prudence dictated that it was time to
pack up and go home early.
While it was a short trip, it made for a great
story and was the first of many enlightening
trips and learning experiences into what is
now the Cecil D. Andrus-White Clouds Wilder-
ness that Ed took us on.
I also want to give special recognition to Ed
for the help and expertise that he provided me
and my staff as we developed the Boulder-
White Clouds and Jerry Peak wilderness pack-
age. As far as I know, there is only one per-
son alive who has been through and over
every acre of those mountains and it happens
to be Ed.
As we were determining wilderness bound-
aries, roads, trails, creeks, snowmobile areas
and helicopter landing and ski areas, Ed was
the one person who could always give me the
answers I needed. More importantly, I could
always count on Ed to give me both sides of
the issue in an impartial manner that was fair
to all parties.
He also identified potential conflicts for me
with boundaries and uses so that we could re-
solve problems before they were locked into
legislation. I can say with confidence that it
would have been very difficult to write the bill
without his help and expertise and for that I
want to say ‘‘thank you Ed.’’
Ed Cannady is one of the good guys and
my staff and I are going to miss him. Fortu-
nately, we know he’s not really going away
and we will keep in touch in the many years
to come.
Good luck and enjoy your retirement Ed.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF JUAN CAR-
LOS SALGADO: HOUSTON, TEXAN
AND GOOD SAMARITAN
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
to pay tribute to an angel, Juan Carlos
Salgado, a Houston resident and Good Sa-
maritan who passed away on January 13,
2019, in Houston, Texas at the age of 41.
On the evening of January 13, 2019, Juan
Salgado was walking to a local market to pick
up dinner, but he never made it because while
crossing Telephone Road near Red Robin
Lane, Juan Salgado was struck by two cars
and died at the scene.
Madam Speaker, Juan Salgado was not one
to draw attention; rather he kept to himself
and worked hard as a landscaper, and sent
his extra earnings to his mother in Guerrero,
Mexico.
But there is more to the story of this won-
derful man.
Three weeks before his death, on Decem-
ber 24, 2018, in the early morning hours of
Christmas Eve, a drunk driver collided with a
Houston Police Department cruiser that was
en route to assist a fellow officer.
Juan Salgado heard the crash from his
apartment and ran toward the police vehicle,
now in flames.
Juan Salgado fought to free the two officers,
John Daily and Alonzo Reid, who were
trapped inside, and breaks his right hand
when he punched through a window to free
Officer Reid.
After freeing both officers and pulling them
to safety, Juan Salgado left the scene and re-
turned to his familiar and comfortable state of
obscurity.
The day after saving Officers Daily and
Reid, Juan Salgado was back at work as a
landscaper.
This documented hero was an undocu-
mented immigrant.
But it was not his immigration status that
Juan Salgado thought about on that fateful
Christmas Eve.
Instead, he saw two human beings who
needed assistance and he did not hesitate to
offer it knowing the danger it posed to him and
his resident status in the United States.
Madam Speaker, Juan Salgado put his
community above himself and because of his
selflessness Officers Daily and Reid are alive
today.
I offer my deepest condolences to the family
and loved ones of Juan Salgado as they
mourn the loss of this unsung hero.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA CLEMENCY HOME
RULE ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Clemency
Home Rule Act, a bill that would give the Dis-
trict of Columbia exclusive authority, like the
states and territories, to grant clemency to of-
fenders prosecuted under its local laws.
While District law appears to give the mayor
authority to grant clemency (D.C. Code 1–
301.76), it is the opinion of the Department of
Justice (DOJ) that the president, and not the
mayor, has the authority to grant clemency for
most offenses prosecuted under D.C. law, par-
ticularly felonies prosecuted by the U.S. Attor-
ney in the D.C. Superior Court. Under current
practice, clemency petitions for D.C. convic-
tions, like federal convictions, are submitted to
the DOJ for the president’s consideration.
Whether or not DOJ’s view is correct, my
bill would remove all doubt that the District,
and not the president, has the authority to
issue clemency for local offenses. The District,
like the states and territories, should have full
control of its local criminal justice system, the
most basic responsibility of local government.
Since the D.C. Council has the authority to
enact local laws, District officials are in the
best position to grant clemency for local law
convictions. My bill would provide clemency
authority to the District government and would
give D.C. the discretion to establish its own
clemency system.
This bill is an important step in establishing
further autonomy for the District in its own
local affairs. I urge my colleagues to support
this measure.

MONSIGNOR ROBERT T.
MCDERMOTT
HON. DONALD NORCROSS
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and legacy of the late
Monsignor Robert T. McDermott of the City of
Camden, Camden County, located in the First
Congressional District of the Great State of
New Jersey, for his decades of public service.
Monsignor McDermott was born July 19,
1942 in the City of Camden and attended
Saint Joseph’s Pro-Cathedral School and later
attended Camden Catholic High School.
In 1969, Monsignor McDermott was or-
dained into the priesthood. He then became
the pastor at Saint Joseph Pro-Cathedral for
thirty years and went on to serve as Vicar
General for the Diocese of Camden.
While ministering to the poor and diverse
immigrant community, Monsignor McDermott
recognized the needs of the community and
assisted in the facilitation of opening several
nonprofits including the Joseph Fund.
The Joseph Fund assists other nonprofits
with fundraising and obtaining resources, such
as; Saint Joseph Carpenter Society, which im-
proves affordable housing, Saint Joseph Child
Development Center, LUCY Outreach, sup-
porting youth through after-school tutoring,
mentoring and trauma-informed care, Joseph’s
House of Camden, aids the homeless, offering
emergency shelter, supportive housing and
social services, as well as the Romero Center,
committed to ending poverty and discrimina-
tion throughout the world.
In the community he both loved and called
home, Monsignor McDermott served with com-
passion and distinction. The Monsignor was a
role model, extraordinary public servant, a tire-
less advocate for others and will be deeply
missed.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join with me
in mourning the loss and honoring the legacy
of the late Monsignor Robert T. McDermott.

TRIBUTE TO RONALD H. ROBERTS
HON. KEN CALVERT
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor and pay tribute to my good friend
Ronald ‘‘Ron’’ Roberts, who passed away in
San Diego, California on Monday, February 4,
2019. Ron was a dedicated public servant and
he will be deeply missed.
Throughout his life, Ron worked to improve
the community around him. In the first phase
of his public service, Ron worked as a Cali-
fornia Highway Patrol officer. By the time he
retired, Ron had risen to the rank of sergeant.
After his career in law enforcement, Ron
began what would eventually be a twenty-four-
year dedication to the city of Temecula. Ron
was first appointed to the Temecula Traffic
Commission in 1990, the year after the city in-
corporated.
In 1992, Ron was elected to the Temecula
City Council, where he would ultimately serve
five consecutive terms, from 1992 to 2014, in-
cluding five terms as the city’s mayor. The im-
pact of Ron’s leadership and hard work is on
display today throughout Temecula, particu-
larly in its infrastructure, facilities, parks and li-
braries. In fact, the city honored Ron by nam-
ing its busiest library the Ronald H. Roberts
Temecula Public Library. Ron was also right-
fully proud of his work granting public use of
the Duck Pond at the corner of Ynez and Ran-
cho California roads and revitalizing Old Town
Temecula. Extraordinary cities like Temecula
don’t exist by accident—they come to fruition
thanks to the vision and activism of tireless
advocates like Ron Roberts.
Ron is survived by his wife, Jeanne; son
Ron, Jr. (wife Kara); daughter Wendy (hus-
band Sam); and five grandchildren. I extend
my heartfelt condolences to the Roberts fam-
ily, his friends, and everyone fortunate enough
to know Ron. Although Ron may be gone, the
many contributions he made to his country,
community and family will have a lasting im-
pact.

RECOGNIZING OAKWOOD POLICE
CHIEF RANDALL MOON’S SERVICE
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Mr. Randall Moon,
who is retiring this week after serving as Oak-
wood City Police Chief for the past 25 years.
Mr. Moon started with the Oakwood Police
Department in 1990 and was quickly promoted
to Chief in June of 1994. Over the past 29
years, Mr. Moon has witnessed the police
force grow from seven officers to sixteen offi-
cers and has been key in assisting the depart-
ment as they have worked to grow the depart-
ment with an ever-changing city. Through it
all, he is most proud of ‘‘maintaining an excel-
lent workplace, with excellent pay and bene-
fits.’’
Mr. Moon credits a presentation on bike
safety, given to his second-grade class by two
Georgia State Patrol troopers, as the catalyst
for his desire to work in law enforcement. Ever
since, Mr. Moon knew law enforcement was
his calling, and he has since served in law en-
forcement for over 34 years, including 29
years in Oakwood.
He leaves his successor with a few words of
wisdom: be a friend, be a family, as that’s
what sets Oakwood apart from other police
departments.
The citizens of Northeast Georgia are fortu-
nate to have men like Mr. Moon serving our
communities. I thank Mr. Moon for his exem-
plary service, and I wish him all the best in his
retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS
AND SERVICE OF THE NATIONAL
SOCIETY OF PERSHING RIFLES
HON. BILLY LONG
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the history, service and accomplish-
ments of the National Society of Pershing Ri-
fles, whose members and alumni will observe
the organization’s 125th Anniversary during its
national convention, March 14 through 16 in
Kansas City, Missouri.
In 1891, Second Lieutenant John J. Per-
shing, then a military instructor at the Univer-
sity of Nebraska-Lincoln, selected a top-tier
group of cadets to ‘‘promote the highest ideals
of the military profession,’’ among other things,
within the Nebraska cadet corps. In 1894, the
group was named The Pershing Rifles, in
honor of their founder and mentor. Lieutenant
Pershing would go on to become Commander
of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in
World War I, and remains the only active duty
American to be awarded the rank of General
of the Armies of the United States.
Since its humble beginnings, the Pershing
Rifles have vastly expanded, and now num-
bers more than 600 ROTC cadet and mid-
shipman members spread across more than
60 campuses nationwide. Now in its 125th
year, members remain steadfast in their deter-
mination to carry on the organization’s original
goal of promoting excellence in the military
arts.
The mission of the National Society of Per-
shing Rifles is to aid in the development of
successful officers in the Army, Navy and Air
Force; foster camaraderie and esprit de corps
among all three Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps programs; further the purposes, tradi-
tions, and concepts of the United States Army,
Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and give
civilians an opportunity to be part of a military
organization without formal commitment to the
military.
Alumni of the Pershing Rifles have fought
with valor and distinction as military and naval
officers in every American conflict since the
Spanish-American War. Distinguished alumni
include former Secretary of State Colin Powell,
among many other notable American military,
political, professional, and cultural leaders.
Madam Speaker, I am honored to rise and
recognize 125 years of service to the nation
since the formation of the Pershing Rifles.
Throughout their history, they have strived for
excellence in all that they do and have clearly
lived up to the vision of their founder. I can
think of no tribute more fitting, to honor the liv-
ing legacy of General of the Armies John J.
Pershing and his vision for military and civic
excellence.

businessman, entrepreneur, and philan-

career spanning over three decades. Cur-
rently, he serves as the Chief Executive Offi-
cer (CEO) of Multimedia and Strategic Alli-
ances of America Movil, Director of Uno TV,

This year, from February 23rd to March 2nd,
citizens on both sides of the Rio Grande will
gather to celebrate the 82nd Annual Charro
Days Fiesta in Brownsville, Texas and Fiestas
Mexicanas in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mex-
ico. The events of Charro Days commemorate
our shared history, culture and positive cross-
border relationship. The Rio Grande binds our
city, and there isn’t a line or boundary that can
eradicate the memories and friendships that
have flourished over generations.
Since 1967, as part of the festivities, the Mr.
Amigo Association, whose mission is to pro-
mote the international friendship and goodwill
between the United States of America and the
Republic of Mexico, identifies an individual to
be Mr. Amigo. The honoree must be a distin-
guished Mexican citizen, who has contributed
to the friendship and understanding between
the U.S. and Mexico and has excelled in their
profession, exemplifying the highest standards
in their professional lives.
Mr. Amigo 2018, Arturo Elı́as Ayub, hails
from Mexico City. Since graduating from Ana-

business management and a graduate certifi-
cate in senior business management from
IPADE Business School in Mexico City, he
has contributed significantly to the community
in which he lives, making him the perfect can-

TELMEX. However, some of his most notable
and impactful contributions have derived from
the work he has spearheaded as CEO of
TELMEX Telcel Foundation.
In his position as TELMEX Telcel Founda-
tion CEO, Mr. Ayub has brought the resources
of the foundation to projects in education,
health care, natural disaster relief, human de-
velopment, and sports. An avid soccer fan, he
translated his passion for the sport into efforts
to support social justice and increase access
to highly-anticipated global sporting events to
the Americas. Ganar-Ganar magazine, a spe-
cialized publication about corporate social re-
sponsibility, selected TELMEX Telcel Founda-
tion as the recipient of the 2013 Social Re-
sponsibility and Sustainable Award for their
work in organizing the 2012 Homeless World
Cup. Additionally, under Ayub’s leadership,
Claro Sports delivered broadcasting of the
2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi to more than
50 television broadcasters in the Americas.
This year’s Mr. Amigo award serves to rec-
ognize the positive work Mr. Ayub has contrib-
uted to our international relationship. It is also
a message of hope as he continues to help
our communities, and in doing so, he inspires
the next generation of leaders.
Today we honor Arturo Elı́as Ayub for his
dedication to socioeconomic change, business
development, and philanthropy. I join Browns-
ville and Matamoros in welcoming Mr. Ayub to

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL
CAROL A. TIMMONS
HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER
OF DELAWARE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today, on behalf of my colleagues
Senator TOM CARPER and Senator CHRIS
COONS of Delaware, to honor and congratulate
Major General Carol Timmons for a lifetime of
dedicated service to our country.
After graduating from William Penn High
School in 1977, Timmons enrolled in college
and enlisted in the Delaware National Guard.
With a childhood dream of becoming an air-
plane pilot, her career in flight would begin
that very summer on a C–130 airplane in
Savanah, Georgia. Despite her love of air-
planes, Air Force rules prevented women from
flying combat-mission planes, like the C–130.
Due to these unfair regulations, she joined the
Army National Guard in 1980 and would learn
to fly Army helicopters, like the UH–1 Huey.
Undeterred and committed to her dream,
Timmons joined the Air Force Reserves where
she flew noncombat support missions. She
soon realized her dream as federal laws
ended the discriminatory prohibition on women
flying in combat missions, and during Oper-
ation Desert Storm, then-Captain Timmons
would become one of the first women to fly in
combat. Following that operation, her career
would come full circle as she rejoined the
Delaware National Guard—flying the same C–
130s she first learned to operate.
On January 8, 2012, then-Brigadier General
Timmons would make history by becoming the
Delaware Air National Guard’s first female
commander, and again on February 1, 2017,
when she was promoted to the rank of Major
General and named Adjunct General of the
Delaware National Guard—the Governor’s
chief military advisor commanding 1,500 sol-
diers and 1,100 airmen.
During her storied 42-year career, she
earned a Bronze Star for her service in Af-
ghanistan and has flown over 5,200 hours in
the cockpit, including 400 combat hours during
contingencies, spanning Operations Desert
Shield, Desert Storm, Southern Watch, Joint
Guard, Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and
Inherent Resolve. She served on the National
Guard’s Joint Diversity Executive Council and
the Air Force Reserve Policy Committee. She
has received numerous honors, including in-
duction into the Delaware Aviation Hall of
Fame and the Delaware Women’s Hall of
Fame.
By refusing to compromise on her dream,
Timmons broke down barriers, blazed trails,
and inspired women to let nothing stand in
their way in service to our nation. I join Sen-
ator CARPER and Senator COONS in thanking
Major General Carol Timmons for her over
four decades of service to our state and coun-
try, and we wish her the very best.

DAVID ELDER
HON. TROY BALDERSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the memory of David Elder, a
committed public servant, loving husband, and
devoted father and grandfather. David passed
away on February 23, 2019 at the age of 70.
He was a dedicated public servant to Wor-
thington, Ohio, for 36 years.
David’s admirable career of service to Wor-
thington began when he interned while com-
pleting his master’s degree at The Ohio State
University. Skillfully demonstrating his capabili-
ties as an intern, he was hired in 1971 to
serve as an administrative assistant. Over the
course of the following decade, David proved
he possessed a dedicated work ethic, which
helped him advance in his career. He was ap-
pointed as Worthington City Manager in 1981,
a title he held for 26 years. Though he left of-
fice in 2007, his legacy is not forgotten. His
strong ethical character, enthusiastic compas-
sion, and devoted service to his home town
made him the consummate example of a pub-
lic servant.
Though he will be missed dearly, I am con-
fident that his memory will live on through his
exemplary life’s work and will continue to
serve as an inspiration for individuals consid-
ering a path in public service. Please keep his
beloved wife, Ann, daughters Stephanie and
Lauren, and numerous grandchildren in your
prayers as they celebrate David’s life in the
coming days.

RECOGNIZING THE 27TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE KHOJALY MAS-
SACRE
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this week
marks the 27th anniversary of the massacre of
hundreds of people in the town of Khojaly in
what was the largest killing of ethnic Azer-
baijani civilians in the course of the Armenia-
Azerbaijan conflict. Khojaly, which is located in
the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan,
was once home to 7,000 people. That was be-
fore Armenian armed forces massacred over
600 unarmed people—including 106 women
and 83 children—and left less than 2,000 sur-
vivors. Hundreds more became disabled due
to their horrific injuries. More than one hun-
dred children lost a parent and 25 children lost
both parents. At least 8 families were com-
pletely killed.
Even though a ceasefire went into effect
over two decades ago, more than 20 percent
of Azerbaijan’s territory, including Nagorno-
Karabakh and seven surrounding districts, re-
main occupied and more than 1 million

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E213
February 26, 2019
Azerbaijanis remain refugees unable to return
to their home villages. Ongoing violence along
the line of contact surrounding occupied Azer-
baijani territory reinforces the urgency of ro-
bust American participation in the Organization
for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s
(OSCE) Minsk Group as it works toward a
peaceful resolution of the Azerbaijan-Armenia
conflict.
Azerbaijan has been a strong partner of the
United States and its allies in security and en-
ergy matters. This cooperation has included:
playing a leadership role in nonproliferation
issues; providing troops to serve shoulder-to-
shoulder with U.S. forces in Kosovo, Iraq, and
Afghanistan; allowing transit of non-lethal
equipment used by coalition forces through
Azerbaijan to Afghanistan, construction of the
Southern Gas Corridor from the Caspian Sea
to Italy, thereby providing Europe with an al-
ternative to Russian energy sources; and sup-
plying 40 percent of Israel’s oil. Azerbaijan
also has a thriving Jewish community and has
outstanding relations with Israel.
As Azerbaijanis throughout the world com-
memorate the massacre and continue to
grieve the loss of loved ones, let us commit
ourselves to supporting non-violent efforts to
resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
