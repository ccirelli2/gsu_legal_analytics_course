HONORING THE SERVICE OF
MARIO RODRIGUEZ
HON. ANDRÉ CARSON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to honor and recognize Mario
Rodriguez, Executive Director for the award-
winning Indianapolis Airport Authority. The In-
dianapolis International Airport is in the con-
gressional district that I represent, and I have
wholeheartedly supported its innovation and
growth under Mario’s leadership.
Mario Rodriguez has long been a dedicated
aviation expert and community advocate, and
has used his knowledge to serve not only the
city of Indianapolis, but also the nation at
large. For 30 years, he has held leadership
positions in airports around the country, and,
under his leadership, the Indianapolis Inter-
national Airport has continued to receive rec-
ognition for its world class service. Mario has
also championed a diverse workforce and to-
date, more than 50 percent of senior leader-
ship and 35 percent of professional staff at the
Indianapolis Airport Authority are women and
racial monitories. Mario’s aviation expertise
also led to his appointment in 2016 to the Na-
tional Department of Transportation Com-
mittee for Aviation Consumer Protection by
President Barack Obama.
Mario is also well-known for his commitment
to civic engagement. He is board member for
many nonprofits in our community, including
Immigrant Welcome Center, Indiana Latino In-
stitute, Indy and Indiana Chambers, The Indi-
ana Sports Corps, The Economic Club of Indi-
ana, Visit Indy, and the 500 Festival. For this
good work, he has received numerous awards
acknowledging his efforts to strengthen Cen-
tral Indiana and improve the lives of its resi-
dents.
Mario Rodriguez is a leader and a trail-
blazer. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me
in celebrating his contributions to our commu-
nity, state and country.

COMMEMORATION OF THE 50TH
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF DO-
LORES AND WILL GRESHAM
HON. MARK E. GREEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and honor Dolores
and Will Gresham of Somerville, Tennessee
on the very special occasion of their 50th wed-
ding anniversary.
Dolores and Will were married on August 2,
1969. Together, their lives have been marked
by service to their community, and both retired
from the United States Marine Corps with the
rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Dolores has also
served in the Tennessee State Senate since
2008.
In addition to their service, their marriage of
fifty faithful years embodies the values of Ten-
nessee which have and will keep our state
and our nation strong. There’s no doubt that
they have lived an All-American life with their
family; raising Hereford cattle on their farm, in-
vesting in their neighbors, and holding fast to
their strong values and shared faith, giving us
all an ideal to which we can aspire. May their
commitment grow even stronger as they love,
cherish, and honor one another for many
years to come.
Madam Speaker, I commend this great cou-
ple on their 50th year of marriage. I ask that
my colleagues in the United States House of
Representatives join me in congratulating
them on this momentous occasion.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF H.D. BROOME
HON. MICHAEL GUEST
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life and service of Mr. H.D. Broome
of Bassfield, Mississippi. Mr. Broome was an
American patriot who served the U.S. Army
during World War II and the perilous
Ardennes, Rhineland, and Central Europe
Campaigns.
Private First Class H.D. Broome was in-
ducted into the U.S. Army on August 11,
1944, at the age of 18. Assigned to C Com-
pany of the 8th Infantry, Mr. Broome partici-
pated in the American march across Europe
and the famed ‘‘Battle of the Bulge.’’ For his
service, Mr. Broome was awarded the Bronze
Star, a Purple Heart, and the Combat Infantry-
man Badge.
Mr. Broome was Honorably Discharged from
the U.S. Army in August 1946 and returned to
Mississippi. After returning to Bassfield, Mr.
Broome married Gracie Williams; served as
deacon, Sunday school teacher, and church
treasurer at Bethel Baptist Church; and en-
joyed a 30-year career with the Mississippi
Department of Transportation. Mr. Broome
passed away May 11, 2019, and is buried at
Lowland Cemetery in Bassfield, Mississippi.
Today, I join Mr. Broome’s family in remem-
bering his service and celebrating his life. I am
grateful for all he has done in service to his
country, his state, and his community.

RECOGNIZING ST. JOSEPH
CATHOLIC PARISH
HON. TIM WALBERG
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize St. Joseph Catholic Parish
of Erie, Michigan as it celebrates its 200th an-
niversary.
St. Joseph Catholic Parish, the second old-
est Catholic church in Monroe County, and the
third oldest Catholic church in the Archdiocese
of Detroit, has a rich history of service to the
community.
The parish began in 1819 as a log building
in a community called Bay Creek, where wor-
shippers were primarily hunters and trappers.
In its early days, the church depended upon
traveling Jesuit priests who ministered to the
congregants, followed by occasional visits by
Father Gabriel Richard. In 1826, a new wood-
frame building was constructed to replace the
earlier log structure, and in 1833, Father John
Debruyn became its first resident pastor.
Around 1850, the Bay Creek settlement
area was renamed Vienna, and today is
known as Erie. As the parish continued to
grow in number, it became necessary to build
a new facility. The present building was com-
pleted under the leadership of Father Peter
Warlop and consecrated in 1852 by Bishop
Peter Paul LeFever. The magnificent structure,
still used today as St. Joseph’s place of wor-
ship, is a testimony to many years of faithful
ministry.
Over the years, the church provided an ele-
mentary school for parishioners and added a
new activities center to better serve the church
body. Today, St. Joseph Parish continues to
enrich hundreds of individuals and families in
Erie as a place of connection, worship, and
service.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
with me in congratulating St. Joseph Catholic
Parish on its bicentennial anniversary. May
God continue to bless the congregation as it
shines a bright light in Monroe County and be-
yond.

IN HONOR OF THE FIRST PRES-
BYTERIAN CHURCH IN
FLEMINGSBURG
HON. ANDY BARR
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the First Presbyterian Church in
Flemingsburg, Kentucky on their 200th anni-
versary.
In 1795, Dr. John Poage Campbell came to
Fleming County and erected a log church at
Flemingsburg. According to historical records,
other pioneer preachers were associated with
the early church including Joseph P. Howe,
James Kemper, William W. Martin, and John
T. Edgar.
The present church building was erected in
1819. It remains as the major known work of
architect-builders Samuel Stockwell and John
Eckles. It is a fine example of Kentucky Fed-
eral architecture. In 1977, the church was
named to the National Registry of Historic
Places.

200th anniversary, I appreciate the historical
significance of their building, but more impor-

I congratulate Reverend Rick Hurst and all
the members of First Presbyterian Church in

REMEMBRANCE OF HOPE
‘‘JACKIE’’ MURPHY WHITTAKER
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Hope ‘‘Jackie’’ Murphy
Whittaker, who passed away on 20 August
2019.
She was born 20 January 1935, the only
child of Frank Marvin Murphy of Ayrfield and
Hope Alice Dadmun of Petersburg and Nor-
folk. Jackie lived a long and varied life, raising
her children, managing the farm, Ayrfield,
where her family has lived since 1769, work-
ing on the Virginia Tech Extension Farm at
Liberty Hall in Mount Holly, and spending 18
years as a customer service representative at
Dominion Power before retiring in 1997.
Jackie was a Red Cross water safety in-
structor in her youth, and was an avid hunter
and fisherman, inviting others into the out-
doors with her enthusiasm. She inherited her
mother’s love of music and singing; she par-
ticularly enjoyed classical music and opera.
She directed the choir at Yeocomico Church
for several years. Jackie participated in var-
ious other nearby choral groups over the
years as well, such as the Essex Community
Chorus, and concerts at Andrew Chapel and
St. James in Montross. When her children ap-
proached school age, she added her forceful
support to the other local parents who sought
to establish a small private school to provide
their children the best possible education.
Their efforts resulted in the creation of Wood-
land Academy in Neenah, VA, a place of qual-
ity primary education for nearly 50 years. She
was as active in the Boy Scouts as her son,
serving on the District Committee and partici-
pating in many district Camporees and training
events. She was a patriot who held an undy-
ing belief in the greatness and wonder of this
country. Jackie graduated from St. Margaret’s
School in Tappahannock and then went to
Westhampton College in Richmond for a year
before attending and graduating from Wom-
en’s College of Greensboro in 1957.
She was predeceased in 1997 by her hus-
band of 35 years, Arthur Davis Whittaker. She
is survived by a son, Cmdr. A. Davis Whit-
taker, Jr, (Lynn); a daughter, Sarah Leigh
Whittaker Montuori (David); a grandson, An-
thony Francis Arthur Montuori; a step-daugh-
ter, Anne Marie Whittaker, and a lot of ex-
tended family and dear friends in the Northern
Neck she loved so much.
HONORING THE VANNIE E. COOK,
JR. CHILDREN’S CANCER AND
HEMATOLOGY CLINIC
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the Vannie E. Cook, Jr.
Children’s Cancer and Hematology Clinic by
recognizing the month of September 2019 as
National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.
Childhood Cancer remains the number one
cause of non-accidental death in children.
Every year, approximately 1,700 Texas fami-
lies will hear the words, ‘‘Your child has can-
cer’’ and about 105 of those brave children
are from the Rio Grande Valley.
For the last 18 years, the Vannie E. Cook,
Jr. Children’s Cancer and Hematology Clinic,
the first comprehensive pediatric cancer and
hematology clinic in the Rio Grande Valley,
has provided quality care and treatment to
over 10,000 South Texas children battling can-
cer and blood disorders, regardless of their
family’s financial capacity.
On September 5, 2019, the Vannie Cook
Children’s Cancer Clinic and community mem-
bers committed to fighting pediatric cancer will
join together to host the Celebration of Life
Carnival in McAllen, Texas. This community
event will raise awareness of pediatric cancer,
remember the young children we have lost,
and honor the survivors as well as the coura-
geous children and families fighting this dis-
ease every single day. It will be a day dedi-
cated to children fighting cancer and l find it
fitting to enter this important date in history
into the record of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. I also plan to continue to do all
I can, through my work in the Congress, to
end all forms of cancer that afflict people all
over the world.
Madam Speaker, I commend all associated
with the Vannie E. Cook, Jr. Children’s Cancer
and Hematology Clinic on the occasion of Na-
tional Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. It
is an honor to represent these courageous
young people currently fighting cancer as well
as those at the clinic for their invaluable work
on behalf of children and families from the Rio
Grande Valley.

HONORING MS. VIRGINIA ‘‘PIXIE’’
FLYNN BELL
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
ask the House of Representatives to join me
in celebrating the exemplary life of Ms. Vir-
ginia ‘‘Pixie’’ Flynn Bell. Ms. Bell passed away
on August 2, 2019 at the age of 85 and is sur-
vived by ten of her thirteen children and three
granddaughters.
Ms. Bell was born in 1934 in Boston, Mas-
sachusetts and grew up in Maine, where she
graduated from Edward Little High School in
1952. Ms. Bell valued education, and in De-
cember 1997 at the age of 63 she graduated
with a Bachelor of Arts degree from
Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia.
Ms. Bell spent her life in dedicated service
to her country and local community. She
served in the Air Force and worked as a sen-
ior advisor to elected officials in Virginia, in-
cluding governors, U.S. Senators, U.S. Con-
gressmen, state Senators, state Delegates,
and Fairfax County Supervisors and Chair-
men. As a longtime member of the Virginia
Democratic Party, Ms. Bell was passionate
about political organizing. She was a hard
worker and strategic thinker, committed to
bringing greater diversity to the Democratic
party. Her colleagues and friends remember
her for her welcoming spirit and mentorship.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I ask
the House of Representatives to join me in re-
membering the life of Ms. Virginia ‘‘Pixie’’
Flynn Bell.

INDIGENOUS STEM PROFESSIONAL
DEVELOPMENT ACT
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO
SABLAN
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Indigenous STEM Professional
Development Act, which would expand oppor-
tunities for Native American students to earn
degrees in science, technology, engineering
and math (STEM) through partnerships be-
tween schools from the elementary to postsec-
ondary level and the private sector.
Native Americans, including American Indi-
ans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and the
indigenous peoples of the Pacific U.S. terri-
tories, are among the most underrepresented
groups in the STEM professions. Efforts to in-
crease Native students entering the STEM
workforce have seen success with programs
like the University of Alaska’s Alaska Native
Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP).
Based on a model incorporating indigenous
language and culture in STEM instruction, in-
tensive academic support and hands-on learn-
ing from middle school through graduate
school, ANSEP has produced over 800 STEM
graduates whose job placement rates exceed
the national average. According to a 2015
Urban Institute evaluation, ANSEP participants
have a 95 percent course completion rate with
84 percent reported being employed within
one year of graduation. The evaluation also
found the majority of ANSEP students earn a
median annual salary over $60,000 with 17
percent earning over $100,000.
In 2008, Congress recognized the benefits
of the ANSEP model in authorizing grants
under the Higher Education Act to support
similar programs focused on Native Hawaiians
as well as Alaska Natives. However, we must
do more to encourage all indigenous students
to enter STEM careers, including Chamorro,
Refaluwasch, and American Indians. The In-
digenous STEM Professional Development Act
reauthorizes and expands the grant program
to include all indigenous peoples of the United
States. Under the bill, schools can continue to
use the grant to develop programs to help Na-
tive students succeed in completing STEM
coursework, transitioning into college, gaining
practical experience through internships, and
working in their career fields after graduation.
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion to help strengthen our nation’s STEM

HONORING VERDINE DAY, DE-
TROIT’S FIRST BLACK WOMAN
FIRE ENGINE OPERATOR
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
tribute to Ms. Verdine Day for her many years
of service to the City of Detroit’s Fire Depart-
ment, on the occasion of her retirement.
Ms. Day has served the Detroit Fire Depart-
ment for more than thirty-three years. She has
risen through the ranks to become the depart-
ment’s first Black woman Fire Engine Oper-
ator. Ms. Day possesses a strong work ethic
and has always remained generous and will-
ing to mentor or help out a colleague in need.
Her dedication to fair and just treatment was
also instrumental in adopting a pregnancy pol-
icy for women of the Detroit Fire Department
with the assistance of the late City
Councilmember, Mary Ann Mahaffey. Ms. Day
has been recognized for her achievements by
being awarded the Spirit of Detroit Award and
being named 2019 Woman of the Year by the
City of Detroit, at the Annual Women in Blue
ceremony. Her heroism in the line of duty has
earned her two citations for the rescue of civil-
ians.
During her tenure, Ms. Day has represented
fire fighters on several fronts with proven re-
sults. She served as an elected union official
with the Detroit Fire Fighters Association for
fourteen years. In that capacity she has
served as 8th Battalion Director, Secretary,
Vice President, and currently holds the posi-
tion of Treasurer of the Association. During
those terms she also chaired various commit-
tees to include the Political Action Committee,
the Joint Health and Safety Committee, Public
Relations, Human Relations and Grievance
committees.
Beyond her service to the public, Ms. Day
has been an active community volunteer. For
the last nineteen years, she has orchestrated
the ‘‘Engine 40 Back to School Backpack
project’’, securing thousands of backpacks
loaded with school supplies for youth. For the
last fourteen years, she has led the ‘‘Fill the
Boot Campaign’’, raising money for children
for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Ms.
Day has also coordinated with Gleaners to
provide bryakfast for children in the summer,
served as a camp coach in Burn Camps and
the Junior Fire Cadet Program.
Outside of her many commitments, Ms. Day
still finds time to enjoy traveling, riding motor-
cycles, and playing softball. Her stellar softball
skills landed her in the Michigan United States
Specialty Sports Association Hall of Fame.
Ms. Day shares her life with her loving family,
spouse Ronald Day and her four children.
Please join me in saluting Senior Fire En-
gine Operator Verdine Day for her thirty-three
years of bravery and service to the public as
we wish her well on her retirement.
IN HONOR OF THE 125TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE INCORPORATION
OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the City of San Mateo upon the occa-
sion of the 125th anniversary of its incorpora-
tion. An election was held on September 1,
1894 and voters overwhelmingly supported
becoming a city. With 125 votes supporting in-
corporation to 25 opposed, the election was
certified on September 3rd and the first coun-
cil—known as a Board of Trustees—was con-
vened the following day.
One hundred twenty-five years later, San
Mateo has about 110,000 residents and a
place in our global economy. Every time you
use Survey Monkey, you are relying upon a
business in San Mateo. At one point in recent
years, first Solar City and then Tesla were ei-
ther founded or had major facilities in this
community. GoPro is next door. These offices
were originally occupied by Visa International,
since relocated in a nearby community. If you
have a Franklin Templeton fund in your
401(k), it was created and managed by the
diligent financial experts at their headquarters
in San Mateo.
I love San Mateo because on its broad,
leafy, streets you can find people and hear
languages from around the globe. One third of
the city’s population was born outside the
United States. About 94 percent of all house-
holds have a computer. About 90 percent
have a broadband internet connection, and 51
percent of all residents have a bachelor’s de-
gree or higher. Gone are the days when
horses galloped around the Bay Meadows
race track. That area is now the site of high
technology. Women and men are making
modern bets in this part of the city, but this
time on the emerging global economy rather
than on successors to Secretariat.
The history of San Mateo did not begin with
the arrival of Spanish explorer Gaspar de
Portolá in the 1700’s. The Ohlone Native
Americans lived in the area and the available
evidence indicates that they largely lived in
harmony with the land and water around them.
There is also evidence of healthy trade be-
tween villages that were once on the San
Mateo Coast and the edge of San Francisco
Bay, including in San Mateo. The forested
land and grasslands of the foothills were seen
by the Spanish as a rich opportunity. First
Spain, and then Mexico, granted extensive
land holdings to early settlers. Farming and
ranching were the norm.
However, the admittance of California as a
state in 1850 was soon followed by the arrival
of extensive development. The railroad
sparked the land rush, starting in 1863. Sud-
denly, what had been a weekend retreat for a
handful became a suburban home for wealthy
refugees from San Francisco. By the turn of
the century, the early founder of Bank of
America—A.P. Giannini—was making daily
commutes from his San Mateo home to his
bank in San Francisco.
San Mateo is enormously patriotic. During
the darkest days of the Vietnam War, and
alone amongst cities in the Bay Area, the resi-
dents of San Mateo adopted a unit of the
101st Airborne, 1st Brigade, 327th Infantry
Regiment Company A, and they have pro-
vided continuous support to the company ever
since. Last year during the weekend of March
24th and 25th, the city celebrated yet another
weekend in which the troops were hosted and
they paraded through downtown.
From its founding as a village in 1894 to its
emergence as a 21st century powerhouse,
residents of San Mateo have led spirited civic
lives. Elections are rarely without significant
discourse. Initiatives are sometimes sparked.
Many, many smart and engaged people par-
ticipate. Democracy is the better for it.
San Mateo is a microcosm of the best of
our nation. Rare is a day when a hawk does
not soar overhead or a child exclaim in joy in
Central Park. At the county hospital, a physi-
cian will save a life or counsel the despondent
not to give up hope. Up the hill, students at-
tend to their coursework at the College of San
Mateo.
Residents know that the best pie on the
planet is to be had at Heidi Pies. If the otters
at CuriOdyssey science museum don’t bring a
smile to your face and joy to your heart, you
have no soul. One hundred twenty-five years
after the city’s founding, the kite surfers off the
city’s levee have it right. Go with the wind and
find your way across the choppy waves. Ex-
citement is in San Mateo, California, along
with joy, genius, generosity, and tremendous
pride in the United States of America.

HONORING DAVE ADKISSON ON
THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIRE-
MENT
HON. HAROLD ROGERS
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in recognition of Dave Adkisson,
for his years of dedicated service in expanding
business and enhancing opportunity through-
out the Commonwealth of Kentucky. A true
champion for business-community outreach
and development, Dave’s retirement in Octo-
ber 2019 marks an impactful 15-year career
dedicated to advancing businesses and pro-
moting workers’ priorities with the Kentucky
Chamber of Commerce.
Dave was raised in Owensboro, Kentucky,
where he first sowed the seeds of his passion
for business and community development.
After starting his career at the local chamber
of commerce, his success and community
leadership were further evidenced when he
was twice elected mayor of Owensboro.
After serving as president of the Bir-
mingham, Alabama Chamber, Dave returned
home to the Commonwealth to serve as head
of the state chamber in 2005. Due to his lead-
ership and selfless discipline, the Kentucky
Chamber became the state’s largest business
association. Dave expanded the Chamber’s
Frankfort headquarters to focus on Kentucky-
first policy and local community development.
Due to the economic growth and business ad-
vancements under Dave’s efforts, the state
chamber doubled in size and became a promi-
nent voice, advocating for Kentucky on the na-
tional scale. With Dave as president and CEO,
the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce was
named the State Chamber of the Year by the
Council of State Chambers.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1086 August 30, 2019
Dave has used his state chamber position
by serving the Commonwealth community in
multiple positions, including serving as the
chairman of the American Chamber of Com-
merce Executives, and the chairman of the
national Council of State Chambers. In each
role, Dave worked to ensure that not only local
business-community relationships existed, but
also that Kentucky businesses were featured,
utilized and grown on the national landscape.
He has been an incredible force in the field of
commerce and economic development for the
Commonwealth.
I am particularly proud of Dave’s tireless ad-
vocacy for enhancing our business community
through education and workforce develop-
ment. Kentucky’s workforce is the best in the
country, and his efforts to create the Kentucky
Chamber Workforce Center and the Leader-
ship Institute for School Principals have cer-
tainly yielded tremendous results. It is clear
that his personal passion has shown through
in these successful initiatives.
Dave has been a true leader for Kentucky
and we will do our best to continue his dedi-
cated work for the region we all love. As he
enters retirement, my wife Cynthia and I wish
Dave, Bonnie and their entire family immense
joy and blessings in the years to come.

CELEBRATING GOLDIE MAE
HAMPTON’S 100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise to honor Mrs. Goldie Mae Hampton as
she celebrates her 100th birthday. Mrs. Hamp-
ton will join the short list of Americans who
have earned the status of centenarian on Sep-
tember 17, 2019.
Mrs. Hampton is the daughter of Grover and
Florence Pierce. She was born and raised in
Lincoln County, Missouri along with her three
siblings, Grover, Otto, and Idell. By the time
Mrs. Hampton was only 16, she had met the
love of her life, John Wesley Hampton, and
knew she wanted to get married right away. In
1935, Goldie Mae Pierce and John, who went
by Wesley, married and together they had two
daughters, Elaine and Pamela.
Over the years, Mrs. Hampton has lived an
active and adventurous life. She and Wesley
loved to travel all across the country in their
motorhome. Their travels even took them to
international destinations, including Israel.
When she was not exploring, Mrs. Hampton
was involved in the banking industry and
would regularly assist with her eldest daugh-
ter’s Girl Scout troop. Although she spent
much of her time helping others, Mrs. Hamp-
ton still found the time to do some of the
things she enjoyed most like square dancing,
gardening, playing pinochle and dominos, cro-
cheting, and ceramics.
Mrs. Hampton now resides in St. Charles
County, Missouri where she still enjoys staying
active, spending time with her family and din-
ners out on the town. As a remaining member
of America’s Greatest Generation, she con-
siders herself blessed and is grateful to have
made it to 100. She counts each day as a gift
and is determined to continue living life to the
fullest—an example we all strive to follow.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
Mrs. Goldie Mae Hampton as she celebrates
her 100th birthday. May she continue to expe-
rience good health and the love and support
by those she cares for the most on this mo-
mentous occasion.

REMEMBERING THE ACHIEVE-
MENTS OF DOCTOR R.C. SHAH
HON. CAROL D. MILLER
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to posthumously recognize, Doctor Rajnikant
Chandulal Shah—affectionately known to
many as ‘‘R.C.’’ Doctor Shah, born on April
11, 1944, was raised in Jinja, Uganda before
he moved to Mumbai, India to attend Grant
Medical College; after receiving his medical
degree, he moved again to America to pursue
better educational opportunities. It was within
the mountains of Appalachia, where he de-
cided to continue his surgical training with Ap-
palachian Regional Hospitals and West Vir-
ginia University School of Medicine.
Often referred to as and recognized as one
of the best General Surgeons in all of West
Virginia, Doctor Shah, throughout forty years
of private practice, devoted his life to caring
for southern West Virginians in the commu-
nities of Beckley, Hinton, Sophia, Rainelle,
Oak Hill, and Meadow Bridge.
While also maintaining an active and influ-
ential career, Doctor Shah remained an asset
to the healthcare industry all throughout the
Mountain State. He was a fervent advocate for
bettering the health of all his fellow West Vir-
ginians—making great efforts to recruit and re-
tain top-notch medical talent to the Mountain
State. Even after long hours and days spent
entrenched in complicated surgical cases, he
made time to serve in a wide variety of med-
ical leadership roles and spent year after year
teaching future generations of medical leaders
from West Virginia University, Marshall Univer-
sity, and Lewisburg College of Osteopathic
Medicine.
Doctor Shah’s list of accomplishments are
many—they include: decades of serving as a
Board of Trustees Member as well as a Med-
ical Director of two hospitals associated with
the Appalachian Regional Healthcare system,
President of the West Virginia Chapter of the
American College of Surgeons, titles at mul-
tiple area hospitals including Chairman of Sur-
gery, Chief of Medical Staff, and President of
the Raleigh County Medical Society. He also
served for over twenty years as a Clinical As-
sociate Professor for West Virginia University
School of Medicine.
May God bless Doctor R.C. Shah. I wish I
could thank him for all he has done for the
people of the great State of West Virginia. He
will always be fondly remembered by his fam-
ily, friends, colleagues, and the countless peo-
ple whose lives he impacted during his life-
time.
IN MEMORY OF CYNTHIA MEADOW
HON. JERROLD NADLER
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
offer my most sincere condolences to the fam-
ily and friends of Cynthia K. Watkins Meadow,
who passed away on April 25, 2019. Cynthia
was a long-time congressional staffer and
dedicated public servant.
Cynthia was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas,
on July 27, 1941. She graduated from Fort
Smith High School, attended Fort Smith Junior
College, and graduated from Baylor University
in 1964. Cynthia went on to obtain her law de-
gree from Catholic University, attending night
school while working as a congressional staff-
er.
Cynthia’s 30-year career on Capitol Hill
began on the staff of U.S. Senator Ralph Yar-
borough and culminated on the House Judici-
ary Committee under Chairman Jack Brooks,
where she rose to become Chief Counsel of
the Subcommittee on Economic and Commer-
cial Law. She also served on the professional
staff of the House Government Operations
Committee’s Subcommittee on Legislation and
National Security.
One of the more important bills Cynthia
worked on for the Judiciary Committee was
the Americans with Disabilities Act. Cynthia
helped then-Chairman Brooks use sign lan-
guage during hearings and markups on the
legislation, for the benefit of members of the
public who were hearing impaired. To show
his appreciation, Chairman Brooks sent Cyn-
thia a floral arrangement afterwards. As she
told her co-workers, she was quite surprised
and delighted by his gesture.
Following her retirement from Capitol Hill in
January 1995, Cynthia attended and grad-
uated from the Baptist Seminary in Richmond,
Virginia. Continuing her lifelong dedication to
helping others, she served as an ordained
Deacon at University Baptist Church in Col-
lege Park, Maryland.
Cynthia is survived by her husband Joseph
F. Meadow and her son Michael Joseph, who
works for the Architect of the Capitol, as well
as her sisters, Sandy and Gloria, and many in-
laws, nephews, and nieces.
Cynthia’s good work and deeds will long be
remembered by her many friends on Capitol
Hill, in the Washington area, and around the
Nation.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF DR.

HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the memory and legacy of Dr. Chin
Houi Lin of Houston, Texas.
Dr. Chin Houi Lin was born in the rural vil-
lage Putian County in Fuijian Province, China
on October 4, 1942. At the age of 7, he and
most of his family fled China and moved to
Taiwan. In 1960, Chin entered the Chemical
Engineering Department at the National Tai-
wan University. He was admitted with the

highest test scores of any student in that pro-
gram that year and went with the dream of
being an engineer like his father.
In 1964, Chin met his dream girl, Jen-Ching
(Grace) Chang. They married on July 10,
1966. Soon after, he received a full scholar-
ship to the Chemical Engineering graduate
program at Rice University in Houston, Texas.
When Chin’s PhD advisor moved to another
university, Chin taught himself to work on IBM
computers on the forefront of scientific com-
puting technology, still managing to complete
his PhD in four years.
Afterwards, he became a dedicated aero-
space engineer at NASA Johnson Space Cen-
ter (JSC) in 1980, where he stayed until his
retirement in 2007. While at NASA Chin devel-
oped heat pipes to cool spacecraft, computer
models of thermal regulation in space suits,
and two-phase flow computer simulations.
Eventually, Chin became the Branch Chief of
the Thermal Systems Branch of the Crew and
Thermal Systems Division of NASA. During
his time at NASA he was awarded two Excep-
tional Service Medals and granted a patent for
the ‘‘Inflatable Spacecraft Module’’, which was
awarded the NASA Government Invention of
the Year for 2017.
Chin is remembered as a man of few words,
preferring to lead by example and express
love through his actions. He showed his family
and friends how to be strong while gentle and
kind, and how to accomplish great things while
remaining humble. We thank Dr. Chin Houi Lin
for his contributions to NASA and for his leg-
acy of lasting servitude.
Madam Speaker, my condolences remain
with the family, community, and friends of Dr.
Chin Houi Lin.

RECOGNIZING EVIDENT LIFE
CHURCH’S TEN-YEAR ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. ANDY BIGGS
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, this summer,
Evident Life Church in Gilbert, Arizona cele-
brates its ten-year anniversary. I join with Pas-
tor Eric Jones, his wife Velvet, and members
of their congregation in celebrating this
achievement.
Starting a new venture—especially building
a church community and foundation—is never
easy. It takes courage, perseverance, and
faith to step forward to begin this process.
Over the past ten years, Pastor Jones, his
family, and his leadership team have endured
both trials and triumphs and have always risen
to the occasion with the help of our Creator.
They have cultivated a thriving church that is
a beacon of hope in our community.
Evident Life Church is extremely active
throughout the East Valley. Pastor Jones
serves as the co-chairman for my faith council,
and his prayers and encouragement sustain
me and many of our public servants each and
every day.
I’m thankful for Pastor Jones, his wife Vel-
vet, and the entire team at Evident Life
Church. To all the pastors, ministers, coordi-
nators, and members: have a wonderful cele-
bration, and may their church enjoy many dec-
ades of fruitful ministry.
TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF CORNELIA
DOZIER COOPER
HON. HAROLD ROGERS
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to pay tribute to one of Eastern
Kentucky’s most dedicated philanthropes of
the arts, Cornelia Dozier Cooper, who has
been awarded the prestigious Milner Award,
presented by Governor Matt Bevin as part of
the 2018–2019 Governor’s Awards in the Arts.
This award recognizes individuals and organi-
zations who make extraordinary and signifi-
cant contributions to the arts in Kentucky.
Cornelia Dozier Cooper has embodied pas-
sion for the visual, fine, and performing arts
throughout her impressive career in Pulaski
County. Not only is Cornelia an accomplished
artist herself, having studied English water-
color at Oxford University and shadowing an
impressive and diverse group of artists rang-
ing from local masters at the University of
Kentucky to artists in France and Italy, but an
ardent proponent of the development of art
and art education across Kentucky. Patrons
and artists from across the state are grateful
for Cornelia’s lifetime support of art: for the
time and financial resources that she and her
late husband, Richard Cooper, have given to
promote community arts and cultural growth in
the region. Through their tremendous influ-
ence, the Coopers have encouraged involve-
ment in the arts and created an enriching, ex-
citing environment in which the people of the
Commonwealth of Kentucky may participate
and enjoy for generations to come.
Among her long list of accolades includes
that she is a founding member of the Ken-
tucky Arts Council, founding member and
President of the Lake Cumberland Performing
Arts Series, Inc, the only female member of
the Governor’s Mansion Commission to ‘‘Save
the Mansion,’’ was appointed by the University
of Kentucky Board of Trustees top serve on
the McDowell Cancer Network Board, Presi-
dent of the Somerset Garden Club, Chair of
the Fountain Square Foundation in Somerset,
Kentucky, an original member of the Kentucky
Arts and Crafts Foundation, and a member of
the University of Kentucky Museum Board.
She is President of the Cornelia Dozier Coo-
per Endowment Fund, a nonprofit organization
to benefit and promote the arts in Pulaski
County and the surrounding region. The En-
dowment awards several $1000 grants each
year to support and encourage the arts in
Eastern Kentucky and regularly supports local
artists and an array of outstanding programs
in professional arts and cultural events in
Somerset, Kentucky, and the surrounding re-
gion. Cornelia donates the proceeds of her
paintings’ sales to the Endowment Fund. Cor-
nelia has been awarded the Master Musicians
Festival Lifetime Achievement Award and the
East Kentucky Foundation Outstanding Citizen
Award in 2006. The ‘‘Cooper Building’’ on the
campus of Somerset Community College was
dedicated to the philanthropy of Cornelia and
Richard Cooper for their philanthropy to both
Somerset Community College and the Univer-
sity of Kentucky.
At 93 years old, this lifelong Kentuckian,
Cornelia Dozier Cooper, is known and beloved
by all for her ‘‘tireless enthusiasm,’’ and is re-
garded as a ‘‘personal hero and mentor’’ to
many throughout Eastern Kentucky. In addi-
tion to serving the community, she is a mother
of two children, four grandchildren, and three
great-grandchildren.
The Milner Award is an honor fitting for Ms.
Cornelia Dozier Cooper in recognition of a life-
time of devotion to art, education, and the
positive impact that she has made, and is con-
tinuing to provide, on Eastern Kentucky
through her service to the arts. I am deeply
grateful for Cornelia’s love and commitment to
the arts. My wife, Cynthia, and I wish Cornelia
and her family immense joy and blessings in
the years to come.

ADRIAN MEYERS 100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. BILLY LONG
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 30, 2019
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the fabulous life of Adrian Meyers,
who turned 100 on April 4 this year.
Adrian was born and raised in Kenton, Ten-
nessee, graduating from high school there in
1937. She went on to attend the University of
Tennessee-Martin for two years before trans-
ferring to Murray State University where she
graduated with a bachelor’s of science in
chemistry.
Not long after graduating, Adrian accepted a
fellowship at the University of Kentucky where
she received her master’s degree in mathe-
matics while serving as a graduate assistant.
After earning her degree, she returned to Ken-
ton to take care of her father. However, she
continued her teaching career, eventually be-
coming an associate professor of mathematics
at Illinois State University, where she taught
for 18 years.
One of the many highlights of Adrian’s long
career was attending the National Science
Foundation Institute in San Jose, California. It
also happened to be the place she met her fu-
ture husband, Dr. W.H. Meyers.
After a long career in education, Adrian and
her husband decided to use retirement to trav-
el. They went to various locations all across
the U.S. and Europe. This is a woman who
has always stayed very informed in current
events, listening to several commentators
daily. Her husband passed away a few years
ago, sadly, and she has since relocated to
Springfield, Missouri, to be near family.
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Adrian
Meyers has lived a beautiful life. She spent
her entire professional career graciously serv-
ing as a public-school teacher, which is be-
yond laudable. America owes her a debt of
gratitude for her many years of service, and I
am honored to rise today, recognizing this ex-
traordinary life.

Arnie proudly served in the Army and was

fense. He was a loving husband and caring fa-
ther. Mr. Cabello will forever be remembered
for his service to his nation and to his commu-

His perpetual selflessness, characterized by
a life of service, began with enlistment in the
United States Army and continued through his
work for fellow service members with the Ko-
rean War Veterans Association (KWVA 272),
the Rockford Veterans of Foreign Wars, and
the American Legion.
Mr. Cabello exemplified public service by his
community involvement, participating in local
government as a Trustee for Harlem Town-
ship, membership in the Knights of Columbus,
and as director of the Phantom Regiment Ca-
dets.
Arnie was a generous man that faithfully
served his God, country, and community. But
most of all, Arnie loved his family. Madam
