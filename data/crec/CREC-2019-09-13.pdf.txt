COMMENDING THE WORK OF THE
SINDHI FOUNDATION AND TASSC
INTERNATIONAL
HON. PETE OLSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 13, 2019
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to acknowledge the important work of the
Sindhi Foundation and TASSC International.
They are tearing down the barriers that sow
division between cultures, fight discrimination
and prejudice, and shine a light on those
countries who target minorities for kidnapping,
torture, and death.
Sindhis in Pakistan, Kurds in the Middle
East, Tamils in Sri Lanka, Uyghurs in China
and others have been lost to ‘‘enforced dis-
appearances,’’ removed from their families
and erased from the sunlight of society. This
terrifying and barbaric practice must end.
The Sindhi Foundation and TASSC Inter-
national are doing valiant work highlighting this
heinousness. I thank them for their continued
efforts to combat injustice, promote equity and
provide healing to hurt families around the
world.

HONORING NATIONAL HUNGER
ACTION DAY
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 13, 2019
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor National Hunger Action Day.
Our nation has seen the damage and despair
that hunger inflicts in our communities. In the
greatest country on earth, no child should go
to bed hungry. I am proud that the City of
Charleston is committed to stamping out hun-
ger in the Lowcountry.
The Lowcountry Food Bank is working in
our district to educate folks about food insecu-
rity and reduce the rates of it in our commu-
nity. More than 25 million meals—yes, you
heard that right—25 MILLION meals were dis-
tributed in 2018 by the Lowcountry Food Bank
and its 300 food pantries. The role that this
network plays in our community is vital in ad-
dressing hunger and raising awareness of an
issue that reaches all corners of the world.
No child, no family, and no human being
should experience the pain that hunger inflicts.
National Hunger Action Day is one of the
many platforms dedicated to tackling this cri-
sis. Foodbanks across the Lowcountry and the
rest of the country are teaming up to host
events in September to bring awareness to
food insecurity and how it impacts us as a so-
ciety. We must fight hunger and mobilize the
resources to take action and confront this cri-
sis head on.
HONORING THOMAS TODARO, VET-
ERANS OF FOREIGN WARS DE-
PARTMENT OF NEW YORK COM-
MANDER
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 13, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
honor Veterans of Foreign Wars Department
of New York Commander, Thomas Todaro.
Thomas was elected to this prestigious and
well-deserved post in June 2019. He has
served both his country and his fellow Vet-
erans for many years. During the Vietnam
War, Thomas served in the United States
Army as part of the 9th Infantry Division and
was stationed at Mei Kong Delta. There, he
earned the rank of Sergeant E–5.
In 1972, Thomas joined the John W. Tiffany
VFW Post 53 in Jamestown, New York. He
became a life member in 1997 and is now a
Gold Legacy Life Member. He has held var-
ious positions within the VFW over the years,
including Senior Vice Commander, Chau-
tauqua County Commander and Sixth District
Commander. He also served on a variety of
state committees during his tenure. In 2015,
he was appointed as the Patriotic Instructor at
the 2015 State Convention, Chief of Staff at
the 2016 State Convention and Junior Vice
Commander at the 2017 State Convention.
Thomas has also served as a Service Offi-
cer in the VFW Department of New York and
the Director of Veterans Service for the state.
He continues to hold a staff position as a
mentor for the Buffalo Veterans Court.
Thomas has clearly given much of himself
for our country and our Veterans. Congratula-
tions to you, Thomas, for this new position—
and I thank you for all that you have done and
will do in the future. I know that Veterans in
New York State have gained a wise leader
and a genuinely honorable man with you as
their Commander.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
honor VFW Department of New York Com-
mander, Thomas Todaro.

RECOGNIZING GEORGE WASH-
INGTON CARVER HIGH SCHOOL
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 13, 2019
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to include in the RECORD a commemora-
tion of George Washington Carver High
School and the George Washington Carver
Alumni and Friends Association. It is with
great pleasure that I commend George Wash-
ington Carver High School for receiving a his-
torical highway marker designation from the
Virginia Department of Historic Resources.
George Washington Carver High School
was founded in 1948 after African-Americans
in Chesterfield County advocated for a new
high school to address the lack of appropriate
educational opportunities and services for Afri-
can-American students. Over the next 22
years, George Washington Carver High
School was the county’s only public high
school for African-American students. Mr. Wil-
liam Albert ‘‘W.A.’’ Brown, the sole principal of
the school, along with his faculty and staff,
propelled George Washington Carver High
School to become a center of intellectual and
cultural excellence within the community.
George Washington Carver High School
closed its doors in 1970 due to desegregation
across the country. To honor its legacy of
breaking barriers and providing exceptional
educational opportunities, the George Wash-
ington Carver Alumni and Friends Association
formed in 2014. For the past five years, the
organization has provided services for the
community, such as mentoring, volunteering,
and supporting students with scholarships and
other resources. Due to the efforts of the
George Washington Carver Alumni and
Friends Association, the former school site
was recognized with a historical highway
marker by the Virginia Department of Historic
Resources. The Association’s outreach efforts
and tireless advocacy prove that the work
ethic instilled in the 22 classes of George
Washington Carver High School endures
today.
The Virginia Department of Historic Re-
sources approved George Washington Carver
Alumni and Friends Association’s request to
designate the former high school as a historic
site on April 17, 2019. The official recognition
ceremony was on June 21, 2019, with a rep-
resentative from the Virginia Department of
Historic Resources, and the unveiling of a
large mounted poster at the George Wash-
ington Carver Alumni and Friends Association
Biennial Scholarship Benefit Gala will be held
on September 21, 2019.
Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join
me in honoring the George Washington
Carver High School and the legacy it has left
behind for the entire country.

HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Paul Laurence Dunbar Com-
memorative Coin Act. This bill recognizes one
of the first influential African-American poets in
American literature and benefits the Dunbar

United States. I myself am a proud graduate
of Dunbar, a storied African-American high
school in our country.
Paul Laurence Dunbar was born June 27,
1872, to freed slaves, and went on to pen
such classics as Majors and Minors and Lyrics
of Lowly Life. He also composed the lyrics to
In Dahomey, the first all-African-American mu-
sical produced on Broadway. By the late
1890s, Dunbar had become a prominent au-
thor, having had his poems published in major
national newspapers, including The New York
Times. Dunbar died February 9, 1906, at age
33.
Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School
was established in the District of Columbia in
1870 as the Preparatory High School for Col-
ored Youth. It was the first college preparatory
high school for African-American children in
the United States. The school was renamed
for Dunbar in 1916.
The Dunbar Alumni Federation was orga-
nized in 2002 to provide scholarships and
other financial support to students and grad-
uates of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School.
The Federation has alumni from more than 35
graduating classes, and supports the school
through its scholarship efforts, community ac-
tivities and other endeavors.
This bill authorizes the Secretary of the
Treasury to mint 50,000 five-dollar coins,
400,000 one-dollar coins, and 750,000 half-
dollar coins, with a surcharge on each coin.
The surcharges will benefit the scholarships
and similar activities of the Dunbar Alumni
Federation.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

CELEBRATING THE UPCOMING
MARRIAGE OF MAYOR JIMMY
CARROLL AND CAROL POWERS
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 13, 2019
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of
Mayor Jimmy Carroll and his extraordinary
fiancée, Carol Powers. I am honored to know
this wonderful couple and congratulate them
as they become one family. I am inspired by
their love for the Lowcountry, the ocean, their
family, and the love that they so proudly dis-
play for one another.
Mayor Carroll and Carol Powers will be offi-
cially husband and wife on September 14th,
2019, but these two have been partners in life
for quite some time. Carol has been a support
system and partner to Mayor Carroll at his real
estate company and business endeavors. She
also knows when to put her foot down to pro-
tect his well-being, as she let the Mayor know
that she would not marry him if he continued
to volunteer at the Fire Department. Mayor
Carroll lovingly obliged. It’s good to know that
someone is looking out for Mayor Carroll while
he looks out for Isle of Palms. That is the life-
long partnership people dream of.
On a personal note, it has been an honor to
work alongside Mayor Carroll. We share a
deep love for the ocean, and he has been an
invaluable partner in protecting our coast. Isle
of Palms could not ask for a better Mayor and
future First Lady. I wish for them a lifetime of
love as endless as the ocean and as timeless
as the tides.
