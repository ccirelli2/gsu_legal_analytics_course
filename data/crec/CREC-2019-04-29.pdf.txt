DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER
PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,
April 29, 2019.
I hereby appoint the Honorable G.K.
BUTTERFIELD to act as Speaker pro tempore

Speaker of the House of Representatives.
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:
God of the universe, we give You
thanks for giving us another day.
The House returns from a long recess
meeting with constituents, as concerns
about a myriad of issues reveal the
considerable divisions both in Congress
and among the American populace as
well.
Horrendous acts of religious violence
also occupy our attention and concern.
You alone triumph over death and sin,
for You alone are holy and eternal.
Prove Your victory in us. Take this
Nation and make it Your own. With
leadership from this body of Congress,
raise up a people who are unafraid to
look into the face of darkness, and by
will, science, and prayer, push back the
door of death. Strengthen our human
frailty, that we may continue to fight
against evil and become a nation of
hope and a people of virtue.
May all that is done this day be for
Your greater honor and glory.
Amen.

THE JOURNAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair has examined the Journal of the
last day’s proceedings and announces
to the House his approval thereof.
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote
on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval
of the Journal.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the Speaker’s approval
of the Journal.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I object
to the vote on the ground that a
quorum is not present and make the
point of order that a quorum is not
present.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8, rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.
The point of no quorum is considered
withdrawn.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.
WILSON) come forward and lead the
House in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led
the Pledge of Allegiance as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
f
VACCINATIONS WORK
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the CDC
announced that there are now over 700
cases of measles in our Nation. Measles
was allegedly an old disease that
wouldn’t come back in 2000 because
people got vaccinated. This is the larg-
est outbreak in measles since, I think,
the 1996 time.
I, unfortunately, got polio in 1954.
When the polio vaccine was being given
to second grade children, I was not in
the second grade; but my father was
giving shots, as a pediatrician, to sec-
ond graders, which included my broth-
er. He brought the vaccine home and
considered giving it to me but knew
that it was outside of his charge, so he
didn’t do it.
I came down with polio 3 or 4 months
later. My father and I both wished I
had the vaccine. It would have solved
and cured a lot of the problems I have
had since and have even today.
I ask each parent out there to make
sure your children get vaccinated so
that they don’t get measles and they
don’t spread measles to others so we
don’t have another terrible outbreak.
Vaccinations work.
f
CONDEMNING ATTACKS IN SRI
LANKA
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, on Easter Sunday, at least 253
innocents were brutally murdered in
Sri Lanka as a result of coordinated at-
tacks targeting hotels and Christian
churches. There were four American fa-
talities.
The tragic Easter Sunday bombings
are one of the worst terrorist attacks
since September 11, 2001. At least seven
suicide bombers hit multiple targets,
including St. Anthony’s Shrine, within
a short period of time of each other.
The attack was clearly planned in ad-
vance, as at least nine sites were tar-
geted. ISIS has claimed responsibility
for the attacks, and a safe house of
ISIS was raided by authorities on Fri-
day.
The American people stand steadfast
beside the people of Sri Lanka in

the people of Sri Lanka or any country
stand alone before the scourge of ter-
rorism.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,

SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the shoot-
ing that targeted the Jewish commu-
nity in the San Diego area this week-
end was a heartbreaking reminder of
the new challenges facing our country
and the world in the 21st century.
In centuries past, purveyors of anti-
Semitism, xenophobia, Islamophobia,
racism, and other vile forms of hatred
employed the ancient tools of whisper
and rumor and incitement in the vil-
lage squares to intoxicate mobs with
fear, and fuel violence against those of
a different race, a different religion, a
different origin, and a different color.
Today, the internet and social media
have provided haters with modern tools
to do the same incitement. We have
seen it in Pittsburgh and in San Diego.
We have seen it in Charlottesville; in
Christchurch, New Zealand; and in Sri
Lanka. We have seen it in the viral im-
ages online using anti-Semitic tropes,
or painting Muslims as terrorists, or
vilifying migrant families.
As a nation, we need to take action
to counter these new forms of incite-
ment. We are observing a lesson in how
hatred has adapted to the 21st century.
What we learn from that lesson and
how we adapt to combat new tools of
hatred will determine whether our de-
mocracy and commitment to tolerance
and pluralism will survive this cen-
tury.
Mr. Speaker, I pray for the victims of
this weekend’s shooting, and I say to
them and all the others who have been
targeted by hate in our day: this House
stands against hate and will continue
to do its part to promote the vision of
our Founders, of a nation where all are
created equal, and endowed not by the
government or the Constitution, but by
their creator with certain unalienable
rights, and among these are: life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Let us all stand for tolerance, for in-
clusion, and reject hate. One nation,
under God, indivisible, with liberty and
justice for all.

SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING IN POWAY
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, as
Members have all heard, this weekend
our Nation experienced another hor-
rific attack on the Jewish people dur-
ing Passover, this time in a shooting at
a San Diego-area synagogue.
This is something that I am afraid is
becoming too commonplace, and we are
becoming comfortable with this type of
violence against Jewish people around
our country and even around the world.
Multiple people were injured. One
person even lost her life, Lori Gilbert-
Kaye. Eyewitnesses claimed she died
while shielding the Rabbi from gunfire,
her friend of more than 30 years.
Almog Peretz shepherded many chil-
dren away from the gunfire and toward
safety.
While most people, understandably,
were fleeing this violence, Army vet-
eran, Oscar Stewart, instinctively ran
towards the gunfire, which froze the
shooter. He was shouting and intimi-
dating the shooter which eventually
chased him off.
From there, off-duty U.S. Border Pa-
trol Officer Jonathan Morales joined
him in the parking lot with a handgun
and shot several rounds at the shoot-
er’s car which made him continue to
flee.
There is no telling how bad this could
have gotten without the heroics of
these folks. And as Oscar Stewart al-
luded, a good guy with a gun can stop
a bad guy with a gun, and it happened
in this case.
Join me in praying for Lori Gilbert-
Kaye and her family, and for all those
who were injured. God bless those who
stepped up and saved the lives of oth-
ers.

TARGET PRACTICE AND MARKS-
MANSHIP TRAINING SUPPORT
ACT
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 1222) to amend the Pittman-Rob-
ertson Wildlife Restoration Act to fa-
cilitate the establishment of additional
or expanded public target ranges in
certain States.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1222
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Target Prac-
tice and Marksmanship Training Support
Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
(1) the use of firearms and archery equip-
ment for target practice and marksmanship
training activities on Federal land is al-
lowed, except to the extent specific portions
of that land have been closed to those activi-
ties;
(2) in recent years preceding the date of en-
actment of this Act, portions of Federal land
have been closed to target practice and
marksmanship training for many reasons;
(3) the availability of public target ranges
on non-Federal land has been declining for a
variety of reasons, including continued popu-
lation growth and development near former
ranges;
(4) providing opportunities for target prac-
tice and marksmanship training at public
target ranges on Federal and non-Federal
land can help—
(A) to promote enjoyment of shooting, rec-
reational, and hunting activities; and
(B) to ensure safe and convenient locations
for those activities;
(5) Federal law in effect on the date of en-
actment of this Act, including the Pittman-
Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16
U.S.C. 669 et seq.), provides Federal support
for construction and expansion of public tar-
get ranges by making available to States
amounts that may be used for construction,
operation, and maintenance of public target
ranges; and
(6) it is in the public interest to provide in-
creased Federal support to facilitate the con-
struction or expansion of public target
ranges.
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to
facilitate the construction and expansion of
public target ranges, including ranges on
Federal land managed by the Forest Service
and the Bureau of Land Management.
SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF PUBLIC TARGET RANGE.
In this Act, the term ‘‘public target range’’
means a specific location that—
(1) is identified by a governmental agency
for recreational shooting;
(2) is open to the public;
(3) may be supervised; and
(4) may accommodate archery or rifle, pis-
tol, or shotgun shooting.
SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS TO PITTMAN-ROBERTSON
WILDLIFE RESTORATION ACT.
(a) DEFINITIONS.—Section 2 of the Pittman-
Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16
U.S.C. 669a) is amended—
(1) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through
(8) as paragraphs (3) through (9), respec-
tively; and
(2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the fol-
lowing:
‘‘(2) the term ‘public target range’ means a
specific location that—
‘‘(A) is identified by a governmental agen-
cy for recreational shooting;
‘‘(B) is open to the public;
‘‘(C) may be supervised; and
‘‘(D) may accommodate archery or rifle,
pistol, or shotgun shooting;’’.

(c) FIREARM AND BOW HUNTER EDUCATION
AND SAFETY PROGRAM GRANTS.—Section 10 of
the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration
Act (16 U.S.C. 669h–1) is amended—

‘‘(B) EXCEPTION.—Amounts provided for ac-
quiring land for, constructing, or expanding
a public target range shall remain available
for expenditure and obligation during the 5-
fiscal-year period beginning on October 1 of
the first fiscal year for which the amounts
are made available.’’.
SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CO-
OPERATION.
It is the sense of Congress that, consistent
with applicable laws and regulations, the
Chief of the Forest Service and the Director
of the Bureau of Land Management should
cooperate with State and local authorities
and other entities to carry out waste re-
moval and other activities on any Federal
land used as a public target range to encour-
age continued use of that land for target
practice or marksmanship training.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW) and the
gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey?
There was no objection.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the Target Practice and
Marksmanship Training Support Act
amends the Pittman-Robertson Wild-
life Restoration Act to authorize a
State to pay up to 90 percent of the
costs of acquiring land for constructing
a public target range. Under the cur-
rent law, the State is authorized to pay
up to only 75 percent of the cost.
This bill also allows the State to al-
locate 10 percent of its Federal wildlife
restoration funding to building public
target ranges.
This bill was part of the negotiated
historic lands package that was signed
into law in March of this year, but this
specific section had to be pulled from
the final package because language in
the bill is required to originate in the
House.
I would like to commend Congress-
man KIND for his continued support of
sportsmen and sportswomen and his
work to send this last piece of the ne-
gotiated package to the Senate.
This is, again, a good opportunity to
celebrate the rightfully named lands
package, the John D. Dingell, Jr. Con-
servation, Management, and Recre-
ation Act, which was a product of
many months of negotiations and
many years of committee process.
The lands package benefits all Amer-
icans by protecting ecosystems, pre-
serving our cultural heritage, and con-
necting people to their lands. By pro-
tecting ecosystems, preserving our cul-
tural heritage, and connecting people
to their lands, we demonstrate this
Congress’ commitment to public lands
that serve all Americans.
Not only did the package perma-
nently authorize the Land and Water
Conservation Fund, but it also added
over 1 million acres of wilderness, des-
ignated four new national monuments,
and expanded three national parks,
just to name a few of the over 100 pro-
visions. H.R. 1222 is simply the last to
get over the finish line, and I am proud
to support it.
I urge my colleagues to continue to
support the lands package and support
this bipartisan bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
CONRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS,
Washington, DC, April 29, 2019.
Hon. RAÚL M. GRIJALVA,
Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA: I am writing
with respect to H.R. 1222, ‘‘Target Practice
and Marksmanship Training Support Act.’’
As a result of your having consulted with us
on provisions on which the Committee on
Ways and Means has jurisdictional interest,
I will not request sequential referral on this
measure.
The Committee on Ways and Means takes
this action with the mutual understanding
that we do not waive any jurisdiction over
the subject matter contained in this or simi-
lar legislation, and the Committee will be
appropriately consulted and involved as the
bill or similar legislation moves forward so
that we may address any remaining issues
within our jurisdiction. The Committee also
reserves the right to seek appointment of an
appropriate number of conferees to any
House-Senate conference involving this or
similar legislation, and request your support
for such a request.
Finally, I would appreciate your response
to this letter confirming this understanding,
and would ask that a copy of our exchange of
letters on this matter be included in the
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of H.R. 1222.
Sincerely,

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES,
Washington, DC, April 29, 2019.
Hon. RICHARD E. NEAL,

House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for con-
sulting with the Natural Resources Com-
mittee on H.R. 1222, ‘‘Target Practice and
Marksmanship Training Support Act’’ and
agreeing to forgo a sequential referral re-
quest so that the bill may proceed expedi-
tiously to the House floor.
I agree that your declining to pursue a re-
ferral in this case does not diminish or alter
the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways
and Means nor prejudice its jurisdictional
prerogatives on this bill or similar legisla-
tion in the future. I would support your ef-
fort to seek appointment of an appropriate
number of conferees from your Committee
over any parts of this bill or similar legisla-
tion under the jurisdiction of the Committee
on Ways and Means to any House-Senate
conference.
I will ensure that our exchange of letters is
included in the Congressional Record during
floor consideration of bill. I appreciate your
cooperation regarding this bill and look for-
ward to continuing to work with you as this
measure moves through the legislative proc-
ess.
Sincerely,
RAÚL M. GRIJALVA,
Chairman,
House Natural Resources Committee.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I am here to support H.R. 1222, and I
am very pleased that Congressman
KIND and Congressman HUNTER were
able to introduce this and for their
part in this particular statement.
As was said by the gentleman from
New Jersey, this has been before this
House before. We have passed it in
committee before and in the House be-
fore, and it was part of the original
package, the land package that went
through earlier this year.
Unfortunately, because of a techni-
cality in the slowdown that we had in
having to reintroduce the bill as a Sen-
ate bill, this must come through as a
House bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3290 April 29, 2019
However, I am pleased to report that
all the concerns people had have been
resolved at this point. The Senate has
already deemed this bill to have passed
once the House acts on it. So, with our
passage today, I think this bill is going
fast into becoming an actual piece of
legislation.
I want to thank Representative GRI-
JALVA and his staff. Mr. GRIJALVA is
not here today. The gentleman from
New Jersey is in his place, and a much
better dresser, I might add, and I thank
him. I thank them for their efforts to
continue on with this program that
was part of the original package. We
had hiccups that we had to solve in
some particular way, so Mr. GRIJALVA
and his staff worked very hard on this
particular piece of legislation.
This is something that has been long
sought by the sports community. The
Pittman-Robertson fund, which is a
great fund that relies on excise taxes
paid on purchases that are made by
hunters and fishers and recreational
shooters, that goes into this fund,
which has been around for almost 80
years and has already contributed
about $10 billion.
It has been important to start hunter
education programs. It has been impor-
tant also for the construction and the
maintenance of our public shooting
ranges. The long-term viability is sig-
nificant.
As this Nation becomes more urban-
ized, the ability of people having a safe
place where they can go, and they can
do practice, target practice, it becomes
even more significant that these ranges
have to be maintained. These ranges
have to be improved in some particular
way.
What this bill does is the perfect so-
lution. It takes this fund of money, but
then allows the States to have greater
flexibility of how it is going to be ad-
ministered. By allowing them to even
match with just 10 percent, it gives the
States the ability to move forward and
to use the Pittman-Robertson fund for
5 years to fund shooting ranges and ex-
pand existing shooting ranges.
It empowers States—that is what we
should be doing more—but it empowers
States that will actually now encour-
age responsible hunting, responsible
recreational shooting, as well as ensur-
ing the wildlife conservation system,
which is, once again, a responsibility of
States.
What we are doing here is, I think,
taking the right approach with a fund
that already exists, giving States flexi-
bility, and encouraging the sporting
community. That is why the sportsmen
of our country have long sought for
this particular provision. They look at
this as a major and important win.
Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of
this measure, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
VAN DREW) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1222.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Affairs facilities that were constructed
to provide affected Columbia River
Treaty tribes access to traditional fish-
ing grounds and expend funds on con-
struction of facilities and structures to
improve those conditions, and for other

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW) and the
gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey?
There was no objection.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 91 authorizes the
Bureau of Indian Affairs to assess sani-
tation and safety conditions on land
set aside to provide Columbia River
Treaty Tribes access to traditional
fishing grounds, and to enter into con-
tracts with Tribes or Tribal organiza-
tions to improve the identified condi-
tions.
The Columbia River Treaty Tribes,
through a series of treaties in 1855, es-
tablished access to ‘‘usual and accus-
tomed fishing areas’’ and ancillary
fishing facilities on the Columbia
River.
Starting in the 1930s, construction of
the dams of the Columbia River Power
System resulted in flooding and de-
struction of Tribal villages, homes, and
traditional fishing sites, severely im-
pacting the Tribal members’ ability to
exercise these treaty rights. The tribes
and their citizens have never been fully
compensated for their losses.
In a series of agreements and laws
starting in 1939, the Federal Govern-
ment acquired and developed small
parcels of land to serve as ‘‘in-lieu’’
and treaty fishing access sites, pro-
viding members of the Columbia River
Treaty Tribes access to exercise their
rights to fish in the Columbia and re-
side at their traditional fishing places
and fishing stations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3291
April 29, 2019
Additionally, Congress enacted the
Columbia River Treaty Fishing Access
Sites project in 1988, which authorized
improvements for the existing ancil-
lary fishing facilities and directed the
Army Corps of Engineers to acquire
new lands to provide unencumbered
river access for Tribal members.
Today, there are 31 Tribal fishing
sites located along the Columbia River,
27 of which are managed by the BIA.
The sites were intended to be used pri-
marily for in-season fishing and some
temporary camping.
However, out of both a need for hous-
ing and a desire to be closer to tradi-
tional fishing areas, many Tribal mem-
bers now use these areas as permanent
residences.
b 1645
These sites were not designed for and
cannot sustain this accommodated use.
In fact, many people at these sites are
living in extremely distressed, unsafe,
and unsanitary conditions as a direct
result of decades of unmet obligations
by the BIA.
Passage of H.R. 91 will result in vast
improvements to the conditions of
these sites. As such, I urge the quick
adoption of this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, even though H.R. 91 is a
new bill, we have seen it before. The
last time we were here, it was a Senate
bill that came over and passed our
committee but did not pass the floor
itself. We did talk about it as part of a
package we did earlier this year, that
it could have gone in that. For some
reason, it was not allowed to go in
there.
It does deal with four of the Colum-
bia River Treaty Tribes and the condi-
tions on their traditional fishing areas
that are basically unsanitary and sim-
ply unsafe. What this bill does is au-
thorize the Department of the Interior
to upgrade these areas, to make them
acceptable to safety and sanitary
standards, and to do that in consulta-
tion with the Tribes.
This bill is, in my estimation, a rea-
sonable approach. I have no objection
to passing this measure today.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. BLUMENAUER).
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I
appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy in
yielding to me and the presentation
that he made outlining the situation,
along with Ranking Member BISHOP,
under whose leadership this legislation
moved forward in the last Congress.
It is long overdue. It is jarring to
visit these in-lieu treaty sites. The no-
tion that it is unsanitary and unsafe
really understates the case.
Along the Columbia River, I have
passed one of these sites for years,
never knowing that what may be a
Tiger Woods three-iron shot off the
freeway revealed these conditions.
These are sites that have been used
by the Tribes for millennia, and sadly,
they were a casualty of the Columbia
River dam construction. Those dams
have produced significant economic
prosperity in our region with jobs and
agricultural activities, but the Native
people have been left behind.
There was a pledge that we would be
able to accommodate their sites that
were flooded, but that has been ob-
served mainly in the breach. It has
reached the point now where we have
on each of these sites people who natu-
rally want to gravitate to what is part
of their tradition. There is, as was ref-
erenced, a need for Tribal housing, but
the fishing experience, the proximity
to the river, and this being part of
their historic heritage draws them
there.
In many cases, they do have sites
where people are living on a year-round
basis in conditions that really should
not exist anywhere in America.
It is interesting, when we started
this saga two centuries ago, Native
people had almost 2 billion acres that
was theirs to hunt, to fish, to live, and
there was some cultivation. The Fed-
eral Government, over a series of years
and a series of treaties, narrowed that
range. In fact, the Federal Government
started giving away Native American
people’s land before there was even a
treaty to White settlers.
The history is checkered and dis-
turbing. There have been acts that can
only be described as genocide—disease,
attacks on Native people, forced
marches. We had our own Trail of
Tears in the Pacific Northwest. And,
consistently, we have not met our obli-
gations to more recent treaties.
I am pleased that the committee has
brought this forward on a bipartisan
basis. I am pleased that the adminis-
tration is aligned with us in, it looks
like, being able to move forward to
deal with what needs to happen with
some of these sites.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we
have a partnership in the Senate with
my friend and colleague, Senator JEFF
MERKLEY, and Senator PATTY MURRAY,
who has been deeply involved with this,
so that we are positioned to take ac-
tion that is long overdue, keeping faith
with the Tribal people, keeping faith
with our commitment through history,
being able to make sure that the
progress that we have been working on
here for 4 years is poised to move for-
ward.
Mr. Speaker, I deeply appreciate the
work that has been done with the com-
mittee on a bipartisan basis to get us
to this position. I look forward to its
passage in the House and the Senate
and being executed by the executive.
It is going to make a big difference to
people who are worthy and deserving of
our best efforts.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, if
I could inquire of the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW) if he has
any more speakers. I don’t have any
other speakers.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I have
no further speakers.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the Columbia River In-Lieu and Treaty
Fishing Access Sites Improvement Act. This
bill takes important steps to address an injus-
tice that four Columbia River Tribes have
faced for decades.
Beginning in the 1930s, the construction of
the Bonneville, John Day, and Dalles dams on
the lower Columbia River flooded many
homes and traditional fishing sites. The flood-
ing displaced members of the Confederated
Tribes of the Warm Springs Indian Reserva-
tion, Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla In-
dian Reservation, Nez Perce Tribe, and the
Confederated Tribes and Bands of the
Yakama Nation. The Army Corps of Engineers
designed 31 Columbia River Treaty Fishing
Access Sites and ‘‘in-lieu’’ sites along the
banks of the Columbia River to be used pri-
marily for in-season fishing and temporary
camping, but conditions have been extremely
unsafe and unsanitary.
This bill would authorize the Secretary of
the Interior to assess and update electricity,
water, and sewer infrastructure at existing Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs facilities that were con-
structed to provide treaty Tribes access to tra-
ditional fishing grounds. These Tribes have
treaty rights to fishing access sites on the Co-
lumbia River and we must uphold our obliga-
tions to provide safe and sanitary housing and
infrastructure. I thank Congressman BLU-
MENAUER and Senator MERKLEY for their lead-
ership, and I urge my colleagues to support
this bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
VAN DREW) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 91.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, on
that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey?
There was no objection.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 317 will reaffirm
the action of the Secretary of the Inte-
rior to take certain lands into trust for
the benefit of the Santa Ynez Band of
Chumash Mission Indians in California.
The current Chumash reservation is
just under 100 acres, but only 40 of
those acres are able to be utilized for
government offices, economic develop-
ment, and a few Tribal homes.
It is obvious that there is not enough
Tribal land for housing needs. Only 17
percent of Tribal members and lineal
descendants are able to live in Tribal
housing.
In 2010, the Tribe purchased approxi-
mately 1,400 acres of ancestral land in
an effort to provide suitable housing
for the Tribe’s members and their de-
scendants. Even though this land was
taken into trust administratively, a
number of parties continue to file law-
suits appealing the decision.
The Chumash leadership has been
forthcoming in their desire to acquire
this land only for additional Tribal
housing, and they have attempted to be
a good neighbor by engaging local
elected officials and groups to mitigate
any concerns.
It is a shame that it has taken al-
most a decade for this issue to be re-
solved, but now we are at the point
where we can finally put an end to this
process.
Passage of H.R. 317 will reaffirm the
Secretarial decision that put the land

in trust, clearing the way for the
Chumash to finally provide additional
Tribal housing for their members. The
bill will also incorporate a memo-
randum of agreement between the
Chumash Tribe and the Santa Barbara
County Board of Supervisors in rela-
tion to the land.
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the
Chumash leadership for their work and
for their persistence on this issue, and
I encourage adoption of this legisla-
tion.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
California (Mr. LAMALFA), the sponsor
of this particular piece of legislation.
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Mr. BISHOP and Mr. VAN DREW for their
work on this effort here tonight.
I am very excited about the support
for this bill, and of course, I rise to-
night in support of H.R. 317, which is
the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indi-
ans Land Affirmation Act.
It has always been a bipartisan effort
to affirm the Department of the Inte-
rior to take land into trust for the ben-
efit of the Chumash Tribe, codifying
agreements reached between the Tribe
and the county of Santa Barbara after
much work.
I am very proud of the good faith, bi-
partisan effort that has gone into this
bill both in Congress and in the local
community.
For the several years I have been in-
volved with this legislation, I have
seen the Chumash Indians and the local
government work together to build
trust and act as good neighbors to
forge an agreement that works for ev-
eryone.
There is nothing controversial about
this bill. It simply ensures the Tribe
has the ability to provide housing for
its members. I can’t think of anyone
who really should take issue with that
effort.
In fact, last Congress, this bill was
passed both out of the Natural Re-
sources Committee and on this House
floor with unanimous consent.
Mr. Speaker, I thank, in the com-
mittee, Chairman GRIJALVA and Rank-
ing Member BISHOP for their hard work
in support of this legislation through
the whole way.
Mr. Speaker, I also thank my col-
league Congressman SALUD CARBAJAL
from the Chumash homeland area who
has been the region’s representative
and an original cosponsor of this bill.
He has played a key role in facilitating
these discussions at the local level, and
I appreciate it.
Located in Santa Barbara, the re-
corded history of the Chumash reaches
back to the earliest arrival of Euro-
peans in California when the Spanish
explorer Cabrillo recorded his encoun-
ters with the Chumash in 1542.
The Chumash have a strong and un-
broken connection to the Camp 4 par-
cel, which is what this is known as,
Camp 4, which is located close to their
current reservation.
Starting in the early 1800s, the
Chumash became wards of the Spanish
mission in Santa Ynez, which included
Camp 4. Later, lands were granted to
them that included Camp 4 as well. A
commission recognized that the Tribe
continued to reside in the Camp 4 area,
though only 99 acres were ultimately
taken into trust at that time.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. VAN DREW
for pointing out that the Chumash face
a significant housing crisis. Fewer than
17 percent of the Chumash members
and lineal descendants are able to re-
side on the Tribe’s existing reserva-
tions, which consists largely of hill-
sides, wetlands, and streambeds unsuit-
able for housing, and areas that they
want to preserve.
To address this shortage, the
Chumash used their own resources to
purchase the Camp 4 parcel, the 1,400
acres, with the intent of construction
of homes on a small part of it.
The Tribe applied to take Camp 4
into trust administratively. After the
formal BIA process, the Department of
the Interior completed the fee-to-trust
process in January 2017.
That same year, the county ratified
an agreement with the Chumash, en-
suring that any impacts of Camp 4
housing on local infrastructure and
other resources would be addressed.
The Department of the Interior ap-
proved this agreement that same day.
In order to enable the Chumash to
address their housing crisis and ensure
any impacts to local governments are
addressed, H.R. 317 affirms and ratifies
the action of the Department of the In-
terior to take the land into trust and
codifies the agreement ratified between
the county and the Tribe addressing
local impacts.
At the request of the Tribe, it also
prohibits the operation of gaming fa-
cilities on this parcel, which is a key
element the people would have been
concerned about, and it protects and
respects the rights-of-way held by local
stakeholders.
The bill represents, again, the cul-
mination of years of good faith nego-
tiations by all parties and should be
considered a model for maintaining
positive working relationships between
Tribal governments and local govern-
ments.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the measure. I thank every-
body who has helped with this in a bi-
partisan effort.
b 1700
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, this entire day we
should have had Yogi Berra come in
here and say it is like deja vu all over
again because, once again, this par-
ticular piece of legislation we saw last
year when it passed out of committee—
sponsored by Mr. LAMALFA then—at
the same time, passed the floor at the
same time, and now we are bringing it
back here to see if we can get it all the
way through to the finish line.
The bill is one that we have talked
about for quite awhile, but it also has,
I think, three significant things it ac-
complishes, why it has to be in bill
form and can’t simply be administra-
tively negotiated in some way.
The first one, obviously, is it nul-
lifies certain restrictions that were im-
posed by the State of California’s con-
servation law. Even if that restriction
to the land title were not a problem, it
also solves the problem that was cre-
ated because the Obama administra-
tion BIA appointees, in their haste try-
ing to approve a fee-to-trust land ac-
quisition, cut some legal corners—they
cut a lot of legal corners—which added
to a lot of appeals and litigation, all of
which cost everyone a whole lot of
money.
The second specific thing it does is
prohibit gaming in this Camp 4 area, as
was said, which is a concern of the
county of Santa Barbara that will obvi-
ously, when this passes, lose a great
deal of jurisdiction over the land in
that area.
And, finally, one thing this bill does,
I think, that is very important is it ref-
erences the memorandum of under-
standing between the Tribe and the
county of Santa Barbara that they ne-
gotiated. This MOU addresses the con-
cerns that they had, puts them in per-
spective, and will actually solve a lot
of problems and efforts that have gone
on in the past.
This is a good bill, used to get people
working together, solving certain situ-
ations and certain problems. And, I
guess, most importantly, the last bill
we passed is going to cost us $11 bil-
lion; this one has no significant costs
associated with it, so Mr. LAMALFA can
maintain his status as a true fiscal
conservative in the bills he brings here
to the floor.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
VAN DREW) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 317, as
amended.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I ob-
ject to the vote on the ground that a
quorum is not present and make the
point of order that a quorum is not
present.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.

SANTA YNEZ BAND OF CHUMASH

pending the rules and passing the bill
(H.R. 317) to reaffirm the action of the
Secretary of the Interior to take land
into trust for the benefit of the Santa
Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indi-
ans, and for other purposes, as amend-

consideration of the bill (H.R. 9) to di-
rect the President to develop a plan for

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,

the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, and ask for its immediate
consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I urge
the Democrat leadership to imme-
diately schedule this very important
bill and to sign the discharge petition
as well.

tleman is not recognized.

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING
RECENT CHABAD OF POWAY
SHOOTING VICTIMS
(Mr. PETERS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, it is with
great sadness that I rise today to speak
of the tragic shooting that took place
at the Chabad of Poway on Saturday.
As the synagogue celebrated the last
day of Passover, a 19-year-old terrorist
walked in and opened fire with an as-
sault rifle.
One woman was killed, and three oth-
ers were badly hurt. Lori Gilbert-Kaye
died while selflessly trying to protect
her rabbi from the gunman. She is re-
called as a faith-filled, generous care-
giver who put others before herself.
Lori died as she lived.
Yesterday I attended an event to
honor local Holocaust survivors. As I
watched these brave men and women
who survived Nazi Germany, I was con-
fronted with the tragic realization that

today in 2019, Jews are still being
threatened by murderous white su-
premacists.
Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of
silence, but we must follow it with ac-
tion. We must act against gun violence
and come together to stop the rising
tide of white supremacy that plagues
our Nation today.
Please join me in a moment of si-
lence.
f
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL
INTERNSHIP AWARENESS MONTH
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, April is National Internship
Awareness Month, and I rise to high-
light the wonderful educational oppor-
tunities internships provide.
They promote experiential learning
that helps people make career choices
amid a wide range of potential profes-
sional tracks. Employers increasingly
prefer to hire people with relevant
work experience, and internships are a
great way to gain this asset.
Congress mirrors this trend and fi-
nancial means should not be a limiting
factor in one’s participation in a con-
gressional internship. That is why I, in
past years, set aside part of my annual
office budget to offer paid internships,
and I am pleased that appropriations
passed into law last year provide fund-
ing for all House offices to do the same.
I encourage more employers to con-
sider offering internships, and I encour-
age people to explore those opportuni-
ties in Congress and all fields to help
them inform their career paths.
f
LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG
PRICES
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Mr.
Speaker, I have spent the last 2 weeks
in my district listening to constituents
and healthcare providers share stories
about how our broken healthcare sys-
tem is hurting south Florida.
One thing is clear: high prescription
drugs prices are hurting families in my
community and across America, which
is why this week in the Judiciary Com-
mittee we are voting on a bipartisan
bill to lower prescription drug prices.
I am all for supporting research and
innovation, but we cannot allow the
pharmaceutical industry to delay and
block more affordable, generic medi-
cines because it may hurt their profits.
Lowering drug prices for all Americans
should be a bipartisan issue, and this is
just one more step in making our coun-
try healthier and helping Americans
keep more of their paycheck.
Let’s help hardworking families get
ahead.
RECOGNIZING TECHNICAL
SERGEANT CAM KELSCH
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Technical
Sergeant Cam Kelsch who is stationed
at Hunter Army Airfield in the First
Congressional District of Georgia. He
recently received the Silver Star Medal
on April 9 at the Mighty Eighth Air
Force Museum.
The third highest medal for gallantry
in the Nation, Sergeant Kelsch re-
ceived the award for extraordinary acts
of bravery during a nighttime raid in
Afghanistan. Throughout the raid, he
exposed himself to enemy fire multiple
times, once to call in air support, and
another time to eliminate an enemy
machine gun.
He was also struck by enemy fire
while saving the life of a wounded
American as he dragged him to safety
while under fire.
Stories like these from our soldiers
abroad are sober reminders of the dan-
gerous situations they endure to make
our world and our Nation a safer place
to live.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Sergeant
Kelsch for his service, his bravery, and
his sacrifice, and congratulate him on
receiving the Silver Star. He deserves
it.
f
UKRAINIAN ELECTION
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, it is with
great admiration that I rise to recog-
nize Ukraine’s recent historic Presi-
dential elections. On April 21, 2019, the
Ukrainian people made their demo-
cratic values known in an election
international observers lauded as free
and fair.
Such an achievement is a rare and
true testament to the Ukrainian peo-
ple’s resilience and love of liberty, es-
pecially while fending off Russia’s on-
going aggression which has already
killed over 13,000 Ukrainian citizens.
I am grateful to President
Poroshenko for his leadership over the
past 5 years and his dedication to mov-
ing Ukraine forward. The United
States Congress congratulates Presi-
dent-elect Zelenskiy and extends a
hand of friendship on behalf of the
American people.
The President-elect faces many chal-
lenges, including delivering on the
Ukrainian people’s expectations to
counter corruption.
The free world must now step up our
efforts to provide moral and material
aid to support Ukraine’s continued
democratic trajectory. Onward
Ukraine. Onward free Ukraine.
CONSORTIUM TO COMBAT
SUBSTANCE ABUSE
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, this morning I was at
Penn State University, a great land
grant university, for the inaugural con-
ference of the Consortium to Combat
Substance Abuse. Penn State has
brought together a diverse group of
stakeholders to address the largest
public health crisis of our lifetime: the
opioid and substance abuse epidemic.
This group will draw on the expertise
of researchers, educators, and practi-
tioners from Penn State campuses
across the Commonwealth to develop
and implement effective programs,
policies, and practices aimed at pre-
venting and treating addiction and its
spillover effects on children, families,
and our communities.
Pennsylvania has been hit hard by
the opioid epidemic, especially our
rural communities, though no house-
hold is immune.
On Saturday, Americans had the op-
portunity to protect their communities
and prevent the spread of addiction by
safely disposing of expired, unwanted,
and unused prescription drugs, thanks
to the Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion’s 17th Annual National Prescrip-
tion Drug Take Back Day.
It is encouraging to see communities
working together to slow the spread of
the opioid epidemic. It is my hope that
through increased awareness and ac-
tion at all levels we can eradicate it
once and for all.

OPPOSING TRANSFORMATION
PLAN OF THE CORPORATION FOR
NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY
SERVICE
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
in strong opposition to the decision by
the Corporation for National and Com-
munity Service, or CNCS, to close all
State and territorial offices and re-
place them with eight regional offices.
If this plan is implemented, just by
way of example, the office in my home
State of Rhode Island will close. If this
happens, we will lose the local experts
who understand the histories and cul-
tures of the communities they serve,
and with them, the years-long relation-
ships that they have built up in our
communities.
The closures will particularly harm
smaller organizations that rely on
CNCS, like New Urban Arts, the Rhode
Island Free Clinic, Federal Hill House,
and Riverzedge Arts.
That is why I have joined my col-
leagues in sending a letter to CEO Bar-
bara Stewart opposing the plan, and
why I am cosponsoring Representative

COMMENDING THE TOXIC 18
GROUP
(Mr. MAST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize a great group who has
been documenting something tragic
going on in our community, the Toxic
18 group on the Treasure Coast of Flor-
ida.
The administrators and the members
of Toxic 18 have dedicated countless
volunteer hours to taking pictures, vid-
eos, and looking at the destruction
which has included dead animals, sick-
ness, destroyed environment, and busi-
nesses being forced to close across the
Treasure Coast, all as a result of the
harmful algal blooms going on in our
area.
Their administrators, people who I
have had the chance to get to know,
like Cyndi Lenz, Jennie Pawlowsky,
Cristina Maldonado, Kim Streiber, and
Troy Brown have done an outstanding
job, and because of their work, I am
very optimistic for a great 2019 and fu-
ture beyond that because of the work
they have already done in 2018 and be-
fore.

VIOLENCE IN AMERICAN
CHURCHES
(Mr. LEWIS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1

Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ex-
press a sense of righteous indignation
about the violence peaceful people of
faith must now concern themselves
with in places of worship all over
America.
We have come to the point in this
Nation where we can no longer attend
church or go to the synagogue or the
mosque without fearing the worst. How
many lives must we lose before we de-
cide there is not any room in America
for hate?
Martin Luther King, Jr., once said:
‘‘Hate is too heavy a burden to bear.’’
We must bring an end to wanton gun
violence before it robs this Nation of
its very soul.
The people in my district pray with-
out ceasing for the victims of the
Poway shooting.
As leaders of this Nation, let’s com-
mit ourselves today to bring this vio-
lence to an end here and now.
CONGRATULATING RUDY DORY
(Mr. WALDEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and congratulate
Rudy Dory who is a great Oregonian
and this year’s recipient of the Na-
tional Grocers Association’s Clarence
G. Adamy Great American Award.
Established in 1982, this award is pre-
sented to an individual or a company
whose leadership in the food industry
best exemplifies active and effective
participation in government relations
as a citizen and industry representa-
tive.
Rudy Dory is the executive chairman
of Newport Avenue Market, which is an
employee-owned, independent grocery
store in Bend, Oregon, in my district,
and I had the pleasure to get a full tour
from Rudy of Newport Avenue Market
in Bend just last August.
He has been in the grocery industry
for 40 years. He has helped Newport Av-
enue Market through its migration
from a traditional store to the award-
winning, employee-owned, specialty
grocery store it is today.
Rudy is a tireless advocate of the
independent supermarket industry and
advocates in support of a public policy
agenda that benefits Main Street gro-
cers throughout the Nation.
Local grocers like Rudy help job
growth, support Oregon’s producers,
and help feed our communities.
So please join me in congratulating
Rudy Dory on receiving this pres-
tigious award, and working on behalf of
not only Newport Avenue Market, but
for all businesses and independent gro-
cers across the country.

RECOGNIZING THE SOUTH MEDIA
FIRE COMPANY
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, in Penn-
sylvania, volunteer fire departments
have long played a central role in the
life of our towns and boroughs. In re-
cent years, changing demographics and
funding issues have seriously impacted
the volunteer fire company tradition.
However, it has also had one benefit of
spurring recruitment of first respond-
ers from nontraditional quarters.
I want to take a minute to acknowl-
edge the history made by two volun-
teers at the South Media Fire Company
just last week. When an emergency call
from a local middle school came in at
7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, Ellen
Yarborough, a schoolteacher, and Dora
Giannakarios Preston, a local business
woman, put their day jobs on hold to
answer the call, unaware that they
were making history. This was the first
time in the 100-year history of the fire-
house that an all-female crew had han-
dled an emergency call.
To Ellen, Dora, the South Media Fire
Company, and all of our volunteer fire-
fighters, thank you for your service
and for answering the call of duty to
keep us safe.

GA–12 NATIONAL SCIENCE BOWL
PARTICIPANTS
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given

Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, over this
past weekend the 2019 National Science
Bowl finals took place down the road in
Chevy Chase, Maryland.
I am proud to rise here this evening
to congratulate Stallings Island Middle
School and Lakeside High School—
both located in Georgia’s 12th dis-
trict—for their students’ stellar per-
formance in this year’s competition.
The path to the finals is no easy
task. With over 1,000 high schools and
nearly 650 middle schools participating
in the regional tournaments nation-
wide, these Georgia-12 students worked
hard to advance to the finals and com-
pete at the national level. The stu-
dents’ brilliance solving technical
problems and answering questions
about all branches of science and math
is truly incredible.
I would like to thank and congratu-
late the educators, coaches, and espe-
cially the bright young students of
Stallings Island Middle School and
Lakeside High School who made this
tremendous run possible.
Georgia-12 is certainly proud, and we
look forward to cheering them on again
next year.

EXPANDING SOCIAL SECURITY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. LARSON) is recognized for
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader.
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr.
Speaker, let me first, before we begin,
given the tragedy that, once again, has
visited our country over the weekend,
pause and acknowledge—with Rabbi
Lazowski from Connecticut in Wash-
ington, D.C., this evening and his son,
Alan Lazowski, joining him at a Holo-
caust museum dedication, and after lis-
tening to the eloquence of SCOTT
PETERS and our own JOHN LEWIS—how
indeed saddened we are by these
events.
As Mr. LEWIS said, we remain focused
on ending and focusing on hoping and
praying that these horrific events will
stop, but I assure you they will not
stop without action on behalf of the
United States Congress.
Mr. Speaker, we are honored to rise
this evening and discuss Social Secu-
rity 2100. We are honored to be joined
by the deputy chair of the committee,
BILL PASCRELL from Paterson, New
Jersey. We want to make sure that
citizens all across this country under-
stand the number of hearings that are
going on in districts all across the
country and here in the Nation’s Cap-
itol, because it is long overdue that we
address the issue of not just protecting
Social Security, but enhancing it.
Mr. Speaker, in fact, the last time
that the United States Congress sig-
nificantly addressed the issue of Social
Security was in 1983. Tip O’Neill was
then Speaker of the House, and Ronald
Reagan was President. It does dem-
onstrate that Democrats and Repub-
licans can work together in the best in-
terests of the country, and there is no
bill currently before the body that does
that in a better way than Social Secu-
rity 2100.
I say that because it is the only bill
that has an actuarial report that
verifies that it does everything that it
says it will do: keep Social Security
solvent, sustainably solvent beyond the
75-year requirement by law. But also,
not just make it sustainably solvent,
but enhance the program so that peo-
ple all across this country can benefit
from the Nation’s leading insurance
program.
Now, the point we always try to
make and get across is something that
is intuitively obvious to American citi-
zens, but not often explained graphi-
cally, and that is this: that Social Se-
curity is not an entitlement. Mr.
Speaker, you hear people speak of So-
cial Security and say: we need entitle-
ment reform.
Certainly, you are entitled to Social
Security because you paid for it. This
is what every American citizen under-
stands from the first time they get a
paycheck and they look at its stub, and
it says: FICA. FICA stands for Federal
Insurance Contribution.
Whose contribution?
Yours.
American citizens throughout their
work life contribute into the program.
They do so knowing that since 1940
they have been able to get a check in
return for either their retirement or
because of a disability or spousal or de-
pendent coverage. That is why it is the
most effective and unique govern-
mental program paid for by American
citizens through their FICA premiums
that are taken from their paycheck
weekly, biweekly, or monthly.
But what every American knows is
that this is the insurance you have
paid for, not an entitlement program
that the government somehow just
grants you.
So we come to Congress in this ses-
sion, as we have in the past, proposing
a bill, but one that we have already
had four public hearings on. In those
hearings, we have discussed why, in
fact, it is necessary for us not to just
protect and preserve Social Security,
make sure that it is sustainably sol-
vent for 75 years, but, in fact, enhance
it, starting with the fact that the last
time we strengthened the program was
in 1983.
So to say that we are overdue is an
understatement. We are overdue at a
time when baby boomers are retiring
at a record rate. In fact, Mr. Speaker,
10,000 baby boomers a day become eligi-
ble for Social Security. That, in and of
itself, should require an actuarial ad-
justment, one that should have been
indexed into the law in 1983 but was
not.
So now it is incumbent upon the Con-
gress. Citizens can’t do this on their
own. They make their premium pay-
ments every week, biweekly, or month-
ly, but it is up to Congress to make
sure the program is actuarially sound.
So we proposed a bill that is not only
actuarially sound beyond 75 years, but
also one that is enhanced to make up
for the lack of indexing and make sure
that people now in their retirement
can have a rational increase in their
Social Security.
Nobody is getting wealthy on Social
Security. Nobody is hoarding their So-
cial Security money. They spend it
weekly, biweekly, and monthly in their
respective communities. It is an eco-
nomic boost to every community and
essential for the survival of many of
our citizens.
We have opted to make sure that we
enhance Social Security in the fol-
lowing four ways: number one, there is
a modest, 2 percent across-the-board
increase for everyone who is receiving
Social Security and who will receive
Social Security in the future.
Number two, we make sure that the
new level of Social Security payments
is now changed so that as long as you
have paid in your quarters, you have
put in your time, and paid your Social
Security benefits, the new floor for So-
cial Security will be 125 percent of
what the Federal Government deter-
mines the poverty rate is at that time,
therefore lifting so many people, espe-
cially women, and more directly espe-
cially women of color, in this country
who have been the caregivers of our
children and family members whether
through birth or through sickness, and
therefore have not been in the work-
force as long as their male counter-
parts. We also know that while they
were in the workforce, they were mak-
ing 70 cents for every dollar their male
counterpart was. So to raise people out
of poverty so they can make their pay-
ments to maintain a lifestyle or qual-
ity of life that is just above the pov-
erty level is the right thing to do.
The third thing we do is something
that the AARP has long advocated, and
that is to make sure that we have a
COLA that actually reflects the cost
that people incur when they are in re-
tirement.
What are those costs?
Those costs happen to be utility
bills—heating and cooling your home—
the doctor visits, the prescription
drugs, the nutrition, and the physical
therapy. Those are the essential—along
with food—elements that you need to
exist. It ought to be factored into how
COLAs are given. Currently a COLA is
just given based on the consumer price
index and an average which incor-
porates a multitude of expenses, and,
frankly, oftentimes, as every senior in
America will attest, they have gone
without COLA payments at a time
when the disparity of wealth is getting
greater in this country of ours. So a
COLA payment makes sense and is
geared towards your actual expenses,
something that we call CPI–E, E stand-
ing for the elderly and the expenses
that they incur.
b 1945
Lastly, we also do a fourth thing. We
provide a tax break to seniors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3299
April 29, 2019
Again, in 1983, they determined that
if you were single and making more
than $24,000 a year, your Social Secu-
rity was taxed; if you were a married
couple and making more than $32,000 a
year, your Social Security was taxed.
Today, that has certainly not kept
pace and is way out of line with what
should happen. So in our bill, Social
Security 2100, we move that to $50,000
per individual and $100,000 per couple.
12.5 million Americans will get a tax
cut immediately, something that I
know they will be able to use.
Why do people remain working when
they are retired? Number one, because
many of them have to. Number two, be-
cause many of them find it more pur-
poseful in their lives to stay gainfully
employed and involved and committed
in their communities, and they do.
This, again, is another reasonable
measure: an increase across the board
of 2 percent, make sure that 125 per-
cent of poverty is the new floor for So-
cial Security, have a COLA that is
based on actual expenses, and provide a
tax break for those who are currently
working or will continue to work after
retirement age.
We already have growth in the age
group. Just this past year, 66 has now
become the age at which you can be-
come eligible for Social Security. You
can get it if you are at 62, if you can
make that case, but you will receive
far less money.
The beauty of Social Security is that
it also has built-in incentives for peo-
ple, depending on their circumstances.
If they can wait longer, there is more
money that they will receive.
An example: If a person who opted to
take money at 62 waited until they
were age 70, they could almost double
what they would receive, in terms of a
Social Security payment for their re-
tirement.
That is the kind of incentive that we
should have for people, knowing that,
if they can, through education, under-
stand what this would be. They should
contact the Social Security office and
make sure that they find out what
their payments are and what is in their
best interests.
Everybody’s case, as we know, is not
the same. It is different depending
upon your health and lifestyle cir-
cumstances; what you had for a job and
the kind of job and its impact on you
physically, mentally, and emotionally;
and where you are, at whatever state in
time, so that you need this.
That is what we are also pleased
about, that we are presenting an oppor-
tunity for people to get Social Security
in a manner in which it will be en-
hanced in these four ways and that it is
sustainably solvent.
How do we get there to do this, espe-
cially without burdening any future
generation? We do it the same way
that Franklin Delano Roosevelt
thought it should be done, and Dwight
David Eisenhower when he expanded
the program thought it should be done,
and Lyndon Baines Johnson when he
expanded the program, and lastly,
when Ronald Reagan agreed to improve
and expand the program.
We do it by way of introducing legis-
lation and then by doing the time-hon-
ored thing of increasing the contribu-
tion. This is an insurance payment—an
insurance payment. Americans, in poll
after poll after poll, are saying: My
God, we are willing to pay more so that
we can reap the benefit. Why doesn’t
Congress make it actuarially sound so
that we are able to do this?
By increasing the payment by 1.2 per-
cent but then phasing that in over 25
years, we are able to come up with an
incremental adjustment that takes the
place of what should have happened in
1983, which would have been the grad-
ual indexing in payment of the pro-
gram.
This way, we make the program ac-
tuarially sound. We make sure that it
is sustainably solvent and that people
can have the benefits that they need.
How do we know this? How does any
senior? How can anyone rely on it?
They can because we have the cor-
responding actuarial report that goes
through every line of the bill and cer-
tifies how it is paid for and that it is
sustainably solvent beyond 75 years.
We also scrap the cap on people mak-
ing over $400,000. Usually, when I am at
a senior hall, I will ask somebody to
raise their hand if they are making
over $400,000. It might surprise some of
our viewers that not many hands go up
in the room. So far, I have yet to see a
hand go up in any senior center that I
have been in.
Nonetheless, it represents about six-
tenths of the American people. We lift
the cap on it, and all that means is
that they will pay what a guy making
$50,000 a year is paying.
When we first introduced this bill on
Social Security, the cap on Social Se-
curity was $112,000. It is now $132,900. It
will grow every year. But we lift the
cap on people over $400,000 because
baby boomers will peak around 2022.
This helps us ease them into that proc-
ess actuarially.
We have two things that are going on
that help us both enhance the program
and make sure that it is sustainably
solvent.
Another way to explain this—and I
often do this by holding up a very pop-
ular brand of coffee and saying to sen-
iors: How much does this Starbucks
cost? Typically, they will know the an-
swer immediately. They will ask if it is
a latte. I will say, yes, it is. They will
say $4.50.
That is right. Or, if you are making
$50,000 a year, that is 9 weeks of Social
Security payments. Or, if you were
those fortunate people at $400,000 a
year, it would still cost you more
weekly to buy this latte than it will to
fix Social Security.
Can we do this, America? You bet we
can, in the same traditional, time-hon-
ored way that we have done it in the
past.
This is not an entitlement. This is in-
surance that needs to be paid for. You
have contributed to it all your life. For
a small enhancement, for a small con-
tribution—if you are making $25,000 a
year, it costs you 25 cents; if you are
making $100,000 a year, it costs you a
buck a week to make sure that Social
Security is there for all American citi-
zens.
Let me say this, too, because I know
our viewers know, and especially the
man from Paterson knows this, that it
is not just a retirement plan, though
we focus on this. It is also spousal and
dependent coverage, disability cov-
erage. In fact, one in five recipients of
Social Security is not in retirement
currently.
That is why we have the support of so
many organizations, from Social Secu-
rity Works to the National Committee
to Preserve Social Security, the AFL–
CIO, the Paralyzed Veterans of Amer-
ica, who have been before the com-
mittee to testify.
If you heard them speak, there is not
an American anywhere in this country
who wouldn’t stand up and salute and
say: This is what we need to do. This is
what we must do for all our citizens
but especially those who have gone
above and beyond in terms of the sac-
rifice that they have provided for this
country.
We are proud of all the sponsors that
this has attracted, but it doesn’t hap-
pen without the day-to-day work, with-
out the testimony, without the hear-
ings. There is nobody who has worked
harder at this than the Congressman
from Paterson, New Jersey; the deputy
chair of the Subcommittee on Social
Security; the former mayor of
Paterson; a voice for America; my dear
friend and colleague, BILL PASCRELL.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL).
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, if
nominated, I will not run.
This is an interesting subject, not
only for the elderly like myself, but for
young people who need to know about
Social Security.
Many times, younger folks, like my-
self when I was younger, I didn’t talk
about Social Security too much. I
didn’t concern myself with what was
going to happen when I was 65 years of
age—or now 66, as the chairman point-
ed out.
But this is going to happen. I hate to
tell you: You are going to get older.
Mr. Speaker, you are going to get
older. You are going to be 66, and then
you are going to be 67, et cetera. Then
you are going to have to address
whether or not there is enough money
in this insurance plan for you.
The chairman needs all the credit in
the world because we are living in a
time when people do not want to ad-
dress the problems that every Amer-
ican is going to face. It doesn’t matter
whether you are this party or that
party. You are going to be affected by
it.
Many people treat Social Security

healthy. Why in God’s name do I need
to be covered by insurance?
Does that sound familiar? We have a
big debate going on as to whether we
should mandate the Affordable Care
Act. All boats have to rise, or they will
all fall.
Secondly, let’s put this into a time-
frame, as Chairman LARSON alluded to.
Let’s put it in a timeframe.
I compare it to, if I may, an analogy
of apples and oranges. Allow me that,
please. Give me license to do that.
I compare this to climate change. We
started to talk about climate change
on this floor—I wasn’t here—25 years
ago. We have been talking each issue to
death, like we do a lot of problems, and
we don’t do anything.
Two new books just came out in the
last week about climate change, more
scientific evidence to prove, to support
the idea that we are running out of
time.
Our shorelines are moving. They are
moving inland, not moving out, and
this can lead to tremendous devasta-
tion.
We know many of these things hap-
pen in nature. I have heard that before.
But many things are pushed by human
behavior, and matters become worse.
b 2000
And the same thing with Social Secu-
rity. Presidents in the past, regardless
of which party they belonged to, were
always willing to make adjustments so
that people had those benefits in this
insurance program—not an entitle-
ment, not an entitlement—so that
there was always adjustments to take
care of things.
We have approached that time. We
are into that time, and we have got
about 12 to 14 years to make up our
mind what direction we are going to go
in. And I suggest that this piece of leg-
islation, which Mr. LARSON has spon-
sored and I am proudly part of it, this
legislation is actuarially acceptable.
We know what is going to happen 30
years, 40 years from now.
If we do this legislation, we reduce
the anxiety that is involved. And even
though you are younger, Social Secu-
rity affects you because you are paying
into it. You don’t even know some-
times that you are paying into it, but
you are paying into it. You are paying
into a social insurance program.
So what is going to happen if we do
not address environmental issues is we
will be choked to death, literally. That
is not hyperbole; that is science. Sorry
about that.
We will cut off food supplies. Some
areas of the world are already being af-
fected by that. And again, we will move
our shorelines.
So, seniors, we need to educate
younger people. They need to under-
stand that Social Security takes care
of the disabled for young and old.
Younger Americans should be con-
cerned and involved with this shrink-
ing reserve in our insurance plan which
we have paid into.
So, for too long, I think, in my esti-
mation, the Congress has been silent in
the face of this crisis. We are paralyzed
on many of the issues. We don’t want
to act to make things better. We would
rather they get worse, and maybe the
heavens will open and they won’t get
worse anymore. I wouldn’t count on
that. Today we stand up to say the
time for action is now. Seniors, fami-
lies, future generations depend on it.
I talk with people in my district, the
Ninth District of New Jersey, every
day, even when I am down here, fami-
lies that are dependent upon their So-
cial Security check as their only
means of income, and we are thinking
in our heads that maybe we should cut
benefits in order to make it better?
That will make it worse. That will
make it worse. Serious stuff.
So many people depend on Social Se-
curity. Think about it. You are 25
years old. Are you thinking about what
is going to happen to you when you are
67 years of age and you are living—be-
cause you haven’t saved enough, or you
couldn’t save enough, because most
people don’t have too much to spend
day in, day out. We have seen those
numbers over the past 3 months. Are
you thinking about what is going to
happen to you if you have to live on a
Social Security check for which the
benefits have been cut?
And we raised the age of being eligi-
ble for Social Security so we could fit
and stretch the reserve a little longer.
Raising the age is not solving the prob-
lem of when someone is eligible. People
retire earlier in this day and age.
We must have courage to act in the
face of challenges. Social Security is
this insurance program which we want
to protect and expand and help senior
citizens and younger people and the
disabled.
Those who pay into that reserve de-
serve to know they will be taken care
of in their older years, that hard work,
paying your dues still means some-
thing in the United States of America.
Congress must take up this Social Se-
curity 2100 Act; they must take that up
right now, without delay.
I think, in the Social Security Sub-
committee, there are folks on the other
side of the aisle who want to see a posi-
tive change, but they must have the
courage to cross the line and make a
decision.
The commitment that I made when I
first ran for office in 1996, my first
commitment when I ran against an in-
cumbent in my district was this: Social
Security will be one of my first prior-
ities, my top three priorities in Con-
gress, that I will try everything in my
power to bolster Social Security, and I
will never support diminishing the ben-
efits of the insurance policy that I pay
into and you pay into and everyone
pays into. I think that that is critical.
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the
gentleman. I think that his courage in
speaking out—and I am not blowing
smoke. I mean this. The courage to
speak out on these issues is going to
have long-standing effects down the
line, because when you are 25, you are
not thinking about this. Let’s be hon-
est. I didn’t. If you talked to me about
Social Security when I was 25, I would
have rather watched paint dry on a
wall. How stupid that was.
You are going to get older, God will-
ing, and you want something back
from what you paid into. I mean, is
that radical? I don’t think that is a
radical idea.
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman’s resolve
in this matter—because the chairman
has gone all over the country to talk
about this legislation. He is serious
about it. This is not a photo op. This is
not a speech. This is something that
needs to be digested, and then you act
upon it.
You ask your Congressman: ‘‘What
are you doing about Social Security?’’
Call him up and ask him: ‘‘What are
you doing about Social Security?’’
Oh, the Congressman may answer:
‘‘Well, you are not one of those who is
going to lose sight of the fact that
these are all things that are going to
get solved sooner or later.’’
‘‘Yeah, but isn’t the time shrinking?’’
‘‘Yes, the time is shrinking, but I am
learning more about it.’’
‘‘What are you doing?’’
Silence is golden. Silence makes no
mistakes.
We need to do something about this
now, Mr. Speaker. I commit to the gen-
tleman: You can count on me. This is a
sound program.
And, by the way, the COLA doesn’t
include some of the expenses that sen-
iors go through, which makes it incred-
ible.
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
New Jersey for his continued leader-
ship.
I want to underscore a couple of
things that he said, and especially
reaching out to our colleagues on the
other side of the aisle.
It is not often that I think you see us
come to the floor and talk about fol-
lowing President Trump, but I believe
they should follow their President in
this instance, because he had both the
audacity and the temerity to argue in
front of 16 other Republicans when he
was campaigning for President and
they attempted to corner him and com-
mit that Social Security was an enti-
tlement. He said, no, it is an earned
benefit; it needs to be protected. To his
credit, he had written before about it
in a book as well, and so he is on the
record.
We will pass a bill in the House of
Representatives, there is no question,
with more than 206 original cosponsors
on the bill, but what we need to happen
here, I think, is for people to come to-
gether in a way that they did in 1983
and present the American people.
Now, some would say, well, geez, that
is impossible to do. The House is Demo-
cratic, the President is Republican, and
the Senate is Republican.
In 1983, the House was Democratic
and Tip O’Neill was the Speaker; Ron-
ald Reagan was the President; Howard

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3301
April 29, 2019
Baker was the Senate majority leader,
a Republican.
So what happened then and what
needs to happen now is for the Amer-
ican public to make sure that they are
contacting their Representative, their
Senator, the President and saying this
can be done.
I am confident that NANCY PELOSI
and Donald Trump could do what Tip
O’Neill and Ronald Reagan did in 1983,
except this time it would be enhanced
and indexed and help so many people.
Here are the facts:
Almost 63 million people are receiv-
ing Social Security benefits, of which
55 percent are women and 45 percent
are men;
For almost two-thirds of those bene-
ficiaries, Social Security provides a
majority of their income—a majority
of their income for two-thirds of Amer-
ican people—and for almost one-third,
it provides 90 percent or more of their
income;
The average annual Social Security
benefit for a woman is $14,000—nobody
is getting wealthy on these programs
that they have paid for—compared
with $18,000 for men;
Without these very modest benefits,
nearly half of women 65 years or older
living without a spouse would live in
poverty;
Nearly 20 percent of Hispanic women
65 years and older live under this cur-
rent program in poverty, and without
Social Security increases, this would
rise to 50 percent for Hispanic women
over 65 years old;
Today, nearly 18 percent of African
Americans live in poverty on Social
Security.
So the Nation’s preeminent insur-
ance program, as sound and as solid as
it is and will be, the latest Social Secu-
rity Trustees report says that in just 15
years, if we do nothing—which, shame-
lessly, has been the role that Congress
has played, it has done nothing—if we
do nothing, there will be a 21 percent
across-the-board cut in order for people
to continue to receive their checks.
We can do this, America. This is
within our grasp. You have a President
who is like-minded, a Speaker of the
House who would be very enthusiastic
about making sure that we are taking
care of all Americans with this uni-
versal insurance plan that provides re-
tirement funding, dependent and spous-
al coverage in time of death.
Three of the members on the Ways
and Means Committee and two on the
Subcommittee on Social Security were
raised by a single parent, having lost a
father prematurely.
It is incredible to me that we don’t
just come together and recognize, as a
nation—noting that the President has
recognized this; clearly, the Speaker
has; and I am sure that even MITCH
MCCONNELL would recognize this as
well—that we need to come together.
What Americans dislike most about
Congress is they don’t see us solving
problems. They see us straining on the
fringes, both making our points but
not coming together to solve a problem
that works to their benefit.
That is why we are elected: to govern
and to govern on behalf of the people
who sent us here. We think that this is
a good step in the right direction.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague
for joining me here this evening. I hope
that those who have heard us here this
evening will call their elected Rep-
resentative and their United States
Senators to talk to them about coming
together to solve the problem for So-
cial Security and pass Social Security
2100.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF PAYGO
LEGISLATION
Pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-

MUTH hereby submits, prior to the vote
on passage, for printing in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD, that H.R. 1222, the
Target Practice and Marksmanship
Training Support Act, would have no
significant effect on direct spending or
revenues, and therefore, the budgetary
effects of such bill are estimated as
zero.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Sacred Father, open the hearts of our
lawmakers to the joy and beauty of
Your providence. Provide them with a
greater appreciation of Your favor, wis-
dom, and grace. Remind them of Your
plans to keep them from stumbling and
present them before Your glory with
great joy. In their weakness, impart
Your strength. In their fatigue, give
them renewal. Empower them with a
moral and spiritual stamina to walk in
the paths of integrity and courage.
And, Lord, as houses of worship face
the reality of criminal violence, sus-
tain and keep all who labor to bring
Your peace on Earth and good will to
humanity.
We pray in Your sovereign Name.
Amen.

DIRECTING THE REMOVAL OF
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES
FROM HOSTILITIES IN THE RE-
PUBLIC OF YEMEN THAT HAVE
NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED BY CON-
GRESS—VETO
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for
the leader, is there a message at the
desk in reference to S.J. Res. 7?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Chair lays before the Senate a commu-
nication of the Secretary of the Senate
regarding that matter.
The legislative clerk read as follows:
UNITED STATES SENATE,
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY,
April 29, 2019.
Hon. MICHAEL R. PENCE,
President of the Senate,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: On Wednesday, April
17, 2019, the President of the United States
sent by messenger the attached sealed enve-
lope addressed to the President of the Senate
dated April 17, 2019, said to contain a veto
message on the bill S.J. Res. 7, a Joint Reso-
lution to direct the removal of United States
Armed Forces from hostilities in the Repub-
lic of Yemen that have not been authorized
by Congress. The Senate not being in session
on the last day which the President had for
the return of this bill under the provisions of
the Constitution of the United States, in
order to protect the interests of the Senate
so that it might have the opportunity to re-
consider the bill, I accepted the message at
10:20 a.m., and I now present to you the
President’s veto message, with the accom-
panying papers, for disposition by the Sen-
ate.
Respectfully,
JULIE E. ADAMS,
Secretary of the Senate.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for
the leader, is the veto message with
the papers attached at the desk?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.
Mr. GRASSLEY. For the leader, I
ask unanimous consent that the veto
message on S.J. Res. 7 be considered as
having been read and that it be printed
in the RECORD and spread in full upon
the Journal.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
The veto message is ordered to be
printed in the RECORD as follows:
To the Senate of the United States:
I am returning herewith without my
approval S.J. Res. 7, a joint resolution
that purports to direct the President to
remove United States Armed Forces
from hostilities in or affecting the Re-
public of Yemen, with certain excep-
tions. This resolution is an unneces-
sary, dangerous attempt to weaken my
constitutional authorities, endangering
the lives of American citizens and
brave service members, both today and
in the future.
This joint resolution is unnecessary
because, apart from counterterrorism
operations against al-Qa’ida in the
Arabian Peninsula and ISIS, the
United States is not engaged in hos-
tilities in or affecting Yemen. For ex-
ample, there are no United States mili-
tary personnel in Yemen commanding,
participating in, or accompanying
military forces of the Saudi-led coali-
tion against the Houthis in hostilities
in or affecting Yemen.
Since 2015, the United States has pro-
vided limited support to member coun-
tries of the Saudi-led coalition, includ-
ing intelligence sharing, logistics sup-
port, and, until recently, in-flight re-
fueling of non-United States aircraft.
All of this support is consistent with
applicable Arms Export Control Act
authorities, statutory authorities that
permit the Department of Defense to
provide logistics support to foreign
countries, and the President’s constitu-
tional power as Commander in Chief.
None of this support has introduced
United States military personnel into
hostilities.
We are providing this support for
many reasons. First and foremost, it is
our duty to protect the safety of the
more than 80,000 Americans who reside
in certain coalition countries that have
been subject to Houthi attacks from
Yemen. Houthis, supported by Iran,
have used missiles, armed drones, and
explosive boats to attack civilian and
military targets in those coalition
countries, including areas frequented
by American citizens, such as the air-
port in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In addi-
tion, the conflict in Yemen represents
a ‘‘cheap’’ and inexpensive way for Iran
to cause trouble for the United States
and for our ally, Saudi Arabia.

certain tactical operations, such as in-
flight refueling, or require military en-
gagements to adhere to arbitrary
timelines. Doing so would interfere
with the President’s constitutional au-
thority as Commander in Chief of the
Armed Forces, and could endanger our
service members by impairing their
ability to efficiently and effectively
conduct military engagements and to
withdraw in an orderly manner at the
appropriate time.
The joint resolution would also harm
the foreign policy of the United States.
Its efforts to curtail certain forms of
military support would harm our bilat-
eral relationships, negatively affect
our ongoing efforts to prevent civilian
casualties and prevent the spread of
terrorist organizations such as al-
Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula and
ISIS, and embolden Iran’s malign ac-
tivities in Yemen.
We cannot end the conflict in Yemen
through political documents like S.J.
Res. 7. Peace in Yemen requires a nego-
tiated settlement. Unfortunately, inac-
tion by the Senate has left vacant key
diplomatic positions, impeding our
ability to engage regional partners in
support of the United Nations-led peace
process. To help end the conflict, pro-
mote humanitarian and commercial
access, prevent civilian casualties, en-
hance efforts to recover American hos-
tages in Yemen, and defeat terrorists
that seek to harm the United States,
the Senate must act to confirm my
nominees for many critical foreign pol-
icy positions.
I agree with the Congress about the
need to address our engagements in
foreign wars. As I said in my State of
the Union address in February, great
nations do not fight endless wars. My
Administration is currently accel-
erating negotiations to end our mili-
tary engagement in Afghanistan and
drawing down troops in Syria, where
we recently succeeded in eliminating
100 percent of the ISIS caliphate. Con-
gressional engagement in those en-
deavors would be far more productive
than expending time and effort trying
to enact this unnecessary and dan-
gerous resolution that interferes with
our foreign policy with respect to
Yemen.
For these reasons, it is my duty to
return S.J. Res. 7 to the Senate with-
out my approval.

THE WHITE HOUSE, April 16, 2019.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
ELECTING SENATE CHAPLAINS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for 1
minute, I will speak to a piece of his-
tory of the Senate.
I call to the Senate’s attention this
fact: When the Senate first convened in
1789 at Federal Hall in New York City,
one of the Senate’s first orders of busi-
ness was to appoint a committee to
recommend a candidate for Chaplain.
On April 25, 1789, the Senate elected
the Right Reverend Samuel Provost,
Episcopal bishop of New York, as its
first Chaplain.
That means 230 years ago this week,
the Senate elected its first Chaplain,
and since then the Senate has had 62
people serve in the position as Chaplain
of the Senate.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, addi-
tionally for 1 minute, I would like to
speak to the issue of healthcare. Some
elected officials are proposing radical
changes to our healthcare system.
These proposals include Medicare for
All, Medicare buy-in, Medicaid for All,
and expansion of the Affordable
Healthcare Act. All of these are
versions of completely government-run
healthcare.
Americans don’t support a govern-
ment-run healthcare system when they
are told about the tradeoffs. Medicare
for All would eliminate private health
insurance companies. Medicare for All
would require middle-class Americans
to pay much more in taxes. Medicare
for All would threaten the benefits
that current Medicare beneficiaries re-
ceive, and those people who have paid
into the system for a lifetime should
not have Medicare, which has been part
of the social fabric of America, put in
jeopardy by loading more people into
it.
Government-run healthcare is a slo-
gan, not an answer.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
want to call my colleagues’ attention
to an issue that has affected many fam-
ilies in Iowa and throughout the coun-
try, and that issue is the cost of pre-
scription drugs. The cost of prescrip-
tion drugs is an issue that comes up at
almost every Q and A I hold with
Iowans at my annual 99-county meet-
ings. During the last Easter break,
which was just completed, I did 20 of
those 99 counties.
In the last 2 months, I started a bi-
partisan investigation with my col-
league, Ranking Member WYDEN of the
Finance Committee, into the pricing of
insulin. That investigation extends to
insulin manufacturers and pharmacy
benefit managers. We need to find out
how manufacturers price their insulin
products, and we need to find out if
pharmacy benefit managers are negoti-
ating the lowest drug price possible
from manufacturers on behalf of insur-
ance plans.
This isn’t my first drug pricing inves-
tigation. In recent years, I have inves-
tigated Gilead’s pricing of hepatitis C
drugs. The names of those drugs are
Sovaldi and Harvoni. I have been inves-
tigating Mylan’s EpiPen price increase.
Let me tell you, oversight by Con-
gress in doing our constitutional job
does accomplish things. I have said it
before and I will say it again because
you can’t say it too often: Congress has
a constitutional responsibility to en-
gage in robust and aggressive oversight
of the Federal Government and its pro-
grams.
My EpiPen investigation is a perfect
example. Several years ago, I began to
receive letters, phone calls, and emails
from my constituents about the rap-
idly increasing, high price of the
EpiPen. In 2007, a pack of two EpiPens
cost $100. By 2016, it had skyrocketed
to over $600. Of course, anybody paying
it or even anybody hearing about it
knows that to be a substantial price in-
crease. I wanted to find out what was
happening and what could be done to
fix this problem of dramatically in-
creasing prices and maybe unwarranted
prices.
My investigative and policy focus
soon turned to the Medicaid Drug Re-
bate Program administered by the Cen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is
a contributing factor that has played a
part in how much money the govern-
ment and the taxpayers pay for some
drugs, and, as you will find out, the
waste of some taxpayers’ money.
Now, as a condition for participating
in the program, drug companies have
to pay a rebate to the Federal Govern-
ment and the States for the drugs they
offer. Generally speaking, the rebate
dollar amount is contingent on wheth-
er the drug is considered a brand name
drug or generic drug. A brand name
drug pays a rebate of the greater of 23.1
percent of the average manufacturer
price or the difference between that
and the drug’s best price.
In the rebate program, the dollar
amount is raised if the average manu-
facturer price has increased faster than
the rate of inflation. A generic drug’s
rebate is 13 percent of the average
manufacturer’s price.
Unfortunately, the rebate program
has not worked as it was designed to
work. Drug companies have been able
to game the system by paying smaller
rebates than they are supposed to, and,
of course, the taxpayer foots the bill.
EpiPen is a perfect example of this
gaming of the system. This is how the
scheme works. Mylan classified the
EpiPen as a generic under the Medicaid
Drug Rebate Program rather than as a
brand name drug. After I asked those
at CMS about that classification, they
told me the EpiPen should not have
been classified as a generic. Of course,
because of this incorrect classification,
Mylan only had to pay a 13-percent re-
bate instead of the 23.1-percent rebate.
That means less money was returned
by the company to the Federal tax-
payers and to the States’ taxpayers.
According to CMS, from 2011 to 2015,
total Medicaid spending on the EpiPen
was $960 million. After rebates, net
Medicaid spending was still approxi-
mately $797 million. As opposed to
Medicaid spending, Medicare spending
on the EpiPen in those same years was

$335 million. Taxpayers and the States’
taxpayers were also on the hook for
these exorbitant overpayments for the
better part of 10 years.
When I saw what was happening, I
asked the Health and Human Services’
inspector general to look into these
practices. Based on data already on
file, the inspector general was able to
calculate the potential lost rebate
value dating back to 2006. The inspec-
tor general found that the taxpayers
may have overpaid for the EpiPen by
as much as $1.27 billion over a 10-year
period of time because of the incorrect
classification. Eventually, Mylan set-
tled a False Claims Act case with the
Obama administration’s Justice De-
partment for $465 million. Now, that
$465 million is a far cry from how much
Mylan got from the taxpayers while it
was pulling off this charade—in other
words, $800 million less.
Upon learning of the settlement, I ex-
pressed my extreme disappointment to
the Justice Department. It just didn’t
seem that the taxpayers had been made
whole. Obviously, they had not been.
According to Attorney General Miller
of my State of Iowa, my home State re-
ceived $1.5 million from the settle-
ment. However, after my having made
repeated requests to justify how much
that amount has made Iowa whole, I
have not received an answer yet. So,
not only did Mylan’s steep price hike
for one of the most widely needed drugs
in this country hit families hard, but it
also hit the taxpayers’ bottom line. We
shouldn’t have to depend on lawyers
and lawsuits to get the taxpayers’
money back. Government Agencies
should be responsibly overseeing any
program that they are in charge of.
During the course of my investiga-
tion, it became clear that CMS didn’t
believe that it had the legal authority
to require drug companies to reclassify
drugs and impose civil monetary pen-
alties for incorrectly classifying drugs.
Except for a few emails sent from CMS
to Mylan’s representatives that ques-
tioned EpiPen’s classification, for
years CMS did nothing. In other words,
CMS was not doing its job, and Mylan
was taking advantage of it.
The inspector general has also stated
that he lacked the legal authority to
affirmatively pursue penalties for the
submission of inaccurate drug classi-
fication data. As a result, Mylan was
able to escape accountability for a long
time, which cost taxpayers billions of
dollars. This is just one case. Other
drug manufacturers are gaming the
system as well.
In a December 2017 report, the inspec-
tor general found that 885 drugs may
have been potentially misclassified.
Specifically, the inspector general
found that from 2012 to 2016, Medicaid
may have lost $1.3 billion in rebates for
just 10 potentially misclassified drugs
with the highest total of reimburse-
ment. It is clear that the law needed to
change to provide much needed clarity
on who had what authorities and in
order to hold the government, as well
as the private sector, accountable.
As a result of the findings in my
EpiPen investigation, I, along with my
colleague Senator WYDEN, drafted—and
Congress later passed—the Right Re-
bate Act. That all happened just a
short period of time ago. The act,
which passed with strong bipartisan
support, fixes the problems that I iden-
tified through my investigation.
It closes the loophole that has al-
lowed pharmaceutical manufacturers
to misclassify their drugs and over-
charge the taxpayers by billions of dol-
lars.
The bill provides the HHS Secretary
the authority to require drug manufac-
turers to reclassify their drugs and im-
pose civil monetary penalties when
drugs are knowingly misclassified.
It provides HHS with additional au-
thorities to monitor drug manufactur-
ers that participate in the Medicaid
Drug Rebate Program, and the legisla-
tion provides the States the ability to
recover incorrect rebate amounts.
Finally, the bill imposes reporting
and transparency requirements on
HHS. An example of additional report-
ing requires the Secretary to submit a
report to Congress on an annual basis
that describes four things: one, the
covered drugs that have been
misclassified; two, the steps that have
been taken to reclassify the drugs;
three, the actions the Secretary has
taken to ensure the payment of any re-
bate amounts which were unpaid; four,
an accounting of how funds have been
used for the oversight and enforcement
of this new law.
All of these fixes and updates are now
in place because my constituents con-
tacted me about the real-world prob-
lems they were paying for and that
were affecting their health as well as
their wallets. I instructed my oversight
staff to investigate the problem. They
acquired the evidence, uncovered the
facts, and, obviously, exposed the holes
in the existing law. Then, I instructed
my policy staff to take those findings
to plug the holes and solve the problem
with new legislation, which is now law.
This is exactly the purpose of over-
sight. This is exactly how oversight is
done.
Pretty simply, this isn’t like rein-
venting the wheel every time. This is
oversight 101. Oversight means to bring
transparency, and transparency is
meant to bring accountability. Over-
sight works, plain and simple, and the
Right Rebate Act that Senator WYDEN
and I brought to passage is proof that
oversight is working.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, with
the 2-week hiatus we have had here in
Washington, DC, so we could be back
home visiting with our constituents,
some things have not changed; they are
just the way they were when we left,
and that would include the heart-
breaking stories that illustrate the sit-
uation along our southwest border.
I have talked, as you might imagine
coming from Texas, with a lot of Bor-
der Patrol personnel who found mi-
grants crammed in parts of cars that
you didn’t even know exist. I visited
the unmarked graves of those who have
been abandoned by their human smug-
glers in essentially desert conditions
and left to die. I have seen the dis-
gusting stash houses, where dozens of
migrants are held at a time to avoid
being caught before they are trans-
ported up through the Interstate High-
way System to distant locations.
I could fill a book with all of the
sights I have seen and the stories I
have heard over the years, and I am
sure, with the stories compiled by the
Border Patrol agents and officers, we
could fill an entire library.
The story, though, really is about
how ruthless and inhumane and com-
pletely reckless and thoughtless with
regard to human life these criminal or-
ganizations truly are.
One headline, though, during this re-
cess period, stopped me in my tracks.
Even this, I thought, could not be the
case. It read:
A 3-year-old was found alone in a field by
Border Patrol agents. His name and phone
numbers were [written] on his shoes.
A toddler, not even old enough to
talk to the agents who found him, was
abandoned.
Customs and Border Protection be-
lieves the boy was part of a larger
group trying to enter the United States
with their human smugglers. When the
group encountered Border Patrol
agents, the adults ran into the Rio
Grande River and back to Mexico, leav-
ing the little boy all by himself.
He was, as the Border Patrol does in
every instance, taken into custody and
treated well. He was taken to a hos-
pital for a medical evaluation, and, mi-
raculously, he was found to be in good
condition.
While the agents tried to track down
the boy’s family, one supervisory pa-
trol agent purchased clothing for him
out of his own pocket; other personnel
entertained the little boy, watching
movies and playing games.
These agents aren’t just patrolling
the border to catch illegal crossers;
they are now being forced, because of
the crisis at the border, to act as care-
givers for some of the most vulnerable
individuals they come across. Unfortu-
nately, what that means is, they are
also diverted from their No. 1 job,
which is law enforcement and to pro-
tect the security and safety of the
American people along our borders.
They are now diverted from that mis-
sion, as well as their counterdrug mis-
sion, essentially handing out diapers
and juice boxes for little boys and little
girls.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2472 April 29, 2019
I think this should be a reminder for
some of our colleagues who seem to
think that the status quo along the
border is just hunky-dory that it is far
from humane. Many of our colleagues
have said: Well, we need to abolish ICE
because somehow that is inhumane; en-
forcing the laws passed by Congress
and signed into law by the President,
that somehow is beyond the pale.
Enforcing the law isn’t inhumane.
Apprehending people who try to ille-
gally enter into the United States or
import their poison so it can be used by
Americans who then overdose and lose
their lives due to consuming those
drugs, that is inhumane. What is inhu-
mane and lacks simple compassion is
doing nothing to stop this practice.
Leaving security gaps that are ex-
ploited by smugglers, traffickers, and
criminal organizations who have zero
regard for human life is inhumane.
These people, the drugs, the contra-
band are mere commodities to these
criminal organizations. They don’t
care anything about them.
Giving people an opportunity to
smuggle an innocent child across our
border alone and leaving him to die in
the desert is not humane. Making
criminal cartels rich by exploiting our
porous border is inexcusable.
To be clear, the criminal organiza-
tions perpetuating this cycle are the
bad guys, not our law enforcement per-
sonnel who work to protect our border
at substantial risk to themselves and
who take compassionate care of those
in their custody.
I think one of the reasons this story
garnered so much attention is because
that is not what the average person
imagines the Border Patrol encounters
at the border, but increasingly it is.
The Border Patrol encounters unac-
companied children and families con-
sisting of one adult and one or more
children along the border because the
criminal organizations that smuggle
them to the border are exploiting gaps
and vulnerabilities in our asylum laws.
Many people believe the typical mi-
grant is an adult traveling alone, but
more likely than not, that is not the
case, and, in fact, it is becoming less
and less common.
In fact, according to the most recent
statics, there is no new net migration
from Mexico. Almost all of the migra-
tion into the United States, either by
people who illegally enter or asylum
seekers, is from countries other than
Mexico, most notably Central America,
but, literally, those could be merely
the transit points for people coming
from all over the world, up through
Mexico, into the United States.
From October 2018 to March 2019, a 6-
month period, more than 360,000 peo-
ple—360,000 people—were apprehended
along the southwest border. That is a
remarkably high number for this point
in the year, based on historical statis-
tics. Only about one-third of them were
single adults, more than half were
traveling as a family unit, and the rest
were unaccompanied children, like this
3-year-old little boy. He was found by
agents in the Rio Grande Valley, far
and away the busiest Border Patrol
sector in the country. In fact, more
than 40 percent of all unaccompanied
children are apprehended in the Rio
Grande Valley sector.
These numbers are far from normal.
Unsurprisingly, our Border Patrol and
Customs and Border Protection agents,
our local communities, the nongovern-
mental organizations, the churches,
and others who try to lend a helping
hand to these migrants coming across
the border are not equipped to handle
this huge surge of humanity.
Customs agents are being pulled off
inspection duty to help process the ap-
prehended migrants. Security check-
points are being shut down. The flow of
legitimate trade and travel is being im-
pacted. Individuals are then being re-
leased because there is simply not
enough space to hold them, even
though they violated our laws or have
not yet proven their right to an immi-
gration benefit under our asylum sys-
tem.
I had a group of manufacturers come
see me before the latest break. They
told me that from Juarez to El Paso,
which is right across the Rio Grande
River—that because commerce was
backed up, the truck traffic that was
transporting car parts as part of a just-
in-time inventory program to manufac-
turers on the American side, they lit-
erally had to hire an airplane to fly 11
minutes from Juarez to El Paso. Car
manufacturers that operate in Texas,
Missouri, and other parts of the coun-
try, depend on this cross-border supply
chain for their products. Eventually, if
we don’t do something about this flood
of humanity and the blockage it is cre-
ating to legitimate trade and com-
merce across our ports of entry, we are
going to see Americans lose their jobs
because it simply was uncontemplated
by anybody in that business that they
would have to suffer those kinds of
delays. Instead of a 1-hour delay com-
ing across the ports of entry carrying
manufactured goods that can be assem-
bled in the United States or otherwise
used in products made here, some are
taking as much as 24 hours to get
across. People are literally sleeping in
their truck because they can’t get
through the ports of entry, in part, be-
cause the Customs and Border agents
are being diverted, like I said earlier,
handing out juice boxes, handing out
diapers, taking care of this huge flood
of humanity coming across our border.
Don’t just take my word for it. I re-
member when President Obama made
comments talking about a humani-
tarian crisis. He called it a humani-
tarian and security crisis back in June
of 2014. At that time, we saw as many
as 135,000 during the month of May and
June 2014 apprehended at the border.
Just to put that in context, in Feb-
ruary and March of this year, 180,000
people were detained at the border—
back when President Obama called it a
humanitarian and security crisis,
135,000; February and March 2019,
180,000.
Simply put, this is a manmade dis-
aster, and the only one that can fix it
is the U.S. Congress, and it is going to
get nothing but worse.
All of the pull factors, the things
that attract people to come across the
border to take advantage of these gaps
in our asylum laws, are going to do
nothing but attract more and more and
more people.
Certainly, we all understand, as a
matter of simple human compassion,
why people would want to leave if they
can’t get a job, if they can’t provide for
their families where they live, but we
simply cannot continue to accept the
tens of thousands. Now, indeed, in a 2-
month period of time, 180,000 new peo-
ple have been coming into the country
essentially jumping in line ahead of
others who are trying to legally immi-
grate to the United States. It is over-
whelming for our communities and our
Border Patrol and our Customs agents.
We know many of these migrants pay
smugglers to lead them on this dan-
gerous journey north or have to pay
others a tax to pass through territories
along the way, including the so-called
plazas which are adjacent to the U.S.-
Mexico border. So while migrants and
vulnerable children are being left for
dead in the desert, and we are strug-
gling to manage a devastating humani-
tarian crisis, these criminal organiza-
tions are getting richer and richer.
This is part of how they do business.
While it is hard to know exactly how
much money these groups are making,
a recent study by RAND estimated
that revenues to smugglers moving mi-
grants from Northern Triangle coun-
tries—that is in Central America—
range from about $200 million to about
$2.3 billion in 2017 alone. These are the
same people, again, who are com-
modity agnostic, who care nothing
about human life. They will move mi-
grants for economic purposes. They
will move people who are being sex
trafficked, and they will move drugs,
some of which contributed to the 70,000
Americans who died of drug overdoses
last year, since Mexico is responsible
for about 90 percent of the heroin and
much of the fentanyl that comes across
our southwestern border.
Of course, all of this is tax-free. You
better believe these networks and their
operations will only continue to get
richer and richer and more and more
ruthless and more and more dangerous.
If you think these problems are going
to go away on their own, you are
wrong. The number of children and
family units found along our border is
already climbing at an appalling pace,
and we need to take action to alleviate
the strain on our personnel on the
southern border and to eliminate the
clogs and delays in legitimate trading
commerce that is the lifeblood of our
Nation, as well as our counterparts in
Mexico.
Unfortunately, rather than trying to
put out the fire, many folks here in

Washington would rather fan the
flames. The topic of border security
has become a hot button, a zero-sum
game that people seem to be willing to
talk about more than look for solu-
tions.
As we all know, that is not how to
get things done around here. We need
to work together to try to come up
with solutions to change our asylum
laws in a way that is both compas-
sionate and one that respects the rule
of law and allows us to control this
vast flood of humanity seeking to enter
our country and take advantage of our
asylum laws.
I have been speaking with our col-
leagues here in the Senate, as well as
those in the House, on both sides of the
aisle, about commonsense reforms,
what they might look like, and where
we might find common ground. We
can’t wait to do comprehensive immi-
gration reform in order to fix this par-
ticular problem where children and
families turn themselves in at the bor-
der because of these flaws in our asy-
lum laws. We need to address that and
to do what we can, but once we accom-
plish that, we need to move on to do
other things that we know we need to
do in the best interest of our country
and in the best interest of the rule of
law.
I think it is amazing what you can
accomplish when you talk to other
Members of Congress instead of just
the news cameras, but that seems to be
solely where the conversation is occur-
ring—for the benefit of news cameras.
We have had some productive discus-
sions about how we can provide our
frontline officers and agents with the
resources they need—staffing, authori-
ties, infrastructure, and technology.
I, for one, am here and ready to talk
to anyone who is willing to work in
good faith to provide relief for the hu-
manitarian crisis occurring on our
southern border. That is what Presi-
dent Obama called it, and it has gotten
much worse. It doesn’t help to be label-
ing this some sort of fake emergency,
as some of our colleagues on the other
side of the Capitol have. To deny re-
ality is a pretty big impediment to try-
ing to solve the problem.
I hope our colleagues on both sides of
the aisle can take stock of the situa-
tion, accept the facts, and muster the
courage to put politics aside and work
together to create a much needed and
long-overdue reform of our immigra-
tion policies because this problem is
not going away. There were 76,000 peo-
ple detained at the border in February
and 103,000 detained at the border in
March. There is no good reason why
the 103,000 will not grow to 150,000, to
200,000, or to 250,000.
All of the same pieces are in place
and all of the same flaws are being ex-
ploited by these transnational criminal
organizations to move people into the
country, where they can essentially
circumvent our immigration enforce-
ment and border security measures. It
is going to do nothing but get worse
when it comes to impediments getting
in place of lawful commerce and trade,
which are so important to our economy
and the economy of Mexico and our
common border.
With that, I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.

TRIBUTE TO R.D. MOORE
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is
hard to imagine that the U.S. Congress
was once guarded by a lone watchman,
but when the legislative branch of our
government moved from Philadelphia
to Washington, DC, that was the case.
His name was John Golding. He was
charged with protecting the U.S. Con-
gress. A generation later, after several
incidents, President John Quincy
Adams asked that a Capitol Police
Force be created. It was created with
four officers working 15-hour shifts.
Today, there are over 2,000 officers and
civilians who work for the Capitol Po-
lice.
When you put it in perspective, 3 mil-
lion to 5 million people from all over
America and all over the world come to
this building complex each year to per-
sonally witness the foundation—at
least on the congressional side—of our
democracy. We want to make certain
they are safe.
We know we live in a dangerous
world. The threats facing Congress
today are far different than at the time
of John Golding. Our exposure to risk
is higher, as we learn every day and
every week about horrible shooting in-
cidents that occur. One, of course, did
occur in the Capitol not that many
years ago. We know we have the best
protection possible in this increasingly
dangerous world thanks to the dedi-
cated, talented, and committed men
and women of the Capitol Police Force.
There is an important reason why I
have been able to do my job as the
Democratic whip for 14 years. It is be-
cause R.D. Moore, a member of the
Capitol Police team, has led my secu-
rity detail during that period of time.
At the end of this month, R.D. is retir-
ing after 39 years of service to his
country and more than 30 years with
the U.S. Capitol Police.
Renoard Moore joined the Capitol Po-
lice in 1988, after serving 9 years in the
U.S. Army. He also served with the
Dignitary Protection Division, pro-
tecting the Senate and House leader-
ship.
In 2005, when I joined the Senate
leadership, R.D. became part of not
just my Senate family but my family.
As a team leader, he has been respon-
sible for keeping the detail up-to-date
on the logistics of every event and
making critical decisions for the safety
and security of our office team. Simply
put, R.D. has been an important part of
my life every day that he has been will-
ing to put his life on the line for me.
He has become an honorary Illinoisan
in the process due to countless trips he
has made back to my home State.
There is even reason to believe we have
made him a Cubs fan, but I am not
going to say that with certainty.
Even with his commitment to duty,
R.D. has always found time for his own
family, putting thousands of miles on
his car each year to travel across the
country to Kentucky, Michigan, and
other places to visit his mother, his
siblings, and his cousins. Whether it
was in Michigan, Kentucky, or North
Carolina, he found the time for family.
No matter where he was, R.D. was al-
ways willing and able to respond to a
phone call or email from his extended
family.
I am going to miss R.D. personally,
and our office is also going to miss
him. He is a caring, larger than life
presence and one of the best known
members of the Capitol Police detail
here on Capitol Hill. If someone had a
rough day, R.D. was always there with
a piece of wrapped candy and a smile. If
any of us needed advice on new tech-
nology, R.D. always seemed to be on
top of it, whether it was the latest
smartwatch or smartphone or some-
thing else that I basically didn’t under-
stand. His great sense of humor was a
calming influence in the most stressful
of times that we faced. He always took
his job seriously, but he never took
himself seriously.
As R.D. Moore retires this week, I
want to thank him personally and wish
him well. I do it personally and on be-
half of my wife, Loretta, my entire
family, and the entire Durbin Senate
staff. He is a dedicated law enforce-
ment professional who should be re-
membered in the Capitol, along with
all of his colleagues on the Capitol Po-
lice who each and every day come to
work, put on their badges, and risk
their lives to keep this building and
the people who come here safe. I want
to congratulate Special Agent R.D.
Moore on a job well done.
REMEMBERING RICHARD LUGAR
Mr. President, I want to take a mo-
ment to celebrate the life of an excep-
tional American, a statesman, a gen-
tleman, and a friend. Senator Richard
Lugar of Indiana passed away yester-
day. He was a man of great intellect
and accomplishment and very little
ego. He possessed an overabundance of
the best qualities of American char-
acter.
He was a problem-solver. He believed
that America can and must be a force
for good in the world, and he was a vi-
sionary who had a genius for devising
thoughtful, effective solutions to com-
plex problems before many people even
knew they existed.
When the Soviet Union collapsed in
1991, many people believed naively that
the threat of nuclear Armageddon that
had haunted the world for nearly 50
years was over, but Senator Lugar

knew better. Working with Senator
Sam Nunn of Georgia, then chairman
of the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee and a Democrat, Senator Lugar
crafted a bipartisan response, the So-
viet Threat Reduction Act of 1991, to
prevent the huge arsenals, once con-
trolled by the Soviet Union, from fall-
ing into the hands of terrorists and
other murderers.
The bill created the CTR Program,
the Cooperative Threat Reduction Pro-
gram, within the Department of De-
fense, better known as Nunn-Lugar,
and led to the deactivation of more
than 7,600 nuclear warheads. Before
Nunn-Lugar, there were enough nu-
clear weapons and materials in the
former Soviet Republic to destroy a
good portion of the world. Much of
these armaments of nuclear Armaged-
don were housed in ramshackle, de-
graded facilities watched over by
guards who hadn’t been paid in months
and were sometimes drunk on duty. It
was like a fire sale for terrorists and
madmen. Under Nunn-Lugar, Dick
Lugar urged America to actually pay
off our old adversary to secure these
nuclear stockpiles, and America and
the world were safer as a result.
Sadly, today, leaders in both the
White House and the Kremlin seem to
be rushing to discard the nuclear arms
agreements and rebuild nuclear arse-
nals. That is absolutely the last thing
in the world we should see happening.
We can only hope that the inspiration
and success of Nunn-Lugar will cause
them to rethink this. The state of our
world is perilous enough without re-
igniting a nuclear arms race.
I want to make a personal note. I am
deeply and personally grateful to Sen-
ator Richard Lugar for agreeing, in
2010, to be one of the two Republican
cosponsors of the DREAM Act. It is a
bill that I introduced many years ago
to give those undocumented young peo-
ple brought here as infants and tod-
dlers and children a path to legal sta-
tus and citizenship. It is the kind of
thing that when you ask the American
people whether it is the right thing to
do, they don’t hesitate. Republicans,
Democrats, Independents—they believe
these young people should have a
chance to go to school, make America
a better place, and not worry about
their citizenship status.
It was always difficult to find Repub-
licans to join me in this effort, except
for Dick Lugar. Dick Lugar time and
again stepped up and said: I am going
to do this. America was recovering
from the great recession at that time,
and anti-immigrant sentiment was al-
ready strong and growing. It was being
exploited, as we see today, almost on a
daily basis.
Standing up for these Dreamers, who
were not legal in the United States and
couldn’t vote in the United States, was
an act of political decency and cour-
age—just what you might expect from
Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana. And 2
years later, after 36 years as a Senator
and a statesman, Senator Lugar lost
his seat in a primary challenge to a tea
party firebrand. Analysts suggested
that his support for Dreamers was one
of the reasons he was defeated.
After that election, Dick Lugar de-
fended his support for the DREAM Act
and other decisions that may have hurt
him in the primary, and he said:
‘‘[Those] were the right votes for our
country.’’ He added: ‘‘I stand by them
without regrets.’’
Dick Lugar was also a cosigner of a
letter, which I sent to then-President
Barack Obama. When we couldn’t pass
the DREAM Act, Senator Lugar joined
me in sending a letter to the President,
asking if there was anything he could
do by Executive order that might give
these young people a chance—just a
chance—to prove themselves and be-
come part of America’s future. Dick
Lugar and I were the two cosigners of
that letter that went to the President.
It was that letter and the thought be-
hind it which led to the creation of
DACA, a program that 790,000 of these
young people signed up for. They paid
their filing fees; they went through
their criminal background checks; they
checked all the boxes; and they were
given, under the DACA Program, 2
years to go to school in the United
States and work in the United States
without fear of deportation. It had to
be renewed every 2 years, but it was
Dick Lugar who stuck his neck out to
help me with that letter as well. When
others just wouldn’t join me, he did
and did it willingly. I will never forget
him, and neither should anyone else.
Our friend Dick Lugar is gone, but he
left a legacy of courage, decency, civil-
ity, service, and statesmanship that we
would all do well to emulate and for
which I am personally grateful. Dick
Lugar was the best of the U.S. Senate
on a bipartisan basis. This Republican
colleague of mine was someone I came
to respect time and again because he
always put country before politics.
Loretta and I got to know his wife
Char. Char and he were married when
they met in college and became fast
friends and built a family around that
friendship and their love—a wonderful
couple, great to be with and to spend
many hours together. I extend my con-
dolences, along with Loretta’s, to Char,
Senator Lugar’s beloved wife of more
than 60 years; to their sons, Mark, Bob,
John, David, and their families; and to
Senator Lugar’s many friends.
When I think of an internationalist
hailing from the Midwest who could
stand there smack-dab in the middle of
this country with all of that flatland
and look in every direction and see how
important the rest of the world was to
us, I think of Dick Lugar, and I think
of the contribution he made to the
State of Indiana and to America and to
the U.S. Senate every day of his public
service.
Most people don’t know that he also
had a passion for planting trees. It was
one of the things we used to talk
about. He would buy farmland and
plant trees. I think it is a suitable met-
aphor for his life that planting a tree is
like planting a good idea. Maybe it will
not come to full growth in your life-
time, but if it is good solid stock, it is
going to be something that is a legacy
for generations to come.
Senator Dick Lugar’s contribution to
Indiana, to America, and to the U.S.
Senate planted many trees that will
benefit future generations to come.

POWAY SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on Saturday, on the final day of Pass-
over, our Nation once again came face
to face with the violent hatred of anti-
Semitism—barely 6 months since the
murders at the Tree of Life in Pitts-
burgh, and, again, gunfire in a syna-
gogue. Again, a place of reverent wor-
ship for our Jewish brothers and sisters
was thrown into deadly chaos—this
time at the Chabad of Poway syna-
gogue in California.
Three people—the synagogue’s found-
ing rabbi, an 8-year old girl, and her
uncle visiting from Israel—were in-
jured by gunfire. Lori Kaye, who at-
tended the service with her husband
and 22-year-old daughter to deliver a
prayer of mourning for her own late
mother, was killed when she threw her-
self between the rabbi and the shooter.
Ms. Kaye has been described as ‘‘the
example of kindness to the fullest ex-
tent,’’ and now, in the words of the
rabbi who oversees Chabad of San
Diego County, she has ‘‘lost her life
solely for living as a Jew.’’
According to some reports, that 8-
year-old girl, in her young life, has al-
ready had to flee incoming rocket at-
tacks in Gaza and then, here in Amer-
ica, has seen her family home sub-
jected to anti-Semitic graffiti, and now
she has been shot—shot at her syna-
gogue.
Here is what she said yesterday:
I never thought that was going to happen
to me . . . it’s a safe place; you’re supposed
to feel safe.
Well, in an abhorrent way, it may be
fitting that our Nation will spend the
week of Yom Hashoah, the Holocaust
Remembrance Day observed in Israel
and worldwide, keenly focused on the
disturbing rise in anti-Semitism within
our own borders and around the globe.
Recent attacks on Muslims in New
Zealand and Christians in Sri Lanka
remind us that religious hatred exists
in many forms, but, of course, the Jew-
ish people have long been subjected to
a unique degree of disgusting prejudice,
and it is paired too often with indiffer-
ence from others.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2475
April 29, 2019
Just in the last few days, the New
York Times published a transparently
anti-Semitic political cartoon in its
international edition—not just online.
It ran in print. The Times compounded
the error by issuing an initial correc-
tion that failed to accurately apologize
for the blatant anti-Semitic tropes in
which the cartoon trafficked. Fortu-
nately, the Times has since finally pub-
lished what appears to be a genuine
apology.
This episode, as one of the New York
Times own columnists explained, ‘‘was
an astonishing act of ignorance of anti-
Semitism . . . at a publication that is
otherwise hyperalert to nearly every
conceivable expression of prejudice.’’
In other words, even important insti-
tutions that strive to meet progressive
sensibilities can often be blind to anti-
Jewish prejudice and attitudes in a
way that would never be tolerated for a
second where most other vulnerable
groups are concerned.
Combined with all the troubling sta-
tistics I have discussed on the floor in
the past, it could just not be clearer
that rising anti-Semitism requires
swift action. Here is just one example.
We know that anti-Semitism often
masquerades as political opposition to
Israel in an attempt to appear—to ap-
pear—more legitimate. But today, as
hate for the Jewish people makes head-
lines with alarming frequency, this
charade is being seen for what it is, and
the Senate recently took action to con-
demn it flat out. Included in the S. 1
legislation the Senate passed earlier
this year was a provision to help State
and local governments push back
against the influence of the BDS move-
ment and to enable communities to
shut off the flow of taxpayer dollars to
entities that support these anti-Israel
boycotters. Unfortunately, Democratic
leaders in the House have not seen fit
to take up this straightforward meas-
ure. Even as they have struggled to
swiftly and clearly condemn instances
of anti-Semitism within their own
ranks, they have also let this impor-
tant provision in S. 1 languish. It is
still sitting over in the House.
The infectious threat of anti-Semi-
tism is serious. Much more must be
done the world over to ensure that it
finds no home in modern society.
I just want to close with the inspir-
ing comments from the rabbi in the
San Diego Chabad. He said:
In the face of senseless hate, we commit to
live proudly as Jews in this glorious country.
We strongly believe that love is exponen-
tially more powerful than hate.
NOMINATIONS
Madam President, on a totally dif-
ferent matter, when I last spoke here
on the floor, the Senate had taken an
important step toward restoring the
sort of comity and efficiency that once
governed our consideration of
uncontroversial nominations. In the
face of across-the-board, systematic
opposition and delaying tactics for
even the most politically
uncontroversial of the President’s
nominees, the Senate took action and
brought this chapter of pure partisan
calculation to an end.
Subsequently, we began doing busi-
ness at a more normal, more reason-
able pace. We confirmed a number of
qualified public servants who still went
on to receive bipartisan support for
confirmation and did so in a fraction of
the time it had been taking.
So today we will continue yet an-
other slate of well-qualified candidates
for service in the executive branch and
on the Federal courts. We will consider
three individuals to join the Presi-
dent’s team, beginning with William
Cooper of Maryland to serve as General
Counsel to the Department of Energy.
Then, we will consider five nominees to
fill Federal district court vacancies in
Texas, Alabama, Florida, Puerto Rico,
and Pennsylvania.
There is still so much work to be
done. Two years of unprecedented ob-
struction can’t be reversed overnight,
but we have taken some important
steps in the right direction, and this
week we will take several more.
REMEMBERING RICHARD LUGAR
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on one final matter, I know many of
our colleagues were as sad as I was to
learn yesterday that our esteemed
former colleague, Senator Dick Lugar,
had died at the age of 87.
Many Members, past and present,
knew Dick Lugar as a senior peer who
always seemed to have the perfect ad-
vice or the exact perspective you need-
ed to hear. More recently, others got to
know Dick as a wise mentor. He felt a
personal responsibility to help new-
comers on both sides of the aisle learn
the ropes and make an impact.
As I was reflecting yesterday on
Dick’s towering legacy, I found myself
admiring all the ways he was really the
consummate U.S. Senator. He was a
total patriot who put principle first
but also a highly talented politician
and a savvy deal maker. Yet somehow
his personal reputation and character
managed to be even more impressive
than those achievements. I literally
don’t think anybody on Capitol Hill
had a bad word to say about Senator
Dick Lugar. His intellect, his commit-
ment, his prudence, his kindness, and
his deliberate focus on mentoring the
next generation of leaders—this man
was the complete package—a total gen-
tleman, thoroughly impressive.
So a lot of Dick’s legacy lies in all
the people he mentored and encour-
aged. Here I can testify firsthand. Dick
was running the senatorial committee
back in 1984 when I decided to try to
run for the Senate. As you can imag-
ine, as a local official, I had not ex-
actly built a national profile, and I
didn’t have a whole lot of people in my
corner. But Dick, thankfully, saw some
potential. That was an unusual lapse of
judgment, I would add, but he thought
he saw potential and took a chance on
a young Kentuckian.
Of course, the rest of the world
knows Dick Lugar best for his towering
impact on U.S. foreign policy and
world affairs. His interest in inter-
national affairs dated back to his and
his brother’s success at drumming up
more export business to turn around
the family factory, and it blossomed
into something remarkable.
For years, he represented one of our
Nation’s most listened to and most re-
spected voices when it came to our role
in the world. Whether he happened to
be chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee or ranking member at a
given time, the respect for his exper-
tise was universal.
His most famous accomplishments,
for good reason, involved his work on
arms control. The 1991 Nunn-Lugar Co-
operative Threats Reduction Program
stepped into the breach at a critical
moment as the Soviet Union was dis-
solving. It took action to dismantle
and decommission nuclear weapons be-
fore they could disappear or fall into
the wrong hands. Those efforts, which
were expanded after September 11 into
the Global Threat Reduction Initiative,
have neutralized literally thousands of
warheads, hundreds of missiles, and
other deadly chemical and biological
weapons. Nations which once ranked in
the global top 10 largest nuclear arse-
nals were certified as nuclear-free. The
entire world is safer as a result.
These early efforts helped set a new
tone right from the start of the post-
Cold War era. Dick understood it was
time to turn the page on Cold War
competition. America would extend our
hand and seek to work together with
Russia and former Soviet states to
build a safer world.
Consistent with Dick’s leadership
and guidance, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike took a deliberately mag-
nanimous approach. For decades, we
sought to work with Moscow, instead
of against it, to welcome Russia back
into the community of sovereign na-
tions.
As an aside, the general foreign pol-
icy consensus about Dick’s approach to
the former Soviet Union is especially
worth remembering today. It dem-
onstrates that Putin’s hostility toward
the West and our interests is not the
result of American hostility toward
Russia. The source of this hostility
emanates from the Kremlin.
‘‘Deliberately magnanimous’’ is real-
ly the Lugar doctrine in a nutshell,
from friendship to foreign policy.
Dick also built a formidable legacy
on agriculture and food security as
chairman and ranking member of the
Agriculture Committee—everything
from working on the farm bill and
fighting for Hoosier families to inter-
national questions of aid and develop-
ment.
The good news is, on these and other
subjects, Dick’s legacy did not end
with his Senate retirement, and it will
not even end now. The Lugar Center—
which has thrived under not only his
name but his active leadership since
retiring from the Senate—will continue

to serve as a home to thoughtful re-
search and an important voice in na-
tional policy conversations.
Of course, that Center isn’t even the
finest part of the ongoing Lugar leg-
acy. That would be the family Dick and
his beloved wife Char built together.
They have been an inseparable team
since their days as coclass presidents
at Denison University. Today that
team includes their four sons, Mark,
Bob, John, and David, 13 grandchildren,
and 17 great-grandchildren.
So we mourn Dick’s passing, but we
celebrate this life he lived so well and
so fully. Our friend left us at 87 years
old with the affection and gratitude of
his colleagues, with the respect of his
country and leaders around the world,
with the love of his beautiful family,
and with a world that is measurably
safer for his work—a remarkable leg-
acy that suits a remarkable man.

POWAY SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
before I begin the bulk of my remarks,
I want to take a moment to express my
heartfelt condolences to the victims of
the shooting on Saturday, in Cali-
fornia, when a gunman opened fire in a
synagogue during services after yelling
anti-Semitic slurs. His heinous attack
left a 60-year-old woman dead, the
rabbi wounded, a man and an 8-year-old
girl with shrapnel wounds.
We have seen so many different
houses of worship attacked in recent
weeks. Just 1 week ago on Easter Sun-
day, hundreds of Christian Sri Lankans
were massacred in their churches.
What happened at the synagogue in
California is rooted in the same White
supremacist hatred and bile that drove
attacks against the Tree of Life syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh; mosques in New
Zealand, and the Mother Emanuel
Church in Charleston.
We must recommit ourselves today
and every day to fighting anti-Semi-
tism and all forms of bigotry in our
country and around the world.
REMEMBERING RICHARD LUGAR
Madam President, I also want to
share a word on the passing of our
friend and former colleague, Dick
Lugar of Indiana. Dick personified the
Senate at its best—honest, decent, and
with an eye for consensus. He rep-
resented the kind of thoughtful biparti-
sanship that is so missing in our poli-
tics today. His work on the Foreign Re-
lations Committee—twice as its lead-
er—made the world a safer and fairer
place, whether it was combating pro-
liferation of nuclear weapons, apart-
heid in South Africa, or world hunger.
His legacy as a legislator and as a
man is something for all of us to aspire
to. Senator Lugar will be greatly
missed.
MUELLER REPORT
Madam President, while Congress
was away during the State work pe-
riod, Attorney General Barr released a
redacted version of Special Counsel
Mueller’s report to Congress and to the
American people.
The report documents, yet again, a
concerted effort by President Putin to
interfere and influence our elections
and to assist the current President.
Members of the Trump campaign
were aware of, and at times amplified,
that foreign influence campaign, in-
cluding President Trump himself, for
the likely purpose of winning a Presi-
dential election. That alone con-
stitutes attacks on our democracy.
Just as alarming was the behavior of
the President and his team concerning
Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation
itself. Special Counsel Mueller’s report
documents a persistent effort by the
President to stonewall, thwart, and un-
dermine the legitimacy of the Mueller
investigation. The report includes no
less than 11 instances during which the
President may have obstructed justice.
There is no question that the Presi-
dent engaged in a pattern of intimida-
tion and interference with the Federal
investigation. Special Counsel Mueller
explicitly states in his report that if he
could have exonerated the President on
the charge of criminal obstruction of
justice, then he would have, but ‘‘evi-
dence about the President’s actions
and intent . . . prevent us from conclu-
sively determining that no criminal
conduct occurred.’’
Also, it appears that the Justice De-
partment’s policy against the indict-
ment of sitting Presidents played an
important role in the special counsel’s
analysis. Now the Congress and the
American people must grapple with
this damning portrait of a President
who was dishonest, lawless, and regu-
larly abused the powers of his office.
The House of Representatives is
going to pursue hearings. The Senate
will hear from Attorney General Barr
this week, where he must answer for
his mischaracterizations of the special
counsel’s findings, his outrageously
partisan press conference, and, in gen-
eral, his failure to behave with the im-
partiality demanded of the Office of
Attorney General.
Special Counsel Mueller must testify
before Congress to further explain the
findings in his report and provide clar-
ity on areas where the Attorney Gen-
eral twisted his words, and Congress
must be given access to an unredacted
version of the report. Knowing Attor-
ney General Barr’s conduct, we cannot
trust him to be a clean pair of hands in
all of this.
So while many on the other side of
the aisle want to move on from these
issues, we simply cannot move on. Con-
gress—Democrats and Republicans—
must grapple with the facts of the
Mueller report. We must defend our de-
mocracy, and, yes, hold the President
accountable. These are not partisan
issues. This is about our country, the
sanctity of our elections, and the fu-
ture of the Presidency.
In the wake of the Mueller report, I
have been asked a lot, what are Demo-
crats going to do with the Mueller re-
port? Well, the real question should be,
what are my Republican friends going
to do with it?
DISASTER RELIEF
Madam President, Congress shame-
fully recessed for the State work period
without passing relief for Americans
who are affected by natural disasters
that occurred recently. This needs to
be a top legislative priority over the
next few weeks. We are already one-
third of the way into 2019, and millions
of Americans are still waiting for us to
provide necessary funding so they can
recover and rebuild from disasters that
happened months ago—in some cases,
longer than that.
The Democratic position is clear: We
support an ‘‘all of the above’’ approach
that provides relief for every American
affected by natural disasters—Ameri-
cans in the Midwest, Americans in the
South, Americans on the West Coast,
and, yes, Americans in Puerto Rico.
Everyone knows why Senate Repub-
licans have blocked our proposals, and
that is because President Trump has
shown a borderline obsessive hostility
to the people in Puerto Rico. Unfortu-
nately, my Republican colleagues have
followed President Trump’s lead. It has
caused us to fail in our responsibility
to provide long overdue aid to Ameri-
cans struggling to piece their lives
back together after hurricanes, floods,
fires and droughts.
Well, my friends on the other side
have had a few weeks to think about it.
I sincerely hope we can press the reset
button. We have a legislative proposal
introduced by my friend Congress-
woman LOWEY that takes care of all of
these disaster victims, and it is ready
to go in the House.
So as we get back to legislative busi-
ness this week, I urge my colleagues to
put politics aside. Let’s do the right
thing. Let’s tell President Trump that
his obsessive nastiness to Puerto Rico,
unfounded by fact, is not going to pre-
vent millions of people in the Middle
West, the West, and the South from
getting the relief they need. Let’s pro-
vide disaster relief for every American
who needs it.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Madam President, tomorrow morn-
ing, at the Democrats’ request, the
Speaker and I will meet with President
Trump at the White House to discuss
the glaring need to invest in our Na-
tion’s infrastructure. During the Presi-
dential campaign, Candidate Trump
promised a trillion-dollar infrastruc-
ture bill. It was one of the few areas
where most Democrats, myself in-
cluded, believed we could find common

ground with the President after he was
elected.
Unfortunately, it has been over 2
years. The President hasn’t proposed
anything close to a trillion-dollar in-
vestment and has shown little interest
in pursuing an infrastructure bill in
Congress. Senate Democrats, however,
have put together a trillion-dollar in-
frastructure investment, a real plan
that invests Federal dollars not just in
roads, bridges, and highways—as im-
portant as they are, and they are—but
also in schools, housing, electric grids,
rural broadband, and green energy.
There are several different ways to
pay for such a bill. For example, by re-
versing only the most egregious give-
aways in President Trump’s tax bill—
those given to the wealthiest of the
wealthy—and raising the corporate tax
rate a smidge, we could finance the en-
tirety of a $1 trillion infrastructure
bill.
So, while we look forward to an open
discussion tomorrow, it is important to
remember two things. First, our coun-
try has large infrastructure demands.
We need to go big and address roads
and bridges but also schools, housing,
broadband, green energy, and more.
Second, we need to remember that
since the Republicans have handed out
a mammoth tax break to big corpora-
tions and the already wealthy, it would
be extraordinarily unfair to ask the
middle class to shoulder the cost of an
infrastructure bill. The Tax Code
shouldn’t be made any more regressive
than it is now in order to pay for an in-
frastructure bill.
We look forward to our discussion to-
morrow, and, hopefully, the President
will have an open mind.
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING RICHARD G LUGAR
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, to
be specific, 51 years ago, the United
Citizens for Nixon-Agnew descended
upon the city of Indianapolis, IN, a city
to which a young man named Richard
Lugar had been elected mayor. That
was my first opportunity to meet
former Senator Richard Lugar, who
died a few days ago.
He became Richard Nixon’s favorite
mayor. He persuaded the suburban
areas around Indianapolis and the city
itself to do something almost no city
in America has been able to do—Nash-
ville did it; Miami did it; Louisville did
it; and Indianapolis did it. It was to
have a unified government—to get rid
of 60 different municipal governments
and form one. No one was very sur-
prised when Richard Lugar was able to
accomplish something, because he had
been marked from the beginning as
being a young man of extraordinary
ability.
At Denison, where he went to college,
he became a Rhodes Scholar. He stud-
ied at Oxford. He became a Navy intel-
ligence officer. Later on in the six-
ties—and I have mentioned 1968 as the
year in which we met him for the first
time—as mayor, he was able to deal
not only with the unification of Indian-
apolis but with the difficult racial
times that occurred all over America
during the late 1960s.
Nobody was surprised when he ran for
the U.S. Senate in 1974. He was de-
feated in the Watergate sweep that
wiped out a large number of promising
young candidates, which I had a little
personal experience with in Tennessee.
Yet no one was surprised when he came
back in 1976 and won.
As soon as he was elected, he orga-
nized the other Republican Senators
who had been elected that year to vote
for Howard Baker, Jr., for the Repub-
lican leader of the Senate in January
1977. Senator Baker won that race by
one vote. You can imagine that Sen-
ator Baker had a very high opinion of
Senator Richard Lugar, and they be-
came close friends.
I first really worked with him in 1980
when I was the Governor of Tennessee.
Senator Baker wanted to run for Presi-
dent, so he summoned to Nashville, to
meet in my office, Senator Lugar and
his young aide, Mitch Daniels—later,
the Governor of Indiana and now the
president of Purdue University—as well
as Warren Rudman, the Senator from
New Hampshire, and his young aide,
Tom Rath. I admired Dick Lugar then,
and I admired him throughout the rest
of his career. It was a privilege to serve
with him on the Foreign Relations
Committee while he was the chairman
of it when I was elected to the U.S.
Senate.
I noticed that unlike all of us Sen-
ators, when Richard Lugar had some-
thing to say, he had something to say,
so people actually listened to him. We

have a tradition in the Republican cau-
cus in which we have Thursday lunches
that are hosted by various members of
our caucus. I have served something
from the town in which Jack Daniel’s
is made—not the whiskey but the food.
Senator CINDY HYDE-SMITH served
some Mississippi food last week before
the recess. We will go around the room
in the order in which we have come in,
and everyone will stand up and say
something. Well, we all say something,
but what was different about Richard
Lugar was, during those Thursday
lunches, he actually had something to
say. He was intelligent and thoughtful.
He studied. He was never flamboyant.
He was not into symbolic votes. He
dominated Indiana politics for 36 years,
and he had the respect of virtually any-
one whom he ever met.
Not many Senators in our history
have the opportunity to do what he did
with former Senator Nunn and the
Nunn-Lugar law, which was to basi-
cally dismantle thousands of nuclear
weapons—take out the explosive parts
of them and render them useless as in-
struments of war for the future. He
continued to work for a safe world and
played a major role in the New START
treaty in 2010.
There will be many memorials and
many speeches and many compliments
paid to Senator Lugar. President
Obama awarded him the Presidential
Medal of Freedom—the highest civilian
honor in our country. I will remember
him for his quiet, unassuming, highly
intelligent, thoughtful style of leader-
ship. The world is better and safer be-
cause of Richard Lugar’s life in public
service. He was always a gentleman, al-
ways principled. He was a model for
what all of us should hope for in our
public officials. He was a good friend
for many years.
I and Honey, my wife, and our family
send our sympathy and our respect for
the life of Richard Lugar to Char and
his family.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
NOMINATION OF STEPHEN MOORE
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, over the
past few weeks, we have learned more
and more about the President’s pick,
Stephen Moore, for the Federal Re-
serve.
We now know he has made all kinds
of offensive, disparaging comments
about women, even about women who
play sports. He has even questioned
women who are in broadcast booths.
We know he is against child labor laws.
He thinks we should have 11-year-olds
working. He has said that he wants
people to start working at 11, at 12. He
has said he is a radical in this.
Think about this. The President is
about to nominate for the Federal Re-
serve a gentleman who says he is an
economist but who really isn’t. He
didn’t get his degree and didn’t get a
Ph.D. in economics, as Federal Reserve
people often do. Yet put that aside.
He said: I am a radical in child labor.
I mean, who thinks that way in the
year 2019?
Other things we know, he was banned
from the op-ed page of the Kansas City
Star after publishing an editorial with
all kinds of factual errors. See, the edi-
tor knew he was a conservative. The
editor may have been a conservative. I
don’t know. That is not the point. The
point is it was filled with factual er-
rors, and the editor said: Those kinds
of factual errors are just unacceptable.
We are finished with him—not that the
editor doesn’t agree with certain view-
points, but she just said: We are not
running him anymore because he
doesn’t tell the truth.
We have him on videotape showing
breathtaking contempt for people in
the middle of the country, from places
like Arkansas and Kentucky and Ten-
nessee and my State of Ohio. Here is
what Mr. Moore said, and it is on tape
and many people have seen it:
If you want to live in the Midwest, where
else do you want to live besides Chicago?
You don’t want to live in Cincinnati—
The home of Senator PORTMAN—
or Cleveland.
My home. He said:
You don’t want to live in Cincinnati or
Cleveland or these armpits of America.
That is what he said.
President Trump is showing his dis-
regard for Cincinnati and Cleveland
and Kentucky and Arkansas and Ten-
nessee and the middle of the country
by nominating someone who is so out
of touch and has such contempt for the
middle of this country. ‘‘The armpits of
America’’ is what he called two of my
State’s great cities.
Make no mistake, he wasn’t just in-
sulting Cleveland and Cincinnati; he
was insulting Little Rock; he was in-
sulting Nashville; he was insulting peo-
ple who get up every day and work
hard. He was dismissing millions of
Americans. He was undermining the
dignity of work by dismissing them,
people who have been ignored by Wash-
ington and have been preyed upon by
Wall Street.
Across the industrial heartland, tens
of millions of Americans raise families;
they serve in our military; they power
our companies; they contribute to our
country.
Mr. Moore, how dare you demean
them and diminish them with those
kinds of comments? How dare you in-
sult them and their hometowns?
You can’t fight for these Americans
when you don’t know the first thing
about the places they live. You don’t
understand that all work has dignity.
You don’t understand the dignity of
work. You don’t understand honoring
and respecting work.
It is particularly ironic where Mr.
Moore made these comments. He was
speaking at an event sponsored by a
think tank called the Heartland Insti-
tute, located, I believe, in Chicago. Can
you believe that?
Take a look at who is really behind
this group, the Heartland group. I
mean, people can name themselves
whatever they want. They call them-
selves the Heartland Institute, but
they are funded by ExxonMobil, the
biggest oil company, I believe, in the
world. They are funded by Philip Mor-
ris, one of the tobacco giants—Big To-
bacco—that poisons our children. Four
hundred eighty thousand people die
every year from tobacco in this coun-
try—480,000 people. You know what
that means? It means Philip Morris has
to find 1,300 new customers every day
just to make up for the people tobacco
has killed.
So the Heartland Institute is funded
by ExxonMobil; it is funded by Philip
Morris; it is funded by the Koch broth-
ers—or at least we used to know they
were funded by these groups.
Today, unfortunately, they don’t dis-
close who their individual donors are,
which is pretty shocking. The Heart-
land Institute didn’t want people in the
actual heartland to realize they are
nothing but a corporate front—a cor-
porate, special interest-funded front.
What have they done with those do-
nations? Well, you can expect them to
do the bidding of ExxonMobil; you can
expect them to do the bidding of Philip
Morris; you can expect them to do the
bidding of the Koch brothers, and those
interest groups have certainly gotten
their money’s worth.
The Heartland Institute has pushed
junk science on behalf of tobacco com-
panies to try to block and stop and
neuter anti-smoking public health
laws.
As recently as the late 1990s, their
president wrote an op-ed. I mean, this
isn’t really funny at all. I don’t know
why I laughed, but it is so ridiculous.
The president of that group wrote an
op-ed claiming that moderate smok-
ing—moderate smoking—doesn’t raise
your risk of lung cancer. You know,
getting those 15-years-olds to start
smoking only a little bit, I guess that
is OK because that doesn’t increase
their chance of lung cancer. That is
their notable achievement.
So, of course, we shouldn’t be sur-
prised that the men in the room—and
it was almost all men. You could tell
from the video and the audio that the
men in the room, when Mr. Moore
talked about my city, Cleveland, Sen-
ator PORTMAN’s city, Cincinnati,
talked about them being armpits of the
Nation, the men in the room howled
with laughter because look who comes
to the Heartland Institute. It is a
bunch of lobbyists, a bunch of drug
company people, a bunch of oil com-
pany men, a bunch of tobacco men, a
bunch of gun lobby people. All these
people who come to the Heartland In-
stitute, of course, they were laughing
at those people in the industrial Mid-
west, in Cleveland, in Mansfield, in To-
ledo, in Zanesville, and all over our
country. That is what these phony,
rightwing, tobacco-funded think tanks
really think of America’s heartland.
President Trump likes to pretend he
cares about people in places like Cin-
cinnati and Cleveland. He likes to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2479
April 29, 2019
make big promises to the people in the
heartland, but look at whom he puts in
charge—these conservative elites.
Make no mistake, they are far-right
conservatives, and they are elites.
They all think they are better than the
rest of the country. These conservative
elites, whether they are on Wall Street,
whether they are in Trump Tower,
whether they are at the White House,
where the White House looks like a re-
treat for Wall Street executives,
whether these conservative elites are
going in and out of the office doors of
the Senate majority leader with their
requests for tax cuts in hand, these are
people who have contempt for the peo-
ple they are supposed to serve.
Stephen Moore says he doesn’t want
to be judged on all the extreme and of-
fensive articles he has written; he
wants to be judged by his economic
record.
So let’s do that. Let’s look at his eco-
nomic record. It is just as bad. It is in
line with views of all these rightwing
elites. It stems directly from contempt
for ordinary people. You see it in their
policies: Make it easier for Wall Street
to pay these huge—$1 million, $2 mil-
lion, $5 million, $10 million—bonuses
that Wall Street elites get, so often at
the expense of workers.
I was at my high school reunion in
Mansfield, OH, some time ago. I sat
across the table from a woman who had
worked at one of America’s largest
banks. When I grew up and I used to
put my family farm paycheck into this
bank, it was called Farmers Bank in
those days. It has been bought and sold
and bought by other bigger banks. The
point is, she had worked as a teller in
this bank for 30 years. She was making
$30,000 a year. Yet Wall Street con-
tinues giving million-dollar bonuses,
massive tax cuts for corporations, for
billionaires and pennies for working
families.
Look at what happened in Kansas,
where Stephen Moore was banned from
writing in the newspaper because he
lied so much. He helped design the tax
cut boondoggle that bankrupted the
State. It was the plan that eliminated
taxes entirely for LLCs and pass-
through corporations. The people who
paid the price were millions of ordi-
nary Kansans. There was no money for
teachers. There was no money for
healthcare. There was no money for
higher ed.
When Republicans in the State fi-
nally rebelled and repealed that Ste-
phen Moore far-right tax plan, Kansas
had fallen behind the rest of the coun-
try. They were actually losing jobs in
Kansas, a once prosperous State, while
almost every other State was adding
them.
One advocate in Kansas who saw his
work up close said: ‘‘I wouldn’t let Ste-
phen Moore within 100 yards of my en-
emy’s piggy bank, let alone put him on
the Federal Reserve.’’
So why on Earth would we want to
hire that guy to help run our national
economy? It is pretty clear that cre-
ating jobs for workers in the heartland
doesn’t really matter to Stephen Moore
and his crowd. After all, they don’t
even want to set foot there.
It comes back to the dignity of work.
We need people in office who under-
stand, who respect work. Whether you
punch a clock or swipe a badge, wheth-
er you work on a salary, whether you
work for tips, whether you are raising
children, whether you are taking care
of an aging parent, it comes down to
honoring and respecting work—some-
thing apparently Stephen Moore and
his far-right elitist crowd know noth-
ing about.
The last thing we need is another
conservative elitist looking down his
nose at American workers, at Ohio
workers, at workers in Arkansas, at
workers all across this country.
FALCON TRANSPORT LAYOFFS
Mr. President, last month, GM laid
off thousands of workers in Lordstown,
OH, and around the country.
Lordstown is a community near
Youngstown and Warren in Northeast
Ohio.
Many of us warned the President that
if he let this happen, the layoffs
wouldn’t stop with GM. Those job
losses would work their way up and
down the entire supply chain—the peo-
ple who stamp the metal, the people
who make the components, the people
who make all kinds of products that
only go into the production of a car,
the assembly of a car—but the Presi-
dent did nothing other than rub salt in
workers’ wounds by boasting about
imaginary new factories coming to
Ohio that were supposedly going to
open.
Now, this weekend, we found out that
the additional layoffs we feared are
starting to happen.
Falcon Transport was part of the
auto supply chain in the Mahoning
Valley, transporting parts for GM
Lordstown. This weekend, with no no-
tice, they closed their doors, leaving
500 Ohioans out of a job.
They didn’t just close their door;
workers found out about this with an
email, I believe, the night before or
early Monday morning in their inboxes
or people saw posts on social media
telling them not to show up for work
the next day. Some drivers were left
stuck all around the country when
they found out.
Workers in my State everywhere de-
serve better than an email letting
them know their livelihood has been
taken away. The entire community of
Lordstown and Trumbull County and
Mahoning County deserve better than a
President who breaks his promises.
Remember, President Trump came to
Mahoning Valley many times during
the campaign, but he came there since
the election as the President of the
United States, and he said: Don’t move.
Don’t sell your house. We are going to
fill up those factories or we are going
to rip them down and build new ones.
Don’t move. Don’t sell your house. We
are going to fill up those factories or
rip them down and build new ones.
People trusted him. A lot of people
had voted for him. They put their faith
in him. They believed what he said.
What did Trump do? Instead of work-
ing to save their jobs, he turned around
and handed corporations a 50-percent-
off coupon to send their jobs overseas.
Here is how it works. If you are pro-
ducing in Dayton, OH, you are paying a
21-percent corporate tax rate. If you
move your production to Mexico, you
pay 10.5 percent. So the President of
the United States, in the tax bill a year
and a half ago that passed this Con-
gress—the President of the United
States essentially gave a 50-percent-off
coupon to American companies on
their taxes. So if you move overseas,
we will give you 50 percent off. It is
part of the President’s phony populism.
Call yourself a populist, but if you are
a populist, you are never racist, you
are never anti-Semitic, you don’t give
tax cuts to rich people and then stick
it to the middle class. That is what has
happened over and over again—a be-
trayal.
I am calling on the President—maybe
he should try keeping his promises,
maybe he should actually fight for
autoworkers, maybe he should actually
stand up and support workers up and
down the auto supply chain for a
change. End the tax cut for corpora-
tions that—again, they shut down an
American plant; they move overseas;
they get a 50-percent-off coupon on
their taxes.
If you love your country, you fight
for the people who make it work.
TRIBUTE TO WALT STINE
Mr. President, a piece of good news. I
want to talk about Walt Stine from
Hartville, OH, an Ohio veteran.
His story is a reminder of the caring
and fundamental decency of the people
of my State. It is a reminder of our
country’s veterans’ comradery and
dedication to each other—veterans
from Arkansas, veterans from Ohio, all
over this country.
Two decades ago, Mr. Stine’s friend
found a Purple Heart at a flea market.
He bought it, and he gave it to Walt
Stine, hoping his friend, a World War II
veteran, would know how to return it
to its rightful owner.
Mr. Stine then set out on a quest—
this was long before the internet, mak-
ing it much harder—to return the Pur-
ple Heart to the stranger who had
earned it, who had received it decades
earlier during the Vietnam war.
Mr. Stine said of the Purple Heart:
It means a lot to me. They don’t pass them
out in Cracker Jack boxes . . . you really
have to earn ‘em. And I know he earned his,
and I want to get it back to him or his fam-
ily.
Mr. Stine and his wife, Sandy, tried
and tried. They wrote letters. They
made phone calls. They couldn’t find
the veteran. The veteran, he said, was
named Cox Bartelmay.
Finally, they realized there was a
typo in the letter awarding the Purple
Heart. The veteran’s name was actu-
ally Coy Bartelmay, but the print said
Cox Bartelmay, C-o-x.

S2480 April 29, 2019
Once they figured out it was a typo,
they realized it was Coy Bartelmay. He
was a Vietnam veteran. He had lost
half his leg during the war. He was
awarded the Purple Heart that Mr.
Stine’s friend found buried in one of
the booths at the flea market.
Tragically, Mr. Bartelmay was killed
in a car crash after returning home
from the war, but his family still lives
in Illinois.
Because of Mr. Stine’s dedication,
that Purple Heart is now on its way
back to the recipient’s family, the fam-
ily of the gentleman who fought for
this country and earned that Purple
Heart in Vietnam.
I want to thank Rob Powers with
WEWS in Cleveland for telling this
story. It is the kind of work that local
journalists do every day to celebrate
what people do in our communities.
I want to thank Mr. Bartelmay’s
family for his service and, of course,
thank you to Walt Stine for his dedica-
tion to our country, for his service to
our country, and to your fellow vet-
erans.
I yield the floor.

REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SE-
CRECY—TREATY DOCUMENT NO.
116–1
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the in-
junction of secrecy be removed from
the following treaty transmitted to the
Senate on April 29, 2019, by the Presi-
dent of the United States: Protocol to
the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on
the Accession of the Republic of North
Macedonia (Treaty Document No. 116–
1).
I further ask that the treaty be con-
sidered as having been read the first
time; that it be referred, with accom-
panying papers, to the Committee on
Foreign Relations and ordered to be
printed; and that the President’s mes-
sage be printed in the RECORD.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The message of the President is as
follows:
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice
and consent of the Senate to its ratifi-
cation, the Protocol to the North At-
lantic Treaty on the Accession of the
Republic of North Macedonia (the
‘‘Protocol’’). The Protocol was signed
in Brussels on February 6, 2019, on be-
half of the United States and the other
Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty.
Also transmitted for the information of
the Senate is an overview of the Pro-
tocol by the Department of State. Full
ratification of the Protocol will allow
North Macedonia to become a Party to
the North Atlantic Treaty and a mem-
ber of the North Atlantic Treaty Orga-
nization (NATO).
As further explained in the report on
the accession of North Macedonia to
NATO, transmitted to the Congress on
March 27, 2019, pursuant to section
3(2)(E)(ii) of the Resolution of Advice
and Consent to Ratification of the Pro-
tocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of
1949 on the Accession of Poland, Hun-
gary, and the Czech Republic of April
30, 1998, North Macedonia is a steadfast
security partner of the United States,
and its NATO membership will directly
benefit United States strategic inter-
ests and the NATO Alliance.
I ask that the Senate provide its ad-
vice and consent, and my Administra-
tion stands ready to brief and assist
you in your deliberations.
DONALD J. TRUMP.
THE WHITE HOUSE, April 29, 2019.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representa-
tive Office in the United States (TECRO)—
CONUS Based F–16 Training
TECRO has requested a possible sale for
the continuation of a pilot training program
and maintenance/logistics support for F–16
aircraft currently at Luke Air Force Base,
Arizona, to include flight training; participa-
tion in U.S. Government approved training
exercises; inert/dummy training munitions;
supply and maintenance support; spares and
repair parts; support equipment; U.S. Gov-
ernment program management; publications;
documentation; personnel training and
training equipment; fuel and fueling serv-
ices; U.S. Government and contractor engi-
neering, technical, and logistics support
services; and other related elements of pro-
gram and logistical support necessary to sus-
tain a long-term CONUS training program.
The total estimated program cost is $500 mil-
lion.
This proposed sale is consistent with U.S.
law and policy as expressed in Public Law 96–
8.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by helping to improve the security
and defensive capability of the recipient,
which has been and continues to be an im-
portant force for political stability, military
balance, and economic progress in the re-
gion.
The recipient and the United States Air
Force (USAF) will have the opportunity to
fly together, which will support disaster re-
lief missions, non-combatant evacuation op-
erations, and other contingency situations.
These services and equipment are used in the
continuing pilot training program currently
at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. This pro-
gram enables the recipient to develop mis-
sion ready and experienced pilots through
CONUS training. The training provides a
‘‘capstone’’ course that takes experienced pi-
lots and significantly improves their tactical
proficiency. Training is a key component of
combat effectiveness.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The prime contractors will be URS Federal
Services, Inc., Germantown, MD and L3,
Greenville, Texas. At this time, there are no
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
not require the assignment of any additional
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the recipient. The USAF will provide
instruction, flight operations, maintenance
support and facilities. Approximately 100
U.S. contractors will provide aircraft main-
tenance and logistics support for the F–16
aircraft.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2482 April 29, 2019
Mr. Eugene Harmack, Mr. Glenn Har-
rison, and Mr. Alfred Villagran served
when the United States and its allies
needed them most. These heroes brave-
ly fought against the Nazis and helped
liberate Europe from Hitler’s fascist
regime.
When he was 24, Eugene Harmack
fought in one of the deadliest battles in
American history, the Battle of the
Bulge. During the battle, Harmack se-
cured a vehicle trapped behind enemy
lines and used its radio to restore vital
communications for the American
forces that defeated the last major
Nazi offensive.
In 1944, Glenn Harrison was a 23-year-
old B–17 bomber pilot who had flown 17
bombing missions against the Nazis.
On one mission, Harrison and his crew
were shot down on the way to Munich,
Germany. Following the crash, Har-
rison was captured and forced to march
300 miles to a Nazi prisoner-of-war
camp, where he was held from June
1944 to January 1945.
At the age of 19, Alfred Villagran was
a gunner and radio operator on a B–17
Bomber. On one mission, Villagran’s
plane was shot and lost two of its four
engines. As the plane flew back to Eng-
land, Villagran and his crew came
under fire again and lost the third en-
gine. With only one functional engine,
the crew safely landed thanks to the
Allied fighter planes that provided
cover.
As we approach the 75th anniversary
of D-Day, I wish to thank these Amer-
ican heroes for their service and brav-
ery. As a nation, we are forever grate-
ful for their sacrifices.

TRIBUTE TO JULIANNA ALBOWICZ
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President,
today we say farewell to a member of
our Senate family: Julianna Albowicz.
For more than 20 years, Julianna has
served the U.S. Senate and the resi-
dents of Maryland.
Julianna started her career in the
U.S. Senate working for my friend,
Senator Barbara Mikulski. After her
retirement, Senator Mikulski let me
know that Julianna was the ‘‘real
deal’’ in western Maryland and that
Julianna knew everyone and everyone
knew Julianna. Senator Mikulski was
right. I was delighted that Julianna
signed on as my western Maryland re-
gional director after my election to the
U.S. Senate in 2016.
Julianna started her Federal service
in 1965 as a supply clerk at the U.S.
Naval Station in Keflavik, Iceland,
where her husband Bill was stationed.
When she returned stateside, she
worked at the National Naval Medical
Center in Bethesda, MD, as a pur-
chasing agent until 1970.
Julianna and her husband owned and
operated Hoff, Inc., a family retail
business, for 31 years in the town of
Clear Spring, MD, while serving in var-
ious elective offices for the town, first
as councilwoman and then as vice
mayor. When her husband died in 2002,
Julianna sold the business. With her
children grown, she decided to learn
computer skills and eventually landed
what she referred to as her ‘‘dream
job,’’ working for an elected official.
Let me tell you, Julianna has been a
dream to work with. I could always
count on Julianna to be everywhere
serving our constituents in western
Maryland. Whether it was representing
me at Fort Detrick in Frederick Coun-
ty or crossing over the western Mary-
land ‘‘Alps’’ to Garrett County,
Julianna performed her duties with
dedication, diligence, and profes-
sionalism. I don’t think there is a
firehall, a family business, or a non-
profit organization that hasn’t met
Julianna or hasn’t had a Senate cita-
tion presented on my behalf by
Julianna. Fittingly, Julianna was rec-
ognized for her accomplishments re-
cently when she was named a Woman
of Achievement by the Hagerstown
Business and Professional Women.
We wish Julianna well as she turns
the page into a new chapter of her life,
which will enable her to spend well-de-
served time with her beloved children:
Vincent, a police officer in Boulder
City, NV; Kay, who worked for the Na-
tional Association of Secretaries of
State; Marc, a first class deputy for the
Washington County, MD, sheriff’s de-
partment; and Nikole, who works at
the U.S. Treasury Department. Most
importantly, she will have more time
to dote on her eight grandchildren:
William, Dillon, Carter, Wyatt, Julia,
Dalton, Claire, and Vivien.
I ask my colleagues to join me in ex-
pressing our deepest gratitude to
Julianna Albowicz for all that she has
done for the residents of Maryland and
the U.S. Senate and in wishing her well
in the years to come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT RUSSELL
HERMAN SINES
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor Sergeant Russell Her-
man Sines of Goshen, WV. Sergeant
Sines bravely served in the 80th Divi-
sion, 317th Infantry of the United
States Army from 1942 to 1945, during
the height of American intervention in
World War II. Known as the Blue Ridge
Division, Sergeant Sines and his com-
rades from Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Virginia, and our home State of West
Virginia were ordered into action on
July 15, 1942, and eventually set sail for
Europe on Independence Day of 1944.
The 80th Division fought valiantly on
the Allied front, first landing on Utah
Beach in Normandy and then quickly
moving to Saint-Jores, France. Later
that fall, the 317th Infantry was forced
to cross the Moselle River to Pont-á-
Mousson in the face of heavy Axis op-
position. During the ensuing battle at
Mousson, Sergeant Sines was wounded
by shrapnel in his calf and ankle and
taken to receive treatment at a Paris
hospital. Sergeant Sines would later
receive a Purple Heart for his wounds
received during combat.
However, this injury would not stop
Sergeant Sines from serving his coun-
try. By the time the Axis forces began
their Ardennes Offensive, Sergeant
Sines was already back with the 317th
Infantry. His regiment continued to
move toward the southeast lines of
Bastonge, where fighting would con-
tinue for several months. While on the
streets of Bastonge, Sergeant Sines
happened to run into his brother, Jun-
ior Sines, proving how small the world
is that we West Virginians enjoy.
Sergeant Sines and the 80th Division,
317th Infantry would go on to capture
the cities of Kassel, Erfurt, Wierman,
Jena, and Gera. It was during the fight-
ing between Kassel and Erfurt that
Sergeant Sines would receive a bronze
medal for his heroic and meritorious
service on the battlefield. By the end of
the war, the Blue Ridge Division cap-
tured over 200,000 enemy soldiers and
endured 289 days of combat, fighting
courageously in places such as
Ardennes, Luxembourg, and Argentan
to name a few.
I hold stories like that of Sergeant
Russell Herman Sines close to my
heart, as my father, Governor Arch
Moore, also fought in World War II. As
Americans, we have a duty to honor
and remember the collective sacrifice
of all the men and women of the Great-
est Generation. Because of their serv-
ice, America has continued to prosper
and flourish, serving as a pillar of hope
and freedom for people across the
world.
West Virginians understand the im-
portance of community, patriotism,
and liberty. These values are alive in
the Appalachian foothills due to the
service of brave men and woman like
Sergeant Russell Herman Sines. Again,
I thank Sergeant Sines for his duty to
his country, and it is an honor to call
him a fellow West Virginian.∑

TRIBUTE TO JO LAUGHLIN AND
DORIS MCCORKINDALE
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
Jo Laughlin and Doris McCorkindale
for their impact on Fergus County and
surrounding areas.
Jo and Doris serve their local com-
munity as volunteers at the Central
Montana Community Cupboard. Folks
all over the community are grateful for
the joy and light Jo and Doris bring to
the families they serve. They have set
a great example for all Montanans with
their time and dedication as volun-
teers.
For over 20 years, Jo has tirelessly
served in various capacities at the Cup-
board, as both a board member and vol-
unteer. Her lighthearted attitude and
selfless nature brings joy to the people
she serves. At 89 years old, Jo con-
tinues to serve as head volunteer, co-
ordinating all food orders and over-
seeing the day to day operations at the
Cupboard.

Doris has served at the Cupboard as
both a board member and volunteer for
almost 20 years. As volunteer coordi-
nator, she works to ensure an adequate

I applaud Jo and Doris for leading a

gling and the hungry of their commu-
nity. Their commitment to their fellow
Montanans, as well as their happy opti-
mism towards life, is a shining example
of the Montana spirit. Fergus County
is lucky to have these two incredible
women in their community as selfless

TRIBUTE TO THADDEUS LUSZEY,
JR.
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, when
his son was deployed to Iraq in 2003,
Thaddeus Luszey, Jr., and his wife
Deborah of Hudson, NH, began sending
him care packages. Now, more than 10
years later, that simple act has turned
into a nonprofit organization called
Operation Care for Troops. Operation
Care for Troops has sent nearly 110,000
packages to deployed servicemembers,
providing them a friendly reminder
from home that they are not forgotten.
For his dedication to supporting the
brave servicemembers who sacrifice so
much so that the rest of us may live in
freedom and security, I am proud to
recognize Thaddeus as the April 2019
Granite Stater of the Month.
Thaddeus comes from a military fam-
ily; his mother, father, and son are all
veterans. When his son was deployed in
Iraq, Thaddeus sat down with a friend
over lunch who was also sending care
packages overseas to deployed
servicemembers, and an idea was born:
They would work together to reach
even more servicemembers. What
started as friends, family, and neigh-
bors in garages putting together care
packages has transformed into a full-
fledged organization with hundreds of
volunteers. Operation Care for Troops
sends over a thousand packages four
times a year, including 3,000 stockings
to troops over the holidays. Operation
Care for Troops also makes sure that
servicemembers know that the people
of New Hampshire have them in their
thoughts. Each package contains three
or four cards from schoolchildren and
community members, ensuring that no
one goes without mail.
The organization does this all with
the support of hundreds of community
volunteers and businesses who help
supply and fill the packages, a true em-
bodiment of New Hampshire’s all-
hands-on-deck spirit.
For these efforts, I am proud to rec-
ognize Thaddeus Luszey, Jr., as the
April 2019 Granite Stater of the
Month.∑
TRIBUTE TO MIKE AND KATHY
RICE
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I
would like to recognize the impressive
work of two Granite Staters, CSM (Re-
tired) Michael Rice and Kathy Rice.
Throughout his service in the New
Hampshire National Guard, Mike and
his wife Kathy worked to ensure that
servicemembers and their families
were well supported. Mike and Kathy
were strong advocates for the men and
women of the New Hampshire National
Guard, championing training and sup-
port for the well-being of the soldiers
and airmen and women. Their knowl-
edge of the military and the systems
available to assist troops and their
families was an invaluable resource
many relied on.
Following Mike’s retirement in 2006,
Mike and Kathy have continued their
service through countless volunteer en-
deavors, particularly in helping vet-
erans find employment. They worked
as part of the employer support to the
Guard and Reserve and as transition
assistance advisers, dedicating their
time and ensuring that our veterans
have the resources they need to suc-
ceed. They have also earned State and
national recognition for their work, in-
cluding receiving the Association of
the United States Army’s Mary G.
Roebling Award for Distinguished
Service.
Mike and Kathy attend every deploy-
ment and redeployment ceremony and
work tirelessly to provide baked goods,
information for troops and their fami-
lies, and help to ensure that veterans
receive the services they have earned.
I thank Mike and Kathy for their
service to veterans, military families,
and our country. Their selfless hard
work honors those Granite Staters who
fought for the cause of freedom and for
the protection of our democracy and
has truly made a difference in the lives
of so many.
I hope you will join me in honoring
dedicated Granite Staters Mike and
Kathy Rice.∑

To the Senate of the United States:
I have concluded that it is not in the
interest of the United States to become
a party to the Arms Trade Treaty (Sen-
ate Treaty Doc. 114–14, transmitted De-
cember 9, 2016). I have, therefore, de-

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE
REPORT OF THE VETO OF S.J.
RES. 7, A JOINT RESOLUTION TO
DIRECT THE REMOVAL OF
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES
FROM HOSTILITIES IN THE RE-
PUBLIC OF YEMEN THAT HAVE
NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED BY CON-
GRESS, RECEIVED DURING AD-
JOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON
APRIL 17, 2019—PM 10
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States, together with an accompanying
report, which was ordered to be printed
in the RECORD, spread in full upon the
Journal, and held at the desk:
To the Senate of the United States:
I am returning herewith without my
approval S.J. Res. 7, a joint resolution
that purports to direct the President to
remove United States Armed Forces
from hostilities in or affecting the Re-
public of Yemen, with certain excep-
tions. This resolution is an unneces-
sary, dangerous attempt to weaken my
constitutional authorities, endangering
the lives of American citizens and
brave service members, both today and
in the future.
This joint resolution is unnecessary
because, apart from counterterrorism
operations against al-Qa’ida in the
Arabian Peninsula and ISIS, the
United States is not engaged in hos-
tilities in or affecting Yemen. For ex-
ample, there are no United States mili-
tary personnel in Yemen commanding,
participating in, or accompanying
military forces of the Saudi-led coali-
tion against the Houthis in hostilities
in or affecting Yemen.
Since 2015, the United States has pro-
vided limited support to member coun-
tries of the Saudi-led coalition, includ-
ing intelligence sharing, logistics sup-
port, and, until recently, in-flight re-
fueling of non-United States aircraft.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2484 April 29, 2019
All of this support is consistent with
applicable Arms Export Control Act
authorities, statutory authorities that
permit the Department of Defense to
provide logistics support to foreign
countries, and the President’s constitu-
tional power as Commander in Chief.
None of this support has introduced
United States military personnel into
hostilities.
We are providing this support for
many reasons. First and foremost, it is
our duty to protect the safety of the
more than 80,000 Americans who reside
in certain coalition countries that have
been subject to Houthi attacks from
Yemen. Houthis, supported by Iran,
have used missiles, armed drones, and
explosive boats to attack civilian and
military targets in those coalition
countries, including areas frequented
by American citizens, such as the air-
port in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In addi-
tion, the conflict in Yemen represents
a ‘‘cheap’’ and inexpensive way for Iran
to cause trouble for the United States
and for our ally, Saudi Arabia.
S.J. Res. 7 is also dangerous. The
Congress should not seek to prohibit
certain tactical operations, such as in-
flight refueling, or require military en-
gagements to adhere to arbitrary
timelines. Doing so would interfere
with the President’s constitutional au-
thority as Commander in Chief of the
Armed Forces, and could endanger our
service members by impairing their
ability to efficiently and effectively
conduct military engagements and to
withdraw in an orderly manner at the
appropriate time.
The joint resolution would also harm
the foreign policy of the United States.
Its efforts to curtail certain forms of
military support would harm our bilat-
eral relationships, negatively affect
our ongoing efforts to prevent civilian
casualties and prevent the spread of
terrorist organizations such as al-
Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula and
ISIS, and embolden Iran’s malign ac-
tivities in Yemen.
We cannot end the conflict in Yemen
through political documents like S.J.
Res. 7. Peace in Yemen requires a nego-
tiated settlement. Unfortunately, inac-
tion by the Senate has left vacant key
diplomatic positions, impeding our
ability to engage regional partners in
support of the United Nations-led peace
process. To help end the conflict, pro-
mote humanitarian and commercial
access, prevent civilian casualties, en-
hance efforts to recover American hos-
tages in Yemen, and defeat terrorists
that seek to harm the United States,
the Senate must act to confirm my
nominees for many critical foreign pol-
icy positions.
I agree with the Congress about the
need to address our engagements in
foreign wars. As I said in my State of
the Union address in February, great
nations do not fight endless wars. My
Administration is currently accel-
erating negotiations to end our mili-
tary engagement in Afghanistan and
drawing down troops in Syria, where
we recently succeeded in eliminating
100 percent of the ISIS caliphate. Con-
gressional engagement in those en-
deavors would be far more productive
than expending time and effort trying
to enact this unnecessary and dan-
gerous resolution that interferes with
our foreign policy with respect to
Yemen.
For these reasons, it is my duty to
return S.J. Res. 7 to the Senate with-
out my approval.
DONALD J. TRUMP.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2489
April 29, 2019
(2) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress
enacted a Federal 36-percent annualized
usury cap for servicemembers and their fam-
ilies for covered credit products, as defined
by the Department of Defense, which curbed
payday, car title, and tax refund lending
around military bases;
(3) notwithstanding such attempts to curb
predatory lending, high-cost lending persists
in all 50 States due to loopholes in State
laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms of
credit, and the exportation of unregulated
interest rates permitted by preemption;
(4) due to the lack of a comprehensive Fed-
eral usury cap, consumers annually pay ap-
proximately $14,000,000,000 on high-cost over-
draft loans, as much as approximately
$7,000,000,000 on storefront and online payday
loans, $3,800,000,000 on car title loans, and ad-
ditional amounts in unreported revenues on
high-cost online installment loans;
(5) cash-strapped consumers pay on aver-
age approximately 400 percent annual inter-
est for payday loans, 300 percent annual in-
terest for car title loans, up to 17,000 percent
or higher for bank overdraft loans, and tri-
ple-digit rates for online installment loans;
(6) a national maximum interest rate that
includes all forms of fees and closes all loop-
holes is necessary to eliminate such preda-
tory lending; and
(7) alternatives to predatory lending that
encourage small dollar loans with minimal
or no fees, installment payment schedules,
and affordable repayment periods should be
encouraged.
SEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.
Chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending Act (15
U.S.C. 1631 et seq.) is amended by adding at
the end the following:
‘‘SEC. 140B. MAXIMUM RATES OF INTEREST.
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any
other provision of law, no creditor may make
an extension of credit to a consumer with re-
spect to which the fee and interest rate, as
defined in subsection (b), exceeds 36 percent.
‘‘(b) FEE AND INTEREST RATE DEFINED.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sec-
tion, the fee and interest rate includes all
charges payable, directly or indirectly, inci-
dent to, ancillary to, or as a condition of the
extension of credit, including—
‘‘(A) any payment compensating a creditor
or prospective creditor for—
‘‘(i) an extension of credit or making avail-
able a line of credit, such as fees connected
with credit extension or availability such as
numerical periodic rates, annual fees, cash
advance fees, and membership fees; or
‘‘(ii) any fees for default or breach by a
borrower of a condition upon which credit
was extended, such as late fees, creditor-im-
posed not sufficient funds fees charged when
a borrower tenders payment on a debt with a
check drawn on insufficient funds, overdraft
fees, and over limit fees;
‘‘(B) all fees which constitute a finance
charge, as defined by rules of the Bureau in
accordance with this title;
‘‘(C) credit insurance premiums, whether
optional or required; and
‘‘(D) all charges and costs for ancillary
products sold in connection with or inci-
dental to the credit transaction.
‘‘(2) TOLERANCES.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—With respect to a credit
obligation that is payable in at least 3 fully
amortizing installments over at least 90
days, the term ‘fee and interest rate’ does
not include—
‘‘(i) application or participation fees that
in total do not exceed the greater of $30 or,
if there is a limit to the credit line, 5 percent
of the credit limit, up to $120, if—
‘‘(I) such fees are excludable from the fi-
nance charge pursuant to section 106 and
regulations issued thereunder;
‘‘(II) such fees cover all credit extended or
renewed by the creditor for 12 months; and
‘‘(III) the minimum amount of credit ex-
tended or available on a credit line is equal
to $300 or more;
‘‘(ii) a late fee charged as authorized by
State law and by the agreement that does
not exceed either $20 per late payment or $20
per month; or
‘‘(iii) a creditor-imposed not sufficient
funds fee charged when a borrower tenders
payment on a debt with a check drawn on in-
sufficient funds that does not exceed $15.
‘‘(B) ADJUSTMENTS FOR INFLATION.—The
Bureau may adjust the amounts of the toler-
ances established under this paragraph for
inflation over time, consistent with the pri-
mary goals of protecting consumers and en-
suring that the 36 percent fee and interest
rate limitation is not circumvented.
‘‘(c) CALCULATIONS.—
‘‘(1) OPEN END CREDIT PLANS.—For an open
end credit plan—
‘‘(A) the fee and interest rate shall be cal-
culated each month, based upon the sum of
all fees and finance charges described in sub-
section (b) charged by the creditor during
the preceding 1-year period, divided by the
average daily balance; and
‘‘(B) if the credit account has been open
less than 1 year, the fee and interest rate
shall be calculated based upon the total of
all fees and finance charges described in sub-
section (b)(1) charged by the creditor since
the plan was opened, divided by the average
daily balance, and multiplied by the
quotient of 12 divided by the number of full
months that the credit plan has been in ex-
istence.
‘‘(2) OTHER CREDIT PLANS.—For purposes of
this section, in calculating the fee and inter-
est rate, the Bureau shall require the method
of calculation of annual percentage rate
specified in section 107(a)(1), except that the
amount referred to in that section 107(a)(1)
as the ‘finance charge’ shall include all fees,
charges, and payments described in sub-
section (b)(1) of this section.
‘‘(3) ADJUSTMENTS AUTHORIZED.—The Bu-
reau may make adjustments to the calcula-
tions in paragraphs (1) and (2), but the pri-
mary goals of such adjustment shall be to
protect consumers and to ensure that the 36-
percent fee and interest rate limitation is
not circumvented.
‘‘(d) DEFINITION OF CREDITOR.—As used in
this section, the term ‘creditor’ has the same
meaning as in section 702(e) of the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691a(e)).
‘‘(e) NO EXEMPTIONS PERMITTED.—The ex-
emption authority of the Bureau under sec-
tion 105 shall not apply to the rates estab-
lished under this section or the disclosure re-
quirements under section 127(b)(6).
‘‘(f) DISCLOSURE OF FEE AND INTEREST RATE
FOR CREDIT OTHER THAN OPEN END CREDIT
PLANS.—In addition to the disclosure re-
quirements under section 127(b)(6), the Bu-
reau may prescribe regulations requiring dis-
closure of the fee and interest rate estab-
lished under this section.
‘‘(g) RELATION TO STATE LAW.—Nothing in
this section may be construed to preempt
any provision of State law that provides
greater protection to consumers than is pro-
vided in this section.
‘‘(h) CIVIL LIABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT.—In
addition to remedies available to the con-
sumer under section 130(a), any payment
compensating a creditor or prospective cred-
itor, to the extent that such payment is a
transaction made in violation of this section,
shall be null and void, and not enforceable by
any party in any court or alternative dispute
resolution forum, and the creditor or any
subsequent holder of the obligation shall
promptly return to the consumer any prin-
cipal, interest, charges, and fees, and any se-
curity interest associated with such trans-
action. Notwithstanding any statute of limi-
tations or repose, a violation of this section
may be raised as a matter of defense by
recoupment or setoff to an action to collect
such debt or repossess related security at
any time.
‘‘(i) VIOLATIONS.—Any person that violates
this section, or seeks to enforce an agree-
ment made in violation of this section, shall
be subject to, for each such violation, 1 year
in prison and a fine in an amount equal to
the greater of—
‘‘(1) three times the amount of the total
accrued debt associated with the subject
transaction; or
‘‘(2) $50,000.
‘‘(j) STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL.—An ac-
tion to enforce this section may be brought
by the appropriate State attorney general in
any United States district court or any other
court of competent jurisdiction within 3
years from the date of the violation, and
such attorney general may obtain injunctive
relief.’’.
SEC. 4. DISCLOSURE OF FEE AND INTEREST RATE
FOR OPEN END CREDIT PLANS.
Section 127(b)(6) of the Truth in Lending
Act (15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(6)) is amended by strik-
ing ‘‘the total finance charge expressed’’ and
all that follows through the end of the para-
graph and inserting ‘‘the fee and interest
rate, displayed as ‘FAIR’, established under
section 141.’’.

therefore, be it
Resolved, That Kim Coalter is authorized to
testify in the administrative hearing of
Bryan K. Stanley before the Mississippi Divi-

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF RUTH
PASSEN
HON. NANCY PELOSI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to pay tribute to a beautiful life. Ruth Passen
was a pioneer of community journalism, a
champion for social justice and a strong voice
for our American values of equality, fairness
and progress. Her passing is a great official
loss for our San Francisco community and a
deep personal loss for all who were blessed to
call her friend.
Ruth Passen was a San Franciscan through
and through. Born and raised in the city of
Saint Francis, she dedicated herself to being
an ‘‘instrument of peace’’ and spent a lifetime
sowing love, hope, light and joy in our commu-
nity and around the world.
Ruth made a difference in so many ways.
Together with her dear friend, the late, leg-
endary Enola Maxwell, Ruth helped build the
Potrero Hill Neighborhood House, known as
the Nabe, into a transformative beacon of
hope, healing and help for so many in our
community. Understanding the unifying power
of the arts, Ruth was also an inspired, effec-
tive force in bringing her beloved jazz and the-
ater to the Nabe and our wider Bay Area com-
munity.
Ruth earned the deep respect of all as an
innovator and a leader of local journalism. In
1970, she made history as she launched the
Potrero View, which has become San Fran-
cisco’s longest running community newspaper,
as well as one of its most respected. Ruth’s
visionary leadership over four decades has
brought local news and community services to
countless families in our City, and has helped
set the standard for editorial integrity in the
field.
All San Franciscans can take great pride in
the progress that Ruth advanced for equality,
fairness and freedom around the world. She
worked tirelessly to bring peace and justice to
communities in need, first through the Wom-
en’s International League of Peace and Free-
dom during the 1960s and 70s, and then
through her work with the people of El Sal-
vador in the 1980s.
She brought that same persistence and
dedication to progress to the labor movement,
where along with her late respected and re-
markable husband Joe, she was a fearless
voice for the rights of working men and
women throughout the West Coast, on the wa-
terfront, in the farms and in all workplaces.
Through their involvement in Young Demo-
crats, Ruth and Joe also helped bring more
progressive voices to Washington, ensuring
that the People’s House would serve the
American people.
San Francisco and America have been
blessed by the life and leadership of Ruth
Passen. May it be a comfort to her son Marc,
daughter-in-law Dianne, granddaughters Nat-
alie and Teresa, and all her loved ones that
Ruth and her beloved Joe have been reunited.
May it also be a comfort that so many mourn
with and pray for them during this sad time.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF
ERNEST ‘‘CHUCK’’ AYALA
HON. NANCY PELOSI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and honor the incredible life of a
dear friend, Ernest ‘‘Chuck’’ Ayala. Chuck
Ayala was a visionary leader and entrepreneur
who dedicated his life to serving the people of
San Francisco and our nation. His passing on
April 22, 2019 at the age of 94 is a profound
official loss for the countless San Franciscans
whose lives he touched and a deep personal
loss for his many loving friends and family.
Chuck Ayala was a life-long San Franciscan
whose deep faith compelled him to honor the
words of our patron saint, Saint Francis who
said, ‘‘Preach the gospel, sometimes use
words.’’ Whether serving in the Army during
World War II, directing the Catholic Youth Or-
ganization’s Youth Services or mentoring
countless at-risk young people to put them on
the path toward a brighter future, Chuck lived
his faith through action and always looked for
ways of giving back to the community he
loved.
In 1973, Chuck was inspired by his mother’s
immigrant experience to create the Centro
Latino de San Francisco, a senior center dedi-
cated to feeding our city’s seniors and pro-
viding the resources they need to thrive. For
over 46 years, Centro Latino has helped
countless underserved and underrepresented
seniors receive a hot meal and find a sense
of community.
Since Chuck started Centro Latino, it has
become a full-service community center for
over 2,500 low-income multi-ethnic seniors
and families. The center’s education initiatives
have helped new immigrants learn English,
apply for vital services and fulfill their Amer-
ican Dreams by becoming citizens. In short,
Centro Latino has done nothing less than give
thousands of San Franciscans a sense of dig-
nity and worth.
From city hall to the White House, Chuck
never failed to make his voice heard. It was
an honor to nominate Chuck to the White
House Conference on Aging to ensure that
our nation’s leaders were listening to the
grassroots activists who are on the ground
caring for our seniors and their families.
For Chuck and the love of his life, his late
wife, Bernice, their greatest source of joy was
family. Over their 56 years together, Chuck
and Bernice raised a beautiful family and cre-
ated a legacy of service and advocacy that will
continue to improve the lives of San Francis-
cans and all Americans for generations to
come.
May it be a comfort to Chuck’s daughter,
Darlene, sons, Mike and Joe, grandchildren
and the entire Ayala family that Chuck and his
beloved Bernice have been reunited. May it
also be a comfort that so many mourn with
and pray for them during this sad time.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT
OF T.J. MCGRATH AFTER NEAR-
LY 27 YEARS OF DISTINGUISHED
CIVILIAN SERVICE
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor and recognize the outstanding
service of T.J. McGrath on her retirement after
nearly 27 years of distinguished public service,
the past 10 years at the Congressional Budget
Office, most recently as its General Counsel.
T.J. was promoted to that position in late
2016, in recognition of her dedication, ability,
skillful work, and breadth of experience. In that
capacity, she has served as CBO’s principal
legal officer and an integral part of the agen-
cy’s leadership team. She has overseen
CBO’s legal staff and their work, skillfully lead-
ing them in interpreting legislative proposals
and providing high-level analysis regarding
significant judicial decisions, scorekeeping
guidelines, and relevant budget laws. She has
been a leader in making CBO’s analysis more
transparent.
Moreover, since becoming CBO’s General
Counsel, she has worked tirelessly, building
professional relationships across the legisla-
tive branch, focusing on creating a positive
work environment at CBO, and providing train-
ing so that employees have the skills they
need to interact more effectively. One example
that encapsulates all three of those efforts is
bystander training. T.J. worked closely with
the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights
to develop training to prevent harassment in
the workplace. The training provided partici-
pants with practical tools for taking ownership
of their work environment and encouraged by-
standers not to remain silent if they witness an
incident that might make someone feel un-
comfortable. As a result of T.J.’s efforts, CBO
was the first agency in the legislative branch
to receive bystander training.
From 2009 to 2016, T.J. served as CBO’s
Deputy General Counsel. In that position, she
dealt with many operational matters and quick-
ly demonstrated her ability to develop practical
solutions. She instituted CBO’s successful
legal intern program, updated and refined
CBO’s internal policies, served as lead attor-
ney in cases involving the Congressional Ac-
countability Act, and worked closely with a
Justice Department attorney in a case brought
in U.S. District Court. T.J. also made valuable
contributions to numerous reports, testimonies,
and cost estimates in just about every subject
area covered by CBO, including the economy,
national security, and health care.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E494 April 29, 2019
T.J.’s service to the nation did not begin
with her work at CBO. She came to CBO from
the Defense Department’s TRICARE Manage-
ment Activity (now the Defense Health Agen-
cy), where she was an Associate General
Counsel, providing guidance to the Director
and staff on policy and legal issues involved in
delivering quality health care to military per-
sonnel, military retirees, and their dependents.
Although T.J. is retiring from civilian service,
she will continue her exemplary military ca-
reer. For nearly 27 years, she has served as
a member of the Air Force’s Judge Advocate
General Corps. She first served on active duty
with assignments across the world, including
in Alaska, Korea, Germany, Iraq, and Afghani-
stan. During that time, T.J. defended the Air
Force against tort claims, prosecuted criminal
offenses, taught at the U.S. Air Force Acad-
emy, commanded a cadet squadron, and was
a military assistant to the General Counsel of
the Department of Defense. Since transferring
to the reserves more than 14 years ago, she
has served in the North American Aerospace
Defense Command and United States North-
ern Command, the Air Force Space Com-
mand, the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center,
and the Pacific Air Forces. She remains active
as a colonel in the selected reserves today.
Her colleagues in CBO and on the Hill ap-
preciate her hard work, keen insights, sense
of humor, and steady hand. They will espe-
cially miss her generosity with her time and
knowledge, her patience, and especially her
kindness.
I know my colleagues join me in extending
our thanks and appreciation to T.J. for her
service to our country. We wish her well in her
future undertakings and hope that the nation
will continue to benefit from her expertise and
commitment.

HONORING HANS BERG
HON. JOE NEGUSE
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
because in early March my district and the
state of Colorado lost Hans Berg of Empire to
an avalanche in Jones Pass.
Hans was a professional photographer for
an experienced and well-reputed backcountry
ski company. He was working with a guided
group when an avalanche struck the pass.
Hans’ death is the seventh in my home
state this season and was the second within
one week’s time.
I share my deepest condolences with Hans
Berg’s family and friends during this time of
loss and ask for a moment of silence in his
honor.

HONORING ANNIE DICKERSON
HON. JOE WILSON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, Annie Dickerson has been a leading
activist and advocate for several decades on
conservative policy. She began her career at
the Michigan Republican Party in the 1980s
working for Spencer Abraham, who later be-
came a United States Senator from Michigan
and then the Secretary of Energy. She has
supported and helped elect candidates from
state and local position to statewide and fed-
eral offices.
She did presidential campaign advance
work for President H.W. Bush and was deputy
finance director for the reelection of President
George W. Bush in 2003 and 2004. She
served as chief of staff to American Ambas-
sador Mercer Reynolds in Switzerland during
the Bush Administration.
Later, she was a delegate to the Republican
National Convention in 2016, serving on the
Platform Committee where she stood up for
inclusion and support of minority communities
within the GOP. Annie has also been a mentor
of and advocate for women, founding Winning

ative women to federal office. She has been a
political commentator on television and a lead-
ing fundraiser for candidates and charities
over the years. She is the proud mother of two
children and currently resides in New York
City.

IN HONOR OF MARV WOLF WIN-
NING THE 2019 WYOMING JEF-
FERSON AWARD
HON. LIZ CHENEY
OF WYOMING
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Marv Wolf on winning the 2019
Wyoming Jefferson Award.
Marv Wolf is well known in the Cheyenne
community. A veteran himself, Marv is a dedi-
cated volunteer at the Cheyenne Veterans Ad-
ministration where he spends time comforting
hospice patients and offering rides to doctor’s
appointments and the grocery store. At 89
years young, Marv has dedicated himself to
his community and fellow veterans. The peo-
ple of Cheyenne and Wyoming are lucky to
have Marv and I’m grateful for his commitment
to serving his fellow veterans.
Again Madam Speaker, I extend my con-
gratulations to Marv Wolf for winning the 2019
Wyoming Jefferson Award and I thank him for
his service to our country and Wyoming.

HONORING MICKEY O’CONNELL
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life and career of
a great American patriot, husband, father,
union leader and favorite son of Baldwin, New
York, Mickey O’Connell.
Mr. O’Connell began his career as an ap-
prentice carpenter in 1978 with local three of
the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers (IBEW) and retires today as a master
Electrician after more than forty years of ex-
emplary service.
Mr. O’Connell’s love of country and family
manifested itself through his many acts of cou-
rageous service to the United States Intel-
ligence community throughout the world and
after the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001.
Mr. O’Connell’s wife Heidi is a dedicated
professor at Nassau Community College and
their son Edward is a Lieutenant Colonel in
the United States Army, their son Andrew is a
former Army Ranger and current ATF agent
and their youngest son Joe is an electrician
with local three following in his dad’s proud
IBEW tradition of service.
Madam Speaker on this day, April 29, 2019,
the United States House of Representatives
rises to pay tribute to Mickey O’Connell on the
occasion of his retirement and extends to him
and his family the nation’s gratitude for his
tireless community involvement, strong work
ethic and profound love of family and country.

HONORING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF
DR. LARRY CLARK
HON. JOE NEGUSE
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the achievements of my constituent
Dr. Larry Clark who the Federal Laboratory
Consortium recently recognized as the Lab Di-
rector of the Year out of over 300 federal labs
nationwide.
Dr. Clark is currently the Director of the Na-
tional Wildlife Research Center in Fort Collins,
Colorado. Through his work, Dr. Clark has
made a number of breakthroughs in under-
standing how our nation’s wildlife interacts
with society and how these interactions can be
improved. As a result of his work, numerous
groups in both the public and private sectors
have been able to make changes that mitigate
their environmental impact.
At a time when our country faces enormous
challenges related to our changing climate, it
is critical that we understand how our deci-
sions impact the creatures in the world around
us. A better understanding of these effects al-
lows us to minimize the impacts of human ac-
tivity on the world which we all share.
Dr. Clark’s tireless dedication to scientific
exploration and excellence allows Americans
to live in peace with the species that share our
world with us. For this reason, I would like to
thank him and all those working at the Na-
tional Wildlife Research Center for all that they
do for our nation.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E495
April 29, 2019
As the third-largest county park system in
the United States, Miami-Dade Parks is a sta-
ple of our community. Founded in 1929 and
now covering 270 parks and over 13 thousand
acres of land, Miami-Dade Parks has spent 90
years providing all of South Florida with oppor-
tunities to explore our natural heritage and
enjoy the outdoors. In addition to leading envi-
ronmental restoration efforts and cultural pro-
grams, Miami-Dade Parks offers summer
camps and fitness programs for children,
adults, seniors, and people with disabilities.
Miami-Dade Parks brings our community to-
gether by helping all of us enjoy the beauty of
South Florida’s natural wonders together. We
are better friends to the environment and to
each other thanks to the incredible work of
this department. I hope my fellow Miami-Dade
residents join me in celebrating Miami-Dade

IN RECOGNITION OF REGINA
STANBACK STROUD
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Dr. Regina Stanback Stroud as she re-
tires from her position as President of Skyline
College and from the San Mateo County Com-
munity College District. She has made extraor-
dinary contributions to education throughout
her entire career.
Dr. Stanback Stroud holds a Doctorate in
Educational Leadership from Mills College in
Oakland, a Bachelor’s in Nursing Sciences
from Howard University, a Master’s in Human
Relations from Golden Gate University and a
Master’s in Educational Leadership from Mills
College. There can be little doubt that, as a
role model, young women, especially women
of color, may look to Dr. Stanback Stroud and
see themselves following in her footsteps.
When President Obama needed an advisor
on college costs and affordability, he recruited
Dr. Stanback Stroud to serve on his advisory
committee. She’s been a visiting professor at
Mills College and served as an adjunct pro-
fessor in the San Francisco State University
Educational Leadership Doctoral Program.
She is the publisher of works on women of
color in leadership, workforce and economic
development, and antipoverty programs in
community colleges. For all these accomplish-
ments and more, Dr. Stanback Stroud is right-
ly recognized throughout the nation as an edu-
cational leader and a person who has worked
effectively to increase the diversity of edu-
cation and science.
Under Dr. Stanback Stroud’s leadership,
Skyline College made dozens of innovative
changes. The Skyline Promise Program
makes community college affordable to resi-
dents by offering fee waivers, support with
transportation, food and books. Skyline’s Eq-
uity Institute administers institutional assess-
ments, publishes research and instructs its
professionals in how to be inclusive and in-
quisitive. Skyline is one of 15 community col-
leges in California that offers a bachelor’s de-
gree program. Students may earn a Bachelor
of Science in Respiratory Care. Its MIT in-
spired fabrication laboratory is part of a global
network offering entrepreneurs the opportunity
to test new devices without having to pay the
enormous fees of a conventional fabrication
laboratory. Under her leadership, Dr. Stanback
Stroud launched a STEM Center which will be
the hub for students who identify goals in
technical careers such as biology, bio-
chemistry, biotechnology, chemistry, computer
science, engineering, health and related fields.
San Mateo County’s economy has changed
enormously in the last 40 years. It shifted from
a mixture of agriculture and tourism to high
technology in software, pharmaceuticals and
finance. International trade now dominates our
local economy. Dr. Stanback Stroud recog-
nizes the importance of international students
in maintaining our county’s economic advan-
tage. Skyline College has a Global Learning
Program and Services Division that is dedi-
cated to expanding international awareness
and study abroad opportunities for the college
and community, complete with a passport
processing office that serves thousands of
community members annually. She has estab-
lished a Dream Center that helps undocu-
mented immigrant students by training these
students in leadership skills and by advocating
for access and equity within higher education.
America is stronger when everyone is pull-
ing together. Through her devotion to oppor-
tunity and to diversity, to students as young as
16, to incorporating international students at
Skyline, Dr. Regina Stanback Stroud built a
solid foundation for the future prosperity of her
students and our community. Skyline College
is an exciting and adventurous community col-
lege because it reflects its leadership. I salute
Dr. Regina Stanback Stroud as she retires.
She will be remembered as a force of nature
at Skyline College because she dared to
dream big and she delivered.

HON. LIZ CHENEY
OF WYOMING
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Dr. Thomas Spicer on winning
the 2019 Wyoming Jefferson Award.
Dr. Spicer has shown sustained commit-
ment to his community for much of his life.
Serving as a medical doctor in the greater
Rock Springs area, Dr. Spicer has dedicated
himself to making a difference in Wyoming. I’d
like to thank Dr. Spicer for his service to our
state that goes far beyond the medical field
and has included serving on economic advi-
sory boards to the governor and has cul-
minated in his current position as a Trustee at
Western Wyoming Community College.
Again, Madam Speaker, I extend my con-
gratulations to Dr. Thomas Spicer on winning
the 2019 Wyoming Jefferson Award and I
thank him for his dedication to our community

CONGRATULATING RICHARD
SEIDLER ON HIS RETIREMENT
FROM UNITYPOINT HEALTH-
TRINITY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Richard Seidler for his retirement
from UnityPoint Health-Trinity as president and
Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Seidler has 37
years of leadership experience within the
health care industry.
Mr. Seidler received his MBA and BBA from
the University of Miami in Florida, and is
Board Certified in Health Care Management.
He is a Fellow in the American College of
Health Care Administrators and received the
Distinguished Service Award in 2011. Mr.
Seidler’s professional experience ranges from
Assistant Administrator, Chief Operating Offi-
cer and Chief Executive Officer when he was
in California. His vision and expertise have
driven the success of facility mergers, man-
aged care organizations, primary care group
acquisitions, market share and referral in-
creases, new partnerships with insurers and
the development of comprehensive outpatient
campuses and cardiovascular centers. Mr.
Seidler came to Trinity and the Quad-Cities in
2010 following twelve years leading Allen
Health System in Waterloo, Iowa. He also
serves on several boards and has shown a
continued dedication to the Quad-Cities com-
munity.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
Mr. Seidler that I am especially proud to serve
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Mr. Seidler on his retirement and
thank him for his service to the community.

HONORING THE ACCOMPLISH-

HON. JOE NEGUSE
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the numerous accomplishments of
Mr. Max Stein.
As a World War II Navy Veteran and long-
time Professor of Mathematics at Colorado
State University in my district, Mr. Stein knows
the meaning of hard work better than most.
Throughout his career, he worked tirelessly to
ensure that any students he came in contact
with understood the concepts they needed to
succeed. This was true whether he was teach-
ing World War II pilots how to use their radar
technology or instructing doctoral candidates
on how to defend their theses.
Mr. Stein has not only been a long-time role
model for his discipline, but for quality of char-
acter as well. As a husband, father, grand-
father, and great-grandfather, he ensures that
those around him understand how much he
treasured them. This devotion has also been
extended to the sports teams he tirelessly
cheers, powering through with them in the
good seasons and the bad. In addition to all
of this, Mr. Stein’s love for laughter has made

his community a happier place every time he
graces those around him with a smile.
In honor of his 100th birthday last month, I
believe it is only fair that we thank Mr. Stein
for being an example of what it means to be
an outstanding American. His dedication, char-
acter and good spirit has made the 2nd Con-
gressional District of Colorado a better place.
I am extremely proud to have the honor of
representing such a distinguished individual in
Congress and believe someone of his caliber
should be honored with the utmost respect.

BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN
‘‘ODIE’’ SLOCUM RETIREMENT
HON. ANDY LEVIN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the retirement of Briga-
dier General John ‘‘Odie’’ Slocum. Gen. Slo-
cum currently serves as the 127th Wing Com-
mander, Selfridge Air National Guard Base,
Michigan. He has announced his plans to re-
tire in May, closing another chapter in his 35-
year military career. General Slocum has con-
tinued the long tradition of excellence at
Selfridge ANGB, a Macomb County icon since
it opened in 1917, through his style of precise
but humble leadership. I recently had the
honor of visiting Selfridge ANGB, where I saw
firsthand the esteem in which Gen. Slocum is
held by the men and women with whom he
serves.
As commander, Gen. Slocum’s priority has
always been the members of the 127th Wing.
He worked tirelessly to keep them prepared
and safe as they engaged in important mis-
sions on behalf of The United States across
the world. His mandate as the top official at
Selfridge also extends beyond the Air National
Guard, as Selfridge ANGB hosts members
from more than 20 tenant units from all
branches of the military, the Coast Guard, and
Border Patrol.
During his tenure, Selfridge received numer-
ous awards including both the Carl A. Spaatz
Award and the Air Force Meritorious Unit
Award. These two awards emblemize the
dedication and capability of the 127th Wing
under Gen. Slocum, though he would give all
praise to those serving under him.
Outside of the gates of Selfridge, Gen. Slo-
cum has built a reputation as a community
leader and strong advocate for Macomb Coun-
ty. Through his leadership, county partners in-
cluding government and business delivered an
impassioned campaign to bring the F–35
Lightning to Selfridge. This campaign will be
the gold standard for all future attempts to
rally the community around a cause.
As a member of the House Committee on
Education and Labor, I also thank Gen. Slo-
cum for his support of the STARBASE pro-
gram. STARBASE provides elementary grade
students aviation themed math and science
education and is located on base. Without a
strong Selfridge, there would be no
STARBASE.
In closing, as Gen. Slocum ends his com-
mand at Selfridge, I encourage my colleagues
to join me in thanking him for his dedicated
service to the United States and to the people
of Michigan. Gen. Slocum has stated that he
is looking to stay and continue to work for all
of us in Macomb County, for which I am grate-
ful. I look forward to supporting him in his next
endeavor.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF CONRAD AND
HINKLE IN LEXINGTON, NORTH
CAROLINA
HON. TED BUDD
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Conrad and Hinkle in downtown
Lexington for their 100th year of business.
Founded in 1919 by Walter Conrad and E.
Odell Hinkle, this local business has remained
in the same location in Davidson County since
the beginning. If folks want locally grown
produce, cut to order meat, or friendly service,
Conrad and Hinkle is the place to go.
When you walk into Conrad and Hinkle, it’s
a step back into time. From the tin-ceilinged
rooms to the display signs, the store is truly
reminiscent of simpler times.
In Davidson County, residents know Conrad
and Hinkle for their rich and creamy pimento
cheese, which is a southern food staple. The
store began making pimento cheese in 1940
using Hinkle’s grandmother’s recipe. It’s so
popular that folks have ordered it from as far
away as Alaska and Germany. Furthermore,
they produce roughly 1,500 pounds a week
and 2,000 pounds a week during the holidays.
Whether you prefer pimento cheese on a
slice of bread, on a biscuit, or on a country to-
mato, there’s no doubt that Conrad and Hinkle
is a reputable supplier of pimento cheese in
Davidson County.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
celebrating Conrad and Hinkle’s 100th year of
business.

Over the past 21 years Donovan has dedi-

Donovan’s hard work and commitment to Cas-

TRIBUTE TO REVEREND ANDREW
B. WARNER
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Reverend Andrew B. Warner. He
is a pastor, social justice activist, devoted hus-
band and father. Reverend Warner is a grad-
uate of Harvard University with a Master of Di-
vinity Degree.
Reverend Warner is leaving his current post
as Senior Pastor of Plymouth Church United
Church of Christ on May 5, 2019. He served
in many pastoral capacities during his 22-year
tenure at Plymouth and was always attentive
to the care of his congregants throughout
times of both joy and grief. Under his guid-
ance, Plymouth embodied the spiritual practice
of ‘‘extravagant welcome’’ to the building, the
mind and the spirit. I have benefitted from and
borne witness to this extravagant welcome on
many occasions as both a visitor and preacher
at Plymouth Church.
Reverend Warner led a major capital cam-
paign and managed the remodel of the 100-
year-old edifice. The project received a May-
or’s Design Award in 2013 for honoring its his-
toric Eschweiler design while adapting to ac-
cessibility and technology needs.
Reverend Warner led Plymouth Church in
collaboration with other organizations on top-
ics such as racial justice, interfaith relations,
and the role of the arts in healing and forgive-
ness. I personally have participated in Plym-
outh’s tribute to the 50th Anniversary of the
Voting Rights Act, as well as a tribute to the
150th Anniversary of the 14th Amendment.
Reverend Warner created the Reviving Jus-
tice, Peace and Hope series of interfaith social
justice conferences held at Plymouth.
Following its remodel, Plymouth has opened
its doors to Congregation Shir Hadash. During
his tenure, Plymouth has also continued to
fully live out its Open and Affirming (ONA) sta-
tus through embrace of and advocacy for the
LGBTQ Community. In the spirit of cross-sec-
tional community building, Reverend Warner
has served on a number of boards including
Pathfinders, Cream City Foundation, and Ro-
tary Club of Milwaukee.
Reverend Andrew B. Warner now takes
leave of shepherding Plymouth to take on two
new roles in the wider United Church of
Christ. He will serve as Director of Develop-
ment for the Wisconsin Conference where he
will lead the fundraising efforts of the con-
ference to support the planned giving and ef-
fective philanthropy of congregations and work
to organize a foundation-based community
foundation model for the endowments of the
conference and congregations. He will also
serve as a Generosity Outreach Officer of the
national setting of the UCC. In that role he will
train, coach and mentor conference and con-
gregational leaders across the country to
strengthen the culture of generosity in the
UCC. As part of the work, he will teach as an
adjunct faculty member with the Lake Institute
of the School of Philanthropy at Indiana Uni-
versity-Purdue University, Indianapolis.
Reverend Andrew B. Warner is a truth faith
leader. I am proud that he resides in the 4th
Congressional District in the Village of White-
fish Bay with his husband and two sons—one

and practices his gastro-evangelism. I, along
with others in the Greater Milwaukee area and
Wisconsin, admire and thank Reverend War-
ner for his positive impact on all around him.
I am proud to call Andrew B. Warner my
friend. Madam Speaker, for these reasons I
rise to pay tribute to a man whose legacy as
a true leader will serve as a beacon for those
who assume his duties upon leaving Plymouth
Church.

NATIONAL ROOFING WEEK
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the National Roofing
Contractors Association headquartered in
Rosemont, Ill., and its efforts to designate the
week of June 2–8, 2019, as National Roofing
Week.
The roof is one of the most important com-
ponents of any home or business. It is the first
line of defense against natural elements, such
as rain, snow or wind, and yet it is often taken
for granted until it falls into disrepair. National
Roofing Week honors the thousands of roof-
ing-related businesses and workers across the
country, as well as the industry’s commitment
to public service. National Roofing Week is a
valuable reminder of the significance quality
roofing has on every home and business in
the U.S.
Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the na-
tion’s oldest trade associations and the voice
of professional roofing contractors worldwide.
NRCA has nearly 4,000 roofing company
members who represent the entire roofing
supply chain. Using its vast network of roofing
contractors and industry-related members,
NRCA is responsible for the installation of new
construction and replacement roof systems on
commercial and residential structures in Amer-
ica. Most of its members are small, privately
held businesses that provide family-sustaining
jobs for thousands of hardworking individuals
who are the backbone of our economy.
Professional roofing contractors provide vital
services to their communities, on and off the
clock. NRCA members will recognize National
Roofing Week June 2–8 by supporting numer-
ous charitable projects and employee training
programs throughout the nation. I commend
NRCA and the vital role the organization and
its members play in every community, and I
ask my colleagues to join me in acknowl-
edging their contributions during National
Roofing Week.

HONORING MS. CELESTE DRAKE
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Ms. Celeste Drake of the
AFL-CIO for her advocacy on behalf of hard-
working Americans.
Throughout her career, Ms. Drake has been
a champion for the American worker. Before
joining the AFL-CIO in 2011 as its Trade and
Globalization Policy Specialist, she worked as
a Legislative Director and Legislative Counsel
for Congresswoman LINDA SANCHEZ of Cali-
fornia and Congressman LLOYD DOGGETT of
Texas. Celeste was also a clerk on the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and served
as a member of the Advisory Committee of
the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Celeste has
brought immense value to every role she has
held throughout her career during her time in
Washington, D.C.
A former high school teacher, Ms. Drake
has dedicated her professional career to im-
proving the quality of life for middle-class
Americans. Now, she is returning to her home
state of California to work with the Directors
Guild of America.
I have had the pleasure of working closely
with her in the fight for fair trade. We worked
side by side to defeat the Trans-Pacific Part-
nership and thereby preventing the accelera-
tion of the outsourcing of good paying Amer-
ican manufacturing jobs and the undermining
of American workers’ wages. Now, with the re-
negotiated North Atlantic Free Trade Agree-
ment, Celeste has been essential again to en-
suring that we secure strong and enforceable
labor standards in the agreement. Her exper-
tise on trade policy and international law has
been a true asset for labor groups, advocacy
organizations, and countless members of Con-
gress and ultimately impacted the wage and
job security of hard-working Americans.
There are few advocates who are stronger
allies of the American worker or who have
done as much to fight for a trade system that
empowers them instead of enriching corpora-
tions. It is my honor and privilege today to rec-
ognize Celeste Drake for her hard work and
dedication, and to wish her the best of luck in
her new endeavor. She will be greatly missed.

CELEBRATING THE GOLDEN ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE MARTIN LU-
THER KING KITCHEN FOR THE
POOR
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the fifty years of service the Martin
Luther King Kitchen for the Poor has offered
to the most vulnerable of Toledo, Ohio’s citi-
zens. Our community joined the organization
in celebrating this milestone on Saturday, April
13, 2019 in the midst of the Easter Season.
In 1969, the late Reverend H.V. Savage, Sr.
established the Kitchen to address the extraor-
dinary need evident in his community. Located
in one of the oldest and poorest neighbor-
hoods in Toledo, the Kitchen for the Poor has
grown into an anchor of the community. Each
day, over 200 meals are served in a neighbor-
hood whose median income is $5,500 a year.
Though its primary service is feeding the hun-
gry through daily meals and groceries, meal
delivery, summer meals and holiday meals, it
also provides clothing, Christmas gifts, coun-
seling and support for its neighbors.
The stated mission of the Martin Luther King
Kitchen for the Poor is that, ‘‘We offer hope
and acceptance to those in need, keeping in
mind the dignity of all persons. We help any-
one who walks through our doors, regardless
of age, sex, religion, political beliefs or race.
We feed the homeless and those with low in-
comes. We provide hope where there seems
to be none.’’
Harvey Savage, Jr. has taken the mantle of
his father’s vision, serving the people food and
hope. Truly, since its inception, the Martin Lu-
ther King Kitchen for the Poor has lived
Christ’s message of Love described in Mat-
thew 25:40, ‘‘Whatsover you do to the least of
these my brothers, that you do unto Me.’’ We
congratulate the members and friends past
and present for fifty years of dedicated service
with dignity. Onward.

RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS
OF ISAAC PYLE AND EMMA
MUSTOWE, RECIPIENTS OF THE
WEST VIRGINIA GOLDEN HORSE-
SHOE AWARD
HON. CAROL D. MILLER
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize two of my constituents, Isaac Pyle and
Emma Mustowe, who each earned the West
Virginia Golden Horseshoe award.
The West Virginia Department of Education
describes the Golden Horseshoe award as
being ‘‘unique in its statewide recognition of
scholastic achievement.’’ The award is given
annually to two hundred and twenty-one 8th
grade students who have outscored their
classmates on a West Virginia history exam
and essay about West Virginia current events.
A minimum of two students from each county
and one student from the West Virginia
schools for the Deaf and Blind are selected for
the award. In a ceremony during Golden
Horseshoe Day, the state superintendent of
schools uses an antique sword to dub each
kneeling student either a lady or knight of the
Golden Horseshoe Society. This is arguably
one of the greatest awards of that school year
for 8th-grade students.
Soon to be knighted is Isaac Pyle of Web-
ster Springs. Isaac is the son of Jeremy Pyle
and Dr. Allison Pyle. An exceptional student,
Isaac is a captain of the West Virginia History
Bowl Team for Webster County High School.
As the winner of his school competition, he
has qualified four times for the state Math
Field Day and has qualified for the state spell-
ing bee. Isaac proudly maintains a 4.0 GPA
and is enrolled in advanced courses.
Emma Mustowe of Webster Springs will
also join the rolls as a Lady of the Golden
Horseshoe Society. The daughter of Tobby
and Janna Mustowe, Emma is a talented writ-
er and performer. She is a winner of the Web-
ster County Young Writers Competition. She is
a captain of the West Virginia History Bowl
Team for Webster County High School and a
winner in the Webster County Regional Lit-
erature Fair. Emma is also a member of the
award-winning Webster County High School
Showband.
As Congresswoman for the Third Congres-
sional District of the State of West Virginia, it
is my distinct honor to rise today to recognize
the dedication and achievement that Isaac
Pyle and Emma Mustowe have put forward in
winning the Golden Horseshoe award. I con-
gratulate them on being model students and
exemplary West Virginians.

Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise

Diane has been a leading pediatrician in
Contra Costa County for forty years, making it
her life’s work to protect the lives and health

HONORING THE LIFE OF FRANK
WILFRED MCCOY
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN
RADEWAGEN
OF AMERICAN SAMOA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Frank Wilfred
McCoy, a friend, a business leader in Amer-
ican Samoa, and a beloved family man. His
family wrote the following tribute to his life and
memory:
‘‘Frank Wilfred McCoy, 71, left us after a
battle with pancreatic cancer on February
5th, 2019, surrounded by family. Born on
April 7th, 1947 in Utulei, American Samoa to
Marie Henrietta Wulf, he is survived by his
loving wife, Edith Iliganoa, children Judith
Lynn McCoy, Jessica Liz Lafaele, Janice
Laumata Pele, Frank Wilfred Jr., and Doug-
las Aloysious, siblings Grace Laumata Allen,
Mary Horne, Ernest Bernard, and 19 grand-
children.
Frank attended Marist Brothers Elemen-
tary in Atu’u, American Samoa, and Long
Beach Polytechnic High School in Long
Beach, CA. He returned home to the islands
in 1970 to work for Van Camp Seafoods where
he met Edith. They were married on June 16,
1970, and set off once more for California.
Frank worked several years with Thums Oil
Company on oil rigs, in the oil fields, and the
Catalina Islands. He also owned a lawn-
mower repair shop, McCoy’s Lawnmower
Shop on Norwalk Boulevard in Hawaiian
Gardens.
In 1977, Frank, Edith, and family moved
back to American Samoa. After a stint with
Southwest Marine Railways and a few years
as a commercial fisherman, Frank started up
Harbor Refuse & Environmental Services,
Inc. (HRES Inc.) in 1985 and provided haz-
ardous waste response and clean-up and de-
bris removal from the Pago Pago Harbor.
HRES Inc. was a Coast Guard BOA con-
tractor and the only Mobile Waste Oil Recep-
tion Facility for many years. He was also
deputized as an officer by the Department of
Public Safety—Marine Patrol Division.
In 2001, Frank fulfilled his lifelong love of
fishing and started two additional compa-
nies: Northwest Fisheries and McCoy’s Ice-
house. Northwest Fisheries consisted of two
longline fishing vessels, F/V Northwest and
F/V Ali B, and one bottom fishing/trolling
vessel, F/V Leilani. He captained the voyages
to bring the F/V Northwest and F/V Ali B
from Washington and Hawaii to American
Samoa, respectively. McCoy’s Icehouse pro-
vided retail and commercial ice to local
stores and fisheries.
Frank was an influential leader and con-
tributor to the local fishery management
programs, including the Department of Ma-
rine & Wildlife Resources training programs
as well as the Sea Grant program. He also
served the larger Pacific fishery community
through his years of service with the West-
ern Pacific Fishery Management Council. He
was an active member from 1978 to 2007, and
held several posts—most notably as Chair-
man in 2006, and Council Vice-Chair in 2004
and 2005. He also Served as a member of the
Council’s Advisory Panel as Vice-Chair and
Pelagic Advisory Panel Chair in 2008.
In 2013, Frank and Edith moved to Gorman,
TX, and built a cabin out in the country. He
relished living ‘off the grid’, and built the
cabin to be self-sustaining with its own
power and water systems. His pond was his
pride and joy, and he spent many hours dur-
ing the dry season dredging it and preparing
it to be stocked.
Frank was a man of the highest character,
integrity, and spirit, and he was living proof
of the indomitable spirit of man. He brought
his dreams to life, time and time again. He
was truly a force of nature in his own right,
and he touched the lives of countless people
with his love, laughter, and light.
His memory lives on and burns brightly in
each and every one of us whose life he im-
pacted.
Rest in peace and love Dad, you are always
in our hearts!’’
Thank you (Soifua).

IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT
JONES
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Robert Jones the retiring Executive Di-
rector of EPA Can Do. This nonprofit commu-
nity development corporation located in East
Palo Alto has provided affordable housing, fi-
nancial readiness training, property manage-
ment, and homeownership evaluations for
thousands of residents since it was first estab-
lished in 1991. Robert Jones was a founding
member of this organization and in 2000
began as its Executive Director.
Robert was born in Warren Arkansas to
John and Odessa Jones. He has six sisters
and three brothers. As a child in Arkansas, he
grew up under a system of segregated
schools and public facilities, racism and Jim
Crow statutes that denied opportunity to Afri-
can Americans. In 1962, he and his family re-
located to California where they settled in
Pasadena. He ultimately obtained his AA de-
gree in Interior Design from Los Angeles City
College and a Bachelor’s in Psychology and
Master’s in Counselor Education from San
Jose State University.
His kind heart and strong mind led him to
counseling young people, and he eventually
worked with emotionally disturbed children,
and counseled them on career and vocational
decision making. By the 1990’s he was in-
volved in the field of affordable housing and
joined Eden Housing in Hayward to begin a
career as a project manager for affordable
housing projects. It was also during this time
that he joined with other neighborhood leaders
in East Palo Alto to found EPA Can Do, serv-
ing as its first Vice Chair and then, soon there-
after, rising to Chair.
Robert Jones worked closely with the City of
East Palo Alto to secure home ownership for
its residents. In 2002, EPA Can Do began to
refinance predatory loans in partnership with
Fannie Mae. This program was a forerunner to
the programs established after the Great Re-
cession in 2008. The Foreclosure Intervention
and Counseling Program established after the
meltdown counseled over 3,700 homeowners
from East Palo Alto and surrounding commu-
nities.
EPA Can Do has developed several
projects but remains in ownership of a 15-unit
development, Clarke Avenue Apartments. The
Light Tree Apartments exist as affordable units
in part because Robert Jones and EPA Can
Do facilitated their transfer to a financially
stronger owner, Eden Housing. Over the
course of a six-year period, Robert assembled
parcels along University Avenue and then ne-
gotiated a partnership which resulted in the
creation of 41 units at Serenity Senior Hous-
ing. This development was a twinkle in the
eye of Robert Jones and few thought that he
could turn it into reality, but he did. The reality
of Robert’s career in housing development is
350 units of permanently affordable housing
across several jurisdictions.
Robert Jones presently serves as the Vice
Chairman of the Menlo Park Fire Protection
District and also participates in numerous vol-
unteer positions in East Palo Alto, including as
a CERT volunteer. Throughout his life in East
Palo Alto, he participated in many committees
to improve the quality of life of residents, in-
cluding committees focused on anti-drug ef-
forts, improving childcare, economic develop-
ment, and the East Palo Alto Senior Center
Board of Directors.
When the history of East Palo Alto in the
modern era is reviewed, Robert Jones will be
understood to be at the center of many posi-
tive changes in this remarkable community.
East Palo Alto is filled with hard working, lov-
ing people who wish the best for their families,
their neighbors and their city. Over decades,
Robert Jones has worked to turn the wishes of
these amazing residents into opportunity. As
he retires from a financially sound EPA Can
Do, we know that he will remain involved in
building his city’s civic spirit. We wish Robert
Jones all the best in his retirement. He may
no longer be at the center of all the initiatives
that will shape East Palo Alto, but he will re-
main in the hearts of his neighbors for many
years to come.

OF PRIVATE FIRST CLASS
CHARLES D. BREWER
HON. JAMES COMER
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, today I rise
to honor the life and legacy of Private First
Class Charles D. Brewer, an American hero
and exemplary public servant.
Charles D. Brewer was born on August 16,
1923 in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. A
Calloway County native, he enlisted in the
United States Army on February 23, 1943 at
the age of 20, during the height of the second
World War.
He trained at Camp Atterbury, Indiana and
received a combat infantry badge along with
rifle expert qualification.
Private Brewer Shipped overseas with Com-
pany K of the 120th infantry. He contributed to
the war effort as a truck driver, transporting
light supply loads. Brewer valiantly served on
several campaigns in the European theater in-
cluding Normandy, Northern France, Rhine-
land, and Ardennes. Although he suffered
wounds in action, Brewer recovered to join the
Allies in celebrating the epic defeat over the
Axis forces. His valance earned him two
Bronze Stars, a Purple Heart, and a Good
Conduct Ribbon. On November 17, 1945 he
was honorably discharged and rejoined civilian
life.
I am honored to recognize Private Charles
D. Brewer and his great contributions to the
1st District of Kentucky and the American war
effort. His many decorations represent the ex-
traordinary sacrifice and bravery of heroes like
Private Brewer. Today, I join this Calloway
County native’s family and friends in cele-
brating his legacy and honoring his noble
service to our nation.

Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Victoria ‘‘Tori’’ Martin
and her accomplishment of earning one gold
medal and two silver medals at the Special
Olympics World Games.
A 25-year-old woman from our local
Woodbridge, VA represented the USA Team

Games held in the United Arab Emirates this
year. Through her hard work and dedication,
Tori earned two silver medals in the 100m in-
dividual medley and the 200m freestyle, and a
gold medal in the 100m breaststroke, with a
winning time of 1:35:99.
Tori began swimming at the age of two and
has been reaching new goals ever since. Tori
comes from a family of athletes and was
raised to be a team player. She encourages
her teammates even when it means finishing
behind them. Tori trains five to six days a
week and believes that everyone can create
their own path and open new doors for them-
selves. Tori is an avid swimmer with unrelent-
ing passion and ambition.
Tori did an incredible job representing the
United States in the Special Olympic World
games and the U.S. is lucky to have her as a
team member. We can all expect to see great
things in the future from Tori.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in

tin at the Special Olympics World Games.

PEMBROKE ACADEMY’S
BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION
HON. ANN M. KUSTER
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Pembroke
Academy in Pembroke, New Hampshire on
the Academy’s 200th birthday. Pembroke
Academy serves residents in the Towns of
Pembroke, as well as Allenstown, Chichester
and Epsom.
Since its founding in 1818, Pembroke Acad-
emy has a rich history and tradition. Pembroke
Academy was founded after Dr. Abel Blan-
chard left funds to a board of trustees upon
his death to build the school ‘‘for the purpose
of improving the rising generation in science,
morality and religion’’. The community remem-
bers headmasters from Isaac Walker, who
was the longest serving, to Bill Marston, who
was the leader of ‘‘P.A.’’ when it became a
public school.
As part of the ongoing bicentennial celebra-
tion, Pembroke Academy will announce its first
class of alumni honorees into its new Athletic
Hall of Fame and Performing Arts Hall of
Fame. The concept is to expand the Acad-
emy’s current Wall of Fame in the school cafe-
teria to have a designated area to best honor
the contributions of alumni who have had a
unique impact on the Pembroke community.
Several athletes and faculty are included as
honorees.
For the past year, the Town of Pembroke
began a celebration of ‘‘P.A.’’ and on Satur-
day, May 11, 2019, the community will gather
to officially recognize this significant milestone
in Pembroke history. This celebration marks a
true distinction for the Town of Pembroke and
all of Pembroke Academy’s generations of
graduates.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s Second Congressional District, con-
gratulations to the Pembroke Academy com-
munity for 200 years and all the best in the
years to come.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF AUNT CORD’S HISTORIC
VOTE
HON. MARK E. GREEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, Mary Cordelia Beasley Hudson, affection-
ately known as Aunt Cord, was the very first
woman to ever vote in the state of Tennessee.
Legend has it that Aunt Cord got up extra
early on April 22, 1919, 100 years ago now,
to be the first in line to cast her ballot at the
courthouse in the city of Camden. She hurried
down the half mile from her home through
town along what is now South Forrest Avenue
to Court Square to wait for the courthouse to
open. She must have been excited. Just days
before, the Tennessee legislature had passed
a measure making it legal for women to vote.
We remember Aunt Cord as a participant in a
suffragette movement that forever changed
our beloved United States. Just over one year
later, Congress and the states ratified the 19th
Amendment in August 1920, bringing us one
step further toward realizing our Founding
principle that all are created equal. I am proud
to honor Aunt Cord and reflect on Ten-
nessee’s history today.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND
LEGACY OF CLYDE SCOLES
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize that during the Spring season of
new life our community came together to me-
morialize the life’s work of Clyde Scoles, direc-
tor of the Toledo Lucas County Public Library.
Unexpectedly passed from this life on Feb-
ruary 15, his colleagues and community eulo-
gized him on Saturday April 13 in a special
ceremony at the new home of Toledo’s Mott
Branch Library.
Friend and mentor to thousands of people
of all ages, he worked creatively and tirelessly
to advance our library system in Toledo and
Lucas County to be the heartbeat of learning
for people of all ages and backgrounds re-
gardless of income or circumstance. His gen-
tlemanly and learned demeanor drew people
to him and he advanced the cause of learning
for everyone across our region. What a privi-
lege it has been to know him and to work with
him as he drove learning and community
down to the neighborhood level.
The Columbus Dispatch, Mr. Scoles’ home-
town newspaper, and the Toledo Blade, his
adopted home’s newspaper, encapsulated his
life thusly:
‘‘Clyde Scoles, passed away, unexpectedly
on Friday, February 15, 2019 at the age of 69.
Originally from Columbus, Ohio, he and his
family have lived in the Toledo area since
1978. Hard working and conscientious, Clyde
focused his energies on serving the people of
Lucas County, Ohio. Tirelessly, first as Asso-
ciate Director and then as the Director of
TLCPL, he continued the work of previous
visionary Library directors to broaden con-
sensus and build community outreach. By
renovating the Main Library, his goal was to
bring 21st Century function and capabilities
to an already outstanding resource. Mr.
Scoles was a distinguished leader of the com-
munity and well known throughout the area,
accumulating many awards for his contribu-
tions and service to the Lucas County public.
He was also a well known and respected pro-
fessional throughout the Library world. His
experience and participation in local, state
and national Library events will be missed.
But it is by his family that he will be most
missed. His love for them was foremost al-
ways in his mind and heart and will remain
with them forever. He is survived by numer-
ous family and friends.’’
Clyde Scoles was a library champion,
guardian of literacy, passionate leader, friend
and mentor to many. The premiere Toledo
Lucas County Library system is his legacy to
our community and the world, opening up
dreams and pathways to people young and
old. In this time of rebirth and new beginnings,
we celebrate this remarkable man and the
catalogue of his life. To his family and friends
carrying forward following his unexpected
passing, we wish peace and comfort as we re-
member Clyde Scoles’ extraordinary gifts.
As the new Mott Branch Library is dedicated
I cannot help but think that future generations
will wonder and admire the structure and think
about those who dedicated their lives to the
advancement of a free people.

HONOR FLIGHT OF CENTRAL
OREGON
HON. GREG WALDEN
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the one World War II veteran and
twenty-four Korean War veterans from Oregon
who are visiting their memorials on the Na-
tional Mall on Thursday, May 2, 2019, through
Honor Flight of Central Oregon. Every time I
have the chance to meet one of these heroes,
I am reminded of the poignant words of Gen-
eral Dwight D. Eisenhower. In a message to
Allied troops just before D-Day, he said, ‘‘The
eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes
and prayers of liberty-loving people every-
where march with you.’’
He was right then, of course, Madam
Speaker. But over seventy years later, liberty-
loving people everywhere continue to owe
these heroes for their extraordinary service
and their incredible stories of sacrifice and
bravery on behalf of our country. That’s why it
is my privilege to enter their names into the
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD today.
The veterans on this Honor Flight from Or-
egon are as follows: Norman Coffelt, Army;
Charles Cole, Navy; Stanley Cunningham,
Navy; Ralph Emerson, Jr., Army National
Guard; Leonard Glenn, Jr., Navy; Robert Gor-
don, Air Force; Dean Griffin, Air Force; Robert
Hall, Army; Emmitt Hussey, Navy; Glenn
Hutchinson, Jr., Navy; Raymond Kjolso, Navy;
Melvin Lemmon, Air Force; Harold Marken,
Army; Joe Martin, Air Force; Ronald Miller,
Navy; Rolf Moller, Coast Guard; Philip Mur-
phy, Army; Barbara Murphy, Army; Vernon
Nance, Navy; Richard Reeve, Army; Kenneth
Stevens, Army; Gene Todd, Air Force; Donald
Van Cleve, Jr., Marine Corp; James Walker,
Navy; and Ervin Wesenberg, Navy.
These twenty-five heroes join over 200,000
veterans who have been honored through the
Honor Flight Network of volunteers nationwide
since 2005.
I would also like to recognize the eight
guardians traveling on this trip who have also
served our country: Gregory Cole, Navy; Clin-
ton McAuliffe, Jr., Navy; Aidan McGowan,
Army National Guard; Kelly Nance, Army;
Dane Prevatt, Marine Corp; Vaughn Robinson,
Army National Guard; Colben Sime, Jr., Ma-
rine Corp; and Darrell Walz, Army.
Madam Speaker, at the height of the Civil
War in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln
wrote, ‘‘Honor to the Soldier, and Sailor every-
where, who bravely bears his country’s
cause.’’ Each of us in this chamber and in this
nation should be humbled by the courage of
these brave veterans who put themselves in
harm’s way for our country and way of life. As
a nation, we can never fully repay the debt of
gratitude owed to them for their honor, com-
mitment, and sacrifice in defense of the free-
doms we have today.
My colleagues, please join me in thanking
these veterans and the volunteers of Honor
Flight of Central Oregon for their exemplary
dedication and service to this great country.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF MR.
HENRY BLOCH
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the memory of Mr. Henry
Bloch, the philanthropist, businessman, and
beloved man who has helped shape Kansas
City into the city that it has become. In life, Mr.
Bloch carried a visionary spirit that trans-
formed and encouraged the lives of everyone
he met, including myself. Mr. Bloch’s life and
work are cherished and celebrated both in our
Fifth Congressional District of Missouri and
throughout the country.
Mr. Bloch was born ninety-six years ago, in
1922, to an ambitious and hardworking mother
and father in Kansas City, Missouri. From a
young age, his family instilled within him a
passion not only to excel individually, but for
the good of all. Creating his own business
model years later, Mr. Bloch always stayed
true to this idea, doing his part to encourage
startup businesses and individuals around the
country to flourish. Growing up in a Jewish
family that experienced firsthand the negative
effects of discrimination, Mr. Bloch cultivated a
spirit of kinship with others who had faced
similar struggles. His dedication to Kansas
City was evident in his own words when he
thanked the city for all it had meant to him and
his family. This week, the city joins together to
celebrate their memories of Mr. Bloch and the
resounding impact he made upon their lives.
Testimonies of the ways in which Mr. Bloch
impacted and touched the lives of so many
have poured forth in recent days as Kansas
Citians speak of how blessed they were to
have met and known this remarkable man.
Mr. Henry Bloch possessed an incredible
spirit of determination and conviction. As a
young man in the Army Air Corp during World
War II, Mr. Bloch flew many missions on be-
half of his country. After returning from the
war, he opened a small business with his
older brother, often working without pay so
they could have enough money to pay the
business’s rent. Today, Mr. Bloch’s business
encompasses 12,000 offices around the coun-
try and employs around 70,000 employees na-
tionwide. Mr. Bloch would often speak of luck
and the fortunate opportunities he and his
brother were given, forgetting to account for
the long hours and sleepless nights that he
put in without complaint during the early days
of their business. Once H&R Block grew larger
and more influential, this enabled Mr. Bloch to
begin the true passion of his life—philan-
thropy.
A quiet and soft-spoken man, Mr. Bloch
nonetheless commanded each room he
walked into. The spirit of generosity that Mr.
Bloch personified can be seen through his in-
credible legacies across the city and in the
lives of so many who bear testament to it.
Today, the Henry W. Bloch School of Manage-
ment at the University of Missouri-Kansas City
and the beautiful Bloch buildings of the Nel-
son-Atkins Museum of Art both stand as some
of the notable contributions Mr. Bloch made to
Kansas City. Through these institutions,
among other gifts, Mr. Bloch’s mark on Kan-
sas City will continue to positively impact lives
for years to come. The Bloch family fittingly
continues the spirit of his generosity as they
ask that all condolence contributions go to the
institutions and programs that meant so much
to him and to our community.
Madam Speaker, please join me, Missouri’s
Fifth Congressional District, and citizens
across the nation in honoring Mr. Henry
Bloch’s life and his commitment to the better-
ment of his city. It is with love and respect that
I share my deepest condolences and sincere
gratitude for all that Mr. Bloch meant to me
and the district that I serve. May he rest in
heavenly peace.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF GREEN
BAY BROADWAY
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 100th anniversary of
Green Bay Broadway, a factory that is owned
and operated by Georgia-Pacific in Green
Bay, Wisconsin.
In Wisconsin, we’re best known for our
cheese. But we also produce several other
world class products. In the Eighth District,
this includes paper.
For many years, the paper industry has
been a leading industry in our state, where
trees and energy are abundant. Even today,
Wisconsin produces more paper than any
other state.
In 1919, a man by the name of A.E. Cofrin
founded Fort Howard Paper Company along
the Fox River in Green Bay. While Fort How-
ard Paper Company has changed hands three
times since its founding, the factory, now
called Green Bay Broadway, has always kept
its machines running.
As the plant changed hands, it has also
modernized its operations. Throughout its
changes in ownership, however, this mill,
along with its workers, maintained its founding
values of producing ‘‘elegant yet affordable’’
products.
In 2000, Georgia-Pacific purchased the mill
with the goal of keeping that mission in mind.
And as of today, this factory will be celebrating
its 100th year of operation. This is a milestone
achievement for any business, and particularly
commendable given the changes this factory
has undergone.
So, on behalf of the Eighth District of Wis-
consin, I want to say congratulations to the
generations of families who have worked at
1919 South Broadway Street in Green Bay,
and to Georgia-Pacific for maintaining this fac-
tory’s operations into its 100th anniversary.
CONGRATULATIONS GARRETT
FORD
HON. TROY BALDERSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize an incredible feat by a re-
markable young athlete from Licking County,
Ohio.
Garrett Ford, of Pataskala, began lifting
weights just a few years ago, and it didn’t take
long for his family and friends to notice his af-
finity for the sport. As time went on, Garrett
continued to work at the sport, lifting heavier
and heavier weights, all the while bulking up
and fine-tuning his skills.
His passion for lifting took him outside the
CrossFit gym last July, when he competed in
the Ohio Special Olympics 2018 Summer
Games, then was flown to Seattle to compete
in the Special Olympics 2018 USA Games.
After accumulating medals and victories along
the way, Garrett flew halfway around the world
last month to represent Licking County in the
Special Olympics World Summer Games in
Abu Dhabi. There, he won four gold medals
for his performance, sweeping in his weight
class in four powerlifting categories: deadlift,
squat, bench, and combined.
With his victories, Garrett, who was diag-
nosed with autism as a child, has achieved
something extraordinary. I know I speak for
everyone in Licking County when I say we are
honored that he represented us in the World
Summer Games—the first person to ever rep-
resent our county in such.
Garrett’s story sets an example for all of
us—one of courage, determination, and be-
lieving in oneself. You see, he’ll be the first
person to tell you exactly how he wants to im-
prove his performance. He constantly pushes
himself to be better, never settling for less-
than. At the same time, he doesn’t get nerv-
ous. He doesn’t take pity for what others may
perceive as a disability. His steady persever-
ance and internal drive have pushed Garrett to
extraordinary, global heights, and I’m confident
that this won’t be the last we’re hearing of
him.
I thank Garrett Ford for bringing honor to
Licking County, Ohio, and in turn I honor him
for his incredible record of achievements.

HONORING THE ANCHORAGE
NORTH STARS U16 HOCKEY TEAM
AS NATIONAL CHAMPIONS
HON. DON YOUNG
OF ALASKA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and congratulate our Anchorage
North Stars U16 Tier II hockey team for their
2019 USA Hockey National Championship win
at the end to their hard-fought season.
A 3–2 loss to the McKinney North Stars ear-
lier in the Tournament could not discourage
these young men from Anchorage. They quali-
fied for the championship bracket, and ad-
vanced to the Championship game, where
they once again faced the McKinney North
Stars. With just 50 seconds left, Anchorage’s

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E502 April 29, 2019
Hayden Fox notched the winning goal off a
Tucker Lien assist to come from behind to win
the game. I have not seen a team from the
State of Alaska win the boys’ National Cham-
pionship at the U16 age group in more than
20 years, and I can’t begin to say how im-
mensely proud I am of this team.
Victory in hockey is a team effort, and so I
would like to recognize the players and staff of
this team individually for their hard work and
dedication this season. Our 2019 Anchorage
North Stars U16 Championship players are
Jarett Beckett, Peter Flannery Schutt, Colten
Gerken Roberto, Jakub Hall, Tyler Huffer, Olin
Kelliher, Tucker Lien, Spencer Lund, Revelin
Mack, Cullen McCormick, Garret Miknich,
Trevor Monahan, Logan Orr, Alexander Pavia,
Teague Porter, Landen Reed, Drake Reid,
Joshua Tyra, and the winning goal scorer,
Hayden Fox. The 2019 Anchorage North Stars
National Championship team is led by Head
Coach Matt Thompson, Assistant Coaches
Austin King, Graham McManamin, and Kory
Roy, Team Manager Katie Hulse, and Presi-
dent Barrett Heisten.
Madam Speaker, it gives me great pride to
celebrate the achievements of our young peo-
ple in Alaska. Hockey teaches young Alaskans
the value of practice and hard work, and there
is no better reward for a season’s worth of
training than overcoming all obstacles in your
way to secure a championship. The other
teams in the 2019 USA Hockey U–16 National
Championship deserve their recognition as
well, especially the McKinney North Stars,
who gave Anchorage as tough of a champion-
ship game as they could’ve asked for. I see it
only fitting that these young men be recog-
nized not only by their home state, but by this
Congress, on their achievement. I think I
speak for all of Alaska when I say congratula-
tions on their victory.
