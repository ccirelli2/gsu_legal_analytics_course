DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on

MADE IN AMERICA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, one of the
biggest lessons that the COVID–19 pan-
demic has taught us is the importance
of the phrase ‘‘Made in America.’’
In my home State of North Carolina,
we are a national leader in textile man-
ufacturing, and we have a rich history
of producing high-quality products.
That is why North Carolina has been at
the forefront of helping our first re-
sponders and frontline medical per-
sonnel get the protective equipment
that they need to effectively battle the
virus.
For these reasons, I want to see our
protective equipment made in the
United States and not in a country
controlled by the Chinese Communist
Party.
For the last two decades, most ob-
servers have predicted that either the
United States or China will lead the
world in the 21st century. In the early
2000s, we saw China as a friendly com-
petitor that we could work with eco-
nomically. However, in recent years,
the actions of the Chinese Communist
Party have revealed the true colors of
an authoritarian force. They are not
our friends, and they are not a force for
good in this world.
Given the fact that it was China that
mishandled the virus, and China that
allowed it to spread, and China that
lied to the world about it, how accept-
able is it that the American people
should be reliant on China for the es-
sential personal protective equipment
that we need to fight the virus? That
would be like having to beg the arson-
ist to help you put out the fire that
they started.
That is why I introduced the Make
PPP in America Act, along with Con-
gresswoman Jan Schakowsky. This bi-
partisan legislation requires the De-
fense Logistics Agency to issue longer
term contracts to make personal pro-
tective equipment in the United
States.
We have to boost our domestic supply
chains and make sure our most impor-
tant products come from our shores
and not from our adversaries like Com-
munist China.
Bottom line, we need to ensure that
Made in America is more than just a
slogan. Made in America needs to be a
guiding principle as we move into the
2020s and beyond.
ESTABLISHING A DEPARTMENT OF
RECONCILIATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise,
Mr. Speaker, in the name of liberty and
justice for all. I rise to call to our at-
tention that we saw last night evidence
of what happens when one party comes
to debate and another party comes to
disrupt.
We saw a President who did any and
everything that he could to avoid de-
bating. And we saw a Vice President
who did any and everything that he
could to debate.
But something more important hap-
pened than the disruption. We saw a
President who refused to denounce
white supremacy and the supremacists.
This is not the first time this has hap-
pened. A President who refuses to de-
nounce white supremacy and white su-
premacists should not hold office.
Mr. Speaker, I was proud of the Vice
President. He indicated that the Presi-
dent of the United States is a racist.
Some things bear repeating: The Vice
President, former Vice President, indi-
cated that the current President is a
racist.
By the way, he is not the first person
to say so. Many members of the leader-
ship of the House have said so. Other
prominent Americans have said so. So
it should not surprise anyone that the
RECORD should reflect what has been
said.
The Vice President went on to say
that he wants to do something about
racism in this country. That, if elected,
he will convene a meeting of persons,
prominent persons, law enforcement,
and others, to do something about rac-
ism, and I am going to add systemic
racism.
I believe that the Vice President’s
heart is in the right place, but I also
know that convening is not enough.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5058 September 30, 2020
Mr. Vice President, whom I happen
to like very much, convening is not
enough.
It is time for us to turn the talking
points associated with racism into ac-
tion items, and we have done much of
that here on the Hill. But there is one
thing that we need to do that we have
not done in this country that goes back
to 1619, and that is, we have not rec-
onciled. We have not reconciled the dif-
ferences that we have, the racial dif-
ferences. It is time for reconciliation.
To turn this talking point into an ac-
tion item, Mr. Vice President, I beg
that you would establish a department
of reconciliation with a secretary of
reconciliation who wakes up every
morning with the job of eliminating in-
vidious discrimination in all of its
forms in this country.
It is time for us to deal forthrightly,
to deal in an open and notorious man-
ner, with racism and invidious dis-
crimination in this country in all of its
various forms.
It is time, Mr. Vice President. You
are the man. You are the man in the
sense that you are the man running for
President as the nominee of the Demo-
cratic Party. In that sense, you are the
person to be more appropriate who can
make this happen.
We saw a President declare a war on
poverty, President Johnson. It is time
to declare a war on racism. It is time
to end what we are seeing occurring al-
most on a weekly basis in this country
to African Americans, minorities, and
women. It is time to have a department
of reconciliation.
To this end, I will send the Vice
President a letter asking him to con-
sider a department of reconciliation.
To talk about it is not enough. We
have to have the action item.
There are many other things that
can be done. I don’t oppose a task
force. I don’t oppose opportunities to
look at other forms of reconciliation.
But a department of reconciliation is
the means by which we can formalize
and actualize reconciliation in this
country.
It won’t be easy, and it won’t happen
right away, which is why we need the
department of reconciliation. Call it
anything that you want, as long as it is
about reconciliation.
I will contact you, Mr. President.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
PUTTING AN END TO POLITICAL
ROBOCALLS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, we are in the height of
robocall season, and the American peo-
ple are beyond fed up.
The recent 6–3 ruling by the Supreme
Court that upholds a Federal ban on
robocalls warrants a serious conversa-
tion that is long overdue.
Under the 1991 Telephone Consumer
Protection Act, TCPA, prerecorded
voice messages and the use of auto-
matic dialing systems were effectively
banned. The prevailing argument was
that the American people would no
longer face intrusive nuisances that we
have now come to recognize as
robocalls.
In retrospect, the TCPA was a novel
endeavor, but the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2015 introduced setbacks that
compromised the progress that had
been achieved in the fight against
robocalls. Debt collectors received a
special carve-out that allowed them to
place automatic calls to Americans
who owed money to the Federal Gov-
ernment.
Though the Supreme Court elimi-
nated this carve-out on the basis that
it was a violation of the First Amend-
ment, bountiful opportunities to enact
meaningful reform remain on the hori-
zon.
Unwanted robocalls have become the
bane of many, and with phones ringing
off the hook in households across the
country, Americans are wondering
when they will get a reprieve from
these nuisances. Imagine you are sit-
ting down for dinner with your family,
and within seconds of the meal start-
ing, your phone begins ringing. It is
yet another robocall.
Now, magnify the scene to house-
holds across the country. It is an en-
raging scenario that all of us have been
affected by, but I have a blueprint that
can set things right.
Since 2005, I have introduced the
Robo Calls Off Phones Act, legislation
that directs the FTC to revise its regu-
lation for the National Do Not Call
Registry and allows politically ori-
ented messages to be added to that list.
In fact, the genesis for this legisla-
tion came from my constituents. Many
were livid that they had been
bombarded with unwanted calls during
the 2004 election year. They demanded
that Congress act to end these
nuisances, and I took it upon myself to
carry the mantle.
Ever since I have reintroduced this
legislation to address the cyclical
issue, and I remain adamant that Con-
gress must address this immediately.
For years, politicians in Washington
have told their constituents that they
would fight against robocalls. Now it is
time to hold ourselves to account and
be part of the solution.
H.R. 805, the bipartisan Robo COP
Act, is the vessel by which we can
achieve meaningful reform.
The simple truth is that no American
is immune to receiving robocalls. It is
becoming a nagging problem that has
evolved to the point where we now be-
lieve it is commonplace to receive
them at any point during the day.
The answer to this problem is right
before our very eyes, and Congress
finds itself in an opportune moment to
enact meaningful reforms that have
been overlooked for far too long.
RECOGNIZING THE DIOL FAMILY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Colorado (Mr. CROW) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, in the early
morning hours of August 5, five Sen-
egalese immigrants, including an in-
fant and a toddler, died in an arson fire
in their Denver home. The victims de-
serve to be recognized.
Djibril Diol, who was 30 years old,
immigrated to the United States from
Senegal 10 years ago to make a better
life for himself and his family. He grad-
uated from Colorado State University
with a degree in civil engineering and
was an outstanding student with a
bright future ahead of him.
He was well loved by his family and
friends. His brother described him as
‘‘a good person, a good worker, and a
good Muslim.’’ A coworker said that
Djibril ‘‘was a way better man than I
will ever be.’’
Djibril’s wife, Adja, and 2-year-old
daughter, Khadija, also died in the fire,
as did Coumba Diol Hassan, Djibril’s
sister, and Hawa Beye, her 10-month-
old son.
We don’t know what motivated this
attack, but it has deeply shaken our
African immigrant community and left
them feeling unsafe. While this was a
tragic incident, and we mourn for the
family, I want to emphasize the
strength and resilience of our African
immigrant community.
As a case in point, the African Lead-
ership Group, ALG, a local nonprofit
that provides a wide variety of vital
services to our immigrant neighbors,
has consoled and supported the Diol
family and kept pressure on law en-
forcement to solve this horrific crime.
Led by Papa Dia, who is a native of
Senegal himself, I thank them for their
service.
RECOGNIZING STANLEY MARKETPLACE
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, it is my
honor today to recognize the accom-
plishments of Stanley Marketplace, a
community-focused urban market in
Aurora, Colorado.
Located in northwest Aurora on the
border of Denver’s Central Park neigh-
borhood, Stanley Marketplace is a
community of businesses and people
who believe in doing things dif-
ferently—sustainably, creatively, and
with more than the bottom line in
mind.
The marketplace’s 22-acre site was
once the site of the Stanley Aviation
factory. It is now a community gath-
ering place, home to 50 independently
owned Colorado businesses.
Today, the same innovative spirit
that once filled Stanley’s building has
been harnessed to offer our community
an urban marketplace featuring goods
and services from local independent
businesses.
The property includes a 30,000-square-
foot sustainable greenhouse and an
urban farm. Under construction is an
inclusive playground where children of
all abilities can play.

During the pandemic, the Stanley
Marketplace team has gone above and
beyond to support its community of
small business owners, helping them
weather the continued challenges of
COVID–19.
Stanley Marketplace is guided by a
document they call the Stanifesto,
which includes these lines:
We believe the best rules are simple and
clear: Love your neighbor. Leave each place
better than you found it. Be good and do
good.
I congratulate the Stanley team on
their ongoing work to support our
neighbors and locally owned small
businesses.
HONORING THE TIRELESS WORKERS IN COLORADO
DURING THE 2020 CENSUS
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, it is my
honor today to recognize the accom-
plishments of organizations in my dis-
trict that have worked tirelessly to
promote and ensure their communities
are counted in the 2020 Census.
With over 800,000 citizens and 160 lan-
guages spoken in my district, making
sure that every single resident is
counted is difficult work. With the help
of many hardworking organizations,
Colorado’s Sixth District has a self-re-
sponse rate of 76.5 percent, surpassing
its 2010 rate and surpassing the State
average of 69.5 percent. In fact, it holds
the highest response rate of any Colo-
rado congressional district.
I would particularly like to acknowl-
edge the following 11 organizations for
their help in spreading awareness: To-
gether We Count, the Asian Pacific De-
velopment Center, the Oromo Commu-
nity of Colorado, The ARC of Aurora,
the Aurora Economic Opportunity Coa-
lition, the Mosaic Church of Aurora,
the African Chamber of Commerce in
Colorado, the Village Exchange Center,
the City of Aurora, Arapahoe County,
and Mi Pueblo Market.
These organizations truly make a dif-
ference in my district for their tireless
work in the 2020 Census.
HONORING MARY HODGE ON HER RETIREMENT
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, it is my
honor today to recognize the accom-
plishments of Mrs. Mary Hodge, a
former State legislator and current
Adams County commissioner, and con-
gratulate her on her upcoming retire-
ment.
Commissioner Hodge is a Colorado
native, who has dedicated her career to
making an impact in her home State.
Mary, among many things, is a former
State representative in the Sixth Dis-
trict of Colorado and a county commis-
sioner. Mary has also taught first
grade in Greeley and preschool in Glen-
wood Springs.
Mary went on to own and operate a
motel in Wyoming and worked for sev-
eral businesses. Her public service
began in 2000, when she was elected as
a Colorado State representative.
As a servant leader, Commissioner
Hodge is a tireless champion for edu-
cation and small businesses. I com-
mend Mary for her support for the Col-
orado Air and Space Port. Her stead-
fast advocacy was integral in bringing
that project to fruition.
Commissioner Hodge’s diverse profes-
sional background and leadership expe-
rience has benefited our community for
many years.
I congratulate Commissioner Mary
Hodge on her retirement and thank her
for her service to our community and
to Adams County.
f
ESSENTIAL MEDICAL INNOVATION
AND MANUFACTURING MUST
COME HOME TO AMERICA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, in 2020, America is facing sig-
nificant threats to our health, to our
values, and to our national security.
The Chinese Communist Party has at-
tempted to exert control over every
facet of America’s economy and indus-
try, and even our health and safety.
The coronavirus has exposed that
much of America’s medical supply
chain, as it currently stands, runs di-
rectly through China. This should con-
cern every American. Why would we
trust a regime that lies about a pan-
demic to control our access to
healthcare?
As a physician, I have long been con-
cerned about the Chinese Communist
Government’s near monopoly on the
manufacturing of generic medicines.
And that threat doesn’t stop there. We
cannot allow the Chinese Communist
Party to control our access to prescrip-
tion drugs and the vital materials that
are used in healthcare equipment, not
to mention PPE.
For the sake of American patients
and our national security, we must cor-
rect course and return the essential
medical innovation and manufacturing
home to America and away from this
hostile regime.
For months, the China Task Force
has been working to identify realistic
and achievable solutions to secure our
medical supply chain and ensure that
Americans are never beholden to the
Chinese Communist Party for our
medicines and for our healthcare
equipment. We are taking a com-
prehensive approach to end America’s
reliance on China and bring jobs home
to America.
Our supply chain challenges extend
beyond the healthcare regime. From
technology to manufacturing, too
many materials that we rely on every
day are sourced from China.
Earlier this year, I introduced legis-
lation that seeks to end America’s de-
pendence on China for rare earth ele-
ments and other critical minerals—
these are essential, and they are used
in the manufacturing of medical sup-
plies, defense technology, and high-
tech products—by establishing a supply
chain for these materials here in the
United States. It is important for our
survival into the upcoming technology
advancements that our country is so
dependent on. It also requires the De-
partment of Defense to source these
materials from America.
Pennsylvania, my home, is home to a
dedicated and highly skilled workforce,
and I am working on a plan to
incentivize companies to bring their
research, the development, and the pro-
duction of materials back home.
As President Trump said earlier this
month: ‘‘We want to build factories in
Baltimore, not Beijing. We want to
make our products in Chicago, not
Shanghai.’’ And, I might add, we want
to make medicines in Chambersburg,
not China.
Mr. Speaker, this is the fight of our
lives, and we have a real opportunity
to make a difference. There is nothing
partisan about securing America’s
place as a leader in the 21st century.
There is nothing partisan about bring-
ing jobs home to America. There is
nothing partisan about combating a
hostile regime’s overreach into Amer-
ican lives.
This is not about Republicans or
Democrats; this is about Americans. I
urge my colleagues from across the po-
litical spectrum to get behind our com-
monsense solutions to counter the Chi-
nese Communist Party and protect our
Nation.
It is simple. We must secure our sup-
ply chains. We must defeat China in
the race to the next-generation tech-
nology. We must prepare Americans to
succeed in the years to come.
From strengthening our supply
chains and bringing jobs home to
America and to our allies, countering
Chinese interference in our educational
institutions, we must take action. We
must continue fighting to defend the
American people and equip America to
lead the way in the 21st century.
As I have said before on this floor,
this is the fight of our lifetime, and it
is one that we certainly can win.

in order to protect the rest of us, and
you are true American heroes.
To the doctors, nurses, technicians,
EMTs, pharmacists, home health aides,
and everyone else who supports patient
care, from the bottom of my heart,
thank you. You have gone above and
beyond. Your dedication, courage, and
strength deserve our most profound ad-
miration and gratitude. Your service to
your community has impacted and
saved countless lives.
It would take days for me to appro-
priately honor each and every person
who deserves special recognition. Un-
fortunately, I have limited time today,
so I want to highlight just a few of
these heroes.
From my neck of the woods in Tyler
County, Texas, I want to thank Carrie
Holland Evans, a registered nurse who
was infected with COVID–19 in the line
of duty. Since her recovery, Carrie has
participated in virology studies and
has donated convalescent plasma to
save lives.
I want to recognize Dr. Qamar
Arfeen, who delivers home health and
hospice care across southeast Texas
and is the head of the COVID–19 unit at
Baptist Hospital, for all of his work
with convalescent plasma.
From Houston Methodist in Bay-
town, I want to mention four brave and
resilient registered nurses: Jennifer
Vera, LaDuska James, Dorothy Terry,
and Jon Ann Watson. Your contribu-
tions to the hospital and dedication to
patient care were simply awe inspiring.
Also, from Houston Methodist in
Baytown, I want to thank Gina Cotter,
who collaborated across disciplines to
educate and upskill nurses to provide
respiratory care, while also serving as
a frontline respiratory therapist.
From Houston Methodist in Clear
Lake, I want to thank Dr. Omar Acres,
Dr. Nina Zatikyan, and Dr. Arthur
Lim, who all cared for many infected
patients. I also want to recognize three
registered nurses—Stephanie Dockter,
Diana Freyberger, and Nicole Herrick—
who all volunteered to care exclusively
for COVID–19 patients so their other
staff members would not have to.
I want to acknowledge the largest
hospital system in southeast Texas,
Memorial Hermann Health System,
which has been on the front lines of the
region’s response to the pandemic. Me-
morial Hermann’s more than 6,000 phy-
sicians, 8,000 nurses, and hundreds of
case managers and social workers have
been caring for patients and their fami-
lies in one of the country’s most sig-
nificant hot spots. They risk their lives
every day to care for our community
and have worked tirelessly to slow the
spread of this disease.
And, finally, I want to mention a
handful of heroes from CHI St. Luke’s.
Thank you to Dr. Lou Hamer, a
pulmonologist who closed his out-
patient practice and instead fully dedi-
cated his services to supporting the
needs of COVID patients.
Thank you Dr. Monte Orahood for
working day and night since the pan-
demic started and for your clinical
oversight, which has undoubtedly re-
sulted in successful patient outcomes.
Dr. George Rodriguez, thank you for
providing clinical guidance and leader-
ship on patient care and protocol devel-
opment.
And I thank Dr. Zaher Shebib, who
has consulted on every single COVID–19
patient case for St. Luke’s.
Also from St. Luke’s, allow me to
highlight lab director, Charlie Combs,
who is described by his colleagues as an
unsung hero, as well as Chelsea
Pavlowich, Christina Andrews, Sarah
Hill, Candace Fernandez, Jason Case,
Nidia Johnson, Cole Morse, Cassie Fire,
and Lisa Agler, who are all superhero
nurses and whose commitment to pa-
tients supersedes any fear of this dan-
gerous virus.
And to the thousands of healthcare
workers who, due to time constraints
were not mentioned today, please know
this: You are the heroes of this unprec-
edented time.
This country and your Congressman
will forever be grateful. May God bless
each and every one of you, and may we
see an end to this global pandemic very
soon.
God bless you.

DAIRY UPDATES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, Sep-
tember 27, was National Chocolate
Milk Day.
Chocolate milk is adored by millions
of Americans nationwide and is a fa-
vorite among children. Seventy percent
of the milk children consume is fla-
vored, with chocolate being the most
popular flavor. Chocolate milk is low
in fat, high in nutrients, and packed
with flavor.
Milk consumption, Mr. Speaker, has
been declining, however, and when the
National School Lunch Program re-
moved the most popular and nutritious
option from schools to only serve fat-
free milk, the numbers continued to
drop. As a result of these detrimental
policies, we have lost nearly a genera-
tion of milk drinkers, and those milk
drinkers have lost access to the best
nutrition.
This detrimental policy was partially
reversed when the USDA made a deci-
sion to once again allow 1 percent fla-
vored milk back into school lunches,
and I am grateful to Secretary Sonny
Perdue for his leadership on the issue.
To build on this momentum, I intro-
duced the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids
Act last year to once again allow whole
milk, both flavored and unflavored, to
be offered within the program because
children can greatly benefit from the
essential nutrients whole milk pro-
vides.
Taking that one step further, I joined
my colleague FRED KELLER to intro-
duce the GIVE MILK Act last month.
The GIVE MILK Act, Mr. Speaker,
gives families who use the WIC pro-
gram, or Women, Infants, and Children
program, more control over the nutri-
tion of their children by making 2 per-
cent and whole milk available through
the WIC program to any child over the
age of 2.
b 0930
Currently, WIC participants are lim-
ited to low-fat or nonfat milk, meaning
they are missing all the nutrition that
comes from that milk fat.
This legislation will give families
who depend on WIC more options when
considering nutritional options for
their children. It will also help in-
crease milk consumption, which is a
win for our dairy farmers.
I talked about this legislation,
among other things, when I had the
pleasure of joining the folks at the Na-
tional Milk Producers Federation last
week on their new podcast, ‘‘Dairy De-
fined’’. We covered a lot of ground, in-
cluding the importance that milk plays
in our diets and how coronavirus has
impacted the dairy industry.
Safety net programs like the Dairy
Margin Coverage program, coupled
with the coronavirus relief efforts,
have helped ease the burden somewhat
on our producers, but times remain
tough. We must continue to spread the
word about these critical safety net
programs so our Nation’s dairy pro-
ducers, those farm families, can take
full advantage of all the tools at their
disposal.
If there has been one positive thing
that has come out of this pandemic, it
is that we have seen more families re-
turning to the dining room table, Mr.
Speaker. Milk consumption has seen an
uptick in the past few months and
more and more Americans are bene-
fiting from the essential nutrients that
whole milk provides.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by
thanking the hardworking men and
women who have the 24/7, 365-day-a-
year job of running our dairy farms.
Thank you for working tirelessly to en-
sure that we have access to delicious,
nutritious, and top-quality milk.

other day.
During these few days before the
House breaks for the final weeks of the

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. CLINE) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge

Mr. CLINE led the Pledge of Alle-

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-

f
U.S. POSTAL SERVICE MUST BE
FIXED
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam
Speaker, in the era of COVID–19, people
are reliant on the United States Postal
Service more than ever, a beloved
American institution built on trust, re-
liability, and durability.
During the Presidential elections of
1864, 156 years ago, during the end of
the Civil War, soldiers were mailed bal-
lots, and they voted and returned those
ballots via the United States Postal
Service. There was no fraud.
Sadly and unbelievably, the United
States Postal Service is being sabo-
taged from within. The Trump Post-
master has removed and destroyed 671
sorting machines nationally, including
5 of 20 from Buffalo. I inspected the
Buffalo facility on September 9 and
found priority mail delayed for more
than a month—or longer.
The dedicated postal workers at the
Buffalo facility report that the situa-
tion has worsened in the past few days.
Mail is sitting on the floor. Five of 20
mail sorters were removed or de-
stroyed.
Today I am calling on the Nation’s
Postmaster to fix and to restore all
mail sorters to the Buffalo facility.
Our postal workers and letter car-
riers do great work for the American
people. This administration needs to
get out of the way and allow them to
do their job, their good and honest pub-
lic service.
f
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SUICIDE
AWARENESS MONTH
(Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to mark National Suicide Aware-
ness Month.
Unfortunately, Montanans are all too
familiar with the epidemic of suicide.
As we have faced this ongoing public
health and economic crisis, the demand
for mental health services has grown.
In Gallatin County, my home, crisis
response therapists have experienced a
higher volume of calls. Each month
they receive more calls than the last
from people needing help. Centers
throughout Montana are seeing similar
increases.
To confront the greater demand for
services and to help people in crisis, we
must ensure access to necessary re-
sources are available. One crucial re-
source is the national suicide hotline.
I am grateful to my colleagues, Re-
publicans and Democrats, for working
with me to designate 988 as the hot-
line’s number. I am proud of that bi-
partisan accomplishment.
Let’s continue to provide these crit-
ical resources for those who need them
the most and support them through
their darkest hours.
f
HONORING THE LIFE AND MEM-
ORY OF MADELEINE BRENNAN
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I rise today to honor the life and mem-
ory of Ms. Madeleine Brennan, a legend
in Dyker Heights and a testament to
the idea that great schools begin with
great leaders.
For 50 years, Madeleine served as the
principal of Dyker Heights Inter-
mediate School, making her the long-
est serving principal in New York City
history and perhaps the entire country.
She loved her job so much that even
when her pension and 401(k) meant
that she could make more money in re-
tirement, she kept on working. That
passion inspired many of her students
to not only become teachers them-
selves, but to return to Dyker Heights
Intermediate School to work on her
staff.
Ms. Brennan passed away this past
April, but her legacy lives on in the
thousands of lives she influenced over
the years. She will be dearly missed.
f
CONGRATULATING NICOLE BERG
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, some
may say that I am biased, but I firmly
believe that Washington State is home
to the best farmers in the world. Today
I rise to congratulate one of those in-
credible farmers, my fellow Washing-
tonian, Nicole Berg, for her appoint-
ment to the Federal Crop Insurance
Corporation board of directors.
Nicole’s experience as a fourth-gen-
eration farmer in central Washington
has provided her with a strong, yet per-
sonal, understanding of the needs of
family-run farms in the United States.
For many years, I have seen Nicole’s
passion for putting food on America’s
table. Her work with the National As-
sociation of Wheat Growers has been of
immense benefit to the region and to
the world. And there is no doubt in my
mind that she will be a great asset to
the Federal Crop Insurance Corpora-
tion.
I wish Nicole the very best as she en-
ters this new chapter. Her appointment
to the FCIC board of directors is well
deserved, and I congratulate her on
this fantastic achievement.
f
HONORING AMERICANS WHO LOST
THEIR LIVES TO COVID–19
(Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to honor the over 200,000 Americans
who have lost their lives to COVID–19
and the over 7 million people who have
been infected.
The pandemic has put great stress on
our communities and wreaked havoc on
our economy. Millions of Americans
have lost their jobs and, with it, their
health insurance.
During the pandemic, common sense
would say we should strengthen our na-
tional healthcare system. President
Trump and the congressional Repub-
licans continue their assault on the Af-
fordable Care Act, urging the courts to
strike the law down.
The House has passed 340 bipartisan
health bills. The Senate refuses to take
them up.
The President signs executive orders
that do nothing. They do not protect
people with preexisting conditions or
cover preventative medicine. The ACA
does.
The President claims to have a
healthcare plan to replace the ACA,
but he only intends to release it after
the election.
This is no way to govern. It is time
to end the political stunts, to work
across the aisle, and to get serious
about the health of the American peo-
ple.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5062 September 30, 2020
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, on Tuesday, the insightful
columnist Star Parker provided an ex-
traordinary analysis, ‘‘Supreme Court
Fight is about Life and Death,’’ in the
Aiken Standard.
‘‘CHUCK SCHUMER, Senate minority
leader, says, ‘Our number one goal
must be to communicate the stakes of
this Supreme Court fight to the Amer-
ican people’ . . . ‘nothing is off the
table.’
‘‘Nothing? Not even violence?’’
‘‘ . . . Senator SCHUMER is right that
the American people must know what’s
at stake.
‘‘Will we have a culture of life and ci-
vility, or a culture of death, violence,
and chaos. . . . ’’
‘‘Fortunately, President Donald
Trump understands what is at stake.’’
Because of ‘‘the diligence of this
President and the Republican Senate,
we will soon see an outstanding con-
servative woman—one who respects
both the sanctity of life and the sanc-
tity of our Nation’s institutions—fill
this Court vacancy.’’
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
Godspeed, Amy Barrett and Carol
Davis.
f
HONORING TOM WICKHAM
(Mr. PRICE of North Carolina asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I rise to recognize a faithful
servant of the people’s House, Parlia-
mentarian Tom Wickham.
Tom is only the fifth Parliamen-
tarian in this institution’s history, and
he is concluding his 25 years of service
in the Parliamentarian’s Office this
week.
One of the distinguishing features of
Tom’s service has been his work with
the House Democracy Partnership and
his willingness to extend himself inter-
nationally, to share his experiences
and insight with those organizing and
administering parliaments in emerg-
ing, often struggling democracies.
Just last fall, Members would have
been heartened to see the reception
that Tom, along with Clerk Cheryl
Johnson and Shuwanza Goff, received
from their counterparts in Kenya, Li-
beria, Ethiopia, and The Gambia.
We have all benefited from Tom’s
dedicated service and the skill, integ-
rity, and fairness he has brought to the
Parliamentarian’s role.
We wish him and his family Godspeed
as they begin the next chapter of their
lives.
f
RECOGNIZING NEW FREEDOM
FARM
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize New Freedom Farm in
Buchanan, Virginia.
Founded in 2016 by Lois Fritz, New
Freedom Farm is a nonprofit commu-
nity that aids veterans suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder, sub-
stance abuse, and traumatic brain in-
jury.
Through animal therapy, farming,
and peer-to-peer support, this tremen-
dous organization strives to empower
veterans and help them heal through
the realization of their own efforts and
contributions. The farm says its mis-
sion is to heal heroes through horses.
At the facility, veterans often de-
velop deep friendships through equine
activity and gentling, fostering, phys-
ical, emotional, and spiritual health,
which helps with reintegration into ci-
vilian life.
They offer their services to veterans
entirely free of charge and say they are
able to operate through donations and
faith.
I applaud the entire team at New
Freedom Farm for their passion and
commitment to serving those who
serve our Nation. I wish them contin-
ued success moving forward and thank
them for their incredible work.

CONGRATULATIONS, DALLASTOWN
ELEMENTARY AREA SCHOOL
DISTRICT
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate the faculty,
staff, and students of Dallastown Ele-
mentary School in the Dallastown
Area School District on being recog-
nized as a 2020 National Blue Ribbon
School.
The National Blue Ribbon Schools
Program was founded nearly 40 years
ago to recognize outstanding public
and private schools that are making a
difference and exemplify excellence.
Dallastown Elementary was recognized
as an Exemplary High Performing
School.
I thank Dallastown Area Super-
intendent Dr. Joshua Doll, the school
board, and the leadership and teachers
at Dallastown Elementary for working
so hard for this achievement. In their
application, school principal Charles
Patterson noted that one of the distin-
guishing characteristics he sees about
Dallastown Elementary is that they
have built a school family. The quality
education these students receive pre-
pares them for success throughout the
rest of their lives.
Congratulations, again, to
Dallastown Elementary School for
being named a 2020 National Blue Rib-
bon School.

THE TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING ARE
TWO-TIME STANLEY CUP CHAM-
PIONS
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to bring some thunder to the
House Chamber and recognize the now
two-time Stanley Cup Champion
Tampa Bay Lightning.
Behind the leadership of Captain Ste-
ven Stamkos and Stanley Cup MVP
Victor Hedman, the Bolts have en-
shrined themselves as one of the great-
est teams of all time.
Although COVID prevented fans from
attending the playoffs, the distant
thunder of the greatest fans in hockey
and the determination of the Lightning
got them to the top of the mountain,
Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker, as we say in Tampa
Bay, Stanley Needs a Tan. And let me
just say, it is sunny back in Tampa
Bay.
While one Tampa Bay championship
run comes to an end, another begins.
Best of luck to the Tampa Bay Rays as
they begin their quest to secure their
first World Series title.
Let’s make Tampa Bay Title Town
USA.

THANK YOU TO OUR MEN AND
WOMEN IN UNIFORM
(Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I re-
mind Mr. BILIRAKIS, everyone knows
that Detroit is actually hockey town.
Mr. Speaker, every day, members in
law enforcement put on their uniform
not knowing if they are going to come
home, these mothers, fathers, sisters,
brothers, sons, and daughters.
In an era of heightened rhetoric, I
stand here today to say thank you to
our women and men in uniform.
Recently, we have seen a rise in at-
tacks against police officers across the
country and even in west Michigan.
This month, officers in Muskegon
Heights responded to a domestic dis-
turbance where two people were shot,
one of them murdered.
A police chase ensued when a deputy
encountered the suspect driving the
wrong way. When the deputy tried to
apprehend the suspect while driving, he
was fired upon.
Multiple departments working to-
gether were able to use a police cruiser
to disable the suspect’s vehicle.
Unbeknownst to the officers, there
was also a developmentally disabled
woman in the backseat who was res-
cued and brought to safety.
This incredible story follows a week-
end where 11 shootings took place in
Grand Rapids.
Despite all this, some of my col-
leagues still think that defunding the
police is a good idea. I am here to tell
you it is not. This will only hurt com-
munity policing initiatives for the very
communities that need it the most.
So, Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to
the incredible men and women who

HONORING ROYCE CARTER
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor
a great American.
Mr. Royce Everett Carter of
Blackshear, Georgia, passed away on
September 12 at the age of 85.
Royce was born and raised in Geor-
gia, and he lived in Pierce County for
the past 52 years.
Committed to improving transpor-
tation and infrastructure in the State
of Georgia, he had worked for the Geor-
gia Department of Transportation as a
project engineer for the State Highway
Department until his retirement.
Royce worked on several projects
with T.R. Long Engineering over the
years, including the Royce E. Carter
roundabout on New School Road, which
was dedicated to the work he did
throughout his life to improve his com-
munity.
He was a steadfast public servant
who was always looking for opportuni-
ties to improve the lives around him.
In his limited free time, he enjoyed
golf, and took his appreciation for it to
new heights when he served on the
board of the Lakeview Golf Club and
eventually became president.
Royce loved his friends, his family,
his community, and his church dearly,
and he used every opportunity to make
the most of the time he spent on this
Earth.
Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the
life he lived, and I know his legacy will
continue for years to come.
I know that every time I drive the
Royce E. Carter roundabout, I will re-
member the impact he made on Geor-
gia’s First Congressional District.

UYGHUR FORCED LABOR
DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2020
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant
to House Resolution 1129, I call up the
bill (H.R. 6270) to amend the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 to require issuers
to make certain disclosures relating to
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion, and for other purposes, and ask
for its immediate consideration in the
House.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CUELLAR). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 1129, an amendment in the nature
of a substitute consisting of the text of
Rules Committee Print 116–64 is adopt-
ed and the bill, as amended, is consid-
ered read.
The text of the bill, as amended, is as
follows:
H.R. 6270
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Uyghur Forced
Labor Disclosure Act of 2020’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Since early 2017, the Government of the
People’s Republic of China has conducted a pol-
icy of disappearance, mass internment, and im-
prisonment of Turkic Muslims, particularly
Uyghurs, in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region (XUAR).
(2) Since 2014, Chinese authorities have de-
tained between 800,000 and possibly up to three
million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and
other ethnic minorities in forced education,
training, and labor camps.
(3) The bi-partisan, bi-cameral Congressional-
Executive Commission on China’s 2019 Annual
Report found numerous reports of forced labor
associated with government repression of ethnic
minority groups in the XUAR. Detainees per-
formed forced labor in factories both within and
outside of internment camps in XUAR.
(4) Radio Free Asia reported in January 2019
that authorities had also sent Uyghurs and
Kazakhs from the XUAR to other provinces in
China for forced labor.
(5) Comments in March 2018 from the presi-
dent of the China National Textile and Apparel
Council suggested that textile manufacturers
were working with XUAR authorities to exploit
forced labor.
(6) Companies that work in the XUAR are at
great risk of complicity in the human rights
abuses being committed in the region.
(7) In a March 2020 report, the Australian
Strategic Policy Institute identified 27 factories
in nine Chinese provinces that are using
Uyghur labor transferred from Xinjiang. These
factories indirectly supply global brands, in-
cluding many American multinational compa-
nies.
(8) Forced labor in XUAR is Chinese govern-
ment policy and due diligence efforts to ensure
clean supply chains is nearly impossible due to
mass surveillance, pervasive police presence,
and intimidation of workers.
SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RE-
LATING TO THE XINJIANG UYGHUR
AUTONOMOUS REGION.
Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m) is amended by adding at
the end the following:
‘‘(s) DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RE-
LATING TO THE XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS
REGION.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than the end of
the 180-day period beginning on the date of en-
actment of this subsection, the Commission shall
issue rules to require each issuer required to file
an annual report under this section or section
15(d) or a proxy statement under section 14 to
disclose in each such report or proxy statement
whether, during the period covered by the report
or proxy statement—
‘‘(A) the issuer or any affiliate of the issuer,
directly or indirectly, engaged with an entity or
the affiliate of an entity to import—
‘‘(i) manufactured goods, including elec-
tronics, food products, textiles, shoes, and teas,
that originated in the XUAR; or
‘‘(ii) manufactured goods containing materials
that originated or are sourced in the XUAR;
‘‘(B) with respect to any goods or materials
described under subparagraph (A), whether the
goods or material originated in forced labor
camps; and
‘‘(C) with respect to each manufactured good
or material described under subparagraph (A)—
‘‘(i) the nature and extent of the commercial
activity related to such good or material;
‘‘(ii) the gross revenue and net profits, if any,
attributable to the good or material; and
‘‘(iii) whether the issuer or the affiliate of the
issuer intends to continue with such importa-
tion.
‘‘(2) AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION.—The
Commission shall make all information disclosed
pursuant to this subsection available to the pub-
lic on the website of the Commission.
‘‘(3) REPORTS.—
‘‘(A) ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS.—The
Commission shall—
‘‘(i) conduct an annual assessment of the com-
pliance of issuers with the requirements of this
subsection; and
‘‘(ii) issue a report to Congress containing the
results of the assessment required under clause
(i).
‘‘(B) GAO REPORT.—The Comptroller General
of the United States shall periodically evaluate
and report to Congress on the effectiveness of
the oversight by the Commission of the disclo-
sure requirements under this subsection.
‘‘(4) DEFINITIONS.—In this subsection:
‘‘(A) FORCED LABOR CAMP.—The term ‘forced
labor camp’ means—
‘‘(i) any entity engaged in the ‘mutual pairing
assistance’ program which subsidizes the estab-
lishment of manufacturing facilities in XUAR;
‘‘(ii) any entity using convict labor, forced
labor, or indentured labor described under sec-
tion 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.
1307); and
‘‘(iii) any other entity that the Commission
determines is appropriate.
‘‘(B) XUAR.—The term ‘XUAR’ means the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill,
as amended, shall be debatable for 1
hour, equally divided and controlled by
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Financial
Services.

Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA) each will con-

GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on H.R. 6270 and to insert extra-
neous material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of H.R. 6270, the Uyghur Forced Labor
Disclosure Act of 2020, important legis-
lation introduced by Representative
WEXTON, a valued member of the Com-
mittee on Financial Services.
The Uyghurs are a Turkic-speaking
Muslim group and are one of a number
of Muslim groups in Xinjiang that are
persecuted, arbitrarily arrested, de-
tained in forced labor concentration
camps, and even executed. It has been
reported by human rights advocates
that over 1 million people are being
held by the Chinese Government in de-
tention camps across the Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region.
The Government of the People’s Re-
public of China falsely refers to these
concentration camps as vocational
camps or reeducation camps.
Make no mistake: The truth is that
today, in 2020, 1 million human beings
are being held in concentration camps
where they are beaten, starved, and
forced to work long hours in conditions

that can only be described as inhu-
mane. Their relatives often have no
idea where they are or whether they
are alive. They are dying each day due
to the cruelty of their living conditions
and the brutality of the Chinese Gov-
ernment, which executes them with
impunity.
Within these concentration camps,
the Uyghurs are used as slave labor to
make goods and products for
unsuspecting American consumers.
Each day, millions of us unknowingly
buy, use, and transport products made
by the hands of people who are held in
these government-run detention cen-
ters while their families wait for some
proof of life that may never come.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to
vote for H.R. 6270.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume,
and I rise today in opposition to H.R.
6270.
Republicans are unwavering in our
support to hold China accountable for
the human rights violations that are
occurring in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region, or the XUAR.
We agree with each other on the facts
on the ground, from the oppression
that the Uyghurs are feeling, to the
forced labor camps.
In fact, Mr. Speaker, I would remind
my colleagues that we passed H.R. 6210
last week, literally last week, on a bi-
partisan basis to address these human
rights violations.
Moreover, to date, the Trump admin-
istration has taken significant action
to punish human rights violators in the
region, including recent sanctions and
additions to the Commerce Depart-
ment’s Entity List.
On the other hand, this window-
dressing bill, put forth by the Demo-
crats less than a month before the elec-
tion and a week after we actually
passed legislation, will not hold any
bad actors accountable.
Adding additional mandatory disclo-
sures for public companies is not the
appropriate way to curtail human
rights atrocities.
Sanctioning is the most effective way
to hold these human rights abusers ac-
countable.
The framework of this bill is deeply
flawed. First, the Securities and Ex-
change Commission, the SEC, has no
foreign policy expertise. The SEC’s
three-part mission is to: one, protect
investors; two, maintain fair, orderly,
and efficient markets; and third, facili-
tate capital formation here in the
United States.
The Treasury and State Department
handle the sanctions regime.
We should instead be working with
both the State Department and Treas-
ury to hold these bad actors account-
able, not the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that
we are working with the State Depart-
ment and Treasury.
To be clear, this bill would require
the SEC to issue rules regarding Amer-
ican companies, and only American
companies, to disclose whether they or
any of their affiliates directly or indi-
rectly engaged with an entity or an af-
filiate of an entity to import not only
goods from the XUAR, but also goods
containing materials originating or
sourced from the XUAR.
Now, we all have been talking about
Disney a lot and a lot of other places
that have had content from, seemingly,
this area.
So now let’s look at what this would
mean for a manufacturer. Let’s look at
what this would mean in so many var-
ious areas of our economy.
This means that companies would be
required to know if its affiliates, its
suppliers, anyone they may have a re-
lationship with, are ‘‘indirectly en-
gaged with affiliates of certain compa-
nies.’’
So you may not be doing something
directly, but an affiliate or a partner of
yours may be doing something with an
affiliate or a partner of somebody else
that may be dealing and doing some
business in that area.
This is a poorly constructed disclo-
sure regime where a public company
would be required to disclose impos-
sible-to-discern information, and it
would be liable for securities fraud, a
very powerful word, if it is impossible
to discern information that is not dis-
closed correctly.
So think about that. They may not
know they are breaking the law, this
law, but they would be held account-
able for that.
Further, the bill does not contain a
sunset clause, and the disclosure re-
quirement would apply indefinitely
even if behavior in the region has
changed.
This bill’s framework has proven dis-
astrous.
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act
mandated disclosures relating to the
use of conflict minerals that originated
in the DRC, or the Democratic Repub-
lic of Congo, or an adjoining country.
There is an entire Great Lakes region,
they call it, in Africa.
The implementation of section 1502
cost billions of dollars—Democrat esti-
mates put it at over $7 billion—and the
provisions led to devastating job losses,
not here in America, but in Africa.
Mr. Speaker, this bill did not go
through regular order either, I might
add.
Committee Republicans have not had
the opportunity to make substantive
changes or suggestions, let alone exam-
ine the bill’s likely harmful con-
sequences.
So, again, just last week, the House
passed H.R. 6210, the Uyghur Forced
Labor Prevention Act, to hold China
accountable. That is where the respon-
sibility lies, with China, not U.S. com-
panies or the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
b 1130
Today, we are only trying to give a
vulnerable Member and other Demo-
crats who feel the need to ‘‘get tough
on China all of a sudden’’ a win—sad, in
my opinion.
I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R.
6270, as it will limit opportunities for
everyday investors, reduce the number
of public companies, increase compli-
ance costs on businesses, and may
harm, actually, the Uyghurs them-
selves who this bill is intending to pro-
tect.
Let’s go after China. Let’s not go
after the Uyghurs.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as she may consume to the
gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.
WEXTON), a distinguished member of
the Financial Services Committee and
the sponsor of this legislation.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Chairwoman WATERS for working with
me on this important legislation and
for her unwavering commitment to de-
fending human rights and demanding
accountability, two things that H.R.
6270 would do.
I also wish to thank Representatives
JIM MCGOVERN and CHRIS SMITH for
their leadership and commend them on
their hard work on the Uyghur Forced
Labor Prevention Act, which passed
the House overwhelmingly last week.
Both of them have worked tirelessly to
shine a light on the atrocities taking
place in Xinjiang.
Speaker PELOSI pointed out that it
was Congressman SMITH and Congress-
man Frank Wolf who, years ago, vis-
ited a forced labor camp and reported
back to the U.S. Congress and to the
world about what was happening there.
Frank Wolf held my seat in Vir-
ginia’s 10th Congressional District for
34 years, so I am proud to continue his
important work defending religious
freedom and human rights. For that
reason, I rise in strong support of H.R.
6270, the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclo-
sure Act.
This legislation is a critical and long-
overdue human rights disclosure bill
that will inform investors and the mar-
kets of publicly traded companies’ pas-
sive complicity or active exploitation
of one of the most pressing and ongoing
human rights violations of our life-
time.
For years, the Government of the
People’s Republic of China has been en-
gaged in the mass internment of reli-
gious minorities in the Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region. Because
of the well-documented and massive
scale of abuses committed in the re-
gion, Xinjiang has become globally no-
torious for human rights violations, in-
cluding the extensive use of forced
labor.
Chinese authorities have used the
pretext of terrorism to suspend civil
and political rights, including the in-
ternment of more than 1 million
Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in
reeducation centers across Xinjiang,
where they are subjected to harsh
abuse and forbidden from practicing
their religious or cultural beliefs.

These reeducation centers also func-
tion as forced labor camps where var-
ious goods, especially those made from
cotton, the region’s top export, are
manufactured with forced Uyghur
labor and sent to producers and con-
sumers around the world.
Chinese manufacturers are provided
development assistance to build fac-
tories in or near the camps to take ad-
vantage of detainee labor. Through
government-sponsored endeavors like
the mutual pairing assistance program,
former detainees are transferred from
Xinjiang to other parts of China for
factory labor, where they are separated
from their families, live in segregated
dormitories, and are assigned minders
who monitor their every move.
It is important to point out that a lot
of these workers were accomplished
people in Uyghur society. We are talk-
ing about professors, doctors, and jour-
nalists, educated, successful people
who had their livelihoods taken from
them. Their only crime was being
Uyghur.
Shockingly, reports show that many
of these factories supply manufactured
materials for some of the largest com-
panies in the world, and some of these
products are finding their way to U.S.
consumers.
The U.S. has banned imports made
with forced labor since 1930, and U.S.
companies are required to exercise due
diligence in order to better understand
their supply chains and potential links
to forced labor. But traditional human
rights due diligence efforts are falling
short in Xinjiang, where forced labor is
widespread and systemic in the re-
gional economy.
Xinjiang is also tightly controlled.
Travel to the region is restricted, mak-
ing efforts to audit supply chains near-
ly impossible. Auditors have reportedly
been detained, threatened, and stopped
at airports. Workers are intimidated
not to talk.
Just last week, five supply chain au-
diting organizations pulled out of
Xinjiang, citing restricted access and
increased difficulty in meeting audit-
ing standards.
Despite all of this, international
companies continue to source from
Xinjiang or allow products from labor
from the region to come into their sup-
ply chains.
My legislation, the Uyghur Forced
Labor Disclosure Act, would require
the SEC to issue rules requiring pub-
licly traded companies to annually dis-
close imports of manufactured goods
and materials that originate in or are
sourced from Xinjiang.
Because of the strong likelihood that
products from Xinjiang were created
using forced labor from concentration
camp prisoners, companies that import
products and materials from the region
face greater legal reputational and fi-
nancial risks that may impact their
short- and long-term value.
Just as important, shareholders and
consumers have the right to know
whether their hard-earned dollars are
being invested in companies whose sup-
ply chains benefit from forced labor. It
is critical that publicly traded compa-
nies disclose this so that investors
have the information that they need to
make the best investment decisions
possible and to ensure that no parts of
our market or economy utilize forced
labor or are complicit in further viola-
tions of human rights.
The gentleman from Michigan be-
lieves that sanctions would be a better
option. Sanctions need to be part of the
solution, and I, along with others,
pushed the Trump administration to
sanction the Chinese Government offi-
cials and entities. When they finally
did, I finally supported that. I firmly
agree with what they did.
But sanctions alone aren’t effective.
We need a multipronged approach that
deals with the supply side and the de-
mand side.
It was mentioned that it is not pos-
sible to exercise the kind of due dili-
gence necessary. What price a human
life? There are lots of opportunities for
publicly traded companies to pressure
their suppliers not to take advantage
of this forced labor, and it could cause
reputational and financial risks and
burdens to the company if they are
found out that they are profiting from
this forced labor.
My bill, along with Chairman
MCGOVERN’s, H.R. 6270, which passed
overwhelmingly last week, sends a
strong message that the United States
economy and the financial system will
not tolerate human rights abuse. I urge
my colleagues to support the Uyghur
Forced Labor Disclosure Act.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ).
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6270 be-
fore us here today.
China is the greatest existential
threat that our country has faced in
my lifetime. From their efforts to dis-
place the U.S. as an international lead-
er, to hurting our job creators and
workers, to China’s human rights
abuses, the U.S. needs to work in a bi-
partisan and strategic way with our al-
lies to fight back against the CCP.
That is why I was honored to serve
on the House China Task Force that
just today released our comprehensive
report. From this report, we have rec-
ommended hundreds of policy proposals
and ideas, over 60 percent of which are
bipartisan, on the most effective ways
to counter the Chinese Communist
Party.
Unfortunately, this piece of legisla-
tion before us today misses the mark,
though I do appreciate my colleagues’
intent.
Once again, my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle are attempting
to use the SEC, which has no foreign
policy expertise and whose mission is
to, one, protect investors; two, main-
tain fair, orderly, and efficient mar-
kets; and, three, facilitate capital for-
mation. This bill seeks to make that
group, the SEC, an enforcer to accom-
plish a policy objective completely un-
related to their mission and expertise.
This responsibility is better housed
in the Treasury Department, where we
do have the expertise and the tools to
effectively punish those who support
the grotesque human rights violations
that the CCP inflicts on the Uyghurs.
One final point. I would like to re-
mind everyone that this bill never
went through a markup and received
zero hearings on the Financial Services
Committee, primarily because, as we
all know, these virtual hearings are
awful, to put it kindly. The virtual
hearings do not work, and they serve as
a tremendous disservice to our con-
stituents.
Since the pandemic struck, we have
not held a single markup as a com-
mittee. What is the purpose of our
committee if we can’t even figure out
how to mark up a bill?
There is so much work to be done
here, and we aren’t seriously taking up
any of it. We can and must find a way
to safely and effectively hold real hear-
ings and real markups in a socially
distanced way so that we can do the
job that the American people sent us
here to do.
I urge my colleagues to oppose this
legislation.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GREEN).
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman, Ms. WEXTON,
for bringing this legislation before the
House.
To be very candid with you, upon re-
viewing the materials that have been
submitted to me, I was absolutely
amazed that this kind of activity is
taking place.
Forced labor. Is that what they are
calling it now when you force people to
work, when you separate families,
when you have persons denounce their
religion, when you put them in reedu-
cation centers? Is that what this is all
about, forced labor?
I have a history that requires me to
speak up and speak out on these issues.
Forced labor is how I got to this coun-
try. If you understand my history, you
have to understand why I am abso-
lutely, totally, and completely opposed
to what is happening to the Uyghurs.
This is unconscionable, and it is unac-
ceptable.
I am proud to be a person who will
strongly recommend to my colleagues
that we not allow this to continue. It is
one thing to have the forced labor, and
then to compound it by having Amer-
ican companies benefit from the forced
labor, that is sinful. It is criminal in
international courts, but it is also just
sinful that American companies would
participate in this kind of activity.
I think this notion that they should
be audited, their supply chains should
be audited, is more than reasonable.
Why would we not want to know
whether American companies are par-
ticipating in this kind of behavior? We
need to know.

How do we find out? Audit the supply
chain. It just makes sense that we
would do this.
I don’t understand how we can oppose
trying to find out if this kind of activ-
ity is being engaged in by American
companies.
Finally, this: I don’t understand how
we consistently find people opposed to
making inquiries about the suffering of
other people. At some point, the people
who are suffering have to be given
some opportunity to have their suf-
fering addressed. And it doesn’t matter
where they are in the world. Suffering
has to be addressed. We cannot allow it
to happen there because, if we do, it
can happen here.
I am absolutely supportive of H.R.
6270, and I strongly encourage my col-
leagues to help us end the suffering of
the Uyghur people.
I just spoke to a constituent who is
of Chinese ancestry who said to me
that she believes all of this to be true.
I just don’t understand how we can
oppose this piece of legislation, and I
strongly urge my colleagues to support
it.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire as to the time remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Michigan has 23 minutes
remaining. The gentlewoman from
California has 18 minutes remaining.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. WEXTON).
b 1145
Mr. HUIZENGA. Parliamentary in-
quiry, Mr. Speaker.
Is it appropriate—
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend. The gentlewoman
from Virginia may yield for a par-
liamentary inquiry.
The gentlewoman is recognized.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Will the gentle-
woman yield for a parliamentary in-
quiry?
Ms. WEXTON. The gentlewoman will
not yield, no.
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from
Michigan raises a couple of points in
his argument saying that H.R. 6270 is
redundant because of the McGovern
bill. None of the disclosures that are
required by this bill are required under
H.R. 6210, the Uyghur Forced Labor
Prevention Act. There is no overlap. In
fact, we worked very hard to make sure
that the two bills were complementary.
H.R. 6210 imposes a disclosure obliga-
tion for certain activities the issuer is
knowingly engaged in, which is appro-
priate in certain circumstances. Im-
port-related activities are covered
under H.R. 6270. The issuer would have
an affirmative obligation to know their
suppliers, so they would have to engage
in due diligence to determine whether
they were engaging in supporting these
forced labor practices.
Companies that continue to import
from the region despite the over-
whelming evidence of forced labor
practices should, at the very least, be
required to actively audit their supply
chains, and that is what this legisla-
tion would require.
Another issue that was brought up by
the gentleman from Michigan is that
this is like a supply chain disclosure
requirement under Dodd-Frank. Rule
1502 had required publicly traded com-
panies to disclose whether their prod-
ucts contained certain minerals that
have been known to finance violent
conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa, but
that comparison misses the point. The
implication is that businesses will find
these disclosure requirements so bur-
densome that they will have to divest
from the region and local jobs will be
lost.
The business environment is not the
same in the DRC as it is in Xinjiang,
where free enterprise does not exist
and people are being put into con-
centration camps and work camps
against their will. We should be push-
ing companies to reassess their supply
chains in Xinjiang and find alter-
natives, preferably here in America,
where they are not exploiting forced
labor. Unlike legitimate mining jobs in
the DRC, we want these forced labor
jobs to go away.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, a report published ear-
lier this year by the Australian Stra-
tegic Policy Institute noted that Nike,
Adidas, and Apple all had supply chains
that included Uyghur workers laboring
under forced conditions. It is critical
that investors in these companies be
given the information they need to
consider the legal, reputational, and fi-
nancial risks associated with investing
in these and other publicly traded U.S.
companies with forced labor in their
supply chain. And it is equally critical
that, when required to disclose this in-
formation, these companies confront
the reality of their choices and make
decisions that don’t contribute to suf-
fering, racism, and death.
Representative WEXTON’s bill, H.R.
6270, is a necessary step in ending this
injustice. Her bill would require the
SEC to issue rules requiring publicly
traded companies to annually disclose
imports of manufactured goods and
materials that originate or are sourced
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous
Region. It would also require the SEC
and the GAO to provide information to
Congress regarding these disclosures,
as well as oversight.
So I would like to just speak briefly
to the misleading letter from the
Chamber of Commerce opposing H.R.
6270 on the grounds that a similar sup-
ply chain due diligence effort—that is,
section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the
Congo conflict mineral law—failed and
caused the situation to worsen. I am
encouraged by their letter because,
when your opponents have to use dis-
honest arguments to their make their
case, Mr. Speaker, it means they have
no legitimate ones to make.
So, despite every effort on the other
side of the aisle to take down the con-
flict mineral law and to weaken and
eliminate the conflict mineral rule, I
am proud to say that support for sec-
tion 1502 has been sustained by a sense
of moral responsibility and by the fact
that evidence is showing that the rule
is having positive effects. Indeed, the
conflict mineral rule continues to spur
these intense efforts to operationalize
and expand regional, national, and in-
dustry due diligence systems.
The U.N. Group of Experts on the
DRC has reported that section 1502
‘‘has had a massive and welcome im-
pact so far, requiring chain partici-
pants all over the world to take due
diligence and conflict financing seri-
ously. This should not and must not be
thrown away or weakened.’’
Likewise, H.R. 6270 is a critical com-
ponent of the effort by the House to
marshal the might of the United States
economy and American conscience to
make clear the reprehensible nature of
China’s actions on a minority in its
country.
This bill complements another bill
that passed the House last week, H.R.
6210, the Uyghur Forced Labor Preven-
tion Act. That bill provides mecha-
nisms that will require the United
States to establish a diplomatic strat-
egy and issue reports that will assist
all interested parties in implementing
H.R. 6270 and provides complementary
disclosures for public companies. So, if
you supported H.R. 6210, Mr. Speaker,
then you should also vote for H.R. 6270.
The bill before us also enjoys the sup-
port of a wide array of civic-minded or-
ganizations, including the AFL–CIO,
Public Citizen, the Uyghur American
Association, Human Rights First, and
the Uyghur Human Rights Association.
We must all stand up against the un-
just and inhumane treatment of the
Uyghurs and push China to end this
brutality once and for all. I believe
that resolve will not weaken just be-
cause China happens to be the second
largest economy in the world. Just as
each Member of this Chamber knows
that this is wrong, so do our U.S. com-
panies, investors, and the American
public.
So I would like to just relate to some
of what Mr. GREEN has said as he tried
to make our friends on the opposite
side of the aisle understand why we are
so invested in this legislation.
We are descendants of slaves—let me
say that one more time; we are de-
scendants of slaves—and when we learn
about slavery anywhere in the world,
we are opposed to it. There is no jus-
tification for it. It does not matter
whether it is the principals or their as-
sociates who are involved with prod-
ucts and services, et cetera, as a result
of slave labor. We are opposed to it,
and we would ask our Members on the
opposite side of the aisle to have a sen-
sitivity to that when they oppose slav-
ery no matter where it is and who is
causing it.

September 30, 2020
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I consume.
Let me just address the point that
was just brought up, Mr. Speaker.
There is a sensitivity to that. There
has been an injustice in our history,
there is no doubt, and we need to ad-
dress that now. Obviously, it was ad-
dressed at the time, but it has been on-
going.
But whether it was the slave traf-
ficking that the chairlady was talking
about or whether it was family mem-
bers of my wife who were enslaved by
Nazis in work camps or whether they
are modern-day slave labor camps like
this with the Uyghurs, this must be
stamped out. This must be stamped
out. We are in robust agreement about
the problem and about the issue.
The question here is enforcement and
responsibility. So, Mr. Speaker, I am
going to read a quote from the head of
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion. We heard about moral obligation
and those kinds of things. This is what
the head of the Securities and Ex-
change Commission said: ‘‘As we all
know, the SEC has little or no experi-
ence in crafting trade sanctions or ar-
ticulating and enforcing human rights
policy, two areas which have not tradi-
tionally been within the purview of se-
curities regulation.’’
This is from Mary Jo White, Barack
Obama’s head of the Securities and Ex-
change Commission.
So this is not a partisan issue. This is
not a question of whether you support
Uyghur slavery or not. I am offended if
our colleagues are trying to portray it
as that. I don’t think they are, but that
may be kind of how they are tinting it.
And I might refer everybody to the fact
that, last week, we passed a bipartisan
bill addressing this very issue.
But this is about enforcement. This
is about the State Department doing
its job. This is about the Treasury De-
partment doing its job, and, yes, our
Financial Services Committee, which
has done its job with sanctions. We are
very much a part of that sanction re-
gime with the Department of the
Treasury.
So, please, Mr. Speaker, do not mis-
understand, and please don’t mis-
construe opposition to this particular
bill. Again, we have no disagreement
about the atrocities. We have no dis-
agreement about what is happening on
the ground to the Uyghurs and, frank-
ly, to others.
By the way, if this was about others,
we would include others, but it is nar-
rowed down to the Uyghurs.
So I am hoping and I am praying that
this isn’t just a political ploy to look
tough on China, finally, but I hope this
is really about helping people, because
I know that is why I am here.
So I want to make sure, whether it is
a young lady in the Philippians who is
in sex slavery or whether it is a Uyghur
in a labor camp or whether it was my
wife’s family that was imprisoned by
the Japanese in internment camps in
Indonesia or in the Netherlands under
the Nazis or whether it was our broth-
ers and sisters who came here involun-
tarily as slaves, we have to recognize
the evil and the sinfulness behind this,
as my friend and colleague from Texas
had talked about its being sinful. I
wholeheartedly agree.
The question is: How are we going to
remediate that and address it? Unfor-
tunately, the Securities and Exchange
Commission is not the right vehicle for
that.
Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to inquire through the Chair if my
colleague has any remaining speakers
on his side. I have no further speakers,
and I am prepared to close.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, we are
hoping to get one more person here
who is on their way, so I continue to
reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume to
help buy some time until the opposite
side gets its speaker.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, we have had a good, ro-
bust conversation, and we have agreed
violently here on the problem and on
the issue that we need to address.
Again, we have no disagreement about
the atrocities against the Uyghurs. We
have no disagreement about what is
happening on the ground and the des-
picableness of the CCP, the Chinese
Government.
Mr. Speaker, I really hope that it is
not simply that the Democrats are
wanting to appear ‘‘tough on China’’ by
pushing through an empty window
dressing bill that hurts U.S. investors
and companies but, unfortunately, sim-
ply pays lip service to the Uyghurs
with a framework that has already
been proven disastrous.
And I just read a short while ago the
quote from Barack Obama’s head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mary Jo White, who said that the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission is
not equipped for this. Using the SEC as
social police didn’t work with conflict
minerals, and it won’t work as we all
attempt to protect the Uyghurs.
b 1200
I would remind my Democrat col-
leagues, again, that a year ago, Repub-
licans put forth strong proposals to
prohibit taxpayer-backed financing
through the Export-Import Bank from
going to the CCP, the Chinese Com-
munist Party, the Chinese Govern-
ment. Our proposals had real teeth in
them.
Sadly, the Democrats on our com-
mittee rejected this proposal with no
real explanation. So instead, Demo-
crats want to target our securities laws
and make the SEC responsible for for-
eign policy. In fact, targeting our secu-
rities law is the Democrats’ solution
for virtually everything—climate
change, outsourcing, conflict minerals,
not enough mustard at the ballpark. It
is not the job of the SEC to make sure
that these things are happening. It is
our job and Treasury’s job and the
State Department’s job to make sure
that those sanctions are in place.
This bill does not target the problem.
Instead, it simply puts, not just incon-
venient duties on the plates of these
publicly traded companies, no, it ac-
cuses them of fraud—fraud—over some-
thing that is impossible for them to de-
termine. On top of it, it requires en-
forcement from an agency that simply
cannot do it.
Sanctioning bad actors is the appro-
priate and most effective way to punish
human rights abusers, as sanctions
hurt the Chinese Communist Party
without hurting the Uyghurs or the
American capital markets or other in-
vestors and employees around the
world. And ironically, sanctions cover
everyone. If you are a privately held
company that is using materials from a
source that is under sanctions, guess
what? You just broke the law. You
can’t do that.
Now under this, if we are only using
the SEC, guess who the SEC applies to?
Publicly traded companies only. So
those private companies could still go
along their merry way doing business
with those folks. Yet, these publicly
traded companies have this massive
burden put on them, enforced by an
agency that says it cannot enforce
them. I would like to see everyone cov-
ered, not just these publicly traded
companies.
Mr. Speaker, both the House and the
administration have taken meaningful
action to combat human rights viola-
tors in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region. This includes recent
sanctions imposed by the administra-
tion on a number of China’s 25-member
ruling Politburo and party secretary of
the region, as well as additions to the
Commerce Department’s Entity List.
Mr. Speaker, that is why I request
my colleagues oppose H.R. 6270, not be-
cause we don’t agree on the goal, not
that we don’t want to make sure that
the Uyghurs are protected, but because
using an agency to enforce the law is
the wrong direction to go. We are lit-
erally asking the street department to
go be the police department. And
whether you are doing the fire depart-
ment or the street maintenance, or
something else in the city government,
you may be good at that but that
doesn’t mean you are a good police de-
partment or a good fire department. So
let’s not ask the SEC to do that job,
the job of the State Department.
Mr. Speaker, this is only going to be
hurting those American investors,
those American companies, everyday
investors, who are trying to make sure
that they get a reasonable return, yet,
have a concern to protect the Uyghurs

that, unfortunately, this bill fails to
do.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time I have remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 10 minutes remaining
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, disclosure may seem to
be a small thing. It is a powerful thing.
It will force publicly traded companies
to audit their supply chains and ensure
investors are better informed regarding
their investments. Moreover, the re-
ports Congress will receive under this
legislation will help us shape our fu-
ture legislative efforts.
In its letter, supporting H.R. 6270, the
Uyghur American Association stated:
Passing the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclo-
sure Act of 2020, H.R. 6270, is one necessary
step in leveraging our collective power to
put a stop to this genocide.
Mr. Speaker, let me just take a mo-
ment to talk about slavery. And as I
mentioned earlier, those of us who are
descendants of slaves are very much al-
ways interested in what we can do to
stop slavery wherever it is or to stop it
before it starts.
Mr. Speaker and Members, let me
just say, while my friend on the oppo-
site side of the aisle makes an argu-
ment about the inconvenience and the
loss of money to American firms, slav-
ery is always about money. Slavery in
this country was about labor. It was
about using those who they brought
over on slave ships from Africa to pick
cotton, and to enrich those owners on
the plantations that were involved
with cotton as its major trade, as its
major source of income and profit.
So we cannot be sympathetic to any
argument that talks about it is going
to inconvenience investors or Amer-
ican companies. Slavery is about ex-
ploitation and the use of other human
beings in order, basically, to derive a
profit from their work and from the
fact that they are slaves. So when my
friend on the opposite side of the aisle
talks about, he, too, is sympathetic to
the arguments that are made against
slavery—and he points out that his own
wife was a victim of slavery, as he
talks about what happened to her and
her family, as we all know, and we cer-
tainly are opposed to the Holocaust
and what happened—let us focus on the
fact that whether you are talking
about the Holocaust or whether you
are talking about slavery with the
Uyghurs, whether you are talking
about slavery that we experienced as
African Americans brought over on
slave ships, slavery is slavery no mat-
ter where it takes place.
So, no, we are not sympathetic to the
fact that investors may lose money if,
in fact, we stop slavery. We are not
sympathetic to the fact that it is an in-
convenience and that somehow the
SEC should not be burdened with the
responsibility to deal with this, they
don’t know how to deal with this.
Well, I will tell you something: His-
tory has taught us that for all of those
who turned their backs and said, they
didn’t understand, they didn’t see, but
they didn’t agree, but they didn’t know
what was going on, that is how these
injustices continue, when people turn a
blind eye.
I don’t care whether it is the SEC or
any other agency of government who
can make the argument that they are
not equipped to do what we are asking
them to do. Then go and get your act
together and get equipped because the
Congress of the United States is charg-
ing you with this responsibility. And
when you tell me that we should re-
spect the SEC, saying that it has not
had the kind of experience that is need-
ed in order to deal with this issue, let
me just share with you that I don’t
care whether it is an appointee by
Obama or anybody else. One of the rea-
sons I have created a subcommittee on
diversity and inclusion is because most
of the agencies of government, particu-
larly in financial services, you don’t
have people who look like me who are
going to stand up and take on these
issues.
Unfortunately, a lack of caring, a
lack of understanding, a lack of experi-
ence—or whatever you want to call it—
we are about opening up these agencies
so that we have people who will stand
up, just like I am standing up here
today, and teach you about that which
you don’t know, or you don’t under-
stand.
So when I take a look at the SEC or
the OCC or the Treasury or the Federal
Reserve, none of them, none of them
have people in management positions
who will talk about the experiences of
those in this country—African Ameri-
cans and our ancestors—in a way that
will create the sensitivity for change.
So we are always focused and centered
on justice, and we understand injustice
when we see it—we feel it very deeply—
and we are opening up these agencies
and we are providing the leadership on
diversity and inclusion so that we can
get people in these agencies who are
willing to do the job and to help share
the information that is needed to cre-
ate change.
Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation,
which is a most important step to-
wards protecting our investors and
doing our part as global citizens. It is
our moral imperative to do everything
we can to stand up against injustice.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 1129,
the previous question is ordered on the
bill, as amended.
The question is on the engrossment
and third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I have a
motion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. MCHENRY. In its current form,
yes.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. McHenry moves to recommit the bill
H.R. 6270 to the Committee on Financial
Services with instructions to report the
same back to the House forthwith with the
following amendment:
Page 3, after line 2, insert the following:
(9) The bi-partisan, bi-cameral Congres-
sional Executive Commission on China’s 2019
Annual Report made recommendations to
address the human rights atrocities occur-
ring in the XUAR, including recommending
the Administration ‘‘aggregate policy re-
sponses within the U.S. Government to ad-
dress gross human rights violations in the
XUAR, including by Using Global Magnitsky
Human Rights Accountability Act (Public
Law No. 114–328) sanctions to hold account-
able Chinese business entities and officials
complicit in the mass internment and sur-
veillance of Uyghurs and other Turkic Mus-
lim minorities and to encourage like-minded
allies to issue their own sanctions’’.
(10) In the same report, the Commission
recommended Holding Chinese Government
Officials Accountable for Abuses by levying
financial sanctions against Chinese officials
complicit in human rights violations against
the Uyghur people in XUAR.
(11) The Trump Administration has taken
meaningful action to combat human rights
violators in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region (XUAR), including recent sanc-
tions and additions to the Commerce Depart-
ment’s Entity List.
(12) Targeted sanctions, such as financial
sanctions led by the Department of Treas-
ury, are the more effective method for ad-
dressing the issue of human rights violations
against the Uyghurs by authorities of the
People’s Republic of China and for punishing
those bad actors.
Add at the end the following:
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
The sense of the Congress is the following:
(1) Using securities law is misguided and
will not protect the vulnerable in the XUAR
nor does it appropriately target or punish
those that continue to oppress them.
(2) Attempts to address human rights vio-
lations of the type being committed against
the Uyghur people in XUAR using the securi-
ties laws will not improve the quality of life
for the Uyghur people. Freedom for the
Uyghur people will only come by holding the
Chinese Communist Party accountable.
SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.
The amendment made by section 3 shall
take effect on the date that the commis-
sioners of the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission unanimously report to Congress that
the amendment required by section 3 will
improve the lives of the oppressed in the
XUAR and ultimately lead to their freedom,
target bad actors in the Chinese Communist
Party in a more effective manner than sanc-
tions would, and will cause no negative im-
pact on the population similar to the unin-
tended negative effects caused by the con-
flict minerals provisions under section 13(p)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Mr. MCHENRY (during the reading).
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent
to dispense with the reading of the bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from North Carolina?
There was no objection.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5069
September 30, 2020
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
North Carolina is recognized for 5 min-
utes in support of his motion.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this
amendment will not kill the bill. It
will make this a serious piece of legis-
lation rather than just a political talk-
ing point, which is what it currently is.
The legislation will then target real
human rights abuses.
Mr. Speaker, Republicans in this
House have been standing against the
Chinese Communist Party and the ris-
ing threat it presents, not only to the
American businesses in our commu-
nity, in our economy, but also to na-
tional security. And Republicans have
also worked to address the atrocities
committed against the Uyghur people,
including in the House Committee on
Financial Services. Republicans stand
with the Trump administration against
communism and the global threat the
Chinese Government poses, while
Democrats have excused the Chinese
Communist Party’s actions for years.
Just last year, we offered House
Democrats an opportunity in the Com-
mittee on Financial Services, to stand
up against the Chinese Communist
Party, and they didn’t. And we offered
them the opportunity to stand against
human rights abuses against religious
minorities in China, and they didn’t
work with us.
We had those votes when we consid-
ered the reauthorization of U.S. Ex-
port-Import Bank. Instead of joining
us, Democrats voted to allow compa-
nies owned by the Chinese Communist
Party to receive U.S.-taxpayer sub-
sidies, subsidies that support the very
people committing these human rights
atrocities in which they are now, all of
a sudden, a few days before the elec-
tion, against.
Mr. Speaker, if you look at that vote
tally, you will see today’s bill’s spon-
sor’s name. She voted against these Re-
publican measures to hold the Chinese
Communist Party accountable, includ-
ing holding them accountable for
abuses against the Uyghur people. So
what has changed?
Mr. Speaker, I would submit that it
is an election that has made these
things more of a reality for these
Democrats that were very weak on
communist China. Democrats in the
House failed to stand up for the Amer-
ican people and stand against the
human rights abuses of the Uyghur
people. And now 33 days before the
election, they are scrambling to look
tough on China.
b 1215
Let me be clear: This bill is not
tough on China. It actually won’t do
the things that the bill’s sponsor is
saying and committee Democrats are
saying.
If we really want to be tough on
China, we would target and sanction
those responsible to the greatest ex-
tent possible. That is what we did in a
bipartisan way last week with a good
bill that is very workable. We would
support a whole-of-government ap-
proach to combat the rising threat and
ensure the freedom of the Uyghur peo-
ple.
This bill doesn’t do that. This bill
uses the same mechanisms that have
previously failed in their intended pur-
pose. In fact, the last time the Demo-
crats paid lip service to similar human
rights abuses in the Democratic Repub-
lic of Congo, they failed to support the
Congolese miners, while at the same
time costing American companies an
estimated $7 billion. That is just one
example.
If you need more evidence that the
Democrats are not serious about com-
bating the Chinese Communist Party,
just look at their new COVID relief
bill, which would send more than $170
billion to the Chinese Government.
What does that do for small businesses
and their employees who are still hurt-
ing and need our support because of
COVID?
Now, there are many good news
items here. Because Democrats are
feeling vulnerable on China leading up
to this election, we were able to get to-
gether on some pieces of legislation
that would do some positive things in
terms of our relationship with China
and holding them accountable. The bill
last week is a good example of that.
The bill before us today is nothing
more than a press release for an elec-
tion. I think we will see that. I think
we will probably see Democrats using
this in campaign ads, maybe.
My amendment recognizes that sanc-
tioning is the most effective way to
punish bad actors and to address the
human rights violations in Xinjiang, in
the Uyghur Autonomous Region, as
recommended by the bipartisan, bi-
cameral Congressional-Executive Com-
mittee on China in their 2019 report,
the very same report, I might add, that
the author of this bill cites in her bill
to describe the atrocities against the
Uyghur people.
It also ensures the bill accomplishes
its intended purpose: cracking down on
the Chinese Communist Party and end-
ing the human rights atrocities in the
ongoing struggle that the Uyghur peo-
ple are facing.
A vote for this amendment says that
you are serious about addressing the
threats of China and what it poses to
our national security. A vote for this
amendment says that we are serious
about ending the human rights atroc-
ities and serious as legislators.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this motion to recommit, urge
its adoption, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I claim
time in opposition to this motion to re-
commit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Virginia is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman is trying to make this about
me, and nothing could be further from
the truth. This is about the Uyghur
people. This is not about me. This is
not about an election.
Before I was even elected to Con-
gress, I met with Uyghur Muslims in
my district. I have one of the largest
populations of Uyghur diaspora in my
district, and they told me their hor-
rible stories about relatives who dis-
appeared into the camps, who perished
in those camps. So don’t try to make
this about me.
Before I came to Congress, I served in
the Virginia State Senate, and there
we had an expression for when people
tried to change our bills on the floor or
on the fly, and that was, ‘‘Get your
own bill.’’
It is disappointing that my Repub-
lican colleagues are politicizing this
issue and opposing this bill, especially
when we have been hearing for so long
how Democrats are weak on China.
But, when given the chance to hold the
Chinese Government responsible for
gross human rights abuses and reveal
the extent of the system of forced
labor, it turns out Republicans aren’t
all that interested.
Crimes against humanity, and per-
haps even genocide, are being com-
mitted by the Chinese Government. Re-
publicans talk a good game, but only if
it doesn’t create any kind of burden on
U.S. corporations or their profit mar-
gins, profit that may be earned off of
the backs of slave labor.
During debate on this bill, the other
side made it clear that they don’t be-
lieve that corporations, publicly traded
companies, should be held responsible
for knowing the origins of their prod-
ucts. The other side is saying that
companies can turn a blind eye to
genocide and not have to disclose to
their shareholders about the use of
slave labor in their supply chains.
This MTR is more of the same. It
neuters the bill and adds a sense of
Congress. Well, Congress has a sense al-
ready: The exploitation and enslave-
ment of the Uyghurs must stop. Ameri-
cans don’t want to purchase goods
made with slave labor.
So maybe my colleagues are fol-
lowing the lead of the President, who
seems to be okay with what is hap-
pening in Xinjiang. When given the op-
portunity to confront Xi over the mass
internment of Uyghurs, Trump actu-
ally encouraged them to carry on
building the camps. He said it was ‘‘the
right thing to do.’’ That is according to
his former National Security Advisor,
John Bolton.
With only the interpreters present,
Xi had explained to Trump why he was
basically building concentration camps
in Xinjiang. According to our inter-
preter, Trump said that Xi should go
ahead and build the camps, which
Trump thought was exactly the right
thing to do.
Maybe you don’t believe John
Bolton—I certainly question his integ-
rity—but Donald Trump admitted it.
When he was asked, he said: ‘‘Well, we
were in the middle of a major trade
deal.’’

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material about the
measure before us.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia?
There was no objection.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the Information Tech-
nology Modernization Centers of Excel-
lence Program Act is the product of
great bipartisan work between Rep-
resentative RO KHANNA and the rank-
ing member of our committee, Mr.
COMER.
Since 2017, the Centers of Excellence
have provided state-of-the-art tech-
nical expertise to assist Federal agen-
cies with their IT modernization so
that they can serve the American peo-
ple more effectively.
The program aims to leverage pri-
vate-sector innovation and centralized
expertise to help the Federal Govern-
ment improve its services to the pub-
lic, deploy cutting-edge technology, at-
tract top talent to its workforce, en-
hance its cybersecurity, and optimize
the data resources available to it.
Today, six Centers of Excellence sup-
port agencies in the strategic com-
petency areas of artificial intelligence,
cloud adoption, contact centers, cus-
tomer experience, data and analytics,
and infrastructure optimization.
This bill would codify that program
and to support agencies in efficiently
improving customer service, imple-
menting cloud computing systems and
data management, optimizing IT infra-
structure, and sharing best practices
and expertise.
As chairman of the Subcommittee on
Government Operations with responsi-
bility for Federal IT modernization, I
have kept a close eye on this program
since its inception, and I intend to
keep a close eye as it continues to put
its mission and goals into practice.
I applaud the improvements made to
the bill to ensure that assistance is

September 30, 2020
provided to agencies by request on a re-
imbursable and transparent basis.
I support the commonsense bill be-
fore us to modernize and improve the
functioning of the Federal Govern-
ment.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
5901, the Information Technology Mod-
ernization Centers of Excellence Pro-
gram Act. This bill will help our gov-
ernment catch up with private-sector
innovations by equipping agencies to
take advantage of modern information
technology solutions.
Federal agencies remain challenged
by inefficient, costly, and unwieldy
legacy technology systems that do not
adequately deliver citizen services and
allow agencies to achieve their legally
mandated missions.
For example, the Government Ac-
countability Office has reported that,
between 2010 and 2017, the Federal Gov-
ernment spent over $450 billion just
maintaining outdated legacy IT sys-
tems. That is over 70 percent of the
government’s entire IT budget.
There is increasingly less and less
Federal IT funding available for new
agency modernization projects. The
government needs to take advantage of
the cutting-edge technology solutions
already being used by the private sec-
tor.
Recognizing the need for a different
approach to transition large Federal
agency technology projects, the Cen-
ters of Excellence were established by
the Trump administration at the Gen-
eral Services Administration to help
agencies overcome persistent mod-
ernization challenges.
These challenges include identifying
the best new technology solutions, pur-
chasing that technology, and then inte-
grating that technology into an agen-
cy’s unique operations and workflows.
The GSA Centers of Excellence teams
serve as change management consult-
ants that bring private-sector best
practices to Federal agency technology
challenges.
By adopting commercially available
solutions, in conjunction with delib-
erate enterprise-wide transformation
planning, agencies can effectively tran-
sition into modern operating environ-
ments. By improving the operational
efficiency of our Federal agency pro-
grams and mission, we can save tax-
payer dollars.
While modernizing government is
good for the taxpayer, the Centers of
Excellence also deliver an additional
benefit to Americans by bringing a cen-
tral focus to improving agency delivery
on constituent services.
H.R. 5901 promises to make the citi-
zens’ engagement with our government
programs more intuitive and straight-
forward, like an engagement with a
modern business.
I am well aware of the challenges
faced by veterans, senior citizens, and
businesses when interacting with the
Federal Government. I am sure that
my colleagues are as well.
The current pandemic has shown how
critical it is for all Americans to be
able to effectively and reliably interact
with government agencies. It is time
the Federal Government leveraged
modern cloud computing systems,
data-driven analytic capabilities, arti-
ficial intelligence, and modern cus-
tomer experience tools to offer the
highest level of service possible.
H.R. 5901 will give congressional
backing and ensure regular oversight
of the existing GSA program in order
to accomplish these goals.
By giving legal authority to the pro-
gram, we are also ensuring the pro-
gram’s stability through the next two
Presidential administrations, which is
critical to gaining agency buy-in and
having the time to realize the benefits
of this new modernization approach.
The Congressional Budget Office’s re-
view of this bill found that it will have
no budgetary impact, which shows that
there are still legislative opportunities
to modernize the government without
spending additional taxpayer funds.
I hope the House Oversight and Re-
form Committee and this Congress can
continue to work together on similar
legislative reforms to bring our govern-
ment into the 21st century.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
leagues for their bipartisan work on
this bill. I encourage my colleagues to
support H.R. 5901, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. KHANNA), the author of this
bill.
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Chairman CONNOLLY for his leadership
on this, on FITARA, and on so many
efforts to bring technology to our gov-
ernment. I thank the gentlewoman
from West Virginia and the bipartisan
committee that has helped bring this
legislation to the floor, including the
majority and minority staffs.
Mr. Speaker, we worked with the
White House Office of Innovation and
Matt Lira on this. The idea was very
simple. We in the Federal Government
should have cutting-edge technology in
our Federal agencies. As a representa-
tive of Silicon Valley, it has always
perplexed me why the world’s greatest
institution, the strongest institution,
the United States Government, can’t
adopt the latest technology.
What this bill does is says that we
need to have digital expertise in the
General Service Administration, about
50 to 150 individuals who will help all of
our Federal agencies adopt cloud com-
puting, adopt artificial intelligence,
adopt the latest technology moderniza-
tion and infrastructure, adopt the best
digital practices for customer service.
We want our Federal Government to
be user friendly. We want our Federal
Government to use all the tools of
technology to be competitive, to be the
leader in the world. That is what this
bill does.
I want to applaud the bipartisan spir-
it in which this bill came to the floor.
It was originally the White House Chief
of Staff Mark Meadows who was the co-
sponsor of the legislation. I thank him,
as well as the cosponsor, now the rank-
ing member, Representative RICE. On
the Senate side, we have bipartisan
commitment from the leadership of
Senator PORTMAN and Senator MAGGIE
HASSAN. So I am hopeful that this will
actually become law and allow us to
continue to compete.
I just want to end by thanking Geo
Saba, a staff member who was extraor-
dinarily helpful on this; as well as,
again, the committee staff that has
been excellent to work with; and, of
course, Chairwoman CAROLYN MALO-
NEY, who helped bring this to the floor.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan government reform bill, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good
bill. I think as Mr. KHANNA indicated,
it adds to the corpus of information
technology legislation where we are
trying to modernize the Federal Gov-
ernment; we are trying to retire legacy
systems; we are trying to move to the
cloud for cyber reasons, for efficiency
reasons, and to be of better service to
the American people.
I think this is another piece in that
mosaic, and I urge its passage by our
colleagues here in the House.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5901, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material about the
measure before us.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia?
There was no objection.

Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the Chai
Suthammanont Remembrance Act
would require each Federal agency to
publish online a plan to reopen the
Federal office building at least 30 days
prior to the return of their workforce.
The legislation also requires agency in-
spectors general to report on whether
their agencies have, in fact, complied
with the provisions in this bill and pro-
vided adequate personal protective
equipment for their employees return-
ing to office spaces.
This bill is named after my con-
stituent who tragically lost his life to
coronavirus on May 26, 2020. Chai’s pic-
ture is behind me. Chai was a real
human being. He wasn’t a statistic. He
left behind a family. He is survived by
four sons, his wife, and four grand-
children. He succumbed on May 26,
2020.
Chai immigrated to the United
States from Thailand when he was 17.
Throughout his life he was known for
helping others.
When he first came to our country,
he landed in the restaurant industry at
a famous jazz club in Greenwich Vil-
lage in New York City, where he made
it among the first restaurants to offer
health insurance to its employees.
After retiring from that industry,
Chai moved to the National Capitol Re-
gion and returned to work as a Federal
employee in the Marine Corps Commu-
nity Services Child Development Cen-
ter in Quantico, Virginia. Chai wanted
to continue giving back to his adopted
country. He was a proud American cit-
izen.
Chai was also a beloved employee
working in the development center’s
kitchen, preparing meals for the chil-
dren of our Marine families. He devel-
oped a unique handshake for each kid
in the daycare, making each child feel
special and included.
At the beginning of this terrible pan-
demic, Chai’s workplace was not en-
forcing or taking proper precautions to
protect its workers. On April 27, Chai
worked his last full shift at the
daycare kitchen as one of his cowork-
ers coughed repeatedly and looked very
ill. There was no protective equipment
for the other employees, including
Chai.
Sadly, soon after that, Chai was in-
formed that the coworker had, indeed,
tested positive for coronavirus. Almost
exactly 1 month later, after 13 days on
a ventilator, Chai died on May 26.
Let me be clear: This was an avoid-
able death. Had there been protocols in
place, had there been PPE in place and
available to employees like Chai, Chai
would still be alive today, in my view.
Chai’s widow, Christina, has worked
with my office to make sure this never
happens to anybody else again.
I named the bill after Chai because,
although the provisions in this bill can
no longer help him, they can help the
millions of Federal and contract work-
ers who will reenter the Federal work
spaces across the United States.
This legislation is designed to save
lives and protect those who serve the
American people.
We, as Members of Congress, have an
absolute obligation to protect the Fed-
eral workforce that keeps our country
running, keeps our country safe. We
must ensure that Federal employees
have the most accurate and up-to-date
information regarding agencies’ re-
opening plans.
Currently, Federal agencies are fail-
ing to communicate with employees
across the board and other stake-
holders about their coronavirus prac-
tices and policies. As some agencies
begin calling employees back to Fed-
eral office buildings, many civil serv-
ants are receiving incomplete or un-
clear instructions, leading to fear and
uncertainty about health.
I represent the third largest number
of Federal employees of any congres-
sional district in America, but there
are Federal employees in every Federal
congressional district. This bill mat-
ters and ought to matter to every one
of us and our constituents.
I refuse to sit idly by and risk more
and more of our Federal workforce
being forced back to office buildings
under superficial plans with zero ac-
countability. This bill simply includes
the commonsense provisions taken di-
rectly from the best practices rec-
ommendations of the Government Ac-
countability Office to communicate ef-
fectively with the workforce and to en-
sure they have adequate PPE. The
Trump Office of Management and
Budget had no concerns with this bill.
The least we can do for our Federal
employees is to ensure the Federal
agencies they work for are being trans-
parent with their plans so that there is
a level of reassurance and security be-
fore they are called back physically to
the workplace.
I wholeheartedly support this bill
dedicated to my constituent Chai, and
I encourage every one of my colleagues
to join me in doing the same.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the Chai
Suthammanont Remembrance Act is
well-intentioned legislation.
First, let me send my deepest condo-
lences to Chai’s family. He sounds like
such a beloved person. I am sure Chai
is greatly missed.
Each and every COVID–19-related
tragedy is a stark reminder of the pre-
ciousness of life. America has faced as-
tonishing challenges over the last 6
months with this global struggle.
As the Nation’s largest employer, the
Federal Government has offices and
employees across the Nation in every
State and territory. There are unprece-
dented challenges facing our Federal
workforce and the management of our
government’s many facilities. Every
single State and territory is working
overtime to operate under a disruptive
emergency declaration.
The work of our Federal agencies’ di-
verse workforce is more critical than
ever, and they are working around the

clock. It is critical that the Federal
agencies have stepped up to the plate
to answer the calls for help.
President Trump and his team at the
Office of Management and Budget and
the Office of Personnel Management
should be commended for issuing time-
ly directives that gave agencies the
necessary guidance and flexibility to
accomplish their missions.
The requirements of this bill may du-
plicate planned administration and
agency actions. Therefore, the bill
could have benefited from further com-
mittee work to avoid potential duplica-
tion. However, H.R. 7340 is well inten-
tioned, and I support governmentwide
transparency.
I have heard my colleague, Mr. CON-
NOLLY, speak passionately about Mr.
Chai, about his character and his pas-
sion for working with children, and my
thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily, friends, and colleagues that knew
him so well.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my friend, Mrs. MILLER, for her
kind remarks, and I certainly know
they will be appreciated by his widow,
Christina.
Mr. Speaker, we have no further
speakers on this side, and I am pre-
pared to close.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no
further comments on this bill, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my friends in the House, on a bipar-
tisan basis, to join with me in honoring
Chai and preventing further deaths and
further infections from COVID–19 with-
in the Federal workforce and the Fed-
eral contract workforce. This is a pru-
dent measure, and, as I said, President
Trump’s OMB does not oppose this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of
this bill, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7340, as

The question was taken; and (two-

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure before us.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia?
There was no objection.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives
BRAD SCHNEIDER and JOHN KATKO for
their strong bipartisan work on this
good-government bill.
Reflecting back on the outbreak of
the pandemic, I think we can all agree
that our Nation and the Federal Gov-
ernment were not prepared for what
lay ahead. Conflicting safety and work-
from-home guidelines caused confusion
across the Federal workforce. We
didn’t have a clear understanding of
how the virus spread or how best to re-
spond to it, so agencies managing of-
fices and priorities across the country
were left to make their own best deci-
sions as they saw it. Many agencies
were not telework-ready, and we did
not grasp the sheer length of time that
this pandemic would last, let alone
plan for it.
Now with the winter months ap-
proaching, the projections are grim. In
June, the University of Washington
School of Medicine predicted 200,000
U.S. deaths by October, a number we
had already passed by September 22.
Their model now predicts, sadly, the
death rate will more than double by
the end of this year. In all likelihood,
the worst is still to come. But this
time we can and must be prepared.
To make sure the Federal Govern-
ment is ready for the challenges ahead,
the COVID PREPARE Act would re-
quire each Federal agency submit to
Congress an initial action plan for ad-
dressing and managing any resurgence
of coronavirus cases. The plans would
use the important lessons learned since
the onset of the coronavirus crisis to
develop data-driven blueprints for an-
ticipating and addressing any resur-
gence. The bill also would require
agencies to provide quarterly progress
reports to Congress.
Agencies should already be engaging
in the strategic evidence-based plan-
ning required by this bill, so compli-
ance ought not to be difficult. Adding
this important step would maximize
the impact of these plans by ensuring
transparency and accountability
through oversight.
It is more urgent than ever that Fed-
eral agencies ensure the responsible
stewardship of taxpayer dollars while
protecting their workforces and the
most effective pandemic response pos-
sible by committing to a sound and
transparent planning and preparedness
process.
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this
thoughtful bill as a complement to the
bill we just passed, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R.
7496, the COVID PREPARE Act of 2020.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5076 September 30, 2020
The bill requires every Federal agen-
cy to report COVID–19 resurgent action
plans to Congress. These plans will
cover agency pandemic resurgence
preparations to assure agency mission
continuity.
The bill also requires agencies to out-
line their communication plans to nec-
essary stakeholders, including Con-
gress, States, and localities, and enti-
ties in the agency’s jurisdiction. Fi-
nally, the bill requires quarterly up-
dates on these plans through the end of
the pandemic. This, of course, pre-
sumes a resurgence of the pandemic,
which we hope will not happen.
In discussing this bill, we would be
remiss if we did not commend the work
the Federal agencies and their work-
force have already done and continue
to do combating COVID–19 across our
Nation.
We should recognize the progress we
have made as a nation in fighting this
global pandemic. Thanks to this ad-
ministration’s leadership, we are see-
ing continual progress in the
coronavirus fight.
The President’s Cabinet and agency
leaders have been constantly evalu-
ating the pandemic and making deci-
sions in real time, with the safety of
the Federal workforce and the Amer-
ican public as their primary goal.
As our collective knowledge of
COVID–19 evolves, Congress needs to
ensure that the legislation we advance
empowers Federal agencies to make
these critical real-time decisions. Con-
gress needs to be careful about contin-
ually laying on new reporting require-
ments to already-strained Federal
agencies.
b 1300
These agencies are currently respon-
sible to congressional oversight, and
new, broadly defined reporting require-
ments can have the unintended con-
sequences of redirecting scarce agency
resources during a national emergency.
H.R. 7496 requires, within 30 days of
the legislation’s enactment, that every
Federal agency communicates plans to
Congress for how they will handle the
unthinkable; this pandemic worsening.
The bill’s language is broad, and we
didn’t have the opportunity to fully en-
gage in debate on what it means and
what metrics we are using.
Legislation like this could have bene-
fited from additional work in our com-
mittee to clarify its intentions.
Fortunately, the agencies already
have plans in place, and we hope the re-
surgence action plans envisioned by
this bill won’t be needed.
Thanks to the administration’s Oper-
ation Warp Speed, the American people
are optimistic that the Food and Drug
Administration will shortly announce
a safe and effective vaccine.
In the meantime, we need to work in
Congress to assure that Federal agen-
cies are able to remain fully focused on
handling their present work and chal-
lenges so that we can stop this virus.
Our constituents sent us here to
work together, put partisanship aside,
and ensure our Nation’s government
has the resources that it needs.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues on legislation that helps our
government remain effective at fight-
ing this pandemic.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I do think it is impor-
tant when we talk about Operation
Warp Speed and we talk about the
promise of vaccines, that we remind
ourselves that not all vaccines are cu-
rative. In fact, many vaccines exist to
lessen the severity of the illness that
could follow.
We are 100 years after the Spanish
flu, and we still don’t have a cure for
the flu. We have an annual vaccine to
lessen the severity of the illness should
you get it and to prevent it in some
cases, but not a cure.
We have been grappling with AIDS
for over 40 years. We don’t have a drug
or a vaccine that completely cures
AIDS.
So when we talk to the American
public, we have to be careful about the
implied promise or explicit promise
those of us in public life make.
That is why I think Mr. SCHNEIDER’s
bill and Mr. KATKO’s bill is so impor-
tant. In the event we don’t have a vac-
cine that is efficacious, we need to
have contingency planning.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEI-
DER), the author of this bill and my
friend.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Virginia
(Mr. CONNOLLY), my friend, for yielding
me the time.
I rise today in support of the COVID
PREPARE Act, H.R. 7496.
As I stand here, our Nation stands at
more than 7 million Americans con-
firmed infected with the SARS-Cov-2
virus and more than 206,000 American
lives lost to COVID–19.
The scale and scope of this pandemic
is unprecedented in American history,
causing dual national crises: one of
public health, the other of economic
calamity.
Over the past 6 months, the pandemic
has affected all of us, putting our loved
ones at risk, overwhelming our
healthcare systems, keeping our kids
out of school, devastating our busi-
nesses, and pushing State and local
governments to the brink.
Most experts agree that things are
likely to get worse before they get bet-
ter. According to Reuters, for the week
ending September 27, total new cases
are up 10 percent from the prior week.
Daily new cases are again rising, with
The New York Times reporting a 23
percent increase in average daily cases
over 2 weeks ago. And The Times shows
that more than half of U.S. States al-
ready have high rates of infection—at
least 15 cases per 100,000 population—or
are concerningly facing rising rates of
infection.
So many people are suffering and
looking to their government for relief.
They needed help as they navigated the
daunting challenges of spring and sum-
mer, and they want confidence that the
Federal Government, our entire gov-
ernment, has a plan as we head into
the fall and winter.
Every day I hear from constituents
in my community, Illinois’ 10th Con-
gressional District, about how they are
struggling to cope. I hear from parents
juggling full-time jobs while schooling
their children; from small business
owners scraping to pay their bills and
worried they may have to shut their
doors forever; from healthcare workers
forced to use and reuse their PPE, the
personal protective equipment that
keeps them safe—for up to an entire
week because of ongoing shortages of
supplies; from city mayors and village
presidents forced into cutting essential
services and laying off critical work-
ers; from individuals of all ages and in
all stages of life concerned about their
future and the future of our country.
With the timeline for rolling out a
safe and effective vaccine still un-
known, it is imperative that the gov-
ernment develop and implement com-
prehensive strategies for beating back
this virus and mitigating its effect on
our healthcare system, on our econ-
omy, and our lives and our livelihoods.
This is not about politics. Congress
and the administration must work to-
gether to provide immediate relief to
those suffering now and get us on a
path to full recovery as soon as pos-
sible.
We can’t get there by ignoring our
challenges or by wishing them away.
We can only get to the other side of
these crises with clear-eyed assessment
and realistic, fact-based, science-driven
solutions.
These are the ideas that lie behind
the COVID PREPARE Act. This is bi-
partisan, commonsense legislation,
crafted with my friend JOHN KATKO, to
assure the American people that their
Federal Government is fully prepared
to address this ever-changing public
health crisis and economic crisis.
This legislation would require Fed-
eral agencies to submit to Congress
their plans for addressing surges of
COVID–19, anticipating a potential in-
crease in infections and even greater
demands on our healthcare system and
pressure on our economy.
Trying to anticipate the unforeseen
is always a difficult task, but any num-
ber of our ills—from shortages of PPE,
to nationwide testing strategies, to
school reopening protocols—could be at
least partially cured by thoughtful
planning and careful preparation.
The COVID PREPARE Act will pro-
vide bipartisan oversight and full
transparency in both the planning and
execution of our national response.
The goal of this legislation is not to
tell our Federal agencies what to do.
Rather, this bill provides the American
people transparency and confidence
that their government is putting their

ticipating what resources and re-
sponses will be required in the imme-
diate, middle, and long-term battle
against COVID; and that we are taking
the necessary steps at the Federal level
to maximize our likelihood of national
success.
In a time of such great uncertainty,
any reassurances we can provide our
country should and will be a welcome
salve.
I will say it again: ending the pan-
demic should not, should not be a par-
tisan issue. We need to move forward
together, Democrats and Republicans.
My bill seeks to do just that, and to
take an aggressive approach to tack-
ling this urgent public health crisis.
We can certainly hope for the best,
but we must responsibly prepare for
the worst.

everybody that bad planning exacer-

of this pandemic. And if we have

our Federal agencies.

GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, the government’s latest
reports describe violence by white su-
premacists as a significant terrorist
threat to the homeland.
In fact, it was recently reported that
DHS analysts assessed ‘‘the threat
from white supremacists as the dead-
liest domestic terror threat facing the
U.S.’’
Further, this past week, a DHS offi-
cial testified before a Senate com-
mittee that attacks by white suprema-
cists are on average the most lethal of
domestic terrorist actors.
This statement came on the heels of
testimony before the Senate Homeland
Security and Governmental Affairs
Committee by FBI Director Chris-
topher Wray, who stated that racially-
motivated violent extremists are ‘‘the
most lethal of all domestic extrem-
ists,’’ and that white supremacists are
the number one threat within that
group.
We have also seen evidence that this
threat is increasingly linked to indi-
viduals and groups abroad.
Last year, the perpetrators of terror
attacks in El Paso, Texas, and Poway,
California, drew inspiration from the
deadly white supremacist attack in
Christchurch, New Zealand.
There are indications that the links
go beyond mere inspiration.
Reports have documented that white
supremacists have traveled inter-
nationally to train with neo-Nazi mili-
tant groups in war zone environments.
By some accounts, white supremacist
groups are drawing on jihadist tactics
to organize, and the threat they pose is
no less deadly.
The Transnational White Suprema-
cist Extremism Review Act would re-
quire the Department of Homeland Se-
curity to disseminate a terrorist threat
assessment regarding foreign, violent
white supremacist extremist groups to
State and local law enforcement part-
ners.
The bill also authorizes DHS to share
information regarding symbols used by
such groups with social media compa-
nies to assist in efforts to identify con-
tent that may violate their terms of
service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5078 September 30, 2020
The bill includes vital civil rights
and civil liberties safeguards to protect
First Amendment rights.
The first step in confronting a threat
is making sure that the people on the
front lines have the information they
need to understand it.
When it comes to the white suprema-
cist threat, that is exactly what this
bill would do.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
b 1315
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
I rise today in strong support of H.R.
5736, the Transnational White Su-
premacist Extremism Review Act.
H.R. 5736 requires the Department of
Homeland Security Undersecretary for
Intelligence and Analysis, I&A, to co-
ordinate with Federal partners and de-
velop a terrorism threat assessment
concerning homeland threats related to
‘‘foreign violent white supremacist ex-
tremist organizations.’’
This bill further requires I&A to
share the information with State and
local law enforcement partners, as well
as fusion centers. Ensuring that State
and local law enforcement and fusion
centers have access to information on
current and emerging threats is a fun-
damental responsibility of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, particu-
larly the Office of Intelligence and
Analysis.
The Trump administration has taken
significant action to address domestic
extremism, including white supremacy.
The creation of the Office of Targeted
Violence and Terrorism Prevention in
April 2019 and the release of the DHS
Strategic Framework for Countering
Terrorism and Targeted Violence in
September 2019 demonstrate a coordi-
nated and comprehensive commitment
to addressing emerging threats in both
international and domestic terrorism.
Subcommittee Ranking Member
WALKER led our efforts to negotiate
changes to the base bill during the
committee markup. I want to thank
Subcommittee Chairman ROSE for ac-
cepting our changes to the bill. I urge
its passage, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield as much time as he may consume
to the gentleman from New York (Mr.
ROSE), the sponsor of this bill.
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois
for yielding her time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my
bill, H.R. 5736, the Transnational White
Supremacist Review Act.
Today, our country faces a wide
range of complex threats to our safety,
our security, and our way of life. Not
only are American families having to
keep their communities safe and their
economy together in the face of
COVID, but in large swaths of the
country, they are doing so while deal-
ing with more frequent and cata-
strophic natural disasters.
Sadly, though, amidst all of this, ter-
rorism does not stop. The homeland se-
curity threat posed by white suprema-
cist extremists is pervasive and per-
sistent. Extremists exploit such crises
as we are in right now. Often, this in-
volves the targeting of the most vul-
nerable in society.
Earlier this year, the Directors of the
FBI and the National Counterterrorism
Center testified before our committee
regarding the unrelenting nature of
bad actors during times like these.
Both testified to the significant home-
land security threat posed by racially
motivated domestic actors, primarily
white supremacist extremists.
In my capacity as chair of the Intel-
ligence and Counterterrorism Sub-
committee, I have joined with my col-
leagues to raise the alarm about this
threat. In carrying out my work on the
committee, I have identified a common
theme. And that is, plain and simple,
that this white supremacist domestic
terrorist problem is, in fact, not do-
mestic at all. It is global in nature.
Look no further than the deadly at-
tacks in El Paso, Texas, and Poway,
California, last year. The U.S. experi-
enced firsthand the ramifications of an
international white supremacist move-
ment when two domestic actors inde-
pendently drew inspiration from the
foreign terrorists who committed the
Christchurch, New Zealand, attack.
Troublingly, there are reports that
white supremacist groups have adapted
recruitment tactics and begun using
training camps modeled after jihadist
groups like al-Qaida and ISIS.
Just last week, a former Trump ad-
ministration counterterrorism official
confirmed that training by foreign
groups is happening when she acknowl-
edged that there have been instances
when our foreign counterterrorism
partners have alerted us to the fact
that U.S. citizens were in their coun-
tries to conduct trainings or partici-
pate in trainings with white suprema-
cist movements.
These foreign partners told this
former official that the U.S. is an ex-
porter of this ideology and must ad-
dress this problem.
This is exactly what this bill today
seeks to address, a bill designed to send
a message to our foreign partners that
Congress hears them and is taking ac-
tion.
This bill would require DHS to
produce and circulate a threat assess-
ment on foreign violent white suprema-
cist extremist groups to local law en-
forcement. It would also push social
media companies to do so much more
in addressing this threat. Crucially,
this bill includes civil rights and civil
liberty safeguards as well.
Countering white supremacy will re-
quire a whole-of-society approach, edu-
cation, awareness, and so on.
Through our work on this com-
mittee, we found that Americans stay
safest when law enforcement at all lev-
els is equipped with the best available
information. This bill makes sure that
our frontline responders in the law en-
forcement community have just that.
It is endorsed by the ADL, an expert
advocacy group that has tracked the
white supremacist threat for decades.
It is also endorsed by the Blue Dog Co-
alition, a group that looks past par-
tisanship and advocates for common-
sense national security solutions.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on its passage.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the
bill, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
As the surge in white supremacist ex-
tremist attacks in the United States
and around world puts all of us at risk,
I commend my committee colleague
Mr. ROSE for introducing this legisla-
tion, and I urge passage.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

woman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of H.R. 5780, the Safe Commu-
nities Act.
Last month, a teenager from my dis-
trict in Antioch, Illinois, went to Keno-
sha, Wisconsin, where he allegedly
killed two people with an AR–15-style
rifle.
The next day, I heard from another
constituent, a mother who lives in the
alleged shooter’s hometown. She wrote:
‘‘There is a militia cell in Antioch that
is becoming more and more
emboldened to take the law into their
own hands. I am becoming fearful to
send my children to the same schools
at white supremacist militia mem-
bers.’’
I share my constituents’ concerns
with the rise of domestic violent extre-
mism in this country. FBI Director
Wray recently testified before the
House Homeland Security Committee
that white supremacist extremists are
a leading threat to our Nation.
I believe we must do more to address
the root causes of violent behavior, and
I look forward to continuing to work
with my colleagues in Congress to
make America a place where racism,
misogyny, and other forms of hate can
no longer flourish.
Meanwhile, in the face of extremist
threats like these, we must take imme-
diate action to secure our critical in-
frastructure and make soft targets less
vulnerable to attack.
In addition to domestic extremists,
our suburban and rural communities
face too many other threats of mass vi-
olence. Just last year, five of our
neighbors, four of whom were my con-
stituents, were killed by an act of gun
violence at the Henry Pratt Company
in Aurora, Illinois. Our workplaces,
schools, and places of worship are far
too vulnerable to mass shootings and
other forms of targeted violence. This
bill seeks to fix that.
Rural and suburban communities
like mine in northern Illinois are in-
creasingly targets of violence but often
don’t have access to the Federal re-
sources they need to protect them-
selves. That is why I introduced H.R.
5780, the Safe Communities Act of 2020,
bipartisan legislation to help better
protect soft targets in communities
like mine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5080 September 30, 2020
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency’s protective security
advisers help improve security at
schools, places of worship, and other
soft targets, but there are too few of
them to meet the demand of their serv-
ices.
H.R. 5780 would require CISA to
maintain an online security resources
clearinghouse to provide security guid-
ance and best practices, serving as a
one-stop shop for school districts, reli-
gious organizations, and local officials
to find the information they need to
keep their communities safe.
The bill would also require CISA to
develop a stakeholder outreach and
operational engagement strategy and
implementation plan to ensure that
the Agency is delivering infrastructure
security services across sectors and
throughout regions.
Finally, H.R. 5780 would authorize a
PSA force multiplier pilot program,
which would require CISA PSAs to
train State, local, Tribal, and terri-
torial officials to perform security vul-
nerability and terrorism risk assess-
ments. These risk assessments are an
important part of qualifying for
FEMA’s security grants; the force mul-
tiplier program will help expand access
to them.
I am proud that the Safe Commu-
nities Act of 2020 has been endorsed by
the Jewish Federations of North Amer-
ica and the Anti-Defamation League.
I would like to thank my colleague,
Mr. KATKO, for joining me in intro-
ducing this measure. I am grateful for
his collaboration and leadership as
ranking member of the Subcommittee
on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Pro-
tection, and Innovation.
I want to extend my sincere apprecia-
tion to the Homeland Security Com-
mittee staff for their work on this leg-
islation.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to support this legislation
today to make sure every community
in America has the resources it needs
to keep people safe.
I urge my colleagues to support H.R.
5780, and I reserve the balance of my

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.

I rise in support of H.R. 5780. This bill

rity Agency more accessible to stake-
holders.
CISA provides advice and rec-
ommendations upon the request of crit-
ical infrastructure owners and opera-
tors on how to secure and protect their
facilities in cyberspace and physically.
This bill will help stakeholders clear-
ly know what CISA can do. Continuing
to develop the relationship between
CISA and our private stakeholders re-
mains an integral piece of our critical
infrastructure security.
I thank Representatives UNDERWOOD

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I

Last week, I was appointed as the
new chair of the Subcommittee on Cy-

rity Committee. It is a great honor and
opportunity for me to amplify the
homeland security concerns of the peo-
ple of Illinois’ 14th Congressional Dis-
trict here in Washington.

My constituents are concerned about
the vulnerability of so-called soft tar-
gets to violence. CISA, which is over-
seen by my subcommittee, has a crit-
ical role to play to empower commu-

against ever-increasing lists of home-
land security threats.
I am committed to ensuring the suc-
cess of the PSA program, and I look
forward to working with CISA to make
sure that every community can benefit
from it. Enactment of the Safe Com-
munities Act of 2020 will help CISA
think more strategically about how it
deploys PSAs and other services and do
so in a way that will scale.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) and the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Illinois.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I don’t need to tell any-
one here that cyberattacks against
State and local governments are grow-
ing more frequent and more sophisti-
cated. In 2019, there were over 100
ransomware attacks on State and local
governments.
From major cities like New Orleans
and Baltimore to small towns across
Texas, cyberattacks sought to cripple
the ability of governments across the
country to carry out basic functions,
from processing real estate trans-
actions to collecting payments for
services.
The cost is more than just a mere in-
convenience. A ransomware attack
against a State and local government
can disrupt lifeline services, like 911
call centers and public hospitals, and
extort money those governments do
not have.
Last summer, the mayor of Atlanta,
Keisha Lance Bottoms, testified before
my subcommittee that the ransomware
attack that hit her city in 2018 cost
city taxpayers $7.2 million to recover
from, but experts expect that cost to
grow to as much as $17 million.
The COVID–19 pandemic, by dramati-
cally expanding the threat landscape
and making government networks
more attractive targets for hackers,
has made the situation more dire. More
Americans than ever before are work-
ing from home. That includes State
and local government workers who
may be less accustomed to teleworking
and less prepared to do it securely.
At the same time, the cyber risk to
State and local networks has increased
dramatically due to unprecedented de-
mand for online services, including un-
employment compensation and human
services applications.
The transition to online learning
that COVID–19 has forced many schools
to undertake has also not been without
incident. According to Education
Week, there have been 220 cyberattacks
against schools so far this year. And
while the pandemic is bringing the vul-
nerability of our school districts’ net-
works into focus, it is worth noting
that there have been over 1,000
cyberattacks against school districts
since 2016, according to the K–12 Re-
search Center.
Despite the urgent need to address
their cyber vulnerabilities, many State
and local governments are not in a po-
sition to do so without outside assist-
ance, as they are overwhelmed by the
challenges of maintaining basic serv-
ices in the face of steep COVID–19-re-
lated revenue losses.
It is time for the Federal Govern-
ment to step up and help. Passing H.R.
5823, the State and Local Cybersecurity
Improvement Act, which I am proud to
cosponsor, is an important first step.
The bill would establish a $400 mil-
lion targeted grant program to help
States and local governments develop
robust cybersecurity capabilities. Im-
portantly, it requires States to pay a
graduated match to incentivize them
to budget better for cybersecurity.
And it requires the Department of
Homeland Security to create a plan to
improve the cybersecurity posture of
State and local governments to ensure
that Federal resources align with State
goals and objectives. The smart invest-
ments we make in the cybersecurity of
our State and local governments now
will pay for themselves in the future.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 5823, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of H.R. 5823.
Preparing our State, local, Tribal,
and territorial governments for the in-
creasing number of cyber threats they
face is a necessary priority.
Cybersecurity preparedness is inef-
fective if our only focus is on Federal
preparedness. It is incumbent on us to
ensure that our State and local part-
ners are taking advantage of the re-
sources that we can offer so they, too,
can prepare for the threats that they
might face. H.R. 5823 will do just that.
It establishes a matching grant pro-
gram for State and local governments
to access and close vulnerabilities in
their IT systems.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives
Richmond and Katko for their bill, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER).
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing.
Before I start, I want to acknowledge
the gentlewoman’s leadership position.
I was sitting in my chair—I have been
dealing with cyber issues for a long
time—and when I heard Mr. JOYCE
agree with the gentlewoman, I almost
fell out of my chair, but I didn’t. I real-
ly applaud both Members for working
together.
Cyber issues are some of the most
important national security issues that
our country faces, internationally and
also within our country, and coming
together like this is how we get things
done for our constituents. I hope people
on both sides of the aisle observe what
these Representatives are doing. That
is the way we need to go.
First, as a former Baltimore County
executive, I am well aware of the prob-
lems that State and local governments
face on a daily basis. They are where

the rubber meets the road and the
source of many of the critical services
our constituents rely on, which in-
cludes schools, law enforcement, parks,
fire, and libraries.
Yet, according to the National Asso-
ciation of State Chief Information Offi-
cers, nearly half of all States do not
have a dedicated cybersecurity line
item in their budget. In fact, most
State cybersecurity budgets are be-
tween 0 and 3 percent of their overall
information technology budget.
While some support from the Federal
Government does exist already, less
than 4 percent of current Homeland Se-
curity Grant Program funding has been
allocated to cybersecurity needs at the
State and local level. As we have seen
from recent cyberattacks on many
American cities and States, this is sim-
ply not enough.
Last year, there were at least 24 pub-
lic-sector ransomware attacks, includ-
ing a ransomware attack in Baltimore,
my hometown, that is expected to cost
more than $18 million in remediation.
A separate attack in 2018 temporarily
disabled Baltimore’s 911 dispatch sys-
tem.
This is part of a growing nationwide
trend. The COVID–19 pandemic has
only exacerbated the threat to local
governments as hackers exploit over-
whelmed organizations that are in-
creasingly dependent on digital tools.
We cannot simply stand by and watch
this happen. We can and must do more.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield the gentleman from Maryland an
additional 2 minutes.
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speak-
er, the bill before us today establishes
a program making grants available to
State, local, Tribal, and territorial
governments to address cybersecurity
risks and threats to their information
systems.
This is not a silver bullet, but it al-
lows us to leverage Federal expertise in
cyber, like that of the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency, or
CISA, to help State and local govern-
ments get their information security
programs off the ground.
This bill will further empower State
and local governments around the
country to begin assuming the funding
burden in their normal budget cycles in
the future by reducing the Federal
share over time.
I thank Chairman THOMPSON, Chair-
man RICHMOND, and all those involved
for this bipartisan coalition.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Washington (Mr. KILMER).
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my good friend for yielding and echo
the gratitude for her leadership and the
bipartisan leadership of the sub-
committee.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of the State and Local Cybersecurity
Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill
that I was proud to help introduce, to
deliver urgently needed investments to
address the vulnerabilities that persist
in State, local, Tribal, and territorial
cyber infrastructures.
These cyber threats are real, and our
communities need help.
I have spoken with a county auditor
just recently who said she is conscious
that her systems are constantly tar-
geted.
I have spoken with public power pro-
viders who understand that, in the ab-
sence of sufficient cybersecurity, we
could see an attack that would wipe
out our critical utilities for citizens
and could undermine our economy.
I have recently spoken with a Tribal
leader who said that they have enough
technology challenges without seeing
the threat of cyberattack compound
things.
I have spoken with a county hospital
in my district that was hit by a
ransomware attack.
This bill is about letting those folks
know and the people whom they serve
know that they are not on their own,
that the Federal Government under-
stands that cybersecurity vulnerabili-
ties don’t only exist in marble build-
ings in Washington, D.C., but that they
exist in communities in every State in
our Nation, and with this bill the Fed-
eral Government says: We are going to
have your back. That is why I urge my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
support this bipartisan plan. There is
no time to waste.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
have no more speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close after the gentleman
from Pennsylvania closes. I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the
bill, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, over
the past decade and a half, Congress
has redoubled efforts to secure Federal
networks. This legislation will con-
tinue that work by supporting State
and local cybersecurity improvements.
It was approved on a bipartisan basis in
committee and has broad and deep sup-
port within stakeholder communities.
I would like to congratulate Con-
gressman CEDRIC RICHMOND, the former
chairman of the Cybersecurity, Infra-
structure Protection, and Innovation
Subcommittee, on this important leg-
islation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the measure, and I yield back
the balance of my time.

gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. UNDER-
WOOD) and the gentleman from Penn-

woman from Illinois.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
5822, the Homeland Security Acquisi-
tion Professional Career Program Act.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5822 authorizes an
existing program within the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security focused on
strengthening its acquisition work-
force. DHS established the Acquisition
Professional Career Program in 2008 to
create a pipeline for hard-to-fill acqui-
sition workforce positions, such as con-
tract specialists.
Since its inception, the program has
had over 300 program graduates join
the ranks of DHS’ acquisition work-
force, which oversees billions of dollars
of transactions to procure what DHS
needs to carry out its diverse missions.
They are charged with purchasing ev-
erything from cybersecurity software
for protecting Federal networks, to dis-
aster response supplies, to sophisti-
cated security screening equipment.
And when it comes to COVID–19, they
have been responsible for spending over
$1.7 billion on a wide range of response
activities.
Unfortunately, the Government Ac-
countability Office has highlighted
workforce shortages as a persistent
challenge for DHS acquisition pro-
grams—one that can negatively affect
their ability to deliver vital capabili-
ties on time and on budget.
H.R. 5822 will help address this chal-
lenge by authorizing DHS’ rigorous de-
velopment program, which provides
participants with acquisition training,
mentorship, department-wide rota-
tions, and other career development
opportunities.
H.R. 5822, if enacted, will help DHS
maintain a pipeline for its acquisition
workforce that directly supports the
Department’s frontline officers with
the tools that they need to perform
their jobs.
Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentle-
woman from Nevada, Representative
TITUS, for introducing this measure,
and I urge my colleagues to support it.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
5822. The Department of Homeland Se-
curity has an important mission to
protect the homeland and secure our
borders. To accomplish this mission,
DHS must enter into contracts for
equipment and services. To protect
taxpayer dollars and ensure that DHS
is getting the most bang for its buck,
the Department must utilize experi-
enced acquisition professionals.
In the past decade, GAO has consist-
ently identified issues that must be ad-
dressed to improve acquisition oper-
ations at DHS, including shortages in
the number of trained acquisition pro-
fessionals. This bill addresses this spe-
cific issue by developing trained acqui-
sition professionals within DHS.
H.R. 5822 provides the on-the-job ac-
quisition training, rotations through-
out the Department, mentoring, and
other opportunities to enhance acquisi-
tion knowledge, and experience for the
participants. I applaud my colleague,
Representative TITUS, for her efforts to
bring this bill forward.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
have no further speakers, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the
bill, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, enactment of H.R. 5822
would help ensure that DHS maintains
a pipeline for hard-to-fill acquisition
positions throughout the Department.
Given the critical nature of DHS’ mis-
sion, it is essential that it have a ro-
bust acquisition workforce in place.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 5822, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.
UNDERWOOD) that the House suspend
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5822, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

tation Security Administration to pro-
vide nursing facilities and paid paren-
tal leave for Administration personnel,
and for other purposes, as amended.

GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support
H.R. 5811, the TSA Personnel Work-
force Improvement Act of 2020. The
country recently observed the 19th an-
niversary of the September 11 terrorist
attacks, a day that shook the Nation
to its core and changed it forever. The
federalization of the aviation screening
workforce was one of the most impor-
tant steps taken as a Nation to restore
America’s confidence in flying again.
Today, with the emergence of the
COVID–19 pandemic, we find ourselves
at another moment when many Ameri-
cans are not comfortable flying. Still,
we have a dedicated workforce in our
Nation’s airports that stand ready to
protect America’s flying public. Yet,
this cadre of frontline workers, trans-
portation security officers—also known
as TSOs—continues to be among the
lowest paid Federal employees.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5811, the TSA Per-
sonnel Workplace Improvement Act of
2020, seeks to ease some of the burden
on TSOs who are also juggling the care
of small children. The legislation di-
rects TSA to provide lactation facili-
ties for nursing mothers and 12 weeks
of paid parental leave for all TSA per-
sonnel.
Under H.R. 5811, these lactation fa-
cilities must be assessed for cleanli-
ness, safety, and accessibility to per-
sonnel duty stations, and TSA must co-
ordinate implementation of the bill
with relevant stakeholders, including
the union representing frontline TSA
officers. Given TSA’s complex and
challenging mission, the agency must
explore all options to retain talent,
which includes parents and nursing
mothers.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of H.R. 5811, the TSA Personnel
Workplace Improvement Act of 2020.
This bipartisan legislation, cham-
pioned by Representative JOHN KATKO,
will make important enhancements to
the workplace rights of TSA employ-
ees, in particular, women and nursing
mothers.
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic,
frontline personnel of the Transpor-
tation Security Administration have
continued to serve the traveling public
to keep our Nation’s transportation
system secure. At a time when the
criticality of the TSA personnel is so
clearly demonstrated, we, in Congress,
have an opportunity with this bill to
express appreciation for their services.
H.R. 5811 requires the administrator
to ensure that employees have access
to safe, clean, and free lactation facili-
ties for an appropriate amount of time.
It requires TSA to coordinate with Na-
tional Institutes for Health to ensure
that lactation facilities meet necessary
standards. Finally, this legislation will
ensure paid family leave for the entire
TSA workforce.
Mr. Speaker, this corrects an over-
sight in last year’s NDAA that pro-
vided paid family leave to the rest of
the Federal workforce. I thank the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO) for
his leadership on this important legis-
lation. I also thank the gentleman
from California (Mr. CORREA) for his
support of this bipartisan legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
have no further speakers, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the
bill, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R.
5811, a bill that seeks to improve condi-
tions for working parents in TSA’s
frontline workforce. These improve-
ments may increase morale and reten-
tion, which is critical to ensure the ef-
fectiveness of aviation security in the
face of evolving threats.
I thank the gentleman from New
York for introducing this bill, and I
urge its passage.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.
UNDERWOOD) that the House suspend

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, the Department of
Homeland Security’s Blue Campaign is
dedicated to raising awareness about
how to identify and prevent human
trafficking.
Last year, over 4,000 self-reported
victims and survivors from all over the
country contacted the U.S. national
hotline for help with a human traf-
ficking situation, an increase of almost
20 percent over the previous year.
Traffickers subject their victims to
forced labor, debt bondage, or sexual
exploitation using violence, manipula-
tion, and false promises.
This DHS campaign works to combat
trafficking by educating law enforce-
ment and the public on how to recog-
nize the signs of human trafficking. To
effectively identify trafficking victims
and keep their community safe, local
and State law enforcement need to
have timely information about the tac-
tics and techniques these criminals
use.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5804, the Blue
Campaign Enhancement Act, seeks to
do just that by, among other things,
expanding human trafficking preven-
tion training opportunities. Impor-
tantly, it would also create new, web-
based training programs for State and
local partners to ensure these edu-
cation tools can reach the widest pos-
sible audience. H.R. 5804 has bipartisan
support and was reported out of com-
mittee by unanimous consent.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
Washington, DC, September 4, 2020.
Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: This is to ad-
vise you that the Committee on the Judici-
ary has now had an opportunity to review
the provisions in H.R. 5804, the ‘‘DHS Blue
Campaign Enhancement Act,’’ that fall with-
in our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your
consulting with us on those provisions. The
Judiciary Committee has no objection to
your including them in the bill for consider-
ation on the House floor, and to expedite
that consideration is willing to forgo action
on H.R. 5804, with the understanding that we
do not thereby waive any future jurisdic-
tional claim over those provisions or their
subject matters.
In the event a House-Senate conference on
this or similar legislation is convened, the
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to
request an appropriate number of conferees
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference.
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the
measure on the House floor. Thank you for
the cooperative spirit in which you have
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees.
Sincerely,
JERROLD NADLER,
Chairman.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY,
Washington, DC, September 16, 2020.
Hon. JERROLD NADLER,
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: Thank you for
your letter regarding H.R. 5804, the ‘‘DHS
Blue Campaign Act.’’ The Committee on
Homeland Security recognizes that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary has a jurisdictional
interest in H.R. 5804, and I appreciate your
effort to allow this bill to be considered on
the House floor.
I concur with you that forgoing action on
the bill does not in any way prejudice the
Committee on the Judiciary with respect to
its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or
similar legislation in the future, and I would
support your effort to seek appointment of
an appropriate number of conferees to any
House—Senate conference involving this leg-
islation.
I will include our letters on H.R. 5804 in the
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of this bill. I look forward to working
with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this nation.
Sincerely,
BENNIE G. THOMPSON,
Chairman.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
5804.
According to DHS, there are millions
of victims of trafficking worldwide
each year. Men, women, and children
are trafficked throughout the world—
many of the victims right here in the
United States.
The Blue Campaign is a national
campaign designed to promote aware-
ness of trafficking and help identify
the signs of trafficking. The Blue Cam-
paign conducts outreach to law en-
forcement, the public, and certain in-
dustry professionals. The ability to
recognize the signs of trafficking can
lead to rescuing individuals from traf-
ficking and bringing the criminals who
seek to exploit them to justice.
This bill would build on the excellent
work of the DHS Blue Campaign and
expand its awareness to include even
more individuals that are likely to en-
counter victims of human trafficking.
I applaud the efforts of my colleague
from Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW) and urge
other Members to support the bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW).
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise
in strong support of my bill, H.R. 5804.
Human trafficking is modern-day
slavery. It is one of the most heinous
crimes imaginable. It deprives its vic-
tims of their inalienable rights to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
While DHS and the Department of
Justice are the lead Federal agencies
in the fight against trafficking, State
and local law enforcement frequently
encounter victims and their traf-
fickers. Individuals and employees of
certain industries, such as medical pro-
fessionals, educators, and airline em-
ployees, among others, are also more
likely to encounter victims and need to
know how to identify and respond to
them. This is where the Blue Campaign
has come in to fill an important gap.
‘‘Blue Campaign is a national public
awareness campaign, designed to edu-
cate the public, law enforcement, and
other industry partners to recognize
the indicators of human trafficking,
and how to appropriately respond to
possible cases.’’
In the 10 years since it began, the
Blue Campaign has helped raise aware-
ness of trafficking. Materials developed
by the Blue Campaign have helped in-
dividuals outside law enforcement rec-
ognize the signs of trafficking and
helped those at risk of being trafficked.
It has fostered communication and
partnerships between industry, law en-
forcement, and nongovernmental orga-
nizations.
My bill, H.R. 5804, the DHS Blue
Campaign Enhancement Act, amends
the Homeland Security Act to expand
the reach of the Blue Campaign
through the use of online educational
videos and the creation of a Blue Cam-
paign Advisory Committee within DHS
to provide support and guidance for fu-
ture development, training, and out-
reach.
It expands on the great work of the
Blue Campaign and the fight against
human trafficking. It is another step
toward ending the cruel and inhumane
exploitation by traffickers and res-
cuing those caught in its grasp.
I appreciate my colleagues’ support
of this bill.

REPORT ON RESOLUTION PRO-
VIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF
SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R.
925, NORTH AMERICAN WET-
LANDS CONSERVATION EXTEN-
SION ACT
Mr. MCGOVERN, from the Com-
mittee on Rules, submitted a privi-
leged report (Rept. No. 116–556) on the
resolution (H. Res. 1161) providing for
consideration of the Senate amend-
ments to the bill (H.R. 925) to extend
the authorization of appropriations for
allocation to carry out approved wet-
lands conservation projects under the
North American Wetlands Conserva-
tion Act through fiscal year 2024, which
was referred to the House Calendar and
ordered to be printed.
f
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION
OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO
H.R. 925, NORTH AMERICAN WET-
LANDS CONSERVATION EXTEN-
SION ACT
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I
call up House Resolution 1161 and ask
for its immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 1161
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to take from the
Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 925) to extend
the authorization of appropriations for allo-
cation to carry out approved wetlands con-
servation projects under the North American
Wetlands Conservation Act through fiscal
year 2024, with the Senate amendments
thereto, and to consider in the House, with-
out intervention of any point of order or
question of consideration, a single motion
offered by the chair of the Committee on Ap-
propriations or her designee that the House:
(1) concur in the Senate amendment to the
title; and (2) concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the text with an amendment con-
sisting of the text of Rules Committee Print
116-66. The Senate amendments and the mo-
tion shall be considered as read. The motion
shall be debatable for two hours equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on
Appropriations. The previous question shall
be considered as ordered on the motion to its
adoption without intervening motion or de-
mand for division of the question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CARSON of Indiana). The gentleman
from Massachusetts is recognized for 1
hour.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the
ranking member of the Rules Com-
mittee, pending which I yield myself
such time as I may consume. During
consideration of this resolution, all
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only.
b 1630
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
be given 5 legislative days to revise and
extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the
Rules Committee met and reported a
rule, House Resolution 1161, providing
for consideration of the Senate amend-
ments to H.R. 925, America’s Conserva-
tion Enhancement Act.
The rule makes in order a single mo-
tion offered by the chair of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations or her des-
ignee that the House: One, concur in
the Senate amendment to the title;
and, two, concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the text with an amendment
consisting of the text of Rules Com-
mittee Print 116–66, which is identical
to H.R. 8406, the Heroes Act.
Finally, the rule provides for 2 hours
of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and the ranking
minority member of the Committee on
Appropriations.
Mr. Speaker, we are here today be-
cause the American people are tired of
waiting.
It has been more than 4 months since
this House passed the Heroes Act in re-
sponse to the coronavirus pandemic to
help our first responders, healthcare
workers, struggling businesses, and
local governments.
This bill passed this House on May
15, Mr. Speaker. But what did the Sen-
ate do, Mr. Speaker? Nothing.
They apparently couldn’t be bothered
to bring this bill up for a vote in over
4 months, but it took MITCH MCCON-
NELL roughly 80 minutes after Justice
Ginsburg passed away to announce a
vote on a Supreme Court nominee.
Now, you can’t make this stuff up.
Something is terribly, terribly wrong
here.
More than 205,000 Americans have
lost their lives due to coronavirus and
more than 7 million more have been af-
fected.
Millions of people are out of work,
small businesses are struggling, and
some have had to shut their doors for-
ever. Our economy hasn’t taken a hit
like this since the Great Depression.
Many families are struggling every day
to make ends meet. Kids are going hun-
gry.
This pandemic isn’t going to just dis-
appear overnight, as the President has
suggested. It is going to take a whole-
of-government response for quite some
time, and that requires Congress to
act.
The Republicans in the Senate may
be able to sleep at night telling the
American people to wait and then wait
some more and then wait some more

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5091
September 30, 2020
while they rubber stamp another judge,
but I cannot ask our people, our com-
munities, our small businesses, our
workers and their families to wait any
longer. No one in this majority can.
Our country is suffering, and our peo-
ple are in pain. That is why we have
tried over these past 4 months to strike
a fair and commonsense deal with Sen-
ate Republicans, but they couldn’t
even come to an agreement on a pack-
age among themselves. Republicans are
fighting with Republicans over there,
so they just abandoned doing anything
at all.
Doing nothing is unconscionable.
I am proud that our Speaker, NANCY
PELOSI, has never given up. She has
spoken with Treasury Secretary
Mnuchin again and again and again
and again trying to come up with an
agreement.
Her offer to this administration was
simple: let’s meet halfway. Let’s take
the $3.4 trillion in relief contained in
the initial Heroes Act and reduce it by
$1.2 trillion. We would still fund our
first responders, our small businesses,
and our State and local governments,
but we would meet Republicans in the
middle. We would come down $1 trillion
and they would come up $1 trillion.
That is called compromise. That is
what you do, and it is what you have to
do from time to time in divided govern-
ment. The bill included in this rule,
H.R. 8406, reflects that give-and-take.
There is funding here for State and
local governments to avert layoffs and
continue critical services; for
coronavirus testing, tracing, and treat-
ment; for our hospitals and for our
healthcare providers; for continuing
unemployment insurance; and for fami-
lies to pay for necessities like food,
utilities, and rent during this pan-
demic.
This revamped Heroes Act totals $2.2
trillion. Many Democrats, including
myself, favored the original larger bill.
My friends on the other side wanted
something much smaller. But disagree-
ment should never result in inaction.
One in four children in this country
are at risk of going hungry this year
because of this pandemic, Mr. Speaker.
The lines for food banks in some com-
munities already go for miles.
People are hurting today, right now.
We all know that. And if you don’t
know that, you don’t go back to your
district.
We all know what it takes to truly do
something about it.
We have pleaded with the Senate to
take this bill up for months, we have
negotiated over and over again, and
today we are back with a compromise
proposal.
The only question, Mr. Speaker, is
whether my Republican colleagues are
finally ready to take ‘‘yes’’ for an an-
swer.
On behalf of the most vulnerable
among us, those who are out of work,
going hungry, and struggling to get by,
I pray the answer is finally ‘‘yes.’’
Once again, Mr. Speaker, I ask my
colleagues, all my colleagues, to sup-
port this rule and the underlying He-
roes Act so we can finally, finally get
relief to where it is so badly needed.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume, and I
thank my good friend, the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN),
the distinguished chairman of the
Rules Committee, for yielding me the
customary 30 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to
consider a rule that provides for con-
sideration of a single item, the Senate
amendment to H.R. 925, the majority’s
second attempt to pass a partisan wish
list under the guise of a coronavirus re-
lief bill.
There are two quotes that sum up
how I feel about today’s rule, Mr.
Speaker. The first, widely
misattributed to Albert Einstein, is
that: ‘‘The definition of insanity is
doing the same thing over and over
again and expecting different results’’;
the second, accurately attributed to
Yogi Berra, is that today’s action feels
like: ‘‘It’s deja vu all over again.’’
Today, the House majority is bring-
ing up again a partisan coronavirus re-
lief package, just as they did in May.
As in May, today’s bill was written
with only Democratic input.
Like in May, today’s bill has a mas-
sive price tag. This sits at $2.4 trillion.
As in May, today’s bill contains a
plethora of provisions that are com-
pletely unrelated to coronavirus relief.
Indeed, just like in May, today’s bill
is more akin to a Democratic policy
wish list than to an actual relief bill.
And just as in May, we all know what
the end result will be: the Senate will
not pass this bill and the President will
not sign it into law.
But it doesn’t have to be this way,
Mr. Speaker.
For whatever reason, the majority is
refusing to truly negotiate on a bipar-
tisan coronavirus relief bill that would
provide real relief for millions of Amer-
icans.
I grant them, discussions have taken
place. But when the majority continues
to insist that it is their way or no way
and refuses to meet Republicans half-
way, one begins to understand how we
got to this point.
Mr. Speaker, I would remind both
this Chamber and the American people
that it has been the Democrats who
have blocked a second coronavirus re-
lief bill. Just last week, House Demo-
crats blocked Republicans from bring-
ing up a simple bill to extend the Pay-
check Protection Program. In the Sen-
ate, Democrats blocked the majority
from bringing up a clean extension of
PPP, and later, Democrats blocked a
Republican-led coronavirus relief bill
from being considered, not because
they disagreed with anything in the
bill, but because they just thought
other things should be in the bill.
All of these bills are bills that the
President would have signed into law.
At a time when so many Americans
are truly suffering, why the House ma-
jority insists on blocking these meas-
ures and bringing up their own par-
tisan wish list instead does not make
sense to me.
But what makes even less sense is
the egregious process they followed in
considering this bill. The process, if
you can even call it that, violated
House rules and any notion of fairness.
The bill was introduced on Monday
night after being drafted in secret in
Speaker PELOSI’s office without any
Republican input whatsoever. No com-
mittee held a hearing on it and no com-
mittee marked it up. That is violating
the McGovern rule, which requires any
bill coming before the Rules Com-
mittee to have a hearing and a markup
in the committee of jurisdiction.
The bill is 2,152 pages long, and I
highly doubt that most Members have
had time to read, review, and digest it
in that short amount of time.
I will say this, though: it does set a
record. It spends $1 billion a page. That
is pretty remarkable spending.
When your process is that bad, no
wonder the output is as bad as the bill
we are considering today.
The majority claims that today’s bill
is a scaled-down version of the Heroes
Act, a bill we considered back in May.
If the majority’s funding calculations
on the amount of money we are spend-
ing in this bill are accurate, that may
be technically correct, but it still has
the exact same policies and problems
as the Heroes Act.
This bill includes massive spending
even in areas where we appropriated
funds as part of the CARES Act in
March and haven’t fully spent them
yet: funding for Democratic policy pri-
orities at the expense of bipartisan
ones; inclusion of provisions that are
completely unrelated to coronavirus
relief, like a complicated and con-
troversial multiemployer pension bill,
a provision revealing an existing provi-
sion of law requiring the auction of T-
Band spectrum, massive student loan
forgiveness, and the mandating of a na-
tional vote by mail.
Some of these may deserve consider-
ation, but what they are doing in a bill
that is supposed to be about providing
relief to Americans affected by the
coronavirus pandemic is beyond me.
Mr. Speaker, in any bill this size, it
is inevitable that all Members will find
at least one provision that they like,
but it is the package as a whole that is
offensive and objectionable.
Drafted without Republican input
and with nothing but Democratic ideas
and extraneous policy priorities, it is
doomed to the same result as happened
the last time the majority tried this
approach.
With their actions today, we will not
move the ball forward, we will not
draw closer to a final deal that actu-
ally helps Americans. And what they
will do is to continue to pass on the
chance to actually work together as a
bipartisan institution and to provide
real help to the American people.
Just as in May, the majority is put-
ting up a partisan bill, when what we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5092 September 30, 2020
need is a bipartisan deal. We did that
four times before, Mr. Speaker. If we
chose to, we could do so again.
They are doing the same thing again
and expecting a different result.
Mr. Speaker, it didn’t have to be this
way. There are many areas where we
agree: Paycheck Protection Program;
additional money for schools to reopen;
a one-time payment of $1,200 per indi-
vidual, $500 per child in households
making less than $75,000 a year; addi-
tional money to speed the distribution
of vaccines.
Those are areas we could bring out
one at a time or bundled together and
pass. Instead, my friends have chosen
to use a formula they know is doomed
to failure.
As to the amount, the President has
actually been flexible. The original
Senate proposal was $1 trillion, no in-
considerable sum of money, I might
add. The President moved that up to
$1.5 trillion. That wasn’t good enough,
even though many members of my
friend’s party actually supported that,
the so-called Problem Solvers Caucus.
So I don’t want to belabor the point,
but I know the difference between a se-
rious effort to pass legislation that has
a chance of passing in the Senate and
being signed by the President and a
messaging exercise, and that is all we
are engaged in today. So it is indeed,
Mr. Speaker, deja vu all over again.
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the
rule, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that
when my friend says this is a Demo-
cratic wish list of things, I mean, the
fact of the matter is, we are trying to
respond to a pandemic. We haven’t had
to deal with something like this since
1918.
b 1645
It has basically impacted our econ-
omy in ways that have resulted in mil-
lions of people losing their jobs. We
have schools that have not fully re-
opened because it is not safe. We have
had shortages of PPE. We don’t have
adequate testing. I can go on and on
and on.
But the wish list that this bill ad-
dresses has things like we support
small businesses. We improve the Pay-
check Protection Program. That is
hardly—I would like to think Repub-
licans share that, too.
Additional assistance for the airline
industry workers: Is that so controver-
sial?
More funds to bolster education and
childcare: Given what we are going
through, is that controversial?
We honor our heroes. We provide as-
sistance to State, local, territorial, and
Tribal governments that desperately
need funds to pay first responders. Is
that a point of contention?
It supports testing, tracing, and
treatment; provides additional direct
payments for those who are unem-
ployed; protects payrolls; ensures
worker safety; preserves health cov-
erage; restores unemployment benefits;
bolsters housing assistance; strength-
ens food security at a time when a
record number of Americans are going
hungry.
Again, just to put this in context, we
passed something 4 months ago. Four
months ago, we sent it over to the Sen-
ate. Now, they should have passed
something, and then we could have ne-
gotiated the differences. That is the
way it usually works.
The Republicans are fighting with
Republicans over in the Senate. There
is a big chunk of Republicans who
don’t want to appropriate one more
penny for the American people. No,
they don’t have the time. But they
have the time to rush through another
Supreme Court Justice, in record time.
I guess what is so frustrating is that
some of my friends act like this is not
an emergency, like, you know, we can
just kind of go along and everything
will be fine. This is an emergency.
We haven’t faced a crisis like this in
our lifetime, and if we don’t have an
all-out comprehensive approach, not a
scalpel approach—it is not just about
PPP. It is also about our schools, our
healthcare workers, our first respond-
ers. It is about a whole bunch of stuff.
But if we don’t have an all-comprehen-
sive approach, then this economy is
going to have a very difficult time re-
covering.
It is just frustrating to me. I was
home in Massachusetts. I did tours of
restaurants in my district, and people
have been visiting some of our res-
taurants, eating outside. But in Massa-
chusetts, we get winters. It is going to
get cold soon, and pretty soon, people
are not going to want to eat outside.
They won’t be able to.
If people don’t feel safe going inside
because, as we are seeing now in a
number of States that aren’t following
some of the recommendations of the
CDC, we see case numbers going up. So
if we had another surge, how are these
restaurants going to survive? They are
going to shut their doors forever.
We have an opportunity to provide a
lifeline until we get through all of this.
I mean, there are so many aspects of
our economy that have been impacted
by this, so many people who are just
struggling to get by.
It is unconscionable to me that this
hasn’t occupied a greater sense of ur-
gency in the Republican leader’s mind
over in the Senate. I just don’t get it.
It really is so disappointing to me.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, let me yield
myself such time as I may consume
just to quickly make a couple of points
and then move to my friend from Ari-
zona.
Far be it for me, Mr. Speaker, to de-
fend the upper body. I am a very proud
Member of this House, as I know all of
us here are.
But it is worth noting for the RECORD
the Senate actually had 52 votes to
pass a bill. It was my friend’s party
that kept them from considering it.
As to the Supreme Court, thank
goodness they don’t have to deal with
the House of Representatives. That is
why they are able to move quickly.
They could move pretty quickly if they
had somebody they could deal with
here as well.
It is my friends who have chosen to
craft legislation that they know will be
unacceptable, that they know the
President will not sign, and then rail
at them for not passing it and the
President for not signing it. That is the
height of chutzpah, if you will.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs.
LESKO), my distinguished friend and
fellow member of the Rules Com-
mittee.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Mr. COLE for yielding me the time.
I agree with Chairman MCGOVERN
that we need to help the American peo-
ple. There are still people hurting out
there, and they need help from us.
That is why it is so frustrating to me
that we have this bill in front of us be-
cause it is just a very similar version
to the partisan bill that the Democrats
pushed out of here just a few months
ago that they know is not going to get
anywhere.
I remember seeing in the media how
Democrats in the House in swing dis-
tricts were asking, pleading with
Speaker PELOSI, to please negotiate
with the Republicans and the President
to actually get a bill that will be
passed and signed into law because,
after all, you all know that if you real-
ly want to help the American people,
you have to have a bill that is actually
able to get signed into law, and this
bill is not it.
Unfortunately, this bill, once again,
highlights a lot of the priorities that
my Democratic colleagues have that
have nothing to do with coronavirus,
quite frankly.
One of the things that I found very
interesting in this bill is that, in the
original Heroes Act that was passed a
few months ago, they had $600 million
in there for the COPS hiring program.
That is to help State and local law en-
forcement. Curiously enough, it is not
in this version of the bill.
So I was wondering, is this how they
are planning to save some money on
the bill, to take away funding for po-
lice and law enforcement?
Also in this bill, once again, is ex-
tending the extra $600 a week in unem-
ployment assistance into the beginning
and through spring of next year. Well,
many businesses, multiple businesses,
have told us that they are having trou-
ble hiring workers back because work-
ers are getting paid more to stay at
home and not work. This is right here
in that bill, in this bill, right now.
We cannot pay people more to stay
home and not work. We need to
incentivize them to come back to
work.
This bill also allows illegal immi-
grants to get $1,200 stimulus checks

and their children $500 stimulus
checks. That is right here in this lan-
guage, right here in this bill. American
citizens, my taxpayers in Arizona, do
not want to subsidize illegal immi-
grants.
This bill also removes safeguards in
the Paycheck Protection Program.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the
gentlewoman from Arizona an addi-
tional 1 minute.
Mrs. LESKO. This bill also removes
any protections from using taxpayer
dollars to fund abortions. That is right
here in this bill.
This bill, as Representative COLE also
said, federalizes elections. In fact, it
prohibits States from requiring voter
ID. Arizona requires voter ID. This bill
would take that away.
It also legalizes ballot harvesting.
Arizona opposed—the legislature said
no ballot harvesting. This would bring
it right back, right here in this bill.
Again, it would also provide tax
breaks to millionaires and billionaires
in blue States that require taxpayers
in low-tax States, like Arizona, to sub-
sidize them.
That is why we can’t support this
bill. There are too many poison pills.
Please come up with something that
we can agree on to help the American
people.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Before I yield to the gentlewoman
from Texas, I just want to say a couple
of things for the RECORD.
I guess the new Republican tactic—if
anybody watched the debate yester-
day—is to try to twist and turn and
confuse people.
The gentlewoman implied that this
somehow defunds police. I mean, there
is $436 billion in here to provide assist-
ance directly to State and local gov-
ernments to support the police.
If my friend was so interested in sup-
porting the police, she should know
that the bill that Senate Majority
Leader MITCH MCCONNELL brought up
provided no money for State and local
governments. I mean nothing.
In fact, that bill didn’t provide
money for a lot of the most needy peo-
ple in this country who are suffering as
a result of this virus: no money for nu-
trition to help our families who are
going hungry, no money for a lot of the
priorities that I know are priorities not
only in my district but all over the
country.
The bottom line is, my friends can
come up with excuse after excuse after
excuse to not support this. But by not
supporting it, we are not supporting
the American people at a time of des-
perate need.
Again, we have come down $1.3 tril-
lion from what we originally put for-
ward, not because we think it is nec-
essarily the right thing to do, because
the need is so great. We are doing it to
try to find ways to accommodate, to
move this process forward. And obvi-
ously, my friends make up ways to jus-
tify their voting ‘‘no’’ on this.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
say to the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, the American people cannot take
this anymore.
And my good friend from Oklahoma,
I know the compassion that he has. We
have worked together, as well as my
friends from Ohio and Arizona.
But yesterday, I stood with the
mayor of the city of Houston, and we
announced a mental health hotline for
people being impacted by COVID–19.
Yes, the stress of COVID–19 is taking a
toll on the American people. They need
relief.
A very proud, brave parent got up to
talk about how difficult it is to vir-
tually teach her children while she
works and how concerned she was.
Why? Because the mandate comes from
on high—the White House—that if you
are not having your children in school
in some form, meaning in the build-
ings, because that is the decision she
was grappling with, then you don’t get
money.
They have no money. They have no
money to have expanded buildings or
temporary buildings so that they can
help parents who work have children
safely in school. They have no money
for testing. They have no money to be
able to provide for sick employees from
COVID–19.
So I rise today to say: The American
people cannot take it anymore. The
stress is enormous. What we have done
here is a very merciful response to the
bill we already passed, that our friends,
conflicted with each other and the
White House, cannot seem to get a grip
on.
I support $225 billion for education
and childcare, $436 billion in assistance
to our State and local governments.
I thank Mr. MCGOVERN for making it
clear. Those are our municipal work-
ers. Those are police and fire, and we
need it because who has gotten sick?
Police officers, firefighters. And we
need this money.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
BLUMENAUER). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield the gentle-
woman from Texas an additional 1
minute.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we
need the testing. We are doing testing
on the last pennies of the money that
we were granted through the leader-
ship, our Speaker and others.
They need testing. I will be in a sta-
dium this coming week, trying to get
people tested. That is how much we
need it.
Then, of course, $28 billion in pro-
curement, distribution, education, ma-
terials for the vaccine.
But I want to focus on the $600 for
unemployment, the money for the
$1,200, as well as the money for rental
and mortgage to prevent mortgage
foreclosure. The restaurant money, I
want it for the independent pizza shops
who hire people, for the workers who
are going to be out of work, like air-
port workers or airline workers. The
food insecurity, people are standing on
line to get food.
What don’t my good friends under-
stand? That people are desperate, and
they are in need?
I wish we were not discussing ques-
tions about white supremacy and
whether or not someone believed it or
not. I wish we would stay focused on
getting this bill passed for the des-
perate people, no matter what back-
grounds they are.
I want to rise in enthusiastic support
for this Heroes bill, H.R. 8406. Let’s
pass it now.
b 1700
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately bring
up H.R. 8265, a bill to extend the Pay-
check Protection Program through the
end of the year and release $137 billion
in unspent funds for that program.
Mr. Speaker, every Member of Con-
gress can agree we need to enact relief
for the millions suffering from the pan-
demic, but we should only move for-
ward on legislation that can actually
be signed into law. The measure the
majority is attempting to pass today
simply doesn’t fit that bill. Absent a
comprehensive bipartisan package, we
should pass smaller pieces where there
is broad consensus, such as the Pay-
check Protection Program.
PPP is of great importance to our
constituents. It is helping keep mil-
lions of Americans employed and re-
ceiving a paycheck. Members on both
sides of the aisle and in both Chambers
agree that this crucial program needs
to be extended, and it could be ex-
tended today if the majority were to
bring a bipartisan bill extending PPP
to the floor.
But you don’t have to take my word
for it, Mr. Speaker. Many House Demo-
crats agree we need to pass a true relief
bill now rather than just another polit-
ical messaging bill.
A bipartisan letter recently sent to
the Speaker stressed that ‘‘failing to
reach a deal is unacceptable and is a
failure of duty to the American peo-
ple.’’
A separate letter sent to the Speaker
by eight Democrats last week de-
manded ‘‘a vote on a clean relief pack-
age that has direct assistance for those
in need.’’
Perhaps the most telling is a third
letter sent just a few days ago and
signed by 23 Democrats. These Mem-
bers correctly point out to their lead-
ers that, absent a bipartisan deal, a
‘‘discharge petition is the only poten-
tial option for COVID–19-related action
on the House floor.’’
As my colleagues know, House Re-
publicans have such a discharge peti-
tion ready to be signed, and we look
forward to these Members joining us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5094 September 30, 2020
However, I would point out, Madam
Speaker, to my colleagues that we
don’t have to wait for a discharge peti-
tion to succeed. We can take a clear
step right now by defeating the pre-
vious question and bringing H.R. 8265
up for an immediate vote.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to insert the text of my
amendment in the RECORD, along with
extraneous material, immediately
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
JACKSON LEE). Is there objection to the
request of the gentleman from Okla-
homa?
There was no objection.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), who is
my good friend and the ranking mem-
ber of the Small Business Committee,
to explain more about this critical bill.
Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman
for yielding, Madam Speaker.
Madam Speaker, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, or PPP as many of us
refer to it, has been shut down now for
over 50 days. That is nearly 2 months
that small businesses have been unable
to access approximately $137 billion
that still remains in the program that
was supposed to go for their relief.
Small businesses and their workers
need our help. Small businesses employ
nearly half of the workers in this Na-
tion, one out of two. Think of that. One
out of every two people employed in
this Nation works for one of America’s
small businesses. Not only do they rep-
resent millions of workers, but they
also are the Nation’s job creators. They
create approximately two out of every
three new jobs in America.
Of course, these aren’t just statistics.
One example of an outstanding small
business owner is Lacie Sims. Re-
cently, I had the opportunity to visit
Lacie’s business, the Village Family
Restaurant, in Waynesville, Ohio, back
in my district.
Lacie spoke with me about how she
used the Paycheck Protection Program
to keep her 25 workers employed so
that they could continue to serve the
community and, most importantly,
continue to support their families.
Lacie went on to tell me about how she
quickly adapted her business to accom-
modate pickup, delivery, and safe in-
door dining.
Like Lacie, many small business
owners have adapted and persevered
through the pandemic. Unfortunately,
COVID–19 continues to challenge their
very existence.
Now is the time for us to act, and we
have an option before us here today. If
we defeat today’s previous question, we
can move directly to my legislation to
reopen the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, the PPP program. H.R. 8265
would provide targeted assistance to
small businesses that truly need the
Federal Government’s help.
This legislation gives small busi-
nesses the opportunity to receive a sec-
ond PPP if they can demonstrate a sig-
nificant revenue reduction or a first-
round loan if they didn’t get one the
first time. Additionally, it adds more
flexibility in how the PPP dollars can
be spent and still be eligible for loan
forgiveness.
Many small businesses are still
struggling across this country. We need
to act now to help these small busi-
nesses, the people that they employ,
and the families that they, in turn,
support.
Let’s defeat the previous question
and restart the Paycheck Protection
Program. The Nation’s economy is at
stake. We still have $137 billion sitting
there that was intended to go to these
small businesses. We don’t have to allo-
cate any more funding. The funding is
there.
Now, my Democratic colleagues have
said that they are for small business.
This is the time not just to talk the
talk but to walk the walk. You get two
opportunities, Madam Speaker, you
can vote against this previous question
or you can sign the discharge petition.
Either one of them gives us another
vote.
Let’s save these small businesses.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
The gentleman would be happy to
know that, in this bill that we are
bringing before here, we have most of
what he requested but more. Our PPP
language is more expansive, because a
lot of businesses didn’t qualify under
the old formula.
But I do have to say that it really
pains me that my friends don’t under-
stand that it is not just about small
businesses. It is about our cities and
towns and our first responders.
We have communities that are about
to fire firefighters and police officers.
Isn’t that important to my friends?
Or helping to pay for schools to re-
open safely or to be able to help kids
get an education remotely or in a hy-
brid way, doesn’t that fall on the top
list of my Republican friends?
Healthcare coverage, the airline in-
dustry, which is about to lay off thou-
sands of workers, we provide some help
for them, but yet that doesn’t make
the cut.
So, yes, we can have a scalpel ap-
proach to this. We will do a little bit
here and maybe we will do a little bit
there, but that fails to recognize the
severity of the crisis that we are now
in.
Open your eyes and look at what is
happening in this country, in large
part, due to the mismanagement of
this President, which is unconscion-
able.
But here in Congress, we can’t deal
with him. We can’t fix the way he ap-
proaches his job. But we can provide di-
rect resources to businesses and to
local governments that can help keep
our economy afloat until we can get by
this.
Madam Speaker, I yield 31⁄2 minutes
to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.
BLUMENAUER).
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker,
I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy
in permitting me to speak on this.
I commend our leadership, the
Speaker, for again putting forward leg-
islation to support working families,
local government, and healthcare as we
deal with the COVID–19 pandemic.
This updated Heroes Act provides for
another round of cash payments, hous-
ing and food assistance, help for unem-
ployed workers, and targeted relief for
small businesses who need it most, like
independent restaurants.
I would like to speak on that for a
moment because I am very proud that
this legislation includes $120 billion
from our RESTAURANTS Act for sav-
ing 500,000 independent restaurants and
their 11 million employees. This sector
of the economy totals $1 trillion when
you deal with all those organizations,
all their supply chains, and ancillary
effects.
Local, independent restaurants are
the cornerstone of communities large
and small, your community and mine.
I think it is hard to imagine what life
would be like in Oklahoma City or Cin-
cinnati or Portland, Oregon, without
those vital institutions. That is where
communities come together. They pro-
vide a disproportionate avenue for eco-
nomic success for minorities, immi-
grants, and women-owned enterprises.
A restaurant for many of us was the
first job, and it is an avenue for moving
forward.
They are, unfortunately, hurting
more than any other industry. They
are the largest contributor to unem-
ployment. One in four job losses is in
this industry. We have a chance to do
something about it. They are the larg-
est contributor of unemployment of
any sector—one in four job losses. In
fact, they were half the unemployed in
April. Already one in six restaurants
have closed their doors permanently,
but this legislation provides relief for
those who are hanging on by a thread.
The evidence is that if we don’t take
action like this that is targeted for
independent restaurants, we are going
to have 85 percent of them close by the
end of the year permanently.
The Heroes Act targets $120 billion of
our RESTAURANTS Act that would
generate $250 billion in economic im-
pact. It would support millions of res-
taurant workers, truck drivers, farm-
ers, and fishermen—people who support
this critical industry. It is not just the
fruits and vegetables and the linens.
Think about it for a moment, Madam
Speaker. All of those are involved.
This legislation would, by giving $120
billion of direct relief, provide $250 bil-
lion in economic savings by having
people not filing bankruptcy and not
adding to the unemployed ranks, but
keeping them in business paying taxes,
paying employees, and keeping those
essential food supply chains going.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentleman from Oregon an
additional 1 minute.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5095
September 30, 2020
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker,
independent restaurants are the true
and quintessential embodiment of
small businesses. What this legislation
is geared for is the small, independent
restaurants. That assistance is more
important now than ever.
It is sad that we have not had much
bipartisan support in the House for
this, although in the Senate there are
40 cosponsors including a number of
Republicans led by Senator WICKER
from Mississippi. I would hope that my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
would see fit to vote for this legisla-
tion, vote to save independent res-
taurants, and be able to move forward
in a way that will benefit every com-
munity across America.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I just want to re-
spond quickly to my friends and point
out something that is striking to me in
listening to the debate. There is almost
nothing that any of my friends have
mentioned that we don’t support—al-
most nothing. All these worthy pro-
grams for restaurants, all this relief for
individuals, and all this help, we all
agree with that. It is the things my
friends don’t mention that they have in
their bill that we don’t agree with.
We don’t agree with more money for
Planned Parenthood. That has no place
in this bill.
We obviously have very serious objec-
tions to federalizing the election sys-
tem of this country, which is State
based. That has no place in this bill.
We obviously don’t want to give a tax
break to millionaires and billionaires
in blue States by getting rid of the
State and local tax limitations that
were placed in.
Those are the things, none of which
have anything to do with coronavirus,
that we object to. Those are the things
that my friends are insisting on that
they cannot pass in the United States
Senate and that the President will not
sign.
If they want to actually pass all
these other wonderful things, we agree
with them, and we have been very gen-
erous in terms of the amount of money.
The President has moved up on that.
Money is a negotiable item here. Pol-
icy positions—poison pills, as my good
friend from Arizona said—are not, and
that is what is keeping us from acting.
Frankly, that is a tragedy and a trav-
esty, in my view, Madam Speaker.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
b 1715
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself the
balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge
opposition to the rule. Today’s bill is
nothing more than a Democratic wish
list masquerading as a coronavirus re-
lief bill, roughly the same as the par-
tisan bill the majority passed back in
May and it was never taken up by the
Senate, would never be signed by the
President.
As in May, today’s bill is ultimately
doomed. It will not pass the Senate.
The President has made it clear he will
not sign it.
Madam Speaker, the majority is
missing a real chance here. The Amer-
ican people are suffering as a result of
the coronavirus. It is past time for the
two parties to do what we did very suc-
cessfully four times in a row in a 10-
week period and work together and ac-
tually provide a package that provides
real relief for the American people.
There are plenty of things we agree
on, such as the extension of the Pay-
check Protection Program, such as en-
suring that more funds are provided for
testing and tracing, such as one-time
payments of $1,200 per individual and
$500 per child to every household mak-
ing less than $75,000 a year. We disagree
about the exact amount, but we agree
every American who is unemployed,
through no fault of their own, should
get at least $400 more a week.
Frankly, because the Democrats did
not take up that offer, those people
have gotten zero since the end of July.
We absolutely agree that we need addi-
tional money for the opening of
schools.
Madam Speaker, so why don’t we put
on the floor—it is a novel suggestion—
the things we agree on, the things we
know the Senate will pass and we know
the President would sign. The only rea-
son we have failed to do that is because
the Democratic leadership has made
the decision that we have to agree on
everything before we do anything. That
is no way to legislate in a body that
has a Democratic majority in the
House, a Republican majority in the
Senate, and a Republican President.
The majority is not in the position to
dictate to either the Senate or the
President what is going to happen, but
they are in a powerful position to nego-
tiate, and negotiate in good faith, and
focus on the areas where we agree.
Madam Speaker, I think that would
move us forward productively. I think
that would be in the best interests of
the American people. So I call on the
majority to end this charade and en-
gage with Republicans in the House,
the Senate, and the administration and
come to an agreement on a real bipar-
tisan relief package. I know my friends
can do it because we did it together
four times in a row.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous
question, ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and ‘‘no’’
on the underlying bill, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I have served in this
House for many years. I have been here
through unimaginable tragedies, like
September 11. Every time this Nation
has been challenged, we came to-
gether—not as Democrats or Repub-
licans, but as Americans. Never could I
have imagined that after a shock like
the coronavirus, that has taken more
than 205,000 lives, that we would strug-
gle to reach a compromise.
The House did its job more than 4
months ago when we passed the origi-
nal Heroes Act; the Senate abdicated
its responsibility. But we have not
walked away. We have not stopped try-
ing to help protect the lives and liveli-
hood of people that we represent. We
are back today with a bill that puts on
paper the compromises that we are
willing to make, not to get a win for
one side or the other, but to help the
American people in the middle of a
pandemic. That is what this is all
about.
Madam Speaker, to my friends on the
other side of the aisle, I beg, please
don’t abandon the American people.
Don’t throw up your hands and walk
away because you don’t like every line
of this bill. Take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer.
Madam Speaker, this bill doesn’t
Federalize elections. It provides safe-
guards for elections and provides fund-
ing to States to be able to carry out
elections safely in the middle of a pan-
demic. To object over the fact that this
bill protects Americans from losing
their health coverage is startling to
me, although it shouldn’t be, because
the President, as we speak, is in court
trying to get the Affordable Care Act
repealed outright, where millions of
people would lose their healthcare,
people with preexisting conditions
would lose that protection, and you
wouldn’t be able to keep your kids on
your insurance until they are 26.
Think about it: In the middle of a
pandemic, that is the priority of this
White House—to rip healthcare away
from people. It takes my breath away
what a disconnect there is about what
the American people need and what
some of my friends’ priorities are.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to join us in compromising to get
something done. I get it. This is an
election year and people are used to
running to their political corners, but
this crisis demands more than just
business as usual. It demands action.
And it demands more than a scalpel ap-
proach: ‘‘Well, let me do a little bit
here,’’ or ‘‘let me do a little bit there.’’
I am told that the White House
doesn’t want to fund nutrition pro-
grams to help make sure that no one in
this country goes hungry. I can’t be-
lieve anybody would take that posi-
tion, but we are told that is one of the
hot button items that people don’t
want to fund, that it is one of the
Democratic priorities that is so con-
troversial.
Really? Even before this pandemic,
we had 40 million people in this coun-
try who didn’t know where their next
meal was going to come from; and
every year it is a battle to make sure
they don’t cut nutrition programs. But
now we are in a pandemic and hunger
has increased dramatically in this
country. Every one of us should not
only be concerned about that, but we
should be ashamed that that is a re-
ality in the richest country in the his-
tory of the world.
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to come together. This is an

RECOGNIZING BARB IVES
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank
and celebrate someone who has been a
dedicated member of my team for
many years now. Barb Ives, a field rep-
resentative and office manager, re-
cently surpassed a 20-year milestone
representing our district.
Barb has selflessly served the district
since September of 2000, initially with

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5098 September 30, 2020
my predecessor Congressman John
Peterson. We were truly blessed to wel-
come her to the Thompson Team.
Barb is an active member in her com-
munity and never stops working hard
for our constituents, helping individ-
uals get much-needed assistance on
issues related to the VA, Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, and so much more. She
is the kind of person who is willing to
step up, take charge, and get the job
done.
In the little spare time she has when
she is not helping others, Barb is an
avid golfer and a wonderful singer. I
can’t thank Barb enough for her hard
work and dedication and sense of
humor over the years.
f
RECOGNIZING THE BOTTO FAMILY
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I
rise to recognize a well-known and be-
loved family in south Jersey, the
Bottos.
The Botto family embodies the
American Dream. Under the vision of
Robert Sr.—the Sausage King, or Big
Bob—the Bottos followed their meat
market with the Botto’s Italian Line
restaurant, a supermarket, catering
and banquet hall.
I can attest, the Bottos’ family sau-
sage, meatballs, and meats are abso-
lutely delicious. I had the pleasure of
touring some of the facilities last
month with Dominic and Enrico Botto.
Your family is a testament to the
fact that hard work and passion will
get you far in life. And in the minds of
everyone who has ever had the pleasure
of enjoying a meal or spending time
with you, this is the true American
Dream, a family who worked hard, who
reached for the brass ring, who did
more, and never gave up.
God bless you and your family for
your commitment to the community,
and I look forward to plenty of full
stomachs in the future.
f
THE GROWING THREAT IN CHINA
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the
China Task Force uncovered reprehen-
sible behavior from the Chinese Com-
munist Party, and it is time that we
hold them accountable.
This body has taken action to con-
demn the gross state-sponsored oppres-
sion of the Uyghurs and stood strongly
in support of freedom and democracy in
Hong Kong.
However, the COVID–19 pandemic
spotlighted for the American people
the growing threat the Chinese Com-
munist Party poses.
From the beginning, the CCP has
covered up vital medical information,
allowing what could have been a local
outbreak in Wuhan to turn into the
global pandemic that decimated our
economy, killed almost a million peo-
ple worldwide, and weakened the Amer-
ican resolve.
Madam Speaker, I commend the
China Task Force for their hard work
making realistic policy recommenda-
tions to help the U.S. stand strong in
the face of the growing threat in China.
f
HEALING THE NATION
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I rise because in the last day, I feel
compelled to speak about healing the
Nation.
Through my years of service, I have
been able to serve on a number of com-
mittees and alliances in my Congres-
sional district, in my city, in my State,
that brought people together.
I was chairperson of the Interfaith
Ministries.
I participated in a campaign of No
More Hate.
I have interacted with Muslims and
Jewish communities alike.
Where the Nation is now is not where
her values are. The Nation is not tak-
ing the attention that is being given by
the world because of the rise of white
supremacy—Boogaloo Boys, Proud
Boys.
The Nation needs a healer and a uni-
fier. We, as the American people, are
much better when we disagree and ac-
knowledge our disagreement, but we
are unified around the values of equal-
ity and justice in this Nation.
Those of us who want to improve po-
lice community relationships are not
antipolice and should not be seen as
that. Black Lives Matter is not a ter-
rorist group. In fact, the terrorist
groups have been designated as white
supremacists.
Let us unify and come together
around the truth. I am ready to do so
to heal the Nation.
f
RECOGNIZING DARRELL WOOD
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
TLAIB). Under the Speaker’s announced
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) is
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.
Darrell Wood and his patriotic con-
tributions to the city of Benton, Ar-
kansas.
Earlier this summer, Benton’s
mayor, Tom Farmer, noticed a street
adorned with American flags. Over the
coming weeks, Mayor Farmer noticed
that more and more flags were appear-
ing around the city until nearly every
street in Benton was decorated. After
asking citizens, Mayor Farmer deter-
mined that Mr. Wood was responsible
for this patriotic display.
To show their appreciation, Mayor
Farmer and the City Council formally
honored Mr. Wood for his contributions
to the community with a commemora-
tive plaque. The beautiful sight of
these flags has inspired others in the
community to add more of their own.
Mr. Woods’ actions have served as a
bright light in these trying times, and
we thank him for his selfless service to
his city.
RECOGNIZING JAMES ‘‘SKIP’’ RUTHERFORD
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, today I rise to recognize
James ‘‘Skip’’ Rutherford, who an-
nounced plans to retire as dean of the
University of Arkansas, Clinton School
of Public Service in Little Rock.
Mr. Rutherford has served in this
role since 2006 and planned to retire
earlier this year but stayed longer than
expected to help the school, students,
faculty, and staff weather the storm of
COVID–19, which shows his dedication
to the lives of those with whom he
works.
Skip had a passion for public service
at a young age as he watched the elec-
tion returns on the courthouse lawn in
Batesville, Arkansas. He believed in
order to make a real difference, you
need to roll up your sleeves and get in
the arena. He was instrumental in the
building of the Clinton Presidential Li-
brary, the development of the River
Market District, and coordinating the
40th anniversary commemoration of
the 1957 integration of Little Rock Cen-
tral High School, which in turn led to
the school being named a national his-
toric site.
Martha and I wish Skip a fulfilling
and active retirement.

RECOGNIZING GRADY SPANN
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize
Grady Spann, the director of Arkansas
State Parks, who was recently named
president of the National Association
of State Park Directors.
Mr. Spann is a 27-year employee of
Arkansas State Parks, having pre-
viously served as superintendent of the
Ozark Folk Center, Historic Wash-
ington, and the Parkin Archaeological
State Park. In 2012, he was named su-
pervisor of Region 5, a newly created
region of State parks.
Mr. Spann’s passion and dedication
earned him not only the position of di-
rector of Arkansas State Parks in 2016,
but now as president of the National
Association of State Park Directors.
The association aims to promote and
advance State park systems through-
out the United States.
Grady’s commitment to the preserva-
tion of the Natural State and beyond is
evident in his leadership. I congratu-
late Grady Spann and wish him well in
this new leadership assignment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5099
September 30, 2020
Morrilton, Arkansas, on the occasion
of their 75th year of service.
Post 4453, also known as the Martin-
Bradley Post, has been given their Dia-
mond Jubilee Award for their excep-
tionally long and dedicated service to
veterans in the Morrilton area.
Our Veterans of Foreign Wars posts
in Arkansas do so much to support our
heroes, once they return home from
service, by providing access to re-
sources and a sense of community. The
VFW posts also honor veterans once
they pass, keeping their memories
alive in the hearts of central Arkan-
sans.
Every year for the Fourth of July,
VFW Post 4453 lines up American flags
for the Morrilton Walk of Flags. Each
of these flags is a visual reminder of
the brave men and women from
Conway County who defended our free-
dom at home and abroad.
Thank you to our central Arkansas
veterans who have laid their lives on
the line for country, and congratula-
tions to the Martin-Bradley Post of the
American Veterans of Foreign Wars for
their 75 years of service. May they
serve many more in the years ahead.
HONORING DALE ENGLISH
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life
of a great Arkansas public servant, Mr.
Dale English. He was 80 years old.
Before passing, Dale served the city
of Searcy for 33 years as city council-
man, and he served the fire department
for 20 years, retiring as captain.
Throughout his years of public serv-
ice, Mr. English developed a reputation
as a thoughtful, intelligent leader who
earned the respect of his peers.
As a constant presence on the Searcy
City Council for the past 33 years, Mr.
English’s knowledge and experience
were only matched by his love and
commitment to youth sports.
His memory will serve the commu-
nity as a model of an effective, dedi-
cated public servant for years to come.
I join the citizens of Searcy and all
Arkansans in honoring the remarkable
life of Dale English. He will be missed.
May he rest in peace.
RECOGNIZING RYAN CHRISTIANSEN
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, today I rise to recognize the
accomplishments and service of Ryan
Christiansen of Bald Knob, Arkansas.
Ryan is a member of Troop 157 of the
Boy Scouts of America. His goal was
always to become an Eagle Scout,
which he accomplished on April 25,
2019, after earning 51 Scouting badges,
30 more than the number required.
For his Eagle Scout project, Ryan
built a mobile drop box for the proper
retirement of American flags. He is ad-
ditionally working to place Purple
Heart parking signs at businesses in
his area.
The Arkansas Veterans of Foreign
Wars named Ryan the 2020 Eagle Scout
of the Year. He was additionally hon-
ored with a challenge coin from the
White County Sheriff’s Office, and
County Judge Mike Lincoln named Au-
gust 7 Ryan Christiansen Appreciation
Day coinciding with Purple Heart Day.
Now a freshman at Arkansas State
University, Mr. Christiansen has
worked tirelessly in the service of oth-
ers, and I am proud to honor his hard
work and perseverance today.
RECOGNIZING BARRY MCKUIN
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize
Barry McKuin. Barry is stepping down
from his responsibilities after 15 years
of service to the Winthrop Rockefeller
Institute as an original board member
and advocate for this important non-
profit organization.
Mr. McKuin first served as the CFO
of Winrock Farms after Governor Win-
throp Rockefeller passed away in 1973,
and his involvement only grew from
there. He was heavily involved in the
Conway County Economic Develop-
ment Corporation and served as its
president.
Barry has always put his community,
the town of Morrilton, on the map by
involving the town in the Uncommon
Communities Program, which pro-
motes local community and economic
development.
Lisenne Rockefeller, Institute board
member, said, ‘‘Barry saw the big pic-
ture, focused on the future, and kept
others on track.’’
Mr. McKuin’s service to the nonprofit
and community are greatly appre-
ciated. Congratulations on his success-
ful tenure at the Winthrop Rockefeller
Institute, and we wish Barry McKuin
success in years to come.
RECOGNIZING MARY NEWSOME
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, today, I recognize the career
and contributions of Mary Newsome to
the University of Arkansas Community
College at Morrilton and to Conway
County, Arkansas.
Mary is the longest-serving employee
of the college, beginning in 1981 as
extra help and, now, currently serving
as the assistant to the chancellor. Yet
after 39 years, her dedication to others
goes far beyond the campus in
Morrilton.
Her list of community involvement is
long, including her service as a board
member of the Morrilton Area Cham-
ber of Commerce, CHI St. Vincent
Morrilton, Conway County Senior
Adult Center, and the Conway County
School Counts. She additionally serves
as secretary of the Conway County
branch of the NAACP and as a Sunday
school teacher at her church.
Mary always makes you feel so wel-
come. She is a neighbor that everybody
wants and a citizen that every commu-
nity needs. She has dedicated her life
to the betterment of others, and I
thank her for her years of service to
UA Community College Morrilton and
central Arkansas.
RECOGNIZING DIONNE JACKSON
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, today I rise to recognize
Dionne Jackson, the executive director
of AR Kids Read, for striving to im-
prove the literacy of Arkansas chil-
dren.
Ms. Jackson recognized the impor-
tance of literacy very young, after re-
alizing that a family member could not
read or write when they signed a docu-
ment with an X rather than sign their
name. This experience inspires her
work daily at AR Kids Read.
Dionne grew up in the Western Hills
neighborhood of Little Rock and at-
tended Hendrix College in Conway.
After earning her degree, she became a
science teacher at her alma mater,
Horace Mann High School.
She earned her master’s from the
University of Central Arkansas and
went on to earn a Doctorate in Edu-
cation from Baylor University, then
becoming a tenured professor at
Hendrix.
As the executive director of AR Kids
Read, she works every day to further
their mission to advance the literacy
education of Arkansas children and
families with the aim of having stu-
dents read proficiently by the third
grade.
Our community is so grateful to her
dedication for this essential need in
our area.
RECOGNIZING DARRELL WALKER
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, as we start a new school year,
I rise today to recognize the University
of Arkansas at Little Rock’s men’s bas-
ketball coach, my friend, Darrell Walk-
er, who was named last year’s Sun Belt
Coach of the Year.
Coach Walker became the third UA
Little Rock coach ever to win the
award, leading the Trojans to one of
the Nation’s best turnarounds, going
from a 10–21 record the previous year to
21–10 this past season.
That includes a 15–5 record in the
Sun Belt Conference, on the way to UA
Little Rock’s first outright league title
since 2015–2016.
The spring of pandemic cut short the
passion of March Madness. The Trojans
were one of just two teams in Division
I that finished in 1st place in their con-
ference after being picked 11th or lower
in the conference preseason.
Coach Walker’s passion for excel-
lence in leadership and hard work are
always evident, and he can now add
Sun Belt Coach of the Year to his long
list of accolades and career accom-
plishments.
Good luck to Coach Walker, and good
luck to the 2020–2021 team. Go Trojans.
RECOGNIZING DERRICK CLARK
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Der-
rick Clark, who has made Arkansas
proud with his resilience and his deter-
mination.
For years, Derrick wrestled with
drug abuse and homelessness on the
streets in Little Rock, looking some-
how for a fresh start. He spent time at
Jericho Way, our Little Rock shelter,
where he was able to meet people who
saw his potential.
Madam Speaker, Mr. Clark made
that slow march to sobriety and self-

sufficiency by working minimum-wage
jobs until he landed a position with a
trucking company. Armed with a com-
mercial driver’s license and gainful em-
ployment under his belt, Derrick estab-
lished the Paul Philia Scholarship to
give others the opportunity to attend
trucking school.
Mr. Clark put up the first $1,000 of his
own money to launch the scholarship,
and the fund was quickly put with the
Arkansas Community Foundation. The
J.C. Thompson Trust has agreed to
match every dollar donated up to
$10,000. Mr. Clark is now enrolled in
college classes and dreams of writing a
book.
Madam Speaker, I commend Mr.
Clark and wish him the best of luck in
his journey, that journey of the pursuit
of happiness.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

REMEMBERING CULLAN BROWN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER)
for 30 minutes.
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to pay tribute to the remarkable
life led by Mr. Cullan Brown from
Eddyville, Kentucky.
Mr. Brown was a student athlete at
the University of Kentucky where he
excelled on the golf course. He passed
away in August at the age of 20 after
battling a rare form of bone cancer.
A young man with a love for golf, he
racked up numerous accomplishments
over his young career. He won the indi-
vidual Kentucky High School Athletic
Association State Championship, Lyon
County’s first State championship in
any sport.
Mr. Brown was a highly ranked re-
cruit nationwide in 2018 and could have
played golf at many different schools,
but he decided to commit to the Uni-
versity of Kentucky, saying: ‘‘I love
the State of Kentucky and its people.’’
Cullan Brown would go on to have a
successful freshman year at the Uni-
versity of Kentucky, including being
named to the All-Southeastern Con-
ference freshman team.
Even more impressive than his suc-
cess on the golf course, friends, coach-
es, and others have widely noted that
this young man had a love for the peo-
ple around him and impacted many
lives with his wonderful personality.
Cancer takes a harsh toll on individ-
uals and families. One life lost to this
disease is too many. It is critical for
our Nation to double down on efforts to
fight cancer, including expanding re-
search efforts aimed at developing ef-
fective treatments and cures.
Cullan Brown was a force for good
whose courageous battle inspired
many. His family and friends continue
to be in our thoughts and prayers.
HONORING JEREMY CREASON
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Mayfield Fire Depart-
ment Chief Jeremy Creason for re-
cently being named the Kentucky
League of Cities 2020 City Employee of
the Year.
Mr. Creason joined the Mayfield Fire
Department in Graves County in 2008,
serving as a firefighter and paramedic.
He quickly rose through the ranks to
become chief at the age of 34.
At a time when essential workers
have made numerous adjustments to
serve their communities, Mr. Creason’s
dedication to Mayfield has been on full
display. When personal protective
equipment was scarce, he found some
for his fellow firefighters to ensure
they remained safe. This, along with
other precautions he took, have proven
to be effective, with no positive cases
within the Mayfield Fire Department
personnel.
In addition to taking good care of his
staff, Mr. Creason met with local busi-
nesses and churches to advise them on
capacity seating in their buildings and
regulations for reopening. His due dili-
gence is a shining example of caring for
others and taking proper precautions
to safely reopen.
I am honored to recognize Jeremy
Creason for this award and his excel-
lent service and commitment to his
community.

HONORING NEIGHBORHOOD PET STORES
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the support neighbor-
hood pet stores provide for our local
communities.
Due to the COVID–19 pandemic, small
businesses have been slammed eco-
nomically, but these dire cir-
cumstances have provided us with an
opportunity to raise awareness of the
tremendous impact local pet stores
have on our communities.
As we all know, our animals serve as
an extension of our families and often
provide a source of friendship and com-
fort for both adults and children. Dur-
ing the pandemic, that companionship
has become even more paramount as
pet owners are spending significantly
more time with their pets.
Local pet stores establish personal
relationships with the community,
whether those relationships are formed
through employees providing expert
advice and helping customers buy the
correct product for their animals or
helping to raise money for the local hu-
mane society.
These small businesses make a huge
impact on the lives of our animals, and
they become part of our families’ lives,
watching the pets grow over the years
and serving as a go-to resource time
and time again.
I join with everyone in honoring the
extraordinary work neighborhood pet
stores do to make a difference in our
pets’ lives. I am honored to represent
them as they continue to build rela-
tionships throughout the First Con-
gressional District of Kentucky and
across the United States.
CONGRATULATIONS TO MARIE GATTON PHILLIPS
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
to congratulate Marie Gatton Phillips
Elementary School in Sacramento,
Kentucky, for receiving the distinction
of a 2020 National Blue Ribbon School
by the U.S. Department of Education.
The award is based on a school’s over-
all academic performance or progress
in closing achievement gaps among
student subgroups.
I am grateful to the hardworking fac-
ulty and staff at Marie Gatton Phillips
Elementary School for their commit-
ment to the betterment of their stu-
dents and the local community. Their
passion for creating a positive and sup-
portive learning environment helps
each student develop essential aca-
demic and social skills.
These skills help them succeed both
inside and outside the classroom, plac-
ing them on a path to become leaders
in their communities for years to
come.
At a time when schools are working
tirelessly to adjust to present chal-
lenges, I am proud to congratulate you
all on this terrific achievement. Your
faculty, staff, and students are very de-
serving of this honor.
I look forward to continued success
from Marie Gatton Phillips Elemen-
tary School. All of McLean County, the
First Congressional District, and the
Commonwealth of Kentucky should be
very proud of this recognition.
HONORING ROGER HOLLOWAY
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Roger Holloway of Hop-
kinsville, Kentucky, a veteran and one
of the last Buffalo Soldiers alive, who
is on a mission to keep their legacy
front and center.
Mr. Holloway enlisted in the U.S.
Army in 1950 at the age of 17, serving in
the Vietnam and Korean wars where he
rose in the ranks to be named a cor-
poral and squad leader.
At that time, the all-Black regiment
was segregated from the general Army
that would soon be integrated in 1951.
In 1953, Mr. Holloway took a break
from service, but soon reenlisted in
1954 and served in the airborne division
until his retirement in 1972.
Mr. Holloway is now on a mission, a
new mission, spreading the word to
keep the stories of the Buffalo Soldiers
alive.
In 1866, Congress passed the Army Or-
ganization Act, creating the Buffalo
Soldiers, a unit composed of all Afri-
can-American troops. The Buffalo Sol-
diers mainly helped to protect the
western frontier after the American
Civil War and later fought in the Span-
ish-American War and the Korean war.
The Buffalo Soldiers were a pivotal
part of our Armed Forces, including
working to secure the first U.S. victory
in Korea on July 20, 1950.
I am honored to share the excep-
tional history of the Buffalo Soldiers
on the House floor today. Throughout
decades of service, they provided much-
needed support, not only for our mili-
tary but for all Americans. I am proud
of all of their accomplishments.

CONGRATULATIONS TO STARFISH ORPHAN
MINISTRIES
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Starfish Orphan
Ministries in Paducah, Kentucky, for
being selected as an Angels in Adoption
Honoree by the 2020 Congressional Coa-
lition on Adoption Institute.
The Angels in Adoption program hon-
ors individuals and organizations fo-
cusing on adoptions, permanency, and
child welfare issues. I was proud to
nominate this outstanding organiza-
tion for this award, which they have
gone above and beyond to achieve.
The Starfish Orphan Ministries sup-
ports children going through the foster
care and adoption processes, both in
my district and around the world.
One way they help children is
through Kendra’s Kloset. This program
serves single-parent households, foster
parents, and teens aging out of the sys-
tem by providing them with clothing
and furniture. These and other neces-
sities allow children to become more
settled in their new home environ-
ments.
In addition to serving Kentucky chil-
dren, Starfish Ministries has expanded
the footprint of their ministry through
international mission trips. They regu-
larly take high school students on mis-
sion trips to Central and South Amer-
ica, giving young people hands-on expo-
sure to community outreach programs,
which make an extraordinary dif-
ference in countless lives.
Thanks to their tireless efforts to
promote the well-being of children, I
can think of no organization more de-
serving of this recognition.
Congratulations, again, to Starfish
Orphan Ministry of Paducah.
HONORING THE LATE TREVOR GOSSER
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor my friend, the late
Trevor Gosser from Russell County,
Kentucky, who tragically passed away
last month.
I first met Trevor on Gosser Ridge in
Russell County when I was out cam-
paigning with farmers. I hired Trevor
at the Kentucky Department of Agri-
culture when I served as Kentucky’s
Commissioner of Agriculture.
He quickly demonstrated a strong
work ethic and high level of dedication
to his work. He also became a good
friend of mine, and I offer heartfelt
condolences to his family.
Trevor was a devoted husband, fa-
ther, and employee who was able to get
along with everyone.
I join with everyone throughout Rus-
sell County and the First Congres-
sional District of Kentucky in keeping
his family in our thoughts and prayers.
HONORING THE LATE TED ROBERTS
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the late Mr. Ted Rob-
erts, a Paducah, Kentucky, whose life
was dedicated to public service in his
community.
Throughout his job at the United
States Postal Service, Mr. Roberts rose
through the ranks to become the first
and only African American to hold the
position of postmaster for the United
States Postal Service in this tristate
region.
In addition to serving as postmaster,
he served as a member of the Post-
master General Speaker’s Bureau in
1991 and a member of the National
League of Postmasters of the United
States.
Mr. Roberts’ community service ex-
tends beyond the Postal Service. He
was a part of the Paducah mayor’s
Task Force on Human Rights; commis-
sioner of the Paducah Human Rights
Commission; vice president of the Pa-
ducah, Kentucky, NAACP chapter; and
an associate member of the Fraternal
Order of Police. Throughout these
roles, Mr. Roberts proved himself to be
an integral part of his community.
In addition to serving his commu-
nity, Mr. Roberts served his country in
the Navy during the Vietnam war.
I am honored to recognize Mr. Rob-
erts, whose distinguished record of pub-
lic service is remarkable.
Thank you for being an exceptional
leader with unparalleled contributions
to the city of Paducah and all of west
Kentucky.
HONORING RICHARD DICKEN
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
to honor Richard Dicken from my
hometown of Tompkinsville, Kentucky.
Richard retired from TVA, where he
was a well-respected engineer.
To demonstrate both his work ethic
and his entrepreneurial spirit, Richard
began building houses while working
full time at TVA.
Upon his retirement from public
work, Richard returned home to Mon-
roe County and started four credible
businesses, which employed hundreds
of people: Dicken Construction, South-
ern Kentucky Hardwood Flooring,
Country Boy Pellets, and a lumber
company.
Richard told people to ‘‘always keep
busy and work hard for anything and
everything you want in life.’’
Richard Dicken passed away unex-
pectedly last month. He is survived by
his spouse, Stephanie Dicken, four
stepchildren, one brother, and two sis-
ters.
He was a true Monroe County success
story who will be deeply missed.
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE AMY CONEY BARRETT
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to speak on the importance of
ensuring that the Supreme Court, the
highest court in our land, is armed
with Justices who will respect our gov-
ernment’s guiding light, the Constitu-
tion.
There is a reason that my friends on
the left are so heartbroken by the pos-
sibility of President Trump’s out-
standing nominee to the Supreme
Court being confirmed. Unfortunately,
they see judges as lawmakers, not
merely interpreters of the law, as out-
lined in the Constitution. Any judge
who rightfully stands in the way of ju-
dicial activism is a barrier to their
agenda.
They want policy to be made by
unelected black robes, not through the
leaders we elect at the ballot box.
Democrats’ only hope for forcing fringe
policies on the American people is for
judges to sign off on unconstitutional
executive actions, which we saw Presi-
dent Obama repeatedly pursue as a sub-
stitute for congressional approval.
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an ex-
ceptional nominee who brings a wealth
of experience from her time in both the
private sector and on the Federal
bench. She was confirmed to her cur-
rent position on the Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals by a bipartisan vote,
including with the support of Hillary
Clinton’s 2016 running mate. Everyone
who has spent time around her has
praised her qualifications and devotion
to the law.
Additionally, she clerked for the late
Justice Scalia and has pledged to fol-
low his philosophy of following the
words of the Constitution, not legis-
lating from the bench.
Being extremely qualified and de-
voted to the Constitution is apparently
a red flag for Washington Democrats.
They are going to desperate lengths to
stop her confirmation, including at-
tacking her faith and threatening to
impeach President Trump for following
his constitutional duty to nominate a
replacement for the late Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg.
The American people put President
Trump and the Republican Senate in
charge to nominate and confirm judges
to the Federal bench. President Trump
was incredibly transparent about his
plans, even putting out a list of can-
didates he would choose from. And the
American people elected him to do just
that.
I look forward to seeing the Senate
fulfill their constitutional duty and
confirm the President’s very qualified
and capable nominee.
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how
much time I have remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 17 minutes.
EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
ABSENTEE VOTING AND MAIL-IN VOTING
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I want
to conclude by talking about the elec-
tion process that we are about to face.
Recent news stories from across Amer-
ica highlight the fundamental problem
with blue States implementing uni-
versal mail-in voting.
Now, let me explain the difference
between absentee voting and universal
mail-in voting. Absentee voting is
where a registered voter requests a bal-
lot. Universal mail-in voting is where
everyone on the voter rolls receives
ballots unsolicited.
With respect to mail-in voting, we
have uncertainty, delay, and inaccu-
racy. These are the consequences of the

universal mail-in scheme that threaten
the integrity of American elections.
As ranking member of the Oversight
and Reform Committee, I recently pub-
lished a report, alongside Congressman
JIM JORDAN, that laid out these threats
to our elections. Simply put, Democrat
States are changing the rules in the
middle of the game.
There is nothing wrong with absentee
voting. Absentee voting is a time-hon-
ored tradition where voters request a
ballot if they are unable to vote in per-
son. Expanded absentee voting is ap-
propriate for those who don’t feel safe
because of the COVID–19 pandemic. I
support absentee voting.
However, blue State Governors have
taken mail-in voting to a whole new
level. Their brilliant idea is to mail out
ballots to everyone on the voter rolls,
which are notoriously inaccurate.
b 1945
They include people who have moved
and even died, creating a situation ripe
for fraud as millions of unrequested
ballots go out to households. Who lives
in those households? We don’t know.
Look no further than my home State
of Kentucky, where former Secretary
of State Alison Lundergan Grimes was
sued for the State’s failure to maintain
accurate voter registration lists.
And just yesterday, New York City
announced that they would be re-
sending nearly 100,000 absentee ballots
out due to a printing error just a
month before the election.
This raises numerous questions: How
many of these ballots were already
cast? Will votes in New York count
twice? Do these ballots even have to be
postmarked?
The fact that we are even asking
these questions raises fundamental
concerns with the integrity of the up-
coming election.
Another concern is the flurry of late
ballots we will see after election day. It
is a disgrace to our electoral system
that we are allowing ballots to be
counted for days after the November 3
election. Shame on the States that are
allowing this to happen, including Ken-
tucky.
Ballots received after election day is
a disaster waiting to happen. If you
vote by mail, then do it now, or at
least by October 15 or October 20 to en-
sure that it has time to arrive by elec-
tion day.
We know what the consequences of
ballots accumulating in the days and
weeks after election day will be. Look
no further than a recent New York pri-
mary, where Governor Cuomo’s shift to
mail-in voting led to absolute chaos.
Election officials disqualified thou-
sands of ballots for not having timely
postmarks, and the election wasn’t cer-
tified for 6 weeks.
The surest guarantee of election in-
tegrity is for Americans to vote in per-
son where safe and possible. Even Dr.
Fauci has declared in-person voting to
be safe. This method comes with
knowledgeable workers, identity verifi-
cation, and secure ballot submission
practices. These safeguards will mini-
mize any delay in election results and
ensure the integrity of the outcome.
I wish Congress could come together
to have universal voting standards for
what will be a Presidential race that,
by all accounts, will come down to the
wire.
Ballots should be received by elec-
tion day, and if we can’t agree on that,
then surely we can agree that ballots
that are received after election day
have to be postmarked.
There are States that are coming out
with new guidance that say ballots re-
ceived after election day don’t even
have to be postmarked. Are you kid-
ding me?
We have to come together on this be-
fore we leave. We have to come to-
gether to ensure the integrity of our
elections.
Madam Speaker, that concludes my
remarks, and I yield back the balance
of my time.

ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO THE
DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAIN FROM
RELIANCE ON CRITICAL MIN-
ERALS FROM FOREIGN ADVER-
SARIES AND SUPPORTING THE
DOMESTIC MINING AND PROC-
ESSING INDUSTRIES—MESSAGE
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–
155)
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message
from the President of the United
States; which was read and, together
with the accompanying papers, referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
and ordered to be printed:
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et
seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United
States Code, I hereby report that I
have issued an Executive Order declar-
ing a national emergency to deal with
the threat posed by our Nation’s undue
reliance on critical minerals, in proc-
essed or unprocessed form, from foreign
adversaries.
A strong America cannot be depend-
ent on imports from foreign adver-
saries for the critical minerals that are
increasingly necessary to maintain our
economic and military strength in the
21st century. Because of the national
importance of reliable access to crit-
ical minerals, I signed Executive Order
13817 of December 20, 2017 (A Federal
Strategy To Ensure Secure and Reli-
able Supplies of Critical Minerals),
which required the Secretary of the In-
terior to identify critical minerals and
made it the policy of the Federal Gov-
ernment ‘‘to reduce the Nation’s vul-
nerability to disruptions in the supply
of critical minerals.’’ The critical min-
erals identified by the Secretary of the
Interior are necessary inputs for the
products our military, national infra-
structure, and economy depend on the
most. Our country needs critical min-
erals to make airplanes, computers,
cell phones, electricity generation and
transmission systems, and advanced
electronics.
Though these minerals are indispen-
sable to our country, we presently lack
the capacity to produce them in proc-
essed form in the quantities we need.
American producers depend on foreign
countries to supply and process them.
Whereas the United States recognizes
the continued importance of coopera-
tion on supply chain issues with inter-
national partners and allies, in many
cases, the aggressive economic prac-
tices of certain non-market foreign
producers of critical minerals have de-
stroyed vital mining and manufac-
turing jobs in the United States. We
must reduce our vulnerability to ad-
verse foreign government action, nat-
ural disaster, or other supply disrup-
tions. Our national security, foreign
policy, and economy require a con-
sistent supply of each of these min-
erals.
Using the authority vested in me by
IEEPA, the Executive Order requires
the Secretary of the Interior, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the
Secretary of Commerce, and the heads
of other executive departments and
agencies, as appropriate, to investigate
our Nation’s undue reliance on critical
minerals, in processed or unprocessed
form, from foreign adversaries. Fol-
lowing this investigation, the Execu-
tive Order requires the Secretary of the
Interior to submit a report to the
President recommending additional ex-
ecutive action.
The Executive Order also declares
that it is the policy of the United
States to protect and expand the do-
mestic supply chain for minerals. Spe-
cific executive department and agency
heads, including the Secretary of the
Interior and the Secretary of Energy,
are directed to take various actions to
protect and expand the domestic sup-
ply chain for minerals, consistent with
applicable law, such as the publication
of guidance, the revision of regula-
tions, and the acceleration of the
issuance of permits.
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued.
DONALD J. TRUMP.

COMMENDING BRIGADIER
GENERAL DAVID A. PIFFARERIO
HON. DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to commend Brigadier General
David A. Piffarerio for his admirable dedication
and selfless service to our Nation. BG
Piffarerio will retire from his assignment as
Commander of the 482nd Fighter Wing, Air
Force Reserve Command, Homestead Air Re-
serve Base (HARB), Florida on August 2,
2020. BG Piffarerio first took command of the
482nd Fighter Wing at HARB on September 9,
2018. BG Piffarerio’s tenure as Commander
has marked everlasting change in the City of
Homestead.
BG Piffarerio was commissioned to the
United States Air Force in 1994 as an honor
graduate. BG Piffarerio has served as a com-
mand pilot with over 3,500 flying hours making
him one of the most proficient pilots in air-
crafts such as the F–15E. His devotion to fly-
ing led him to a major milestone, becoming
the first pilot in the Air Force to log 1,000
hours in the F–22 Raptor. BG Piffarerio has
dedicated over 13 years on active duty in a
variety of F–15E Strike Eagle and F–22 as-
signments. He was selected as part of the first
cadre to test the F–22 during follow-on evalua-
tions in 2002. Shortly after, BG Piffarerio was
named program manager and F–22 test direc-
tor at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. BG
Piffarerio was also a part of the initial cadre
who stood up the 477th Fighter Group in
2007. He served as the Commander of the
302nd Fighter Squadron, Air Force Reserve
Command’s 477th Fighter Group, Elmendorf
Air Force Base, Alaska. Prior to assuming
command of the 482nd Fighter Wing, BG
Piffarerio was the Command Center Director
at Joint Headquarters North American Aero-
space Defense Command and U.S. Northern
Command.
This admirable work ethic, experienced
operational knowledge, and excellent leader-
ship made him a respected and honorable
Commander of the 482nd Fighter Wing. For
the community in Florida’s Congressional Dis-
trict 26, and the devoted men and women at
Homestead Air Reserve Base, BG Piffarerio
embodies superior professionalism. He led his
members with courage and consistency.
Under his respected role, BG Piffarerio com-
manded over 2,500 personnel members,
stemming from active duty Air Force associa-
tion personnel, traditional reservists, Air Re-
serve technicians, and full-time civilians. BG
Piffarerio also managed wide-ranging tenant
units that include the Air National Guard’s
125th Fighter Wing, Detachment 1 Alert Force,
Headquarters, Special Operations Command,
South (SOCSOUTH), U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection, U.S. Coast Guard Maritime
Safety and Security Team (MSST 91114), the
Florida Army National Guard’s 50th Regional
Support Group, and members of the United
States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
BG Piffarerio’s impact reaches far beyond
the work at HARB, ensuring the Homestead
community benefits as well. He led efforts in
enacting positive change within the community
by partnering with local businesses, Home-
stead Hospital, Veterans Affairs, Military Af-
fairs Committee (MAC), the South Dade
Chamber of Commerce, and many other com-
munity organizations. It has been an honor to
have someone of exceptional caliber serve as
Commander. On behalf of a grateful nation, I
join my colleagues today and congratulate
General Piffarerio for a lifetime of service. We
wish him, his wife, Jennifer and his son,
Bryce, the best wishes on his new journey as
Deputy Commander, U.S. Alaskan Command,
Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN SHIMKUS
SPEECH OF
HON. ADAM KINZINGER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 29, 2020
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in honor and recognition of my good
friend and mentor, Congressman JOHN SHIM-
KUS of Illinois’ 15th District.
For 23 years, JOHN has served here in the
House of Representatives, leading our delega-
tion and making his mark on the House En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. Before his
service in Congress, JOHN served our country
in the United States Army and the United
States Army Reserve, retiring with the rank of
Lieutenant Colonel.
For his district and his country, JOHN has
served with great honor, integrity, and convic-
tion. He has changed the game with his work
on our nation’s energy portfolio and chemical
safety measures, especially with the Frank R.
Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Cen-
tury Act, which became law in June 2016 and
formally outlined how we use and dispose of
chemicals.
This was a major undertaking and the suc-
cess of this legislative achievement is one of
many you’ll find throughout JOHN’s career.
In Congress, he was a champion for finding
safe nuclear waste repository solutions and re-
ducing greenhouse gases and sulfur emis-
sions.
He introduced legislation that would stream-
line permits to enable efficient broadband in-
frastructure, recognizing the needs of under-
served communities.
He also championed the 1999 legislation
that officially designated 9–1–1 as the uni-
versal emergency telephone number within the
U.S.
Yes, that’s right—JOHN SHIMKUS made 9–1–
1 the official emergency number and we
should ALL be grateful. His effort to create
and establish this comprehensive emergency
communications infrastructure has undoubt-
edly saved countless lives.
During his time in the House, JOHN’s legisla-
tive accomplishments ran the gamut—from the
9–1–1 legislation and his impressive (and ex-
pansive) energy policy portfolio, to improving
child safety measures through Anton’s Law
and others, securing funding for rare cancer
research, protecting veterans and our commu-
nities, and leading countless biofuel and tele-
communication provisions.
The bills he championed have been signed
into law by three different presidents, show-
casing the prowess JOHN has in legislating
and working across the aisle to get things
done for the American people.
It’s this ability to find common ground and
work together with his colleagues to get the
job done that has made JOHN so successful
as a Congressman and so well-respected as
a colleague.
His leadership has been critical over the
years, and I know without question that this in-
stitution is better because of his service and
that I am a better Member of Congress be-
cause of his guidance.
JOHN SHIMKUS is more than a colleague,
he’s a true friend and a patriot. His impact on
Members like me has been incredibly pro-
found and I know his legacy of servant leader-
ship will continue to serve as a model for in-
coming Members of Congress for years to
come.
Madam Speaker, the hometown hero of Col-
linsville, Illinois has served this chamber well
and is most deserving of this recognition here
today. We are going to miss our good friend
JOHN SHIMKUS in the People’s House, but we
wish him all the best in his retirement.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN SHIMKUS
SPEECH OF
HON. JEFF DUNCAN
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 29, 2020
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor a good friend and esteemed colleague,
the gentleman from Illinois, JOHN SHIMKUS.
Congressman SHIMKUS has been a true
statesman and a devoted public servant for
the people of his district.
He’s a testament to hard work, commitment
to the job, and dedication to serving the
United States of America.
JOHN and I have served on the House En-
ergy and Commerce Committee together and
share a passion for energy and environment
policy.
We have fought for Yucca Mountain and for
the promise of a permanent geological reposi-
tory for our nation’s nuclear waste, something
that impacts both South Carolina and Illinois.
We have fought for the advancement of nu-
clear energy as part of our all-of-the-above en-
ergy matrix and a carbon-free source of elec-
tricity.
We fought for these things and more—and
his efforts in these fights will be truly missed.

HONORING THE CITY OF BETHANY,
MISSOURI
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize the City of Beth-
any. Bethany is celebrating 175 years of being
a town this September. Located within Har-
rison County, Bethany may be a small town
within my district, but this town’s roots run far-
ther than can be imagined.
Bethany, having been around since 1845, is
well known for its early days of being a rail-
road town which ultimately shaped the econ-
omy, culture and community of this wonderful
town for almost 100 years until the last train
pulled out of Bethany in 1980. The Railroad
industry wasn’t the only industry that helped
the City of Bethany become what it is today.
For many years, Bethany was known as one
of the best trading places in Northwest Mis-
souri. Now thanks to the Interstate 35, Beth-
any is still is on the map in Northwest Missouri
for its service industry and retail industry
which has fueled the wonderful growth of
Bethany over the past 30 to 40 years. Home
of Babe Adams, a great baseball player who
pitched in three world series games, and Ben-
jamin Prentiss, a Civil War General and former
Postmaster of Bethany, the city of Bethany
has many reasons to be proud of its past 175
years.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in recognizing the City of Bethany for 175
years of existence but also to recognize the
city’s extremely bright future ahead. I am hon-
ored to represent every citizen within and
around the City of Bethany in the United
States Congress.

IN HONOR OF DONNA KELLY-WIL-
LIAMS, RN, PRESIDENT, MASSA-
CHUSETTS NURSES ASSOCIATION
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
honor of Donna Kelly-Williams in recognition
of her outstanding contributions to the Amer-
ican Labor Movement, the Massachusetts
Nurses Association and for nearly fifty years of
dedicated service to her community.
The daughter of Louise and John Kelly of
Somerville, MA, Donna was born on Sep-
tember 19, 1954. Her family lived on Marion
Street in Somerville until they moved to Arling-
ton, MA. Donna and her husband Bill bought
a house just a few doors down from her par-
ents where they reside today.
Donna attended St. Joseph’s High School in
Somerville. Subsequently, she enrolled at La-
Salle College where she earned her nursing
degree. She then enrolled at the University of
Massachusetts, Boston, earning her under-
graduate degree, and then earning a Masters’
Degree at Cambridge College. In 2007, she
attended the Harvard Trade Union Labor Pro-
gram.
Madam Speaker, Donna took a job at Cam-
bridge Hospital and observed a strike by a
union at the hospital. She called her father
and he instructed her to come home imme-
diately and not cross the picket line. This inci-
dent sparked her fire for collective bargaining,
workers’ rights and fair representation.
Donna accepted a nursing position at Cam-
bridge Hospital, becoming the President of the
Cambridge Hospital MNA Bargaining Com-
mittee. Not surprisingly, she rose to the posi-
tion of Vice-President of the MNA, and for the
past twelve years has been President of the
MNA.
During her tenure as MNA President, Donna
has worked ferociously to represent the
nurses and health care professionals in this
state. She has accomplished much: legislation
banning mandatory overtime was passed as
well as legislation limiting the number of pa-
tients assigned to ICU nurses across the
Commonwealth.
Throughout this COVID 19 pandemic,
Donna has fought for PPE for healthcare pro-
fessionals, for legislation to limit occupational
exposure to COVID 19, and to eliminate the
re-use of n95 masks which endangers the
safety of those who use them. She has
worked to secure housing for nurses who are
fearful of carrying the virus home, and for
counseling for those who are in need.
Madam Speaker, Donna is known for her
kind smile, quick sense of humor, her relent-
less energy when fighting for her nurses and
her affection for Dunkin’ Donuts iced coffee.
She has had the good fortune to be married
to Bill for 42 years. They are the proud par-
ents of four children and three grandchildren.
It is my distinct honor to join with Donna
Kelly-Williams’ family, friends, and contem-
poraries to thank her for her service to the
American Labor Movement, and for her dedi-
cation to nurses and patients across the Com-
monwealth of Massachusetts.

CELEBRATING BOND BETWEEN 10
YEAR OLD KHLOE MOUTRA AND
MISSOURI CITY POLICE OFFICER
HON. PETE OLSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate a special bond that developed be-
tween Missouri City, TX Police Officer Jessica
Berry and a young girl, Khloe Moutra. Their
friendship sparked a community initiative to
collect books for officers to distribute at events
and on emergency scenes.
This friendship began thanks to Khloe’s
grandmother who introduced her to officers at
the Missouri City Police Department. After the
meeting, ‘‘A Book and a Smile’’ was started
with Khloe’s extra savings, a program de-
signed to give books to families who couldn’t
get them at libraries due to the pandemic.
Khloe’s goal is to give 1 million books to 1 mil-
lion kids—and she’s well on her way with a re-
cent donation of 1,000 children’s books from
Disney.
Khloe’s grandmother wanted her to feel safe
going to the police for help when she needed
it. This simple gesture blossomed into a won-
derful friendship and initiated a goodwill effort
to support literacy and give back to the com-
munity. This special alliance highlights the po-
tential for goodwill during this pandemic and
beyond.
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I thank Khloe Moutra
and the Missouri City Police Department for
the inspirational work they’ve done for our
community.

CONGRATULATING SISTER BETH
BROSMER A CHAMPION FOR
THOSE IN NEED, ON HER RE-
TIREMENT FROM HEART, LOVE

HON. BRIAN HIGGINS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Sister Beth
Brosmer on her retirement as Executive Direc-
tor of Heart, Love & Soul, a nonprofit in the
city of Niagara Falls, New York ‘‘dedicated to
feeding those in need; body, mind and soul.’’
A native of Columbus, Ohio and a member
of the Sisters of St. Francis at Stella Niagara
for more than five decades, Sister Beth’s ca-
reer of care included a stint as development
director for her order to ensure the care of her
fellow sisters and at one of her hometown
hospitals working with volunteers. Her experi-
ence and determination in making a difference
in the lives of others made her an ideal choice
eleven years ago to lead this agency that lives
up to its name.
Heart, Love & Soul is now one of the largest
organizations in Niagara County, serving indi-
viduals and families from Niagara Falls to
Lake Ontario. Founded in 1982 as a food pan-
try by a local prayer group, Heart, Love & Soul

and nutrition classes and community care pro-
grams. Sister Beth also oversaw the develop-
ment of many strong partnerships, especially
with the students and faculty of Niagara Uni-
versity, and an expansion of private fund-
raising, foundation support and public grant
awards to meet the growing demand for qual-
ity health and nutritional services.
Sister Beth once said, ‘‘At Heart and Soul I
feel as I’ve come home’’ and it is with her wel-
coming smile, boundless energy and unwaver-
ing respect for the humanity of others that she
greets her clients, fellow staff members and all
who come to her in need. She makes every-
one feel like they have found a home as well
with her candor, commitment and complete
embrace of social justice. Sister Beth’s service
to others has blazed a trail for us to follow.
Though truly humble and generous in her
gratitude to others, it must be acknowledged
that her legacy will live on in ‘‘Daybreak,’’ the
new one-stop center opening this year fol-
lowing a multi-million-dollar capital campaign.
More than 30 partner agencies will be housed
under one roof allowing for easier access to
expanded services for the homeless and those
who find themselves in need of assistance.
I am honored to have had the opportunity to
work with Sister Beth for the betterment of Ni-
agara Falls and our Western New community
as she has become a voice for those tradition-
ally not heard and a champion for those who
deserve every opportunity to live lives of
value. Fueled by her deep faith, Sister Beth
Brosmer embodies the unyielding compassion
necessary to foster healing in mind, body and
soul. And while she will be greatly missed,
Sister Beth Brosmer’s home will always be at
Heart, Love & Soul.
Madam Speaker, I take this time to con-
gratulate, celebrate and thank Sister Beth
Brosmer for her lifetime of service. She is truly
a beacon of light and hope and her work will
leave a lasting impact on the Niagara Falls
community.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF
NORMAN DUNCAN
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to commemorate the life of Norman Duncan, a
World War II veteran who dutifully served our
country, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and
his Loudoun County community throughout his
life.
Mr. Duncan was born in 1919 to Lithuanian
immigrants and grew up in Manhattan before
moving to Washington, D.C. He was drafted
during World War II, and, following a training
accident, was reassigned to General Eisen-
hower’s extended staff and special services di-
vision. In this role, he oversaw logistics and
supply for U.S. bases in Great Britain and
supported Operation Torch in North Africa and
Operation Overlord in Normandy. He was
awarded the Legion of Honor from France in
2018 for his service.
Following his military career, he made his
home in Virginia and worked as a transpor-
tation logistics specialist. He was an advocate
for minority participation in the transportation
industry and volunteered his expertise to serve
on President Carter’s National Defense Execu-
tive Reserve and to consult on logistics for
President Reagan’s inauguration.
Mr. Duncan was also very active in his com-
munity and was named one of the 100 most
influential people in Loudoun County in 2016.
He served on the Loudoun County Transpor-
tation Economic Development Committee and
as a board member of the Loudoun Sym-
phony. He was also a passionate advocate for
caregivers, having cared for Elsie, his beloved
wife of 72 years, as she struggled with Alz-
heimer’s disease in her final years. Labor of
Love Day, which he founded, is celebrated
every Labor Day in Loudoun County to raise
awareness of family caregivers and their loved
ones who struggle with Alzheimer’s.
Mr. Duncan passed away last year at the
age of 100, two months after he attended the
75th anniversary and commemoration of the
D-Day landings in Normandy, France. He is
deeply missed by his three children, eight
grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, and
two great-great-grandchildren.
Today, the House of Representatives will
honor Mr. Duncan’s life and memory by pass-
ing legislation to name the post office in Lees-
burg, Virginia after him. I ask my colleagues to
join me in recognizing Mr. Duncan’s life and
his lifelong commitment to service.

RECOGNIZING HYDROCEPHALUS
AWARENESS MONTH
HON. LLOYD DOGGETT
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Hydrocephalus Awareness
Month. Every September patients, caregivers
and their families come together throughout
the nation in support of the more than
1,000,000 people of all ages living with hydro-
cephalus in the United States. As co-chair of
the Congressional Pediatric and Adult Hydro-
cephalus Caucus, I believe Congress has an
important role to play in both raising aware-
ness of this condition, as well as crafting poli-
cies that result in better treatments and poten-
tially a cure. I urge my colleagues to join the
caucus to learn more about this devastating
condition.
Anyone can develop hydrocephalus, an ab-
normal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in
the brain, at any time. This can include pre-
mature babies, active duty service members,
veterans, and seniors. Individuals can also be
born with hydrocephalus, develop it as part of
the aging process, or acquire it as a result of
infections, brain tumors or traumatic brain inju-
ries, among other causes. The only present
treatment for this condition is brain surgery.
From children to veterans, the prevalence of
this condition is reflected in my own district.
The physicians and staff at the Children’s
Hospital of San Antonio perform the brain sur-
geries necessary to treat many of the one in
770 babies across the country who develop
hydrocephalus per year. Nationwide, these
cases alone cost the U.S. health care system
$2 billion per year. Veterans and active mili-
tary personnel, such as those stationed at
Joint Base San Antonio, are also
disproportionally affected. Medical researchers
believe that two-thirds of our nation’s current
and former military service members suffering
from moderate to severe traumatic brain inju-
ries are at risk of developing hydrocephalus.
In the midst of this pandemic, it is now more
important than ever to improve the federal
government’s partnership with the hydro-
cephalus community. Many individuals with
hydrocephalus live with other serious medical
comorbidities, putting them at a higher risk for
severe illness from COVID–19. We must do all
we can to help patients, health care profes-
sionals and families as they struggle to main-
tain and improve quality of life during these
challenging times.
I urge my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing Hydrocephalus Awareness Month and
the 1 million Americans living with hydro-
cephalus by joining the Congressional Pedi-
atric and Hydrocephalus Caucus.

Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a
heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life
and memory of a dear mentor, a great Kansas
Citian, and an extraordinary American: Ms.
Rosemary Lowe. Ms. Lowe, who passed away
on the evening of September 22nd, was an
unstoppable force for change, force for good,
and force of nature. A public servant can only
hope to mean to their community what Ms.
Lowe means to hers. Since I learned of her
passing, I have been thinking about her re-
markable story—about everything she was
able to accomplish—and I still find it hard to
believe she was able to fit it all into just nine-
ty-four years.
Ms. Lowe grew up in Dumas, Arkansas in
the painful shadow of Jim Crow. When she
was just fifteen, her family moved to Kansas
City, where she would go on to become a pio-
neer in the fight for desegregation. Ms. Lowe
spent her early career with another pioneer in
that struggle: Black physician Dr. Dennis
Madison Miller, who would go on to be ap-
pointed Superintendent of the Jackson County
Hospital Colored Division. She worked for him
for twenty-three years at his office on 18th and
Vine. In the 1950s, Ms. Lowe was instru-
mental in efforts to desegregate downtown
Kansas City department stores. Ms. Lowe was
also instrumental in the founding of Freedom,
Incorporated of Kansas City, Missouri, a polit-
ical organization conceived in 1961 to elevate
the votes, voices, and volition of the Black
community of Kansas City to the halls of gov-
ernment. The next year, she and Freedom,
Inc. co-founder Leon Jordan ran for seats as
Democratic committee representatives for our
City’s 14th Ward. She lost. Jordan won. But
Ms. Lowe would later go on to win that seat
and hold it for two decades as Kansas City’s
first Black committeewoman. In 1964, when
thousands of activists travelled south to Mis-
sissippi as part of Freedom Summer, Ms.
Lowe stayed in Kansas City and helped reg-
ister thousands of Black voters before a city-
wide vote on a proposed ordinance that would
make it illegal to discriminate in taverns, trade
schools, hospitals, and clinics. Kansas City’s
public accommodations ordinance passed,
predating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by sev-
eral months. A retired cosmetologist, she
spent her later years, if anything, expanding
her efforts to help her community. She volun-
teered for the American Red Cross at Meno-
rah Medical Center and the Veterans Adminis-
tration Hospital of Kansas City, won and main-
tained a place on the Democratic National
Committee for six years, co-founded the Local
Investment Commission to improve the lives of
children and families in the Kansas City re-
gion, and helped convince city leaders to relo-
cate a Patrol Division of the Kansas City Po-
lice Department and rename it after none
other than Freedom, Inc. co-founder and
KCPD’s first Black lieutenant, Leon Jordan.
And whether it was Freedom, Inc., the Kansas
City Democratic Committee, LINC, or any
other of the tables of decision at which Ms.
Lowe sat, she was, more often than not, either
the only woman, the only Black voice, or both.
I failed to mention, of course, the linchpin of
Ms. Lowe’s life of service. In 1952, after the
Supreme Court ruled that people could not be
evicted from their homes on the basis of race,
Ms. Lowe’s became one of the first Black fam-
ilies to move to the beautiful Santa Fe Neigh-
borhood on the East Side of Kansas City.
Kansas City’s history of ‘redlining’ and Santa
Fe’s history of racial covenants meant the
transition for the first wave of Black residents
was far from easy. White families began to
move away in fear until, in 1955, just 15 per-
cent of the neighborhood remained White-
owned. Years later, when new residents would
move into the Santa Fe Neighborhood, they
were told to go see the President of the Santa
Fe Area Council, a Ms. Rosemary Lowe, who
had held the position for many decades. As
President of the Santa Fe Neighborhood, Ms.
Lowe fought for more streetlights, improved
housing and infrastructure, and stronger, more
trusting ties between police and the commu-
nities they had sworn to protect.
Ms. Lowe was also a sage counselor, men-
tor, and role model to countless civic leaders,
community organizers, and elected officials
like myself, who sought her wisdom as we
began our own barrier-breaking careers on a
path she helped pave. We who owed her so
much, who loved her so much, who looked up
to her so much—we called her ‘‘Mother
Lowe.’’ We sought her out not only for her ex-
perience and wisdom, but also for her kind-
ness, her warmth, and her unflinching,
unapologetic honesty. She is the political
mother of African American power in Kansas
City.
Decades working for Dr. Dennis Miller, dec-
ades as the committeewoman for the 14th
Ward, decades as the President of the Santa
Fe Area Council—Ms. Lowe was one of the
most dedicated public servants I have ever
seen in action. Hers was not a rise to power,
where one springs from one post to another.
Ms. Lowe became ‘‘Mother Lowe’’ because
she stayed in the arena, fighting in the strug-
gles of today, every day, for ninety-four years’
worth of days.
There is a stretch of street in Kansas City,
on 29th between Prospect and Indiana Ave-
nue. It runs right through the heart of the
Santa Fe Neighborhood. It is called the Hon-
orary Rosemary S. Lowe Lane. Today, we
honor a woman who has defined a stretch of
history in Kansas City. It is a stretch that runs
right through the heart of our struggle to be-
come more free and more equal. Madam
Speaker, please join me in honoring the ex-
traordinary life and memory of Ms. Rosemary
Lowe. Ms. Lowe’s march to a better future for
our city did not relent for one minute. Let us
be grateful for the world she handed us and
resolve to bring the spirit of Mother Lowe to
each and every effort we undertake to make
it better.

CONGRATULATING BILL BECKER
HON. DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Bill Becker on
his 30 years of remarkable service to the Flor-
ida Keys-based U.S. 1 Radio 104.1 FM and to
our community.
Bill began his career with U.S. 1 Radio in
1980 when the news station had just estab-
lished itself. He served as the news director,
where he broadcasted local news, and hosted
U.S. 1’s 90-minute ‘‘Morning Magazine’’ every
morning to highlight local issues and events
through on-air interviews and commentary.
His passion and devotion to marine biology
first led him to the Florida Keys and is what
jumpstarted his career in radio. After grad-
uating in 1971, Bill began working at the
Lower Keys’ Newfound Harbor Marine Institute
at Sea Camp. He taught marine biology to
kids, through outreach programs and became
involved in local organizations. Bill co-founded
one of the Lower Keys’ signature events: the
annual Underwater Music Festival that spot-
lights coral reef preservation. Every year the
event draws hundreds of diving and snorkeling
enthusiasts, as well as national and inter-
national media coverage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E903
September 30, 2020
With his unyielding dedication to his com-
munity, Bill’s work has left a tremendous im-
pact in numerous people’s lives. He volun-
teered his time during the 1998 Hurricane
Georges to offer comfort and critical live up-
dates throughout the storm. Bill partook in
broadcasts in Cuba as part of humanitarian ef-
forts led by a local group taking essential
medical supplies and food to the island nation.
In 1982, Bill broadcasted live from Key West’s
Mallory Square when the Florida Keys se-
ceded from the Union and formed the inde-
pendent Conch Republic. Aside from his hard
work in broadcasting, Bill also dedicated his
time to the community of the Lower Keys by
serving as the president of the Lower Keys
Chamber of Commerce.
Through all these accomplishments, Bill
made himself a pillar of the Keys community
and his retirement marks the end of an era.
Bill embodies the hard working, community-
minded nature that the Florida Keys is known
for. On behalf of Florida’s 26th District, I would
like to thank Bill for his contribution to the
community and wish him the absolute best in
this next chapter of his life.

RECOGNIZING MS. PATRICIA
CROWLEY, PRESIDENT/CEO OF
THE GREATER HERNANDO COUN-
TY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
HON. DANIEL WEBSTER
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker,
it is with sincere appreciation that I recognize
my friend Patricia Crowley, President/CEO of
the Greater Hernando County Chamber of
Commerce, for her leadership and service to
our business community. After 20 years of
service to the Greater Hernando County
Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Crowley will retire
on October 31, 2020.
Ms. Crowley began her career with the
Greater Hernando County Chamber of Com-
merce in March of 2000 as a Membership
Representative. A few years later, Ms. Crow-
ley was named President/CEO of the Greater
Hernando County Chamber of Commerce.
Throughout her years of service with the
Chamber, she formed strong partnerships with
local leaders and business organizations to
strengthen the county’s business environment
to enable business development and pros-
perity throughout Hernando County.
Ms. Crowley has been a dedicated servant
to people of Hernando County throughout her
career. She has served in several organiza-
tions including the United Way of Hernando
County, Kiwanis Club of Brooksville, and Oak
Hill Hospital Board.
I am honored to recognize Patricia Crowley
and thank her for her hard work and countless
contributions to the Hernando County commu-
nity. Her commitment to excellence, leadership
and service is to be admired, and may it in-
spire others to follow in her footsteps. My sin-
cerest wishes and congratulations to Pat on
her retirement.
HONORING MICHAEL LAIRMORE
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Michael Lairmore and his
nearly 10 years of distinguished service as the
Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine at
the University of California, Davis. As Dr.
Lairmore retires this year, his dedicated tenure
ensures he leaves behind a veterinary school
which, ranks among the best in the world and
is well-placed to further its success at the fore-
front of veterinary science far into the future.
Alongside the school’s pioneering research,
the veterinary hospital is unmatched in reputa-
tion and patient visits.
Dr. Lairmore became Dean in 2011 and im-
mediately set to work; crafting a long-term and
multifaceted plan to guide the institution to its
full potential. His emphasis on the importance
of the school’s student and patient experience
at the forefront of his efforts and under his
leadership, the school implemented multiple
comprehensive student programs, such as the
Office of Global Programs and the Counseling
and Career Service Center. Dr. Lairmore si-
multaneously reigned in student fees and was
a vanguard for diversity, ultimately making UC
Davis a leader among veterinary schools with
both the lowest levels of student debt and
most diverse student body. Together this al-
lowed UC Davis’ program to tackle inequities
in the veterinary field and create greater op-
portunities for the most disadvantaged stu-
dents.
Dr. Lairmore expanded the school’s re-
search capabilities—placing them at the top in
funding, infrastructure, and cutting-edge tech-
nology. With his guidance, the school
partnered with the United States State Depart-
ment’s Office of Food and Agriculture; to cur-
tail the Newcastle and Mad Cow viruses. In
addition, Dr. Lairmore played a pivotal role in
the development of USAID’s PREDICT project
and identifying the Marburg and Ebola viruses
in bats preventing potential outbreaks. While
the world continues to combat the coronavirus
pandemic, UC Davis provides a model for
stopping future pandemics before they are al-
lowed to spread.
Dr. Lairmore is continuing his career with
the School of Veterinary Medicine as a distin-
guished professor in the Department of Pa-
thology, Microbiology, and Immunology. How-
ever, it is clear that his legacy as Dean will
continue to shape the school and its students
and faculty for years to come. On behalf of the
people of California’s 3rd Congressional Dis-
trict, I offer my sincere gratitude for his dedi-
cated service and best wishes upon his future
endeavors and accomplishments.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF
GENRE VINCENT PECORA
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I
rise to celebrate the life of Genre Vincent
Pecora who sadly passed away in his North
Huntingdon, Pennsylvania home on August
30, 2020. I knew Vince personally and can at-
test that his devotion to family, community,
and country was evident to everyone who met
him.
Vince was the proud owner of Pecora Floor-
ing Inc., a southwestern Pennsylvania com-
pany specializing in institutional and industrial
installation for over fifty years. Throughout that
time, Vince earned the respect and trust of his
community through his tenacity, workmanship,
and approachability.
Outside of work, Vince was committed to
helping kids with cancer after his grandson
was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leu-
kemia. After watching one of their own go
through treatment and ultimately achieve re-
mission, the Pecora family started Genre’s
Kids with Cancer Fund to support others in
similar situations. From entertainment systems
to go-bags packed with essentials, Genre’s
Kids with Cancer Fund anticipates the needs
of families confronted with the horror of a
childhood cancer diagnosis.
Vince is survived by his wife of 56 years,
Donna Day Pecora; children, Daunette Baker
and her husband, John, Vincent Pecora and
his wife, Brenda, Dante Pecora and his wife,
Carla, and Todd Hook and his wife, Julie; sis-
ter, Antoinette Capo; grandchildren, Kaitlynn
(Ricky) Boyer, James Baker, Genre Baker,
Vincent Pecora, Gianna Baker, Avery Pecora
and Ava Pecora; and great-grandchildren, Gid-
eon Boyer, Eden Boyer, Lacey Hook and
Cameron Hook.
Madam Speaker, it is with profound sadness
that I recognize the loss of Genre Vincent
Pecora. Vince will be remembered as a friend
to many and his legacy will live on in south-
western Pennsylvania.

RECOGNIZING THE UKRAINIAN
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF CHICAGO
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Ukrainian National Museum
of Chicago (UNM), a cultural landmark in the
heart of my district, on the occasion of its an-
nual banquet. The UNM prides itself, for good
reason, on its museum artifacts, library, and
archives, which highlight Ukraine’s history, its
ongoing fight for freedom and democracy, and
the rich culture and contributions made by
Ukrainian Americans and Americans of
Ukrainian heritage, both to Chicago’s cultural
tapestry and to that of the United States.
Each one of the four waves of immigration
from Ukraine, as well as the generations of
American Ukrainians who have followed, have
brought with it a wealth of literary, music, artis-
tic, and cultural artifacts, historical
testimonials, relics, scientific patents, personal
keepsakes and reminders, all of which speak
to the importance of Ukrainian heritage and
the personal and professional accomplish-
ments of American Ukrainians across our
country.
Themselves a part of the third wave of
Ukrainian immigrants to the United States,
Olexa Hankewych, Julian Kamenetsky and
Orest Horodysky, founded the Ukrainian Li-

preserve books and other documents at risk of
destruction in Ukraine. Shortly after the estab-
lishment of the Library and Archival Center, a
call went out to the Ukrainian community,
which enthusiastically responded. Several
years later the Library and Archival Center
grew into the Ukrainian National Museum of
Chicago, fully funded by community donations.
While some artifacts in the Museum’s bur-
geoning collection were purchased in Ukraine,
others were donated by Ukrainian American
collectors and artists, as well as from personal
libraries and individuals throughout the com-
munity, in Chicago and beyond. Over 100,000
Ukrainian Americans live in Chicago, and I am
proud that the Museum has its roots in our
great city.
The Ukrainian National Museum of Chicago
too has much to be proud of, due to the hard
work of its staff, board of directors, and offi-
cers. Unfortunately, only two of its past presi-
dents remain with us—Dr. George Hrycelak
and Jaroslaw Hankewych, son of the Muse-
um’s founder, Olexa Hankewych. Today,
under the leadership of Lydia Tkaczuk, the
Museum’s first female president, the UNM
continues its work in one of Chicago’s most
historic neighborhoods, Ukrainian Village.
More than just engaging visitors and adding to
their understanding of Chicago’s rich and di-
verse communities, it also serves as a window
to Ukraine, its history, and its people.
The Museum’s diverse collection of folk-art,
fine art, tapestry, traditional dress and artifacts
help to illuminate the societal impact American
Ukrainians have had on Chicago and across
the United States. Its permanent exhibitions
educate visitors on the history, heritage, poli-
tics, culture and religions of Ukraine and the
broader Ukrainian American community, in-
cluding exhibits on the Kozak period,
Ukraine’s role in the World Wars and impor-
tantly, the Holodomor, the forced famine-geno-
cide of 10 million Ukrainians by Stalin across
1932 and 1933.
Madam Speaker, the Ukrainian National Mu-
seum is a place where visitors feel welcomed
and engaged. It serves as a pillar of knowl-
edge and culture for the Ukrainian community,
for individuals of every background who call
our city home, and for all the universities and
students, artists, and authors throughout the
world who have benefited from work in its ar-
chives. The City of Chicago is lucky to house
such an institution, and it is my privilege today
to recognize the Ukrainian National Museum
here in Congress.

REMEMBERING FATHER NICHOLAS
VIERON
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
tribute to Father Nicholas Vieron, the much
admired retired pastor of Annunciation Greek
Orthodox Church in Memphis, who passed
away Tuesday morning at the age of 94. Fa-
ther Vieron was a revered ecumenical leader
in Memphis, serving as Chairman of the Mem-
phis Ministerial Association at the time of the
1968 Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike and
the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
With Rabbi James Wax, the Reverend Frank
McRae, Dean William Dimmick and other reli-
gious leaders, Father Vieron confronted Mayor
Henry Loeb the day after the assassination,
which helped bring the strike to an end and
helped bind Memphis together during that time
of crisis for our city. A native of New Orleans
and the son of Greek immigrants, he grew up
across the street from America’s first Greek
Orthodox Church. Father Vieron came to
Memphis to become pastor of Annunciation
Church in 1955 after attending seminary in
Brookline, Massachusetts, and served as a
priest in Louisville, Kentucky, and Huntington,
West Virginia. In Huntington, he received a
master’s degree from Marshall College. In
Memphis, he received a J.D. from the Univer-
sity of Memphis School of Law in 1970. He re-
tired from Annunciation in 1991 but stayed
busy. For decades, Father Vieron taught a 15-
week course in the Greek language to all
comers, telling students that there would be
no tests but that they were required to endure
his corny jokes. My favorite: There are three
stages in life—young, middle aged, and
‘‘you’re looking good.’’ For 40 years, he
served as chaplain to the Memphis Touch-
down Club. He also served as editor of The
Epistle, a newsletter for retired Orthodox
priests. In 2015, he received the MLK Legacy
Award from the National Civil Rights Museum.
His wife of 69 years, Bess, passed in 2017. I
want to express my condolences to his sons,
Leonidas and Paul, his four grandchildren and
five great-grandchildren, the entire Annun-
ciation Greek Orthodox community, and his
many friends and admirers. Father Vieron led
an exceptional life of service and he will not
be forgotten.

Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to commend Wesley Yuen, a junior at
Clements High School from my hometown of
Sugar Land, who has helped us combat the
spread of COVID–19 in space.
This summer, Wesley was selected to at-
tend NASA’s Student Enhancement in Earth
and Space Science internship for two months
at the University of Texas, Austin. He was one
of around 60 high school students selected
from a pool of 600 applicants. Wesley and his
team successfully researched how to stop the
spread of coronavirus between astronauts
going between Earth and the ISS using the
few materials they have. This valuable work
will help set the rules for safe space explo-
ration for decades to come.
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-

Wesley for his hard work. He has a bright fu-
ture ahead, and I wish him the best of luck in

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize David Kent
Fruechtenicht. David is a very special hus-
band, father, and leader who is proudly retiring
from a career of service to this country.
David Fruechtenicht has dedicated over 41
years to protect this nation. After joining the
Air Force in 1980, David quickly realized that
he enjoyed serving his country, as he says he
just kept reenlisting and next thing he knew 20
years had flown by. After leaving active duty,
David used his expertise with Electronic Intel-
ligence to move over into DOD defense con-
tract work but still found his way back to the
Air Force by April of 2007. Whether it be ac-
tive duty, consultant, or Air Force Civilian,
David has continuously found a way to serve
his nation. As David says he wouldn’t change
anything that he has done and ultimately that
shows the true love and pride that David has
for this country and I wish him well in retire-
ment.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in recognizing David Fruechtenicht on his
retirement and for his years serving our na-
tion. l am honored to represent him in the

Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the American COMPETE Act. This
package of bills includes two of my own—the
SMART IoT Act and the Advancing Unmanned
Delivery Services Act.
The SMART IoT Act would encourage the
development of future Internet of Things poli-
cies that will promote innovation and help
these technologies grow to further benefit con-
sumers and businesses alike. It is crucial we
have the right federal policies in place to bol-
ster this industry that has dramatically
changed the way we live, manufacture goods,
farm, and even receive health care through
internet-connected devices.
I also introduced the Advancing Unmanned
Delivery Services Act with my friend from
Michigan, Mrs. Dingell. This legislation would
evaluate the many benefits contactless deliv-
ery has for various sectors of our country and
help identify potential regulatory roadblocks to
the use of their services. This technology is
especially important today as Americans de-
pend on home delivery services to remain so-
cially distant to mitigate the spread of the
coronavirus.
I urge my colleagues to vote in support of
the American COMPETE Act to ensure the
United States remains a global leader in inno-
vation.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE

CHAPTER
HON. DAVID SCOTT

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Alpha
Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated-Eta Lambda
Chapter, on their 100th Anniversary.
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., the first
inter-collegiate Greek letter fraternity estab-
lished for Black college students, was founded
at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in
1906. In a period of one hundred fourteen
years, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. grew
from one undergraduate group of seven mem-
bers to an international organization with an
active membership of more than one hundred
fifty thousand. The national organization is
now the central organization to many subordi-
nate chapters.
The Eta Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi
Alpha Fraternity, Inc. was founded in Atlanta,
chartering on May 19, 1920. As the First
Alumni Chapter, and one of the most accom-
plished in the Southern Region (Georgia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ten-
nessee, Alabama, and Mississippi) I am hon-
ored to highlight the rich history and signifi-
cance of my beloved fraternity in Atlanta.
For one hundred years, the Eta Lambda
Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has
been intertwined in the fabric of the City of At-
lanta; from Hartsfield-Jackson International
Airport to Andrew Young International Boule-
vard and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center,
just to name a few. Notable Alpha Brothers
have served as leaders in all levels of govern-
ment, business, education, and civic affairs.
I am a proud member of this prestigious or-
ganization, which was founded on the pre-
cepts of many deeds, scholarship, and love for
all mankind.
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the historic significance of the centen-
nial anniversary of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity,
Incorporated-Eta Lambda Chapter.

THE EASTSIDE GIRLS
HON. KAY GRANGER
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to offer a tribute to 15 remarkable
women who through their 65 year relation-
ships with each other is a story itself; but, I
believe, might also offer a way to carry many
of us through this tumultuous time of eco-
nomic upheaval, tragic illness and death, and
riots in our streets where we have lived
peacefully all these years.
Their belief in each other has allowed them
to love and share tragedies and disappoint-
ments. Their lifetime of friendships and memo-
ries help them to remember to laugh and
make time together.
Melany Burton Davis remembers what she
recalls as one of the scariest days of her life
at age 10, when she had to go to a new ele-
mentary school. ‘‘Little did I know that the pre-
cious girls I met that day were going to be life-
long friends. Each of them made me feel not
just accepted but valued and loved.’’
She goes on to say, ‘‘Even when we all
went our separate ways for decades, when-
ever we got together I had the same feelings
of being valued and loved. These beautiful
girls always bring joy to my heart, and I am
blessed to have them in my life.’’
They are often asked, ‘‘How do they do
that?’’
Jackie Nantz Kelly, one of the women, an-
swered, ‘‘Where to start? How do you de-
scribe a 70-year friendship?
We started in two different elementary
schools that merged into the same junior high
school where it all began. We grew closer in
high school, but went our separate ways in
college. We married, had children, some di-
vorced and had struggles of single parent
hood, but we survived and all of us raised
beautiful children. We are all not the same re-
ligion, but believe in God and we love our
country’’
In 1987, 26 years after we graduated high
school, we decided it was time for a reunion.
We remembered our best times were slumber
parties so that’s what we did, Dana Gant Tate
sent the invitation and commanded for all of
us, ‘‘Sleeping bags, pillows and baby doll pa-
jamas or you don’t come!’’
We had a great time and decided we had to
do a better job of keeping in touch, and we
did.
We began to travel.
Tricia Walker Christensen was our historian
forth is outing and in her words, ‘‘In 2010 we
had a great opportunity to celebrate and travel
when we joined 60 passengers to birth the
USS Fort Worth at Mariette Marine Corpora-
tion. One of our Eastside Girls was KAY
MULLENDORE GRANGER and she was the spon-
sor of the ship. We watched as she stood with
her grandsons and smashed a bottle of cham-
pagne against the bow of the ship. We were
proud and excited. We were also holding our
breath hoping that the hit would be successful.
KAY was never athletic, so it wasn’t a sure
thing she could do this.’’
We gathered together for parties and get
togethers that others hosted and at some
point someone suggested we needed a name.
Many of us still lived in the part of Fort Worth
where we had all that fun, so we named our-
selves ‘‘The Eastside Girls’’ for the area we
grew up in and that is the name we have used
for 23 years.
The slumber parties were a thing of the past
until 2001 when Key Stevens Richardson in-
vited us to her house in Austin. As Key puts
it, ‘‘After years apart and attempts to get to-
gether, we began the tradition of reuniting for
an annual memorable weekend a tour house.
Hank, my husband and an Eastside guy,
leaves town and our raucous group takes over
the house. We all talk at once. There is laugh-
ter (someone suggested we should be called
the ‘The Eastside Cacklers’) and there are
tears.’’
Key’s little sister Nancy Stevens Klein is the
only one allowed outside our class and she
adds. ‘‘I’m honored to be included in this won-
derful group of women who support and in-
spire each other and in doing so make each
one of us stronger. I wouldn’t miss seeing
them every year for anything.’’
Laughter is the most important part of this
long friendship. Talana Hadsell Wier says,
‘‘My very best memories are of the laughter
we always shared with whatever we did. Slid-
ing down the stairs at Melany’s house, pep
rallies at Eastern Hills High School, talking
about our boyfriends. And now making it
through the good and tough times of mar-
riages and raising families. And then being
able to once again come back to our fun times
of memories together.’’
Jaynie Lewis Shaffer says, ‘‘We are each
unique and different yet the same because of
our shared heritage. It is wonderful to be with
people who knew me then. I don’t have to ex-
plain anything to them. Like a beautiful grand
piano with individuals key that emit a beautiful
tone and perhaps at times may need fine tun-
ing, we make lovely music and come to-
gether.’’ Jaynie spent 30 years at IBM to pre-
pare herself for the most important job—tech-
nical support for the Eastside Girls.
Priscilla Willis Coleman was the cutest,
most popular and funniest of the ‘‘Girls.’’ She
never misses the August Austin slumber party
and is the most talkative and gets funnier
every year. She added that it is important
where we have that Austin soiree. ‘‘It is in the
hills of Austin so we don’t disturb anyone, and
believe me, a group of women who haven’t
been together all year, all talking at the same
time, accompanied by a few margaritas and
glasses of wine—this can become quite loud.’’
During the year we keep in touch by phone.
And we text. And Priscilla says she imagines
we will continue until we can’t drive anymore
and we will take an Uber or a van. But she
continues, ‘‘I really love these women. We
would do anything in our power to help each
other. We are happy together, sad together,
and we pray for each other. We share a com-
mon bond that knits out lives together.
We are all in our 70’s now, but we will al-
ways be the Eastside Girls.’’

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF VIRGIL SIMON LOONSFOOT
‘‘RED CLOUD’’
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, It is my
honor to recognize the life of Virgil Simon
Loonsfoot ‘‘Red Cloud’’, who passed away at
the age of 80 after a lifetime of service to his
fellow Americans. Through his extreme cour-
age and selflessness, Virgil became an indis-
pensable part of the state of Michigan.
Virgil was born on August 17, 1940 in
L’Anse, Michigan. Following his education, Vir-
gil served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam

War. After his service, he worked as a truck
driver and did maintenance for housing in
Sault Sainte Marie. Virgil was a member of the
Holy Name of Jesus church, the Keweenaw
Bay Indian Community, former president of
Ojibwa Seniors, and past commander of KBIC
Veterans. His joys in life included fishing,
watching football, enjoying the outdoors, KBIC
Community Pow Wows, and serving those in
his community through Veterans organizations
and Toys for Tots.
Virgil passed away on September 25, 2020.
He is missed dearly by his family and friends,
and his legacy will undoubtedly live on for
generations for come. Virgil’s tireless devotion
to the public good touched the lives of count-
less Michiganders, and the impact of his life
cannot be overstated. Visitation for Virgil will
be held on October 1, and his funeral service
will be held thereafter with traditional service
with drums, committal prayers, and Baraga
County Area Veterans providing military rites.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s
First Congressional District, I ask you to join
me in honoring the life of Virgil Simon
Loonsfoot ‘‘Red Cloud’’. His legacy will forever
live on in his family and through the countless
lives he bettered through his life and service.

HONORING DYLAN MONTGOMERY
EVANS
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize Dylan Mont-
gomery Evans. Dylan is a very special young
man who has exemplified the finest qualities
of citizenship and leadership by taking an ac-
tive part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop
115, and earning the most prestigious award
of Eagle Scout.
Dylan has been very active with his troop,
participating in many scout activities. Over the
many years Dylan has been involved with
scouting, he has not only earned numerous
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Dylan
has Firebuilder in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say.
Dylan has also contributed to his community
through his Eagle Scout project. Dylan con-
structed two signs that can be removed and
replaced as needed for Wesley United Meth-
odist Church in St. Joseph, Missouri.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in commending Dylan Montgomery Evans
for his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts
of America and for his efforts put forth in
achieving the highest distinction of Eagle
Scout.

SUPREME COURT REPLACEMENT
HON. JOE WILSON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, last week, South Carolina Attorney
General Alan Wilson who, when first elected in
2010, was America’s youngest Attorney Gen-
eral, explained to Newsmax with John Gizzi,
‘‘The Case for Moving the Supreme Court
Confirmation.’’
‘‘Since the passing of United States Su-
preme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, Democrats and members of the
mainstream media have accused President
Donald Trump and Senate Republicans of hy-
pocrisy and unfairness.
‘‘First, let’s look at the constitutional per-
spective. In the case of nominating and con-
firming a United States Supreme Court jus-
tice, the rules are simple. Article II, Section
2 of the United States Constitution says that
the president ‘. . . shall nominate, and by
and with the advice and consent of the Sen-
ate, shall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme
Court.’
‘‘A president has not just the right but a
duty to appoint a person to the Supreme
Court so long as that appointment is accom-
panied with the advice and consent of the
Senate.
‘‘Second, as to the historical perspective,
these actions are neither shocking nor un-
precedented. As Dan McLaughlin of the Na-
tional Review, Sen. Ted Cruz, R–Texas, and
others have pointed out, there have been 44
presidents, and 22 of them have had 29 vacan-
cies to fill in their last year in office.
‘‘Regardless of how you feel politically
about filling this vacancy, history and the
Constitution support Trump and the Repub-
lican Senate. The Senate needs to move for-
ward and fill this seat now.’’
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops, and
we will never forget September 11th in the
Global War on Terrorism.

HONORING HYDROCEPHALUS
AWARENESS MONTH
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, September 30, 2020
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker,
each year in September, designated as Hydro-
cephalus Awareness Month, hydrocephalus
patients, caregivers, and other supporters
across the country work together to raise
awareness of the impact and prevalence of
hydrocephalus and urge public and medical
officials to garner more resources to improve
treatment protocols and one day find a cure.
As we all know, COVID–19 and its inherent
social distancing requirements have limited
many public awareness activities, but this past
month members of the Hydrocephalus Asso-
ciation and the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foun-
dation, and other active supporters, adjusted
and relied on social media and other venues
to share statistics, brochures and personal
stories to enhance awareness of this condi-
tion.
As the co-chair of the Congressional Pedi-
atric and Adult Hydrocephalus Caucus, I call
on all my colleagues in the House to take the
time and learn more about hydrocephalus so
we can better assist our constituents and their
family members who live with challenges of
hydrocephalus every day.
Hydrocephalus is colloquially known as
‘‘water on the brain.’’ In truth, the condition is
caused by an abnormal build-up of cerebro-
spinal fluid and can be treated only by sur-
gically implanting a drainage shunt in the
brain. Everyone, from babies to the elderly,
can develop hydrocephalus. While some
cases are congenital, many cases are caused
by a traumatic brain injury, an infection, or
even just develop as part of the aging proc-
ess.
Hospitals across the country work to serve
the over one-million adults with hydro-
cephalus, including the New Neurons Neuro-
surgery Institute (NNNI), located in my district
in Spring Lake, New Jersey. NNNI’s pediatrics
division plays a critical role in addressing the
needs of thousands of children with hydro-
cephalus in New Jersey and across the coun-
try. Nationwide, over 400,000 babies a year
are born with hydrocephalus.
Through their compassion, skills, and critical
expertise dedicated medical professionals
such as those at NNNI save lives every day.
United States citizens are not alone in their
struggles with this condition. Unfortunately, the
global situation is even worse, which is why
I’ve introduced the Global Brain Health Act,
which adds hydrocephalus to the Foreign As-
sistance Act of 1961. This approach would en-
sure more robust foreign assistance for treat-
ing those infants and children in developing
countries with hydrocephalus and other brain
health-related conditions. It also fosters study
in treatment protocols that can be shared here
at home.
It’s essential for Members of Congress to
better understand this condition and its pro-
found impact on the people we represent. I
urge my colleagues to join the bipartisan Con-
gressional Adult and Pediatric Hydrocephalus
Caucus. As a member you will not only help
raise awareness but may also play a role in
creating public policies that lead to better
treatments and hopefully a cure.
