The House met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,
November 13, 2019.
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on
this day.
NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by
the majority and minority leaders for
morning-hour debate.
The Chair will alternate recognition
between the parties. All time shall be
equally allocated between the parties,
and in no event shall debate continue
beyond 11:50 a.m. Each Member, other
than the majority and minority leaders
and the minority whip, shall be limited
to 5 minutes.

I RISE TO DEFEND DACA
RECIPIENTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise. And still I rise because
I love my country.
And today I rise to defend those who
are recipients of the DACA program. I
rise to defend these young people be-
cause, unfortunately, bigotry is being
weaponized against them.
I rise because the Chief Executive Of-
ficer has indicated that there are hard-
ened criminals among them, but he
does it in such a way as to demean and
defame all of them. He does it on the
day that the Supreme Court of the
United States of America is consid-
ering a case with reference to DACA re-
cipients.
I rise to defend them. These are
young people who came to this country
at a very early age. They did not come
of their own volition. These are young
people who have been screened and vet-
ted. These are young people who have
gone on to get good educations. These
are young people who are contributing
to our society.
So I rise to defend the DACA recipi-
ents. I rise because I understand what
is going on. This Chief Executive Offi-
cer is not going to stop. This is just an-
other phase of his attempts to
weaponize bigotry, hatred, racism.
He did it with the Muslim ban,
weaponizing religion. He did it with the
s-hole countries, weaponizing race. He
did it with some ‘‘fine people’’ among
those in Charlottesville where a woman
lost her life, weaponizing anti-Semi-
tism.
And he has done it repeatedly and
will not stop. He went on to do it with
the ban on transgender persons in the
military, weaponizing homophobia.
This is not going to stop. We must
move to impeach this President.
I am proud to say that history, now,
is going to record that, on this day,
witnesses appeared to give testimony
with reference to why the President
should be impeached. That is how the
testimony is going to be presented.
I am not proud that this is hap-
pening. I love my country. I don’t want
this to happen in my country.
I didn’t come to Congress to be a part
of an impeachment effort against the
President, but when a President at-
tempts to weaponize race, bigotry, xen-
ophobia, Islamophobia, homophobia,
that President ought to be impeached—
and he will be.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
IMPEACHMENT MUST NOT BECOME
WEAPONIZED
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, the
House of Representatives most cer-
tainly faces a vote to impeach the
President before the end of this year. I
urge my colleagues to carefully and de-
liberately contemplate this next step
in their votes.
The Constitution provides great lati-
tude to this body in impeaching a
President. It is up to us, all 435 of us in
this Chamber, to determine what con-
stitutes a ‘‘high crime and mis-
demeanor,’’ and those determinations
clearly vary greatly among us.
As we cast those votes, we must con-
sider our place in history and the im-
plications of those votes in the future
of this Republic.
Alexander Hamilton warned of the
risks of impeachment becoming a par-
tisan act. In Federalist No. 65, he wrote
of his fear that, during impeachment,
‘‘ . . . there will always be the greatest
danger that the decision will be regu-
lated more by comparative strength of
parties, than by the real demonstra-
tions of innocence or guilt.’’ I fear the
proceedings have not heeded this warn-
ing.
Impeachment was never designed to
be a supplemental election process but,
rather, a safety valve to be used in the
rarest of occasions when an elected of-
ficial acts in such an immoral and bla-
tantly unlawful manner as to threaten
the very basis of our Republic.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to remember this as they as-
sess the interviews, depositions, and
hearings that are unfolding today and
their impending vote on impeachment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8788 November 13, 2019
Impeachment must not become
weaponized. It cannot simply be an-
other election tool.
The question before this body is not
whether a Member is comfortable with
the rhetoric of the President, his polit-
ical tactics, his use of Twitter, his pol-
icy choices, or his political rallies. The
question is: Have high crimes and mis-
demeanors been committed? And if so,
they must be prepared to demonstrate
that specifically.
I urge the Speaker of the House to
ensure that each Member, should they
desire, be afforded time, 5 minutes per
Member, during debate on impeach-
ment to explain his or her view and im-
pending vote. It is critical the Amer-
ican people, who will be watching
closely, be afforded an opportunity to
see and hear those views.
Impeachment must not be based upon
polling data, election advantages, or
social media commentary. It must be
based upon clear and compelling facts.
To do anything else threatens our Re-
public.
I intend to approach this matter in
just that way. I will uphold my oath
and vote as the circumstances require.
But this judgment also must not be
preordained based on political party or
political maneuvering by anyone serv-
ing in this Chamber.

NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP WEEK
2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, this week, we celebrate the
fifth year of National Apprenticeship
Week, a week dedicated to showcasing
the impact that apprenticeship pro-
grams have on preparing Americans for
the jobs of today and tomorrow.
Our Nation has 7 million unfilled
jobs. A 2018 survey of U.S. employers
showed that nearly half of all job cre-
ators struggle to hire employees with
the right skills for the job.
Apprenticeships offer one of the
strongest solutions to closing the skills
gap and strengthening the American
workforce. That is why Republicans on
the Committee on Education and Labor
are committed to expanding appren-
ticeship opportunities nationwide.
According to the Department of
Labor, 94 percent of apprentices retain
employment after completing an ap-
prenticeship program, and the average
starting salary after completion is
$70,000.
Apprenticeships help integrate the
education system with the workforce
development system, which allows all
students to be better prepared to com-
pete successfully in the 21st century
economy.
f
ALABAMA A&M 50TH
ANNIVERSARY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 50th
anniversary of Alabama Agricultural
and Mechanical University.
The school was originally established
not long after the Civil War, in 1873, by
the legislature of the State of Ala-
bama. Through the tireless efforts of
the first principal and president, Wil-
liam Hooper Council, the Huntsville
Normal School opened on May 1, 1875,
with an appropriation of $1,000 per
year. It had 61 students and two in-
structors.
In 1885, because of its success with in-
dustrial education, the Alabama Legis-
lature changed its name to the State
Normal and Industrial School in
Huntsville.
In 1891, the name was again changed
to the State Agricultural and Indus-
trial Institute for Negroes, and a new
location was provided at Normal, Ala-
bama.
In 1969, the school became a fully ac-
credited member of the Southern Asso-
ciation of Colleges and Schools, and its
name was changed to Alabama Agricul-
tural and Mechanical University, the
name that it has today.
In the 50 years since its university
designation and establishment of the
foundation, Alabama Agricultural and
Mechanical University has grown to
encompass widely respected programs
in engineering, computer science, busi-
ness, food sciences, agricultural and
animal sciences, and education, as well
as Ph.D. programs in plant and soil
science, food science, physics, and
reading.
Today, Alabama A&M University is
comprised of over 70 buildings and
more than 1,000 acres, is home to more
than 6,000 students, is a designated
Gold Military Friendly institution, and
serves as a regional State, national,
and international resource, while
maintaining its mission of educating
the underserved and uplifting the peo-
ple of Alabama, the Nation, and the
world through its excellence in edu-
cation.
On a more personal note, my mother,
Betty Brooks, is a proud graduate of
Alabama A&M University, having re-
ceived her master’s degree there. I
thank Alabama A&M for helping her to
successfully serve for a quarter of a
century as a Lee High School govern-
ment and economics teacher.
In sum, I am, and all of the State of
Alabama is, proud of Alabama A&M
University’s accomplishments and wish
Alabama A&M a happy 50th anniver-
sary as a fully accredited university.
Go Bulldogs.
May their future success in helping
prepare, train, and educate our youth
be as great and productive as their
past.

CONGRATULATING COLONEL AN-
THONY POLASHEK ON 32 YEARS
IN THE AIR FORCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Colonel Anthony
Polashek on his retirement from the
U.S. Air Force after 32 years of service.
Colonel Polashek graduated from Coe
College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, an offi-
cer training school, before commis-
sioning into the Air Force.
During his long career, Colonel
Polashek’s deployments included Oper-
ation Desert Shield and Desert Storm
and Operation Iraqi Freedom and En-
during Freedom. By the end of his dis-
tinguished career, he logged more than
5,800 flight hours as a command pilot,
more than 500 of which were in combat.
Since 2016, Colonel Polashek has
served as commander of the 934th Air-
lift Wing, located at Minneapolis-St.
Paul International Airport Air Reserve
Station, overseeing 12 squadrons with
more than 1,400 airmen.
Minnesota has been fortunate to have
such an accomplished member of our
Nation’s Armed Forces lead the charge
and train our airmen and -women of to-
morrow.
Again, we congratulate Colonel
Polashek on his retirement, and we
wish him the best as he moves to his
next chapter.
RECOGNIZING NANCY LIBERSKY’S LIFETIME OF
SERVICE TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Small Business
Administration’s Minnesota district di-
rector, Nancy Libersky, on her retire-
ment.
District Director Libersky has served
our great State of Minnesota for 28
years. She will be missed.
Nancy’s time at the SBA in Min-
nesota began in 1994 as the regional
manager for SBA’s Twin City’s inter-
national trade programs. In this capac-
ity, Nancy helped hundreds of Min-
nesota businesses compete in the glob-
al marketplace.
At the same time, Nancy also served
as an adjunct instructor at Saint Paul
College and was appointed by the U.S.
Secretary of Commerce to sit on the
Minnesota District Export Council.
Mr. Speaker, we thank Nancy for al-
most three decades of service to Small
Business Minnesota, and we wish her
the best in her retirement.
THE WALL FAMILY, MINNESOTA FAMILY
BUSINESS AWARD OF 2019 RECIPIENT
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate the Wall family
of Highland Bank in St. Michael, Min-
nesota, for receiving the 2019 Min-
nesota Family Business Award.
The Walls have proudly owned and
operated the bank for more than four
decades, serving as a lifeline for their
customers and their community.
As a small financial institution, the
financial crisis took its toll on High-
land and families in and around St. Mi-
chael. Nevertheless, the Wall family
persevered and led their bank and their
community during a very difficult eco-
nomic time.
The resiliency and community-fo-
cused nature of banks like Highland
are essential to helping Minnesotans

and Americans pursue and achieve
their American Dream. Family-owned
institutions like the Highland Bank
understand the needs of their neighbors
and business owners and, in turn, em-
power families and local economies on
Main Streets across our country.
I congratulate the Highland Bank
and the Wall family on their recogni-
tion and thank them for all they do for
St. Michael and Minnesota’s Sixth Con-
gressional District.

RECOGNIZING THE CENTENNIAL OF THE
MINNESOTA FARM BUREAU
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to wish the Minnesota Farm Bu-
reau Federation a very happy 100th
birthday.
For 100 years, the Minnesota Farm
Bureau has been an ally and advocate
for growers, ranchers, and producers
across the 87 counties in Minnesota.
Even after a century of work, the Min-
nesota Farm Bureau remains the lead-
ing voice for farmers, their families,
and the agriculture community at
large.
I want to give a special thanks to
Minnesota Farm Bureau President
Kevin Paap and Vice President Dan
Glessing, both of whom go above and
beyond to advocate for their members.
I would also like to recognize Amber
Hanson Glaeser, the bureau’s director
of public policy, who always keeps our
office apprised of the challenges facing
our agricultural families and their
community.
It has been an honor to work with ev-
eryone at the Minnesota Farm Bureau
throughout my time in Congress, and I
am grateful for the opportunity to wish
them all a happy 100th birthday.
HONORING THE LIFE OF STACY MANNING AND
HER LEGACY OF HELPING FAMILIES
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Stacy Man-
ning from Zimmerman, Minnesota.
Stacy tragically passed away earlier
this year, leaving behind a legacy of
compassion and support for Minnesota
families working through the process
of adoption.
Stacy and her husband, Pat, had
three children of their own when they
decided to adopt three more. While
working to meet the challenges that
adoption can bring with a family of six,
Stacy realized that other adoptive par-
ents were experiencing many of the
same challenges.
Stacy wanted to help, so she estab-
lished Hope Connections, a support net-
work designed to connect with families
for adoption coaching and education.
Stacy’s work touched the lives of
thousands of families across this coun-
try.
This week, Stacy’s family is in Wash-
ington to honor her memory and re-
ceive the Angels in Adoption award
that Stacy earned for the work that
she believed in so deeply.
Stacy may no longer be with us, but
her spirit and Hope Connections’ mis-
sion lives on through her son Andrew,
who continues her legacy in assisting
those experiencing the challenges that
adoption can bring.
Stacy’s impact on so many Minneso-
tans will never be forgotten.
f
CELEBRATING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
OF WOMEN IN TECHNICAL AND
MANUFACTURING FIELDS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. VEASEY) for 5 minutes.
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow
is National Women in Apprenticeship
Day, and today I celebrate the accom-
plishments of all women who are work-
ing in the nontraditional technical and
manufacturing fields.
During World War II, we saw women
across the Nation flock to factories to
fill technical and manufacturing jobs
that were vacated by men leaving to
fight for our country. We saw it in Fort
Worth at what is now the Lockheed
Martin plant—just some great pictures
that capture that time period that still
exist today.
But, nearly 70 years later, we are
struggling to give women equal rep-
resentation in these fields.
That is why my fellow co-chair of the
Blue Collar Caucus, Representative
BRENDAN BOYLE, and I are proud to in-
troduce the Women in Apprenticeship
and Nontraditional Occupations
Amendment Act that will break em-
ployment barriers that face women of
all races and backgrounds entering
into technical and manufacturing oc-
cupations.
Because the best way we can cele-
brate National Women in Apprentice-
ship Day is by taking action to ensure
that all Americans have a fair shot at
entering our workforce and achieving
the American Dream.
I also want to thank my colleague,
Congresswoman JACKIE SPEIER, for her
work on the legislation that we will
vote on later this week, the Rosie the
Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act
of 2019, which will honor any female in-
dividual who held employment or vol-
unteered in support of the war efforts
during the World War II time period
back in the 1940s.
f
RECOGNIZING NECCO FOSTER
CARE OF KENTUCKY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Necco Foster Care
of Kentucky, an organization with of-
fices across Kentucky’s First Congres-
sional District and the Commonwealth.
Necco works tirelessly to place thou-
sands of children with supportive and
caring families. With foster parents
from all walks of life and a variety of
backgrounds, the organization ensures
that each child is matched with a lov-
ing, stable, and comfortable home.
The organization was recently recog-
nized as a 2019 Angels in Adoption hon-
oree.
Necco offers supportive community
living for young adults and intensive
home-based treatment for families.
Through programs like these, Necco
shows itself to be a diligent, compas-
sionate guiding hand to society’s most
vulnerable.
The staff at Necco helps children in
both rural and urban settings as well as
those in the juvenile justice popu-
lation. By providing these services,
Necco is improving the lives of those
most in need while also setting the
foundation for a brighter future for
coming generations of Kentuckians.
On behalf of my constituents, I con-
gratulate Necco and its staff in their
efforts to make the dream of a family
a reality for many children in need.
CONGRATULATING DEAN OWEN FOR BEING
AWARDED THE HIRE VETS MEDALLION AWARD
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
applaud my friend, Mr. Dean Owen, for
being awarded and recognized last
week by the Department of Labor’s
HIRE Vets Medallion Awards Program.
This program focuses on bringing our
Nation’s veterans back to the work-
force and equipping them with the
skills they need to excel at home after
serving our country across the world.
As a resident and business owner in
the First Congressional District of
Kentucky, Dean Owen has gone above
and beyond to invest in recruiting, em-
ploying, and retaining our Nation’s fin-
est through his professional account-
ant services firm in Paducah, my dis-
trict’s largest city.
The rigorous criteria by which a
HIRE Vets Medallion is earned speaks
to the remarkable dedication Dean reg-
ularly displays in his mission to ad-
vance veteran careers.
I want to thank Dean once again for
being a valuable, caring, and ambitious
figure in my district. With constitu-
ents like Dean, there is no question as
to why I am proud to stand here today
and represent the First Congressional
District of Kentucky.
CONDUCT THE BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, this must
be a proud day for many Washington
Democrats: the beginning of their
quest to impeach our duly-elected
President of the United States, with
wall-to-wall coverage from all the
major media networks of this circus of
an event.
But I, again, rise today to implore
the Speaker of the House, NANCY
PELOSI, to conduct the business of the
people.
The people of America elected all 435
of us to do the things that they expect
Congress to do—real business, not the-
ater. And the business that the people
expect us to do, of the utmost impor-
tance today, would be to ratify the
USMCA and to take up the demand to
try to have some type of prescription
drug reform legislation passed before
the end of the year.
But, instead of doing these two most
essential acts that Congress should be
taking up to represent the people of

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER
PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will remind all persons in the
gallery that they are here as guests of
the House and that any manifestation
of approval or disapproval of pro-
ceedings is in violation of the rules of
the House.
f
FUND THE MILITARY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, there are 8
days until our military funding runs
out. Instead of funding the military,
the House is kicking the can down the
road. Instead of bringing stability to
our servicemembers, House Democratic
leadership is focused on a partisan im-
peachment process.
Our men and women in uniform de-
serve better than this. They deserve to
have their mission, training, weapons,
and equipment properly funded.
However, next week, when we reach
the funding deadline, we will likely
vote on a continuing resolution, a CR.
A CR is not a thoughtful approach to
support our servicemembers. A CR
maintains current spending levels for
the military and continues this cycle
of uncertainty for our servicemembers.
While better than a shutdown, there
are real-world consequences to simply
passing a CR:
The Air Force is short 2,100 pilots. A
CR does not provide the Air Force with
new funding to train new pilots to fill
these positions.
A CR prevents the Army from build-
ing 4,000 housing units for its members.
A CR forces the Navy to cancel ship
maintenance periods and undermines
critical training programs.
This is a dangerous funding cycle
that jeopardizes our servicemembers’
safety and their ability to protect our
country.
Once again, our Federal spending
process is broken, and it has gotten us
into this mess. Let’s stop the partisan
politics. Let’s focus on supporting our
military. And let’s work to fix the bro-
ken spending process here in Wash-
ington.
Mr. Speaker, we must never allow
our servicemembers and their mission
to be put at risk again.
RECOGNIZING 100 YEARS OF THE WISCONSIN FARM
BUREAU
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize 100 years of the Wisconsin
Farm Bureau. For a century, the Wis-
consin Farm Bureau has supported
farmers in Wisconsin.
Agriculture is a Wisconsin tradition.
Generations of Wisconsinites have
dedicated their life to farming and
feeding our State and the world. From
milk to cheese, from sweet corn to soy-
beans, from cranberries to whey, our
proud, hardworking Wisconsin farmers
are there.
I thank the Wisconsin Farm Bureau
for helping Wisconsin become and re-
main America’s dairyland.
Happy 100 years.
CONGRATULATING UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN
WOMEN’S HOCKEY TEAM ON FIFTH NATIONAL
CHAMPIONSHIP
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate the University of Wis-
consin women’s hockey team on win-
ning their fifth national championship
in program history.
They beat the Minnesota Gophers 2–
0 to win their first national champion-
ship in 8 years. Kristen Campbell did
not give up a goal, and it was her 11th
shutout of the season. To make the vic-
tory better, we beat our rival, Min-
nesota.
The Badgers’ women’s hockey team
is visiting my office and the White
House to celebrate this success.
Congrats to the University of Wis-
consin women’s hockey team for their
hard-earned victory. The Badger State
is proud of them. On, Wisconsin.

HONORING CHIEF OF STAFF RYAN
THOMPSON
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. WRIGHT) for 5 minutes.
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, what are
the best things an American can do for
his or her country?
Public service, military service, com-
munity service.
What does a true public servant look
like?
Someone who possesses exemplary
character, integrity, and inspires con-
fidence. Someone who has the network
of relationships on both sides to be
both respected and effective.
How do you honor a man who gave 20
years to the United States Government
and the House of Representatives, the
United States Marine Corps Infantry,
and dedicated his free time to bringing
Democrats and Republicans together in
the name of charity?
Ryan Thompson, my trusted chief of
staff and dear friend, who sits here
with me, joins us on the House floor for
the final time today.
He has accompanied me and our
former boss to the floor countless
times and always helped us look and do
our best. Today is different, though,
because this is his moment.
Mr. Speaker, there are proud mem-
bers of the United States Marine Corps
and there are proud graduates of Texas
A&M University—Texas Aggies.
Occasionally, God blesses the world
by combining both of those things in
one person. Such is the case with Ryan
Thompson.
Ryan is a proud, sixth-generation
Texan of the Aggie variety, who serves
as a past president of the Texas State
Society. A true philanthropist, Ryan
has dedicated thousands of hours over
the past decade to organizing the bi-
partisan, bicameral Congressional
Baseball Game, which raises millions
of dollars for local charities each year.
Furthermore, Ryan founded and
leads the Congressional Sports for
Charity Foundation, which was created
to ensure that the Congressional Base-
ball Game and other congressional
charity events live on for decades to
come.
Ryan wisely understands that the
game is not only essential to the many
charities it helps but serves another
cause in need, the Congress itself.
Today, on behalf of the Boys and
Girls Clubs of Washington, D.C.; the
Washington Nationals Dream Founda-
tion; and the Washington Literacy
Council, which honored him with the
Champion for Literacy Award—not to
mention a grateful institution and Na-
tion—thank you and happy trails to
Ryan Scott Thompson.
Like a Texas live oak, he is strong
from the roots up.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL
APPRENTICESHIP WEEK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
National Apprenticeship Week. This
year is the fifth anniversary for the
celebration that aims to connect job
seekers with businesses and educators
in our communities to highlight the
wealth of apprenticeship opportunities
that are available.
For too long, it has been implied that
the only respectable or worthwhile op-
tion available to achieve a successful
career is spending 4 or more years on a
campus to earn a college degree. Yet,
the more than 7 million unfilled jobs in
America today suggest workers don’t
have the necessary skills to fill these
jobs.
We need to defy this misconception,
invest in skills-based education, and
fix our Nation’s growing skills gap by
providing students and job seekers
with the skills and hands-on experience
they need to improve their own lives.
As co-chair of the bipartisan Career
and Technical Education Caucus, I am
proud to push for accessible career and
technical education alongside my good
friend and colleague, Congressman JIM
LANGEVIN.
Career and technical education, or
CTE, goes hand in hand with appren-
ticeships. Equipping learners of all
ages with real-world experience in
fields like STEM, nursing, information
technology, cyber technology, agri-
culture, and more can bring us one step
closer to closing our Nation’s skills
gap. In the past several years, we have

seen a rapid expansion in skills-based
education like on-the-job learning,
earn-while-you-learn programs, and ap-
prenticeships.
Workforce development programs are
successful only if they are adaptable to
the changing needs of employers. The
notice of proposed rulemaking by the
Department of Labor issued this past
June recognizes this through the pro-
posed establishment of industry-recog-
nized apprenticeships programs, or
IRAPS. IRAPS cut through the bureau-
cratic red tape to put businesses and
employees at the center of the con-
versation.
The proposed flexibility in the notice
of proposed rulemaking will allow busi-
nesses the ability to quickly meet
labor market needs. These changes will
help foster continued innovation that
recognizes the dignity of all work and
provides another tool for apprentices
to move into meaningful work in the
rapidly evolving 21st century economy.
We can ensure IRAPS create as many
career opportunities as possible by en-
couraging employer innovation and al-
lowing students and families the free-
dom to choose the path that is best for
them. That is the power of work. That
is the power of CTE. And that is the
power of apprenticeships, putting em-
ployers and students in the driver’s
seat of their own professional futures.

CONGRATULATING STEVE JOHN-
SON ON RECEIVING IMTA’S
FOUNDERS AWARD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate my friend, Steve John-
son, for receiving the prestigious Indi-
ana Motor Truck Association’s Found-
ers Award.
The IMTA’s Founders Award is an
honor bestowed to those who embody
the spirit of the association’s founders
and have made outstanding contribu-
tions to the association and the Indi-
ana trucking industry. Steve is only
the ninth individual to have received
this award in the past 14 years.
Always one to give back, Steve
proudly serves his Nation in uniform
and remains involved in his local
church, charitable foundations, and
children’s hospitals in Indiana.
I congratulate my good friend, Steve
Johnson.
CONGRATULATING THREE HIGH SCHOOLS ON
SPECIAL OLYMPICS RECOGNITION
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
congratulate three high schools located
in Indiana’s Sixth District on their
achievement of becoming a National
Banner Unified Champion School.
Columbus East High School, Muncie
Central High School, and South Ripley
High School were recognized by the
Special Olympics for their servant
hearts and commitments to inclusion.
These three high schools achieved the
status of a Unified Champion School
after meeting 10 national standards of
excellence set by the Special Olympics.
As institutions dedicated to inclu-
sion, collaboration, and engagement,
we are proud of Columbus East, Muncie
Central, and South Ripley. We con-
gratulate the students and faculty for
this significant achievement.
RECOGNIZING BATESVILLE HIGH SCHOOL AND IVY
TECH’S PARTNERSHIP
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize Batesville High School for
their tremendous achievement of hav-
ing one-half of the 2020 graduating
class earn college credits. Through
their innovative programs with Ivy
Tech Community College, Batesville
will see 50 percent of their graduating
seniors walk across the stage with an
entire year’s worth of college credits.
The Ivy Tech program gives Hoosiers
the opportunity to take 16 college
courses at no cost, enabling them to
obtain a bachelor’s degree in just 3
years after they go to college.
I thank Batesville High School fac-
ulty and staff for continuing to provide
innovative educational programs that
set our students up for success.
RECOGNIZING RUSHVILLE CONSOLIDATED HIGH
SCHOOL FFA PROGRAM
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Rushville Future Farm-
ers of America chapter for being one of
six chapters across the country to par-
ticipate in the Turn the Bag Blue and
Gold program.
The Turn the Bag Blue and Gold pro-
gram is a partnership between FFA and
Mycogen Seeds that gives students the
opportunity to visit with farmers and
polish their professional skills while
raising money for their communities.
This program will allow students to
sell directly to local farmers, providing
industry experience and a wonderful
educational opportunity. A percentage
of these sales will go directly to the
Rushville FFA chapter.
Congratulations to Rushville FFA.
CONGRATULATING INDIANA NATIONAL GUARD
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I congratu-
late the Indiana National Guard for the
stationing of the 127th Cyber Protec-
tion Battalion at Muscatatuck. As the
seventh largest Army National Guard
contingent in the Nation, the Indiana
National Guard continues to make our
Nation’s defenses better.
The Hoosier State is proud to be
home to cyber force structures such as
the Muscatatuck Urban Training Com-
plex, the Defensive Cyber Operations
Element, and Cyber Protection Team
172. We are honored to have such a dis-
tinctive battalion.
Indiana’s Sixth District boasts the
Department of Defense’s only live, full-
scale cyber range, and I join the Army
National Guard in congratulating our
distinguished Hoosiers in uniform on
this outstanding achievement.
CONGRATULATING BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA
VOLUNTEER BETH CURTISS
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
congratulate Beth Curtiss of Shelby-
ville, Indiana. Beth was awarded the
2019 Crossroads of America Silver Bea-
ver Award, in association with the Boy
Scouts of America. This award is the
highest honor the Crossroads of Amer-
ica Council may bestow on a volunteer.
Beth has volunteered with the Boy
Scouts of America for over 15 years.
This is the fifth time Beth has been
recognized for her outstanding service.
I am pleased to congratulate Beth,

for the life You give to all Your chil-

Sacred pollen, sacred Earth Mother,
sacred water that manifest Your de-
sires, O Creator and Great Mother, we
thank them for the nourishment they
give us equally, with no regard to race,
color, or creed.
Creator and Great Mother, bless
those standing before You who carry a
sacred trust to all of us who inhabit
Turtle Island, our homeland. And I
pray today that You will give them the
wisdom and the courage to carry out
their sacred trust with the same equal-
ity that we receive from the Sun and

WELCOMING MS. VERNA TELLER
The SPEAKER. Without objection,
the gentlewoman from New Mexico
(Ms. HAALAND) is recognized for 1
minute.
There was no objection.
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I
am honored to have a fierce woman
from my district to deliver a historic
opening prayer.
Isleta Pueblo Chief Judge Verna Tell-
er is the first Native American to de-
liver the opening prayer in the U.S.
House.
This is a special time in our coun-
try’s history and, in honor of Native
American Heritage Month, a time to
reflect on the contributions of Native
Americans to this country.
Chief Judge Teller made her own his-
tory in New Mexico. She broke barriers
when she was elected as the first
woman Pueblo Governor. Because of
the history of colonization, many
Pueblos generally don’t allow women
to hold leadership positions, but that
didn’t stop Judge Teller from knowing
her value as a Tribal leader.
I am proud to stand with Chief Judge
Teller to highlight the resilience of in-
digenous women and our perseverance
to uplift our girls and our women in all
of our communities.

COMMENDING MEMBERS OF NIAG-
ARA FALLS FIRE DEPARTMENT
AND NEW YORK STATE PARK
POLICE
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize our
everyday heroes—police and fire per-
sonnel—who sign up to rush into dan-
gerous situations most people would
run from.
Today I want to take this oppor-
tunity to commend the outstanding
members of the Niagara Falls Fire De-
partment and the New York State
Park Police.
Last week, a man was discovered in
the fierce and frigid rapids of the Niag-
ara River. Without hesitation, the Ni-
agara Falls firefighters and New York
State Park Police took quick action,
entering the water just yards away
from the brink of Niagara Falls and,
under the most dangerous of cir-
cumstances, completed a successful
rescue.
We are grateful for the brave and
selfless service of these first responders
and others across my community and
this Nation who risk their own safety
and save the lives of others.
f
CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT
OF DEBBIE BONE-HARRIS
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate Debbie Bone-Harris
as she begins her retirement from the
Franklin Public Utility District.
Deb began working for Franklin PUD
in 2003 and has held many roles
throughout the organization. She has
been a stalwart advocate for hydro-
power in the Northwest. She has spent
countless hours educating our commu-
nity about the value of the Columbia
and the Snake River dams, and she has
worked with both State and Federal
legislators to advocate for their protec-
tion.
Deb is a leader, not only with the
Franklin PUD, but in the greater com-
munity as well. She has served on nu-
merous boards and held leadership
roles with community organizations,
including Pasco Chamber of Commerce,
Visit Tri-Cities, Tri-Cities Legislative
Council, Washington Public Utility
District, Northwest Public Power Asso-
ciation, and Pacific Northwest Water-
ways Association.
As Deb begins her well-earned retire-
ment, our community wishes her the
best as she enjoys spending more time
with her grandchildren, going on hot-
rod adventures with her husband, and
attending those rowdy sewing conven-
tions.
I thank Deb for her advocacy and
congratulate her.
f
RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF FLEET READINESS
CENTER SOUTHWEST
(Mr. PETERS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 100th anniver-
sary of the Fleet Readiness Center
Southwest at Naval Air Station North
Island in Coronado, the birthplace of
naval aviation maintenance.
In 1912, the entire Navy aviation
squad consisted of four officers and
three planes, which called North Island
home. As more planes routinely landed
at sea, it became necessary for the
Navy to have an official aviation main-
tenance facility.
Shortly after the U.S. Government
obtained the island in 1917, it estab-
lished the Overhaul and Repair Depart-
ment, the first maintenance repair and
overhaul facility in the Department of
Defense.
Now designated as the Fleet Readi-
ness Center Southwest, the goals are
the same: to produce quality equip-
ment and provide support to our Na-
tion’s aviation war fighters through
the overhaul, repair, and modification
of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps
frontline aircraft.
Encompassing 358 acres and over 80
buildings, the Fleet Readiness Center
is one of the largest aerospace employ-
ers in San Diego County, employing ap-
proximately 3,500 civilians and 900
military personnel.
Please join me in honoring one of the
best facilities in the U.S. Navy, the
Fleet Readiness Center Southwest at
Naval Air Station North Island, on its
100th anniversary.

HONORING WALTER B. JONES, JR.
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, yesterday I proudly an-
nounced my first piece of legislation as
a Member of Congress, H.R. 5037.
Of course, every bill that goes
through this great legislative body is
important, but I think it is fair to say
that every Member’s first bill carries
with it an importance in its own right.
It marks the beginning of a new path
forward, and I wanted mine to begin in
remembrance of my predecessor,
friend, and mentor, the late Congress-
man Walter B. Jones, Jr.
Congressman Jones served the great
people of eastern North Carolina for
over 20 years. He supported our mili-
tary, he supported our farmers, and he
supported our coasts. As his successor,
I pledge to do the same.
This bill, which would name a post
office in the town Congressman Jones
was born and raised, in the great town
of Farmville, North Carolina, is the
least that we can do to honor the re-
markable statesman and steward that
he was.
In this time of great divisiveness, it
is wonderful to have an issue that we
all can rally around and support. I look
forward to this bill becoming a reality
for the people of eastern North Caro-
lina.
f
LOWER THE COST OF
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
(Mrs. AXNE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
because the price of prescription drugs
is too high and prescription drug prices
have risen 44 percent in 5 years.
Big pharmaceutical companies have
raised the cost of the most commonly
used drugs by 100 percent. I am talking
about every day, basic prescription
drugs like insulin for diabetes or
Advair for asthma.
Experts say there is no end in sight,
and we will see prices rise in 2020 if this
continues and if we don’t act now.
I recently heard from Joan in west
Des Moines, who said the cost of her
generic suddenly skyrocketed, and
there is nothing she can do, because if
she doesn’t take it she will need a liver
transplant.

And I heard from John in Madrid,
who discovered his insulin refills lit-
erally cost more than the price of gold
if you broke it down by price per
ounce.
That is why I am supporting H.R. 3,
the Lower Drug Costs Now Act. Iowans
and Americans can’t wait any longer.
Every dollar spent on overpriced drugs
is stealing money away from someone’s
retirement, from someone’s college
fund, and from buying a home, and it is
putting someone’s life at risk.
We must act now and pass and sup-
port the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.

COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE FALL OF THE
BERLIN WALL
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemo-
rate the 30th anniversary of the fall of
the Berlin Wall.
In a 1987 speech in West Berlin, Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan famously declared:
‘‘Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.’’
For nearly 30 years, East and West
Berlin were separated, both physically
and ideologically.
On November 9, 1989, freedom pre-
vailed. East Germany’s communist
government and the Berlin Wall, one of
the starkest symbols of the Cold War,
would fall.
That evening, on a West German tel-
evision channel, reporter Hanns
Friedrichs proclaimed:
This 9th of November is a historic day.
East Germany has announced that, starting
immediately, its borders are open to every-
one.
While East and West Germany would
not officially unify until the following
year, East and West Berliners rushed
to the Brandenburg Gate to celebrate
this historic moment that would lead
to the end of the Cold War.
Let today serve as a reminder that
freedom is always worth fighting for.

REPRESENTING NEW YORK’S 25TH
DISTRICT
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, 1 year
ago today, I took the oath of office and
was sworn in as a Member of the
United States House of Representa-
tives.
It is truly the honor of a lifetime to
represent New York’s 25th District, and
I am grateful every day for the oppor-
tunity to serve the community I love.
I am so proud of the work we have
done in the past year to improve the
lives of everyday Americans. The
House has passed landmark legislation
to create universal background checks
on all gun sales. We are taking action
to lower the cost of prescription drugs
and make healthcare more affordable
for working families. We are fighting
to protect our climate, strengthen our
economy, close the gender pay gap, and
ensure everyone has access to a quality
education.
Back home, I am working with com-
munity partners on strategies to re-
duce poverty and give opportunity to
all of our citizens.
I am proud of our work, but there is
so much more still to be done, and I
look forward to another year con-
tinuing my work for the people of my
community and the people of the
United States.

KEEPING SOLEMN PROMISE TO
NATION’S VETERANS
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, on Mon-
day, we gathered around the country to
honor our veterans to whom we owe a
tremendous debt. But sentiments ex-
pressed at parades and ceremonies ring
hollow if we don’t follow our good
words with meaningful deeds for those
who have served and sacrificed so
much.
Although the VA has countless care
providers and employees who have
dedicated their careers to veterans,
they work in a system that has serious
problems that must be addressed
quickly.
It is unacceptable that the health
network for more than 9 million vet-
erans has remained on the High-Risk
List of Federal agencies prone to defi-
ciencies and waste. That is why I intro-
duced the Reducing High Risk to Vet-
erans and Veterans Services Act with
my colleague, General BERGMAN, to im-
prove the management and care at the
VA.
It is also unacceptable that the VA
has not met the needs of a growing
number of women veterans. I intro-
duced legislation with Congresswoman
STEFANIK that will ensure the VA is
equipped to provide women veterans
with life-changing prosthetics as part
of the Deborah Sampson Act.
We made a solemn promise to our
veterans, and we should be working to-
gether every day to fulfill that prom-
ise. These pieces of legislation are an
important step forward, and I thank
my colleagues for supporting these bi-
partisan bills.

ENACT GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION
TO PROTECT POLICE, CITIZENS
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, on
June 13, a gunman from another State
sat in the parking lot of Tamaques Ele-
mentary School in my district, armed
with a loaded .45-caliber handgun, hol-
low-point bullets, and 130 rounds of am-
munition.
Because of the quick work of the
Westfield Police Department of New
Jersey, the gunman was disarmed and
taken into custody. Officers Jeffrey
Johnson, Michael Pollock, Joseph
Habeiche, Elizabeth Savnik, and Tif-
fany Kenny, along with Detectives
Nicholas Bruno and Jason Merritt, pre-
vented what could have been a dev-
astating tragedy.
I am eternally grateful for their
brave and swift actions, and I am proud
to recognize them this month as they
are honored with the New Jersey PBA’s
Unit Citation Award for their heroism.
Mr. Speaker, police officers are the
good guys with a gun in America. They
are the good guys with a gun.
How many times do we have to expe-
rience these tragedies and close calls
before Congress finally acts to protect
them and us by keeping dangerous
weapons from falling into the wrong
hands?
The House has passed sensible gun
safety legislation that will save lives.
It is time for the Senate to act.

TRUMP-ERDOGAN MEETING
SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE
(Mr. RASKIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, it is an
outrage that President Trump has hon-
ored President Erdogan today with a
meeting at the White House.
During his infamous May 2017 visit to
the White House, Erdogan dispatched
his thugs to beat up peaceful protesters
at Sheridan Circle here in the Capital
of the United States of America, dem-
onstrating before the world his con-
tempt not only for human rights but
for the rule of law in our country. He
should have been banned from America
until he makes all of his victims whole.
This time, his visit coincides with
Turkey’s savage military campaign in
northern Syria, an invasion that has
killed hundreds of civilians, displaced
and driven from their homes over
160,000 people, threatened our national
security, and produced a massive hu-
manitarian crisis.
Just weeks ago, the U.S. House
passed H.J. Res. 77 and H.R. 4695, the
Protect Against Conflict by Turkey
Act, which denounced Turkey’s mili-
tary actions against the Kurdish people
in northern Syria.
We also cannot overlook Erdogan’s
continuing oppressive actions against
the Turkish people. He has executed a
campaign of repression against anyone
who dares disagree with his barbaric
policies.
This meeting should not be taking
place.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and to include ex-
traneous material on the bill under
consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland?
There was no objection.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I am proud to have served as the lead
Democratic cosponsor of this bill intro-
duced by my friend from Ohio (Mr.
CHABOT), H.R. 1663, the Foundation of
the Federal Bar Association Charter
Amendments Act of 2019.
The Federal Bar Association serves
as the primary voluntary bar associa-
tion for attorneys, both in the private
and public sectors, practicing in Fed-
eral courts. This bill will permit the
FBA Foundation to better fulfill its
role as the only institution in America
chartered by Congress to promote the
Federal administration of justice, the
advancement of Federal jurisprudence,
and the practice of law in the Federal
courts by providing it with the organi-
zational flexibility that it needs to
fully meet its contemporary mission.
The original 1954 charter created a
framework that has served FBA for the
last six decades. During these years,
the foundation has indeed strengthened
Federal jurisprudence, advanced legal
education, and promoted effective legal
practice. The organization’s initiatives
have also directly improved the lives of
our people.
For example, one community out-
reach program, the Wills for Veterans
Initiative, is a pro bono project where
FBA chapters provide the drafting of
wills and signing services for veterans
in their communities. I know a number
of my constituents who participate
have found great fulfillment working
on this project, just as many veterans
have benefited from it.
Another initiative establishes a
mentorship program for law students
to work alongside experienced attor-
neys.
The current charter must be amend-
ed to allow the organization greater
flexibility of operation and growth.
For example, the existing charter
codifies strict membership and govern-
ance requirements that constrain
member development and nimble gov-
ernance of the organization. This rigid-
ity presents serious challenges as the
organization seeks to expand its crit-
ical charitable and educational initia-
tives.
H.R. 1663 makes technical fixes to the
charter that will give the FBA the
needed flexibility in the new century.
In the place of legislatively fixed mem-
bership criteria, it permits the FBA to
proactively establish and update mem-
bership criteria through the bylaws
process. Similar provisions authorize
enhanced flexibility in the composition
and duties of the members of the board.
In general, this measure would en-
able the FBA to swiftly meet its needs
and improve the administration of Fed-
eral justice.
A similar version of the bill was in-
troduced last year, which was passed
by this body on a voice vote, but it did
not pass in the Senate for various rea-
sons. One was that the language in the
bill’s proposed nondiscrimination pro-
vision did not explicitly prohibit dis-
crimination on the basis of gender
identity, as most of the new anti-
discrimination legislation does.
To that end, I am very pleased that
the Federal Bar Association took it
upon itself to amend its own bylaws on
April 18 of this year to include the fol-
lowing language: ‘‘The terms of mem-
bership may not discriminate on the
basis of race, color, religion, sex, dis-
ability, age, sexual orientation, gender
identity, or national origin.’’
As a cosponsor of the Equality Act,
introduced by the gentleman from
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), my good
friend, I fully support equal rights for
all. The proactive amendment of the
FBA bylaws, I believe, makes clear the

intent of the Federal Bar Association
that everyone must be protected
against invidious discrimination.
In light of this development, I believe
that H.R. 1663 will help the FBA to
flourish for many decades to come. I
strongly support the bill, and I look
forward to the FBA’s continued posi-
tive involvement in our Nation’s Fed-
eral legal system, and I urge all of my
colleagues to support the bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I rise today in support of H.R. 1663,
the Foundation of the Federal Bar As-
sociation Charter Amendments Act of
2019. I appreciate the gentleman and
his fine laying out of what the bill ac-
tually does. I thank him and Congress-
man STEVE CHABOT for their work on
this legislation and for their support of
the Federal Bar Association.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for his comments.
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from the District of Columbia (Ms.
NORTON).
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding. I thank
him for bringing this bill to the floor.
I support the mission and work of the
Foundation of the Federal Bar Associa-
tion. I support passage of H.R. 1663,
which would give the foundation more
operational flexibility, as I did when
the House passed a similar version last
Congress.
However, I would be remiss if I did
not note my concern with section 6 of
this bill. Federal law requires the foun-
dation’s principal office to be in the
District of Columbia. Section 6 would
amend that requirement and allow the
foundation to have its principal office
at any location in the United States
decided by its board of directors and
specified by its bylaws. Currently, the
foundation’s principal office is in Ar-
lington, Virginia, in violation of Fed-
eral law.
I am speaking on this bill not to op-
pose it but to make a larger point
about the location of Federal agencies.
While the foundation is a federally
chartered corporation and operates
independently of the Federal Govern-
ment, H.R. 1663 comes to the floor at a
time when the Trump administration
and many Members of Congress, among
them my Republican colleagues, are
working to relocate Federal agencies
outside the national capital region.
Recently, Senators JOSH HAWLEY and
MARSHA BLACKBURN introduced a bill
that would relocate most agencies out-
side of the Nation’s Capital and the na-
tional capital region. We can have a
discussion on ways to make govern-
ment work better for the American
people, but such bills should not be
part of that discussion.
These types of bills or administration
proposals are often used for cheap talk-
ing points against the national capital
region and Federal employees or are
intended to undermine the work of the
Federal agencies the bills or proposals
are ostensibly designed to help.
Eighty-five percent of Federal em-
ployees work outside of the national
capital region already. Hundreds of
Federal employees and their families
have already been harmed by the re-
cent relocation of two U.S. Department
of Agriculture agencies, as has the
work of those agencies.
Congress cannot do its job without
the unvarnished facts and briefings
that nonpartisan agencies give the
House and Senate almost daily. I have
already gotten language in appropria-
tions bills that would block politically
motivated moves outside of the na-
tional capital region, and I will con-
tinue to fight agency relocations with
every tool at my disposal.
Fortunately, H.R. 1663 is not about
relocation.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I thank the gentlewoman, who is a
great champion for the people of Wash-
ington, D.C., and I could not agree
more with her sentiments about efforts
being made in the Senate to relocate
agencies central to the operation of the
national government away from the
national capital region. I stand firmly
with her in opposition to that dis-
turbing trend.
As the gentlewoman noted, the Foun-
dation of the Federal Bar Association
operates independently of the Federal
Government and is currently
headquartered in Arlington. I have re-
ceived assurances from the FBA that
they have no plans to relocate their
principal offices as a result of the pas-
sage of this bill.
FBA’s mission and institutional in-
terests, advancing the quality of jus-
tice in the Federal judiciary, neces-
sitate location close to Washington,
D.C.
Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from
Ohio is prepared to close, I am as well.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
The gentleman from Georgia is not
prepared to close because, frankly, the
gentleman from Ohio is on his way. I
will do the best I can here.
Mr. Speaker, interesting discussion
today. I could go on. I think it is inter-
esting. Again, sometimes we get lost in
the formalities and everything else of
what is going on here. But this discus-
sion about moving offices outside the
District and moving them around is an
issue and discussion that should be
had.
I think there are some that are very
vital to being here in the District or, as
in the case of this organization, in Ar-
lington, just outside the District. But
then there are also some very real con-
cerns on how we can discuss that.
I think one of the things that we
have lost, and I will discuss here since
we are in this mode, is this discussion
of having a real, honest, back-and-forth
discussion on legislation and pieces of
legislation or, honestly, where things
need to be.
Mr. Speaker, I think this is some-
thing that is vitally missing, probably
from both sides of the aisle, especially
this year, as we look at the context of
bills and stuff that have gone on with-
out the benefit of true bipartisan dis-
cussion. I can think of the arbitration
bill that was just recently on the floor,
in which there were very real concerns
that Republicans had, very real con-
cerns the Democrats had.
Unfortunately, when I actually men-
tioned to the chairman that I think we
could have gotten a bill that would
have had 375, 400 votes on the floor for
‘‘yes,’’ my chairman was amazed. Do
you think we really could have? And I
said, yes, if we had engaged in dialogue
to fix what was wrong and not try to do
a whole rewrite on something that
could get made into law.
I think these are the kind of discus-
sions that are very good. I think these
are the kind of discussions that make
it.
I appreciate so much the gentle-
woman taking up for the District of
Columbia. I think that is exactly why
we come here. I come here from the
perspective of northeast Georgia. The
gentleman comes from Maryland. The
gentlewoman comes from the District
right here.
Members from all over the body bring
their ideas and their thoughts of their
constituents to the floor, especially in
markups and especially in bills, in
which not everything, at the end of the
day, is from a Republican or Demo-
cratic standpoint.
At the end of day, as someone who
has authored many pieces of legisla-
tion, just as the gentleman has as well,
the big things get done when we work
together. The big things—I mean,
criminal justice reform was when
HAKEEM JEFFRIES and I bridged a large
gap in a divide, even an unruly Senate,
to actually pass something that really
worked.
We had the Music Modernization Act,
which, again, took 6 years to discuss
and 6 years to be a part of. When you
had Members of the bodies that ended
up being a part of this not even willing
to sit down and talk to each other at
the beginning of this process and, at
the end of the day, having a major ac-
complishment and a major bill that
was passed because of bipartisanship, I
think that it gave on both sides.
b 1230
I appreciate the gentlewoman bring-
ing those things up. I think it is an in-
teresting correlation between the Fed-
eral Bar Association and the excellent
work that they do. I have no problem
with the work that they do.
I will reserve, if the gentleman would
like to share and respond on what we
just talked about.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8796 November 13, 2019
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I want to thank the distinguished
and always eloquent gentleman from
Georgia for his comments on a number
of interesting things. One is the ques-
tion of bipartisanship and us working
together, and I think the gentleman
correctly invites us to study the record
of legislative success and achievements
in our body.
It is true that the best legislation,
like the Voting Rights Act, for exam-
ple, is legislation that came through a
bipartisan process where we had both
parties working together.
All of our great Presidents have been
people who themselves were involved
in partisan politics, and often in a
bare-knuckled way, but also, once they
were in office, called the country to try
to speak across party lines.
Jefferson said, ‘‘We are all repub-
licans. We are all federalists’’ in his in-
augural address in 1800.
And Lincoln, of course, said: We are
friends; we must not be enemies. We
must be friends, and we must not be
enemies.
And President Obama said: We are
not the red States of America; we are
not the blue States of America. We are
the United States of America.
And so we have to try to aspire to
that even though we work in a party
system. And the reason we have a
party system is because we are not a
one-party dictatorship.
One way to get rid of partisanship is
you get rid of political parties and you
have a one-party state. But we don’t
believe in that. We have got political
freedom in America.
But, at the same time, once we get
in, the same way that we render con-
stituent service to all of our constitu-
ents without regard to whether they
are Democrats or Republicans or Inde-
pendents, we should try to render legis-
lative service to the whole country at
the same time.
Let me just make one other point to
my friend about the Seat of Govern-
ment Clause.
Now, as the gentleman knows, the
distinguished gentlewoman from the
District of Columbia represents 700,000
people who have no voting representa-
tion in Congress, and the basis for that,
what I think is a historical accident,
has been the existence of the District
Clause that Congress exercises exclu-
sive legislation over the land that is
ceded to Congress for the purposes of a
seat of government.
Well, I suppose to the extent that
there is an attempt to justify us being
the only country on Earth where the
people of the Capital City are not rep-
resented, it has to do with the fact that
this is where the Federal Government
is located.
Now, the District of Columbia is in-
volved in a statehood struggle, which I
support. Like every other American,
they want to be part of a State. But as
long as they are in the so-called seat of
government, it seems to me that the
gentlewoman makes a good point,
which is that truly Federal functions
should not be stripped away from
Washington, D.C., and relocated around
the country.
Now, most Federal employees don’t
live in the National Capital area; 80 to
85 percent of them live across America
at Army bases or post offices, Depart-
ments of Justice around the country.
They work in all of those Federal func-
tions around the country.
But there are certain things that do
belong here. The Federal departments
clearly belong within the seat of gov-
ernment, and I think that the gentle-
woman was just identifying that there
has been an effort to strip away essen-
tial Federal functions and to relocate
them to other parts of the country,
leaving her constituents with the worst
of both worlds, which is no representa-
tion the way that our constituents are
represented, but, at the same time, a
gradual stripping away of the Federal
offices and departments.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I have one more speaker and I will
yield him the balance of my time, so
when he yields back, I will close.
I appreciate that now that the air-
plane has circled enough and we have
run out of enough fuel, we are now on
to the next topic, and I appreciate the
gentleman discussing that.
I yield the remainder of my time to
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT).
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I want
to thank the gentleman from Maryland
(Mr. RASKIN) for his leadership on this
particular piece of legislation that I
am going to discuss now.
I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1663.
Put simply, this bill helps to support
those Federal attorneys who prosecute
major drug traffickers, white-collar
criminals, and others who commit Fed-
eral crimes and those Federal judges
who preside over cases heard in their
courtrooms.
In a few short months, the Federal
Bar Association will celebrate the cen-
tennial anniversary of its founding. It
was founded with a mission to promote
and support legal research and edu-
cation, to advance the science of juris-
prudence, to facilitate the administra-
tion of justice, and to foster improve-
ments in the practice of Federal law.
Back in 1954, Congress chartered the
Federal Bar Association, but in the
decades since receiving its charter, it
has neither been updated nor amended.
As a former educator and attorney
and current senior member of the Judi-
ciary Committee myself, I recognize,
as many of my colleagues do, the im-
portant work that the Federal Bar As-
sociation does to bring civics education
to classrooms in my State of Ohio and
throughout the country.
Without legislation like this, H.R.
1663, it would take, literally, an act of
Congress to allow the Federal Bar As-
sociation to make simple changes to
its bylaws.
More specifically, this legislation
gives the association the ability to
choose the location of its principal of-
fice, restricts its officers from engag-
ing in political activity, and makes
other technical changes to conform to
commonly used language used by other
congressionally chartered groups.
This legislation being considered
today serves to provide the Federal Bar
Association with the ability to con-
tinue its important work and scholar-
ship in communities throughout the
country.
Finally, I want to again thank the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN)
for his support of H.R. 1663, and I want
to thank both Chairman NADLER and
Ranking Member COLLINS for bringing
it to the floor today for consideration.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to support it.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank Mr. CHABOT for his excellent
work on this legislation, and I want to
thank Mr. COLLINS for his thoughtful
intervention.
Mr. Speaker, this bill was advanced
to allow the Foundation of the Federal
Bar Association the flexibility it needs
to successfully manage its own affairs,
as Mr. CHABOT pointed out. I urge its
passage, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
RASKIN) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1663.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on

Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask

tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection.
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I would like to thank Chairman NAD-
LER and Ranking Member COLLINS for
moving H.R. 4258, the Reauthorizing
Security for Supreme Court Justices
Act of 2019, through the Judiciary
Committee in a swift manner.
I would also like to thank my friend
and fellow member of the Judiciary
Committee, Congressman STEUBE, for
joining me in introducing this impor-
tant piece of legislation.
The Supreme Court Police currently
has permanent authority to protect
Justices on Supreme Court grounds;
however, its authority to protect them
outside of the Supreme Court grounds
is temporary and has been reauthorized
in a bipartisan manner since 1928. H.R.
4258 is a bipartisan bill that will per-
manently reauthorize the ability to
protect the Justices outside of the Su-
preme Court grounds.
With the increase of potential
threats against the Justices of the Su-
preme Court in recent years and the
current authorization set to expire on
December 29 of this year, this bill is
needed to remove the threat of disrup-
tions and security gaps caused by the
temporary authority.
I urge my colleagues to support H.R.
4258. I hope the Senate acts swiftly and
considers this bill. It is critically im-
portant that we protect the Justices of
the highest court in our land.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of H.R. 4258. The
gentleman has spoken well of what it
actually does and what it will not do. I
support that.
I would like to congratulate Con-
gressmen STANTON and STEUBE on their
work on this legislation.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
I rise today in support of H.R. 3537,
the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training
Act of 2019, and I thank Mr. SPANO for
joining me in introducing this legisla-
tion and helping lead this effort to im-
prove the program to ensure veterans
can continue to take advantage of the
Boots to Business Program.
It is an honor to be here today to cel-
ebrate and honor our Nation’s veteran
entrepreneurs. Just this week we cele-
brated Veterans Day and last week we
marked National Veterans Small Busi-
ness Week.
Every member of the military has al-
ready demonstrated their love of coun-
try by committing everything, includ-
ing potentially their lives, in the serv-
ice of our Nation. When their service in
uniform is completed, many veterans
direct their passion to starting a busi-
ness. Such dedication to Nation and
community should be recognized every
day. This is patriotism and not a par-
tisan issue.
That is why I am pleased that the
Small Business Committee can once
again highlight how we put aside the
differences we may have in some areas
and now bring these bipartisan bills to
the floor today.
Entrepreneurship has always been a
bedrock of the American economy, par-
ticularly for our returning vets. That
is why our committee is focused on bi-
partisan solutions to repay our vet-
erans through policies designed to ease
the risk of starting and running a busi-
ness.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman
VELÁZQUEZ and Ranking Member
CHABOT, as well as the committee staff,
for working with us to increase the op-
portunities and resources for veteran
entrepreneurs.
H.R. 3537 bolsters the Small Business
Administration’s Boots to Business
Program to enhance our ability to en-
sure that it is effectively serving aspir-
ing veteran businessowners.
There are approximately 2.5 million
veteran-owned businesses generating $1
trillion in receipts. Such successes are
a draw for many of the men and women
leaving the service today to become
their own bosses.
Entrepreneurship provides a prom-
ising opportunity to continue serving
their country, creating jobs in their
local communities, while supporting
their families.
Empowering vets to succeed as entre-
preneurs should be a viable option for
people trained to lead, inspire, and
achieve remarkable things. Their suc-
cess spurs local economic development
and demonstrates our commitment to
their aspirations of entrepreneurship.
But starting a business can be com-
plex and sometimes daunting. The
process can seem overwhelming, but
programs like Boots to Business offer
resources and assistance from experts,
giving aspiring entrepreneurs the les-
sons of others’ previous experience.
Initially launched in 2012, the Boots
to Business Program offers
transitioning servicemembers and mili-
tary spouses insights into self-employ-
ment and business ownership. The Vet-
erans Business Outreach Centers are
trained and empowered to deliver these
services to over 180 military installa-
tions nationwide. In 2018, over 17,000
veterans, servicemembers, and mili-
tary spouses participated in the 2-day
course.
Research has shown that service-
members are distinctly qualified to
start and run their own businesses.
While serving in the military, they
learn how to make good decisions in
chaotic environments and are natural,
confident, and driven leaders.
Each year, more than 200,000 service-
members make the transition from
military to civilian life. Transition as-
sistance is critical to ensure that those
who serve in the military have oppor-
tunities for meaningful employment.
H.R. 3537 addresses the many issues
we have heard from veterans by updat-
ing many aspects of the program and
also offering certainty by codifying it
for the next 5 years.
Mr. Speaker, I again thank Mr.
SPANO and the committee for their
work on this important bill. I urge
Members to support this bipartisan
piece of legislation, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume. I
rise in support of H.R. 3537, the Veteran
Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2019.
Mr. Speaker, before I speak on the
bill, I want to again thank Chair-
woman VELÁZQUEZ, who is unable to be
with us, so then the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. SCHNEIDER), for running our
committee in such a bipartisan fash-
ion.
Today we have yet another strong
package of five bills that are fully bi-
partisan. So, again, I want to make
sure that we recognize that we all have
a seat at the table on that committee.
Today’s five bills focus on our Na-
tion’s heroes, our veterans, service-dis-
abled veterans, reservists, National
Guard members, and their spouses.
Last month, four veterans testified
before our committee and reminded us
of the incredible contributions those
who have served our country make.
They have made extraordinary sac-
rifices, put their lives on the line, and
kept our country safe.
Their service to our Nation doesn’t
always stop when they separate from
the military. Increasingly, veterans are
choosing to open their own small busi-
nesses.
Research has shown that service-
members are especially qualified to
start running their own firms. While
serving in the military, they learn to
make good decisions in chaotic cir-
cumstances, and are confident, driven,
and natural leaders.
There are a myriad of programs and
services across the Federal Govern-
ment that assist veterans who start
businesses after leaving the military.
At the Small Business Committee,
we have the unique opportunity to sup-
port our Nation’s veterans as they em-
bark on their next adventure: business
ownership. The SBA offers funding,
training, and Federal contracting re-
sources tailored to meet the needs of
our veterans. We are committed to
making the SBA’s programs and serv-
ices more accessible to our Nation’s
veteran entrepreneurs.

Military to Entrepreneur,’’ we heard
firsthand from veteran small business
owners that entrepreneurship has em-
powered current and former service-
members and their spouses. The Boots
to Business Program is a first step in
their journey.
Originally launched in 2012, the Boots
to Business Program offers
transitioning servicemembers and mili-
tary spouses information about self-
employment and business ownership.
Participants complete a 2-day, in-per-
son entrepreneurship program and can
access additional training through on-
line courses.
H.R. 3537, the Veteran Entrepreneur-
ship Training Act of 2019, codifies the
Boots to Business Program, solidifying
a crucial piece of veteran entre-
preneurs’ support network. Through
this program, participants are intro-
duced to the SBA and its resource part-
ners, who will have their back as they
experience new challenges of business
ownership.
The program’s success is a statement
to interagency collaboration, and we
can give veterans the holistic support
they deserve.
Mr. Speaker, this bill is another
product of our committee’s bipartisan
cooperation, as I mentioned before, and
I would like to thank the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER) and the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. SPANO)
for working together to increase busi-
ness opportunities for our Nation’s he-
roes.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. SPANO),
and I want to thank him for his leader-
ship on this legislation.
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Ranking Member CHABOT for yielding.
I rise today in support of the Veteran
Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2019,
a bill that I was proud to introduce
with Representative SCHNEIDER.
This bill authorizes the Boots to
Business Program for 5 years, which
provides educational opportunities to
veterans and their families on how to
start and manage their own small busi-
nesses.
Veterans often have the natural tem-
perament and experience to be success-
ful entrepreneurs. They are trained to
be confident leaders and they know
how to make tough decisions in very,
very difficult environments. However,
many veterans often retire from the
service with all the right tools but lack
the knowledge on how to apply them in
the business world. The Boots to Busi-
ness Program fills this gap.
As a pilot program, it provides a
number of opportunities to educate
veterans in entrepreneurship. The flag-
ship offering of the program is the In-
troduction to Entrepreneurship course,
a 2-day, in-person training on the fun-
damental principles of business owner-
ship.
Specifically, the course teaches par-
ticipants how to recognize business op-
portunities, create a business plan, and
consider the legal and financial aspects
of how to operate a business. This al-
lows veterans to come to the course
with the beginnings of a business idea
and leave with the tools to turn it into
a viable business model.
Boots to Business also follows up this
introductory course with more in-
depth educational opportunities on spe-
cific topics, such as conducting market
research and revenue readiness.
Beyond these educational opportuni-
ties, Boots to Business provides vet-
eran entrepreneurs access to free con-
sultants for follow-up questions and to
help them navigate loan programs of-
fered by the Small Business Adminis-
tration.
I have personally seen the positive
impacts of the Boots to Business Pro-
gram in my district. Introduction to
Entrepreneurship classes are regularly
offered at MacDill Air Force Base, and
so far, 100 courses have been given
throughout Florida.
The program has been a great benefit
to the veterans in my community, and
I am confident that it will continue to
benefit veterans across the country.
Mr. Speaker, the bill passed unani-
mously from the Small Business Com-
mittee, and I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON),
and I want to commend him for his
leadership on this as well.
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to speak in support of a bill I cospon-
sored, H.R. 3537, the Veteran Entrepre-
neurship Training Act.
This bill would authorize the Boots
to Business Program, which helps our
Nation’s veterans who are
transitioning back into the workforce
launch and grow their small busi-
nesses.
Our Nation just celebrated Veterans
Day, and while it is a wonderful way
for us to show our appreciation for
those who have served the United
States honorably, it is also important
we honor those veterans year-round.
We must never forget our highest
commitment, which is to support our
servicemembers, veterans, and their
families.
The Boots to Business Program is
one such way we can do that for our
veterans, by providing them with the
tools and resources they need to be
successful entrepreneurs in our modern
world.
The Boots to Business Program is an
important way for our country to sup-
port two fundamentally American val-
ues: small business and military serv-
ice.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support H.R. 3537.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no
further Members seeking time. If the
gentleman is prepared to close, we will
close now.
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend,
again, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
SCHNEIDER) and the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. SPANO) and Mr.
BALDERSON for their leadership on this
bill, which works to increase business
opportunities for our Nation’s vet-
erans.
As Mr. BALDERSON just mentioned,
many of us attended various Veterans
Day events earlier this week, and I
think he is absolutely right: this is
something where we can continue
every day of the year to help those who
really do seek to start a business, to
grow a business, and create more jobs
for veterans and for other members of
American society.
Mr. Speaker, I urge its support. It is
bipartisan legislation. It supports our
Nation’s veterans.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Again, I want to thank my colleague,
the ranking member, from Ohio.
By developing new products, advanc-
ing research, and creating new mar-
kets, entrepreneurs are a vital force in
our economy. Over the years, we have
repeatedly seen the important role vet-
erans play in this process.
Due to their leadership, training, per-
severance, knowledge of procurement
processes, and other skills acquired in
the military, veterans are often excep-
tionally well qualified to launch and
manage their own business. In fact,
veterans own one in ten small firms in
our country and support more than 5
million jobs.
Despite being positioned to succeed
as entrepreneurs, servicemembers
transitioning into civilian life face ob-
stacles starting their own small busi-
ness.
The Boots to Business Program is de-
signed to alleviate these challenges by
providing a path to entrepreneurship
for veterans without compelling them
to attend business school, which could
mean more time away from their fami-
lies.
Boots to Business is unlike any other
entrepreneurial development program
offered by the SBA, because its cur-
riculum focuses on educating service-
members about the basic concepts of
business, SBA resources, real world in-
sight, and how to manage expectations,
and it is directly tied in to their transi-
tion programming.
The Veteran Entrepreneurship Train-
ing Act not only codifies the program
for the next 5 years, but also ensures
that the information is accessible and
readily available to all servicemembers
wishing to test the waters of entrepre-
neurship.

take a ‘‘step in the direction of entre-

warrior ethos that had them succeed in

H.R. 3537 is a commonsense move and

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3661, the Patriotic Employer
Protection Act of 2019.
Mr. Speaker, this commonsense leg-
islation recognizes the service of our
reservists and the companies they
work at by broadening the ability of
small business employers to access
loans when a reservist is deployed.
Across the country, small business
owners are doing the right thing by ac-
tively employing military reservists.
Congress recognized the strain a small
business can be under when key em-
ployees are deployed on missions. That
is why this distinguished body created
the SBA’s military reservist programs,
which are the Military Reservist Eco-
nomic Injury Disaster Loan program
and the Repayment Deferral for Active
Duty Reservists program. These two
programs provide emergency working
capital and loan flexibility to small
business owners who have an essential
employee who is an Active Duty re-
servist called into action.
Over the past decade, our Reserve
Forces have experienced a shift from a
strategic reserve to an operational re-
serve. This bill addresses that shift by
expanding the pool of eligible reserv-
ists through a restructuring of the pro-
grams so they are not limited to peri-
ods of conflict.
This seemingly minor modification,
in addition to increased coordination
between the SBA and the National
Guard Bureau and State Adjutants
General, will lead to targeted outreach
and education about the programs
while also modernizing them to meet
the needs of today’s small employers.
I thank Congressman KIM and Con-
gressman BURCHETT for working with
me to improve access to affordable cap-
ital for small businesses, especially
those owned by or who employ reserv-
ists.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
3661, the Patriotic Employer Protec-
tion Act of 2019.
Mr. Speaker, nearly half of all em-
ployees in the United States work for a
small business. These employees come
from every State and territory, and
every congressional district. Many of
them also serve our Nation proudly.
When these men and women are
called up for military duty, the small
business that they work for may be at
a disadvantage due to their absence. If
a small business experiences an eco-
nomic loss due to the essential em-
ployee being called up to duty, the
small business has the ability to apply
for a Military Reservist Economic In-
jury Disaster Loan through the SBA.
To modernize this loan program, H.R.
3661, this bill, adds employees who are
also on full-time National Guard duty
to the eligibility list. This reform fur-
ther aligns this SBA program with the
way today’s military operates.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
from Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) and
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
KIM) for working in a bipartisan man-
ner on behalf of the Nation’s military
servicemembers. Additionally, I thank
the chairwoman, as usual, for moving
this legislation forward in a bipartisan
manner.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the bill, which was favorably
reported out of committee via voice
vote, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, it is
now my privilege to yield such time as
he may consume to the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. KIM), my friend
and colleague who is a sponsor of this
bill.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand up
for small business owners across our
country who want to do the patriotic
thing and provide economic opportuni-
ties to those serving in the military
Reserves.
I represent Burlington County and
Ocean County in New Jersey, home to
Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.
Approximately 5,500 reservists are cur-
rently serving at our joint base, and 99
percent of New Jersey businesses are
classified as small businesses.
For those small business owners who
are members of the Reserves or want to
hire reservists, there is uncertainty
and risks that come with unexpected
deployments and activations to Active
Duty. During times of war, we not only
ask these reservists to sacrifice during
their service but to sacrifice their eco-
nomic well-being.
In 2003, during the Iraq war, a small
business owner and servicemember
named Stanley Adams was called to
Active Duty. Mr. Adams, who owned
two thriving livestock trailer compa-
nies, had to close one down and saw
revenue plummet during his deploy-
ment. In an interview, Mr. Adams said,
‘‘Everything came to a halt, and all
this money still had to be paid.’’
We owe our servicemembers more
than that. Serving our country
shouldn’t be a barrier to those who
want to start or work for a small busi-
ness. We should reward these patriots,
not create an environment of economic
uncertainty.
That is why I am proud to introduce
the bipartisan Patriotic Employer Pro-
tection Act with Congressman
BURCHETT. The Patriotic Employer
Protection Act would restructure two
programs—the Military Reservist Eco-
nomic Injury Disaster Loan program
and the Repayment Deferral for Active
Duty Reservists program—so that they
better reflect the current deployment
trends of reservists. The bill would
allow these programs to be used for
any reservists being ordered to Active
Duty for a period of more than 30 con-
secutive days, broadening the program
to more people in need.
In addition, the bill would create a
new business training program to pro-
vide counseling and assistance to sup-
port members of the Reserves and their
spouses, as well as direct the Small
Business Administration to develop
more targeted and effective outreach
to reservists and small business own-
ers.
The American Legion, which has en-
dorsed this bill, has called these impor-
tant programs ‘‘underutilized because
their eligibility restrictions do not
fully reflect current deployment prac-
tices.’’ This bill fixes that and empow-
ers small business owners across the
country to provide a path to the Amer-
ican Dream for those servicemembers
who fight to protect it every day.
Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join my-
self and Congressman BURCHETT in sup-
porting this bill.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.
BURCHETT), the Republican leader on
this particular bill.
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of the Patriotic Em-
ployer Protection Act. I am proud of
this bipartisan legislation that encour-
ages small business owners to hire
military reservists.
Military reservists bravely serve
America and are also members of our
Nation’s small business workforce. In
east Tennessee and throughout Amer-
ica, small business owners rely on the
abilities and skills of reservists. When
an employee is activated from the Re-
serves to answer the call of duty, small
businesses should not struggle while
that employee is absent.
This legislation improves small busi-
nesses’ access to Military Reservist
Economic Injury Disaster Loans and
Repayment Deferral for Active Duty
Reservists. These programs offer finan-
cial support to small businesses that
lose valuable production when a reserv-
ist is activated for military service.
By improving access to these pro-
grams, small businesses can continue
to operate while an employee is serving
in the military. Additionally, it gives
small businesses peace of mind that
their businesses will not suffer in the
absence of military reservists.
It takes courage to put your liveli-
hood and career on hold to serve our
country, and small businesses should
be proud of their employees’ military
commitments.
Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor to
champion this legislation with Rep-
resentative KIM, and I encourage my
colleagues to support this bill.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, a small business should
not be disadvantaged if the men and
women who they employ are called to
military duty.
H.R. 3661 updates the SBA’s Military
Reservist Economic Injury Disaster
Loan program to ensure it aligns with
today’s military.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bipartisan legislation. I
thank Mr. BURCHETT and Mr. KIM for
their leadership on this, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I, too, commend and
thank Representative KIM and Rep-
resentative BURCHETT for their leader-
ship on this. The Small Business Com-
mittee, as a whole, commends those
small business owners who support
their employees serving in the Na-
tional Guard and Reserves and thereby
support our national security.
Reservists can be called away at a
moment’s notice and fulfill their duty
in a variety of ways. For instance, we
rely on them during our most vulner-
able times, like during natural disas-
ters, and they can be tapped to serve
abroad when needed and necessary.
They protect us and our communities
by leaving their lives and communities
behind. Though they may be called
upon temporarily, their absence is
sorely noticed by their families and
employers who rely upon them.
The bill before us today, H.R. 3661,
takes their absence into consideration
by reflecting how our Nation has
changed the way we call upon them. By
making the SBA’s Military Reservist
Economic Injury Disaster Loan and Re-
payment Deferral for Active Duty Re-
servists programs more accessible to
servicemembers and their employers,
we are helping to sustain small busi-
nesses, families, and local commu-
nities.
This legislation makes sure that the
SBA can be a resource for when em-
ployers support their workers while on
deployment.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
SCHNEIDER) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3661, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-

A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

SERVICE-DISABLED VETERANS
SMALL BUSINESS CONTINUATION
ACT
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and pass the
bill (H.R. 499) to amend the Small Busi-
ness Act to clarify the treatment of
certain surviving spouses under the
definition of small business concern
owned and controlled by service-dis-
abled veterans.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 499
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Service-Dis-
abled Veterans Small Business Continuation
Act’’.
SEC. 2. TECHNICAL AMENDMENT REGARDING
TREATMENT OF CERTAIN SUR-
VIVING SPOUSES UNDER THE DEFI-
NITION OF SMALL BUSINESS CON-
CERN OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY
SERVICE-DISABLED VETERANS.
Effective on the date specified in sub-
section (e) of section 1832 of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017
(Public Law 114–328; 130 Stat. 2660), section
3(q)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.
632(q)) is amended—
(1) in subparagraph (C)(i)(II), by striking
‘‘rated as 100 percent’’ and all that follows
through ‘‘service-connected disability’’; and
(2) by amending subparagraph (C)(ii)(III) to
read as follows:
‘‘(III) the date that—
‘‘(aa) in the case of a surviving spouse of a
veteran with a service-connected disability
rated as 100 percent disabling or who dies as
a result of a service-connected disability, is
10 years after the date of the death of the
veteran; or
‘‘(bb) in the case of a surviving spouse of a
veteran with a service-connected disability
rated as less than 100 percent disabling who
does not die as a result of a service-con-
nected disability, is 3 years after the date of
the death of the veteran.’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. SCHNEIDER) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 499, the Service-Disabled Vet-
erans Small Business Continuation
Act, which protects small businesses
owned by disabled veterans by pro-
viding a transitionary period to keep
service-disabled veteran-owned small
business status in the event of the
business owner’s death. This bill codi-
fies our intention to bridge the dif-
ferences between the SBA and VA by
establishing uniformity.
We know that running a small busi-
ness often involves many members of a
family. By extending surviving spousal
rights to the SDVOSB definition, we
are honoring the sacrifice a deceased
veteran previously made for our coun-
try. We are also providing stability for
the business and its employees to en-
sure that they can remain competitive,
rather than being effectively penalized
by the death of the service-disabled
veteran business owner.
I thank Ranking Member CHABOT and
Mr. DELGADO for working together to
ensure that when a disabled veteran
business owner passes, the law does not
impose insult to injury by penalizing
the surviving spouse.
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port this bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
b 1315
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
499, the Service-Disabled Veteran
Small Business Continuation Act.
First, I would like to thank Chair-
man TAKANO and Ranking Member ROE
of the House Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee for their leadership and collabo-
ration on this issue. I would also like
to thank the gentleman from New
York, a member of our Small Business
Committee, Mr. DELGADO, for his will-
ingness to work with me and be a lead-
er on this legislation.
I, like all Members of this body, hear
from many constituents on a wide
range of issues. One issue that is par-
ticularly important to me and the
folks in my district is to ensure that
veterans and their families are treated
fairly by the government that they
have served so bravely.
Many of our men and women in uni-
form come home after serving and de-
cide to use their considerable talents
to become small business owners. Un-
fortunately, the laws and regulations
around starting a business can be dif-
ficult to navigate—almost prohibi-
tive—when they shouldn’t be. Further
exacerbating the problem is when one
part of the law says one thing, yet an-
other part of the law says something
entirely different.
How can we expect our veterans to
come home and become successful en-
trepreneurs when our laws are often
unclear? That is why this bill, H.R. 499,
is so important. While Congress has al-
ready codified in title 38 a common-
sense policy allowing the surviving
spouse of the service-disabled veteran
small business owner to retain the
company’s SDVOSB status for a cer-
tain length of time, the Small Business
Act has no such policy and this lack of
parity creates legal uncertainty in the
application of the law and confusion
for veterans and their families.
H.R. 499 provides clarity in the law
by ensuring continuity across the gov-
ernment in the way we treat our vet-
eran entrepreneurs and their families.
The bill amends the Small Business
Act to align with title 38, guaranteeing
that the surviving spouses of service-
disabled veteran small business owners
can keep the valuable SDVOSB small
business designation for their compa-
nies for a certain period of time, even
after the veteran owner passes away.
Correcting this misalignment in the
law is the least we can do to provide
our Nation’s heroes and their families
with some measure of comfort and
peace of mind, especially when dealing
with this type of family tragedy.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
DELGADO).
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my friend and colleague Representa-
tive SCHNEIDER from Illinois for yield-
ing.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of the first bill I introduced as a Mem-
ber of Congress, the bipartisan Service-
Disabled Veterans Small Business Con-
tinuation Act.
This legislation which I introduced
with Members from both sides of the
aisle, Ranking Member CHABOT, Con-
gressman JACK BERGMAN, and Rep-
resentative CORREA, responds to the
critical need to ensure that spouses of
service-disabled veterans can start or
continue operating a small business
after the veteran’s passing.
The spouses, families, and loved ones
of our servicemembers carry enormous
burdens. Not only do they make sac-
rifices to support their loved ones in
the military, they are integral to the
transition back to civilian life.
The Service-Disabled Veterans Small
Business Continuation Act seeks to ad-
dress one of the many burdens carried
by the spouses of our military vet-
erans. Rightfully so, both the Small
Business Administration, and the VA
give contracting preferences to small
businesses owned by service-disabled
veterans. However, currently, when the
veteran dies, only a small handful of
spouses can retain that contracting
preference. That is because this con-
tracting preference is only given to the
spouses of veterans with a 100 percent
disability.
Spouses of service-disabled veterans
should be able to retain this preference

regardless of the veteran’s disability
rating. This bill makes an important
correction ensuring that all spouses of
service-disabled veterans retain Fed-
eral contracting preference as a serv-
ice-disabled veteran-owned small busi-
ness no matter the severity of that vet-
eran’s injury.
This will give surviving spouses the
opportunity to remain competitive in
the Federal contracting market and
help ensure that businesses are not up-
ended after the death of their veteran
spouse.
I want to thank my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle for their co-
operation on this issue and commit-
ment to the families and spouses of our
veterans. Caring for our Nation’s he-
roes should never be a partisan issue. I
urge the House to support this legisla-
tion.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, this commonsense bill
fixes an oversight by Congress to align
the way the Federal Government treats
the surviving spouse of a service-dis-
abled veteran-owned small business.
The bill simply aligns title 15, the
Small Business Act, with title 38, en-
suring continuity across the govern-
ment for this important policy.
This bill will provide our Nation’s he-
roes and their families with peace of
mind. I urge this bill’s adoption, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, both the Department of
Veterans Affairs and the Small Busi-
ness Administration value the sac-
rifices of America’s veterans and, in
particular, we note today, service-dis-
abled veterans who remain committed
to their country by starting small
firms.
In that vein, the VA and the SBA
have contracting preferences for serv-
ice-disabled veteran-owned small busi-
nesses. Despite the success of these
programs, neither adequately address
what happens when the service-dis-
abled veteran owner dies. The death of
a loved one by itself, an already dev-
astating event, is compounded by need-
ing to attend to the duties of running
his or her small business and it is often
debilitating.
The sudden death of a veteran whose
small business relies upon a con-
tracting preference takes a toll on the
spouse of the deceased veteran, the
business operations, and the business’
employees.
H.R. 499 establishes much-needed cer-
tainty by rectifying inherently critical
oversight. Setting forth the rules by
which a surviving spouse can retain the
service-disabled veteran-owned small
business status honors the dedication
of the veteran, the surviving spouse,
and their business.
The government has a responsibility
to ensure those who give so much to
their country have the opportunity for
their small business passions to survive
and prosper, even upon death.
I urge my colleagues to support the
bill, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
SCHNEIDER) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 499.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, on
that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8804 November 13, 2019
The Interagency Task Force on Vet-
erans Small Business Development was
established to do just that. The task
force is chaired by the SBA and is com-
prised of representatives appointed by
the SBA’s administrator from a variety
of agencies, including: the SBA’s Office
of Veterans Business Development, De-
partment of Defense, Department of
Labor, Department of the Treasury,
Veterans’ Affairs, General Services Ad-
ministration, Office of Management
and Budget, and four representatives
from veterans service and military or-
ganizations.
The task force is charged with co-
ordinating efforts to improve capital
access, business development, and con-
tracting goals for veterans. Unfortu-
nately, it hasn’t filed an annual report
since fiscal year 2015. This delay is
wholly unacceptable on its face. Con-
sidering we heard from veterans about
the needs for more outreach and co-
ordination of business services, it only
makes the delay more painful.
Today’s legislation requires the SBA
administrator to report annually on
the appointments made, highlighting
the activities of and plan for outreach
and engagement by the Interagency
Task Force on Veterans Small Busi-
ness Development.
Annual reporting will give Congress
the visibility over the task force re-
sponsible for serving our veterans at
SBA and the ability to provide proper
oversight. Gathering a regular snap-
shot of the program will enable Con-
gress to make modifications where
they are needed in a timely fashion.
I want to thank Ms. DAVIDS and
Ranking Member CHABOT for their col-
laboration on this bill. I urge Members
to support this bipartisan legislation,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
3734, the Successful Entrepreneurship
for Reservists and Veterans Act or the
SERV Act.
Veteran-owned small businesses are
some of the Nation’s most innovative
companies. They are nimble and move
quickly as markets change directions.
The resources that are available to our
veteran-owned small businesses should
be as effective and as efficient as the
owners themselves.
The SERV Act requires the SBA to
outline the agency’s veteran outreach
plans and veteran promotion plans to
Congress. Additionally, H.R. 3734, re-
quires the Government Accountability
Office to evaluate credit availability of
veteran, service-disabled veteran, and
reservist-owned small businesses.
I want to thank the gentlewoman
from Kansas (Ms. DAVIDS) for working
with me in a bipartisan manner on this
legislation. I also want to thank Chair-
woman VELÁZQUEZ for advancing this
commonsense legislation that will as-
sist veterans as they work to launch
and build strong small businesses.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to

ably reported out of committee by
voice vote, and I reserve the balance of

Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker,
I thank my good friend and colleague
from Illinois for yielding.
The first thing I would like to do is
thank Chairwoman VELÁZQUEZ and
Ranking Member CHABOT for con-
tinuing the Small Business Commit-
tee’s bipartisan efforts.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 3734,
the Successful Entrepreneurship for
Reservists and Veterans Act, or the
SERV Act, which I introduced with
Ranking Member CHABOT.
This bipartisan piece of legislation
helps veteran business owners succeed
by studying the barriers they face, in-
cluding lack of access to capital and
credit. It also helps ensure that vet-
erans are aware of all of the resources
available to them through the Small
Business Administration.
I was fortunate enough to spend this
past weekend on Veterans Day at home
in the district I represent in Kansas. I
was meeting the brave men and women
who have served our country and was
hearing about the issues and opportu-
nities that they have.
After everything our veterans have
done for us, we must have their backs.
They deserve nothing less than access
to jobs, healthcare, and the services
that they deserve.
That includes the ability to start and
grow a small business. Veterans pos-
sess many of the leadership and entre-
preneurial skills to start and grow
small businesses, but they face unique
challenges, including difficulty access-
ing capital and credit.
Since it is tough to accumulate the
type of credit needed to start a busi-
ness during your time in service, those
issues are exactly what the SERV Act
is intending to address. The SERV Act
requires a report from the Comptroller
General of the United States on the
ability of veteran and reservist small
business owners to access credit.
The report will include new informa-
tion and analysis on the sources of
credit that veterans and other reserv-
ists use to start and maintain their
businesses, as well as how deployment
and other military responsibilities af-
fect a veteran’s and reservist’s credit.
Studying the problem of access to
credit for veterans and reservists is a
crucial first step in finding the right
solutions. This legislation also helps
connect veterans to existing programs
in the Small Business Administration
that are aimed at helping veterans
transition their military skills from
service to business, like Veteran Busi-
ness Outreach Centers, Boots to Busi-
ness, or the Service-Disabled Entrepre-
neurship Development Training.
These programs provide vital re-
sources for veterans, but they are only
useful if veterans know about them.
Without understanding the programs,
veterans are not going to be able to ac-
cess them.
That is why the SERV Act requires
the Interagency Task Force on Vet-
erans Small Business Development to
develop a plan for outreach and pro-
motion of these incredible programs.
The task force is responsible for co-
ordinating Federal efforts to improve
capital access, business development,
and contracting opportunities for vet-
eran and service-disabled small busi-
nesses. But the task force has not sub-
mitted a report to Congress since 2015.
That is why the SERV Act would re-
quire an annual report to Congress on
its appointments and to outline its
plan for outreach on the many pro-
grams available to veterans, service-
disabled veterans, reservists, and their
spouses.
I urge all of my colleagues to support
the SERV Act and help set our veteran
entrepreneurs up for success.

Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, veteran-
owned small businesses deserve the re-
sources that will prepare them for fu-
ture growth.
In order to improve our capital ac-
cess programs for our Nation’s veteran-
owned businesses, we must fully under-
stand what they are facing when seek-
ing access to affordable and reliable
capital. This bipartisan bill will pro-
vide future Congresses with a better
picture of what is available to them
and what is not and where we can plug
the gaps for them.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bipartisan legislation, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Assisting entrepreneurs requires in-
tegrated, comprehensive solutions that
leverage a combination of government
and private efforts. Despite progress we
have made, hundreds of thousands of
veterans and their families continue to
struggle, demonstrating how much
more must be done.
The interagency veterans task force
is a critical part of this effort, and we
must hold agencies accountable for en-
suring they are meeting the duties
placed upon them to maximize out-
reach to our servicemembers. H.R. 3734
does just this by requiring regular re-
porting by the task force to gather
snapshots of programmatic outreach
and education to veterans.
It also asks the Government Ac-
countability Office to study the many
issues raised by veteran entrepreneurs
facing difficulty accessing credit so
that this body can better understand
the financing needs of veterans. Doing
so enables us to take additional steps
to ease the burdens of not just
transitioning back to civilian life, but
also risking more to start a business.
It is incumbent upon all of us to en-
sure that resources reach the veterans

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1615, the Verification Align-
ment and Service-Disabled Business
Adjustment Act, or the VA-SBA Act.
I want to first take this opportunity
to thank Chairman TAKANO and Rank-
ing Member ROE of the Committee on
Veterans’ Affairs. This bill is a cul-
mination of years of collaboration to
ensure we are doing right by our Na-
tion’s veteran business owners. I thank
the gentlemen for their cooperation
and recognize the staff of our respec-
tive committees, both majority and
minority, for seeing this effort
through.
Mr. Speaker, considering how vet-
eran-owned businesses increase com-
petition and solidify our industrial
base, Congress created the SBA’s Serv-
ice-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small
Business, SDVOSB, program to maxi-
mize their participation in the Federal
marketplace.
In 2018, the Service-Disabled Veteran-
Owned Small Business procurement
program awarded $20.6 billion to over
180,000 contracts. Such awards ac-
counted for approximately 4.27 percent
of all contracts, exceeding the 3 per-
cent statutory goal.
While this accomplishment should be
applauded, the structure and resources
of the program have not kept pace with
the growth. Currently, the Department
of Veterans Affairs requires all partici-
pants to go through a rigorous certifi-
cation process. In contrast, the SBA al-
lows businesses to self-certify that
they meet the regulatory threshold.
The problem with two certification
processes is simple: It creates confu-
sion for business owners and con-
tracting officers alike.
This bill harmonizes the two con-
flicting contracting programs by elimi-
nating the VA certification and trans-
ferring it to the SBA. It also institutes
a certification process under the SBA
program to prevent concerns of fraud
and abuse.
I thank all the members of the re-
spective committees who have spon-
sored this bill, because it is certainly a
step in the right direction to eliminate
duplication and confusion between the
two agencies. This bipartisan legisla-
tion will make it easier for the vet-
eran-owned business to do business
with our government.
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port this bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON VETERANS’ AFFAIRS,
Washington, DC, November 4, 2019.
Hon. NYDIA M. VELÁZQUEZ,
Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN VELÁZQUEZ: I am writ-
ing with respect to H.R. 1615, the
Verification Alignment and Service-Disabled
Business Adjustment Act. Thank you for
consulting with the Committee on Veterans’
Affairs regarding the matters in H.R. 1615
that fall within the Committee’s jurisdic-
tion.
As a result of your consultation with us on
this measure and in order to expeditiously
move the bill to the floor, I forego further
consideration of H.R. 1615. The Committee
on Veterans’ Affairs takes this action with
our mutual understanding that we do not
waive any jurisdiction over the subject mat-
ter contained in this or similar legislation,
and the Committee will be appropriately
consulted and involved as the bill or similar
legislation moves forward so that we may
address any remaining issues that fall within
our jurisdiction. Further, I request your sup-
port for the appointment of an appropriate
number of conferees from the Committee on
Veterans’ Affairs during any House-Senate
conference involving this or similar legisla-
tion.
Finally, I would appreciate your response
to this letter confirming this understanding
regarding H.R. 1615 and would ask that a
copy of our exchange of letters on this mat-
ter be included in the Committee Report and
the Congressional Record during floor con-
sideration of the measure. Thank you for the
cooperative spirit in which you have worked
regarding this matter and others between
our respective committees.
Sincerely,

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS,
Washington, DC, November 5, 2019.
Hon. MARK TAKANO,
Chairman, Committee on Veterans’ Affairs,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN TAKANO: Thank you for
your letter regarding the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs jurisdictional interest in H.R.
1615, the ‘‘Verification Alignment and Serv-
ice-Disabled Business Adjustment Act’’ and
your willingness to forego consideration of
H.R. 1615 by your committee. I agree that
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has a
valid jurisdictional interest in certain provi-
sions of H.R. 1615 and that the Committee’s
jurisdiction will not be adversely affected by
your decision to forego consideration of H.R.
1615. As you have requested, I will support
your request for an appropriate appointment
of outside conferees from your Committee in
the event of a House-Senate conference on
this or similar legislation should such a con-
ference be convened.
Finally, I will include a copy of your letter
and this response in the Committee Report
and in the Congressional Record during the
floor consideration of this bill. Thank you
again for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
NYDIA M. VELÁZQUEZ,
Chairwoman.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume,
and I rise in support of H.R. 1615.
Before I speak on the bill, I want to
thank the gentleman from Mississippi
(General KELLY) and the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. CROW)—both vet-
erans, by the way—for their leadership
on this important legislation and for
their service to our country. We appre-
ciate it greatly.
So many of our Nation’s heroes come
home to become entrepreneurs, and
many choose to continue with their
service to the country by entering the
Federal contracting space.
Federal contracting can be a con-
fusing minefield of red tape and bu-
reaucracy, and it is up to us to make
the process as easy as possible.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8808 November 13, 2019
Unfortunately, the process is com-
plicated and rife with disparities. In
fact, there currently exists an unneces-
sary duplication of small business pro-
grams at the SBA and the VA. Both op-
erate under separate and conflicting
standards.
Veterans attempting to make sense
of these two programs often feel over-
whelmed and frustrated, sometimes to
the point where they decline to join
the Federal marketplace altogether.
This should not be the case. We need
to encourage veteran entrepreneurship
by reducing barriers to entry, not cre-
ating more confusion.
It is well past time that these two
programs consolidate under a single
agency, the SBA, and that all rules and
regulations governing the Service-Dis-
abled Veteran-Owned Small Business
program are unified for the benefit of
our veteran entrepreneurs. H.R. 1615
takes that critical step in the right di-
rection.
Mr. Speaker, I thank both of these
gentlemen for their leadership on this.
I urge my colleagues to support the
bill, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield as much time as he may consume
to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.
CROW), my friend and colleague.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in support of the Verification Align-
ment and Service-Disabled Business
Adjustment Act, or the VA-SBA Act.
I start by thanking my friend and
colleague from Mississippi (Mr.
KELLY)—or, as a former Army captain
myself, I like to call him General
KELLY—for his leadership and friend-
ship and hard work on this bill as well.
Veterans are uniquely qualified and
have a valuable perspective as they
start and manage small businesses.
In my home State of Colorado, there
are over 52,000 small businesses owned
by veterans that continue to give back
to the country, the community, and
our economy every single day. These
veteran-owned businesses have also
proven to go above and beyond to hire
other veterans, including those who
have been injured in the line of duty.
Currently, service-disabled veterans
who want to start a business have to go
through a complicated, confusing, and
redundant application process through
both the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs and the Small Business Adminis-
tration.
The VA-SBA Act removes duplica-
tion in regulation and cuts red tape to
ensure the Federal Government can
provide the support and resources that
our veterans deserve. It also ensures
that data on service-disabled veteran-
owned businesses and veteran-owned
small businesses is located at the
Small Business Administration, which
is uniquely equipped to serve veterans
who want to start small businesses.
This bill will greatly ease the burden
on our veteran-owned small businesses
by cutting unnecessary red tape.
I thank Chairwoman VELÁZQUEZ and
Ranking Member CHABOT, as well as
Mr. SCHNEIDER and all my colleagues
on the Committee on Small Business.
This truly is an example of bipartisan
cooperation, as we have all come to-
gether to do the right thing by our vet-
erans and our small businesses, a true
win-win for the country and for our
communities.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.
KELLY), General TRENT KELLY.
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I thank Chairwoman
VELÁZQUEZ and Ranking Member
CHABOT for working to bring the VA-
SBA Act to the House floor. I also
thank my friend and cosponsor from
Colorado (Mr. CROW) for working on
this very important legislation. I
thank all of them for being champions
of both our veterans and our small
businesses all across America.
As we have heard in the hearings
held in the Committee on Small Busi-
ness, the VA proactively verifies serv-
ice-disabled veteran-owned small busi-
nesses while the SBA allows business
owners to self-certify. This process cre-
ates inconsistent outcomes, such as a
business qualifying as a service-dis-
abled veteran business for VA con-
tracts but not other Federal agency
contracts.
While the SBA-certified businesses’
awards are subject to scrutiny, the
lack of a front-end verification leaves
the door open for fraud and abuse.
We have already made significant
strides in the right direction. The Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for
fiscal year 2017 instructed the SBA and
VA to unify the definitions for service-
disabled veteran-owned small busi-
nesses and began moving regulatory re-
sponsibility from the VA to the SBA.
Additionally, this administration has
made substantial improvements in
streamlining certifications for small
business Federal procurement pro-
grams.
The VA-SBA Act marks the next sig-
nificant step towards unification of the
two programs under one umbrella at
the SBA and reduces red tape and con-
fusion for veteran small business own-
ers.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues
for supporting this bill.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as she may consume to the
gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss
GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN).
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in full
support of H.R. 1615, known as the VA-
SBA Act of 2019, introduced by my dear
friend, General KELLY from Mississippi.
Why this bill is important for me: in
Puerto Rico, we do have more than
100,000 veterans registered by the VA
system.
Our men and women in uniform are
an invaluable asset during their time
of service and upon separating from the
Armed Forces as well. One of the main
challenges upon retiring and adjusting
to life as a civilian is actually securing
employment.
Many decide to open and operate
their own business, employing the com-
munity and generating robust gains for
our economy. According to the Small
Business Administration, close to 2.5
million businesses in the United States
are minority-owned by veterans, with a
total annual revenue of over $1 tril-
lion—and Puerto Rico is not a part of
these statistics.
Yet, there are additional issues to
consider, and that is the reason this
bill is presented today. Both the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs and the
Small Business Administration are in-
volved in the process of certifying
American service-disabled veteran-
owned businesses.
These businesses have the option to
self-certify with the SBA for con-
tracting purposes with the Federal
Government, but, additionally, the
Veterans Affairs Administration has
its own process for certifying these
same businesses through a more rig-
orous evaluation for Federal contracts
within the VA.
This is another hardship for many of
those veterans. Having two paths for
what is essentially the same outcome
can be confusing for service-disabled
veteran business owners and creates an
opportunity for fraud, waste, and
abuse.
This bill will help rectify this prob-
lem by streamlining the process and
making clear certification require-
ments for service-disabled veteran-
owned small businesses and shifting
this responsibility to the Small Busi-
ness Administration, which has the
technical expertise to administer small
business programs and properly work
with these cases.
By releasing the VA from this task,
we help eliminate inconsistencies in
the certification process and previous
loopholes that impact Federal con-
tracting and also allow the VA to focus
on their main mission. We also help
focus the VA’s attention to its core
mission of administering the
healthcare services for our veterans.
Mr. Speaker, I am a proud original
cosponsor of this bill, and I think we
should all vote for it.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, it is vi-
tally important to reduce the red tape
and bureaucracy our Nation’s heroes
endure just to try to contract with the
Federal Government.
There currently exists an unneces-
sary duplication of programs at the
SBA and the VA which operate under
separate and conflicting standards.
This bill is a step in the right direction
to eliminate some of that red tape for
our Nation’s veterans.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8809
November 13, 2019
b 1345
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
As the largest purchaser of goods and
services in the world, the Federal Gov-
ernment is in a unique position to sup-
port veteran-owned businesses, yet
navigating this process remains com-
plicated to many veteran entre-
preneurs.
One of the most challenging obsta-
cles for veteran-owned businesses is
getting certified. This first step toward
contracting with the Federal Govern-
ment is the most important, but also
the most complex. This is largely due
to the fact that the SBA established its
own program, which applies govern-
ment-wide, and the VA administrators
established their own program as well.
Although the two programs share the
same goal, each has its own participa-
tion requirements. Creating more con-
fusion is the fact that firms can self-
certify for the SBA programs, ones
verified by the VA may not necessarily
be found eligible to receive an SBA set-
aside contract, and vice versa.
Coordinating certifications between
the SBA and the VA can allow the Fed-
eral Government to reap the benefits of
goods and services provided by veteran-
owned businesses.
Again, I would like to thank Chair-
man TAKANO and Ranking Member
ROE. Finally, I commend the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. KELLY)
for leading this long effort and con-
tinuing to keep the needs of our vet-
eran business owners in mind, as well
as my colleague from Colorado (Mr.
CROW).
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by

ROSIE THE RIVETER CONGRES-
SIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT OF
2019
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and pass the
bill (H.R. 1773) to award a Congres-
sional Gold Medal, collectively, to the
women in the United States who joined
the workforce during World War II,
providing the aircraft, vehicles, weap-
onry, ammunition and other material
to win the war, that were referred to as
‘‘Rosie the Riveter’’, in recognition of
their contributions to the United
States and the inspiration they have
provided to ensuing generations, as
amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1773
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rosie the
Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act of
2019’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Over 70 years ago there was a call to ac-
tion, a demand for workers to fill the vacan-
cies left by the men who went to fight in the
war.
(2) More than 6 million women answered
the call then, entering the workforce during
World War II and providing the equipment,
weaponry and ammunition to achieve final
victory and end the war.
(3) These women left their homes to work
or volunteer full-time in factories, farms,
shipyards, airplane factories, banks, and
other institutions in support of the military
overseas.
(4) They worked with the United Service
Organizations and the American Red Cross,
drove trucks, riveted airplane parts, col-
lected critical materials, rolled bandages,
and served on rationing boards.
(5) Our ‘‘Rosie the Riveter’’, the women
who worked and sacrificed to strengthen this
country during World War II, are among the
greatest living heroines in the United States.
(6) These women persevered, despite often
facing harassment from their male col-
leagues and disapproval from their male
family members, and all the while continued
to maintain their ‘‘other jobs’’ as caretakers
of children and their households.
(7) Minority women also overcame long-
held policies of discrimination and made sig-
nificant contributions to the war effort.
(8) Because of the ‘‘Rosies’’, Federal, State,
and local agencies coordinated with business
owners to develop childcare programs and
other supports for working mothers.
(9) The example that these women set dur-
ing World War II continues to inspire us and
blaze a path for the working women and
young girls of today.
(10) Specifically, the images of ‘‘Rosie the
Riveter’’ and the phrase ‘‘We Can Do It’’ con-
tinue to symbolize the empowerment of
women today, representing patriotic women
who want to serve and strengthen their
country, and to inspire young girls to be-
come ‘‘21st Century Rosies’’ by aspiring to,
and attaining positions of leadership in all
walks of life in America.

filling jobs in factories, farms, ship-
yards, airplane factories, banks, and
other institutions left vacant by the
men who went to fight overseas.
These women, despite facing harass-

to the war effort, all while continuing
to serve as primary caretakers for chil-
dren and as heads of household.
The hard work and sacrifices of these
women during the war also paved the
way for the development of childcare
programs and other Federal-, State-,
and local-level policies to support
working mothers and families.
Today, the iconic image of Rosie the
Riveter, first popularized as part of a
wartime recruitment campaign for fe-
male workers, continues to be a symbol
of female empowerment and inspira-
tion for women who wish to serve and
strengthen their country.
H.R. 1773 recognizes the brave, patri-
otic women who stepped up to serve
their country in its time of need and
whose leadership and spirit of em-
powerment continues to inspire ensu-
ing generations.
I thank Ms. SPEIER for joining me in
introducing this bill this Congress, and
I urge Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, as the son of a World
War II veteran, the brother of a Viet-
nam veteran, and as a veteran myself
who served during the time of Desert
Storm and other conflicts, I under-
stand that victory in battle is not sole-
ly due to the soldier on the battlefield,
the airman that is flying over the bat-
tlefield, or the marine or the sailor. It
is as much the responsibility of all
Americans and those who actually sup-
ply the weapons and the machinery of
war that is so desperately needed by
those who are on the battlefield.
We saw this play out in a great way
during World War II. As our young men
and women were across the pond and
throughout the Pacific fighting against
tyranny, many here at home stepped
up and fulfilled the positions that
many of them vacated to go fight on
the battlefields.
We are honoring such of those women
today, being Rosie the Riveters, where
6 million answered their country’s call
to make sure that the airmen had the
aircraft to fly; that the infantrymen
had the bullets and the guns that were
needed to defend this country; that the
sailors had the equipment, the ships,
and the weapons to fight on the seas;
and that the Marines that were invad-
ing the islands that were held by the
Japanese had the materials that they
needed.
We could not have seen that victory
in World War II if it weren’t for these
brave patriots who not only took on
the roles and the responsibilities that
others left to make sure that we had
the weapons and the materials and the
logistics that were needed, but while
also raising families at the same time.
Back in June, I was honored to be
one of the official delegates to travel
to Normandy, representing the United
States and the House of Representa-
tives for the 75th anniversary of D-day.
I was especially honored because my
dad was one of those who stepped on
the shores of Normandy during that
battle.
And, as I was sitting in the audience
waiting on the President to give his re-
marks, there were three lovely ladies
sitting in the row in front of me. We
began to engage in conversation, and I
found out that they were Rosie Riv-
eters. And, of course, I had to have a
selfie with Rosie the Riveter.
They became the stars. Regardless of
the number of Members of Congress
who were sitting in the audience, those
three ladies became the focus of many
who were there, and rightfully so. And
because of their deeds and their patri-
otism, I fully support this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my
colleagues to do so as well, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
FITZPATRICK).
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, the
Rosie the Riveter Congressional Gold
Medal Act honors the 20th century icon
that unified women and inspired them
to join the workforce and help with the
war effort.
Throughout our Nation’s history,
countless Americans have answered the
call to service during times of conflict
and turmoil. During World War II,
women across the country left their
homes for factory jobs in support of the
war effort, working as riveters,
buckers, welders, and electricians.
These Rosie the Riveters embodied
the ‘‘We Can Do It’’ spirit forever con-
nected with the famous poster.
I am proud to recognize these home-
front heroes, especially my constituent
Mae Krier. Mae is 93. She is in the
Chamber with us today. She lives in
my hometown of Levittown, Pennsyl-
vania.
During the war, determined women
like Mae manufactured planes, ships,
tanks, weapons, jeeps, and everything
else that was needed to defeat the
enemy. Mae has said, ‘‘We worked, we
danced, and we slept on Sundays. Most
of all, we were duty-bound.’’
Mae has been dedicated to get the
real-life Rosies recognized for over 30
years. While this bill serves to get a
single medal to the important symbol
that is Rosie the Riveter, it truly is be-
stowing the honor and recognition on
the millions of women like Mae Krier.
I am proud to recognize these heroes
as an original cosponsor of H.R. 1773,
alongside Representatives SPEIER,
HUFFMAN, and now 289 of our col-
leagues. And I commend my fellow
Pennsylvanian, Senator CASEY, for in-
troducing this bipartisan bill in the
Senate.
This legislation is supported by the
Pennsylvania Veterans of Foreign
Wars, the Marine Corps League, the
Philadelphia Vietnam Veterans Memo-
rial Fund, among countless other orga-
nizations that represent our men and
women in uniform and our veterans.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in
the House and Senate to vote ‘‘yes’’ on
this important legislation so that we
can see these strong American women
honored by a Congressional Gold
Medal.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. DESAULNIER).
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my colleagues for their leader-
ship on this and my friend from Texas
for yielding.
I rise today as a proud sponsor of the
Rosie the Riveter Congressional Gold
Medal Act and thank my colleagues
again for their bipartisan leadership on
this bill.
During World War II, thousands of
women joined the war effort at the Kai-
ser Shipyards in Richmond, California,
now home to the Rosie the Riveter
World War II Home Front National His-
torical Park, as part of the National
Park System, where they produced
over 700 ships, the most productive
shipyards in history.
These brave and dedicated women
broke barriers by taking jobs as riv-
eters, welders, and electricians, forever
changing the role of women in the
workforce. They embodied the ‘‘We Can
Do It’’ motto.
Among them is Betty Reid Soskin—a
constituent, a friend, and a pillar of my
local community—who is now the Na-
tional Park Service’s oldest serving
ranger and works at the Rosie the Riv-
eter World War II Home Front National
Historical Park at the age of 98.
She has been instrumental in edu-
cating thousands of visitors about the
Rosies and sharing her experience as a
young Black woman working on the
home front.
I am so proud to have this important
piece of history in my district, and I
urge my colleagues to support this
tribute to the Rosies’ invaluable serv-
ice to this country.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, as I
have no more speakers on this bill, I
urge my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle to emphatically support this leg-
islation to give recognition to those
who stepped up and served our Nation
in such an important way during one of
the darkest times in our Nation’s his-
tory to ensure that we not only
brought home the victory, but we liber-
ated millions of those in oppression
and tyranny across the globe.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I am pleased to bring forward a bill
celebrating women from all walks of
life who, in difficult, dark days chose
to rise to the occasion and serve their
country. They did not let themselves
be confined to archaic notions of what
women can or cannot do, nor did they
let others dictate what a woman’s
place is in society.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8811
November 13, 2019
Let me remind my colleagues that
these Rosies were also Rositas, who
came from all parts of our country, in-
cluding our Hispanic community.
I would like to read from an inter-
view with Aurora Orozco, one of the
Rositas from Cuero, Texas, who laid
out how so many Latinas contributed.
‘‘In the valley there were these pack-
ing sheds where they packed tomatoes
and lettuce . . . there were not enough
men to work, so they started hiring
women. So that is when it started to
change a little more in women’s lives.
They were calling from the government
for women to go and work in the fac-
tories . . . then they started calling
women into the Army.
‘‘And first it was like, oh, my good-
ness, ‘dios mio,’ how can these women
go over there by themselves? Every-
body was shocked because we were not
used to seeing women leave the house.
You didn’t leave the house until you
were married. With senoritas, every-
thing was so strict and then came this
change . . . and I think that was won-
derful because it opened a new world
for women. It showed that women can
be independent. This was a real break
for women.’’
So let us honor the example these
women set and continue to blaze a path
for the working women of today and fu-
ture leaders of tomorrow.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting this important
piece of legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of
my time to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. SPEIER), the sponsor of
this legislation.
b 1400
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for giving me this op-
portunity to speak on this very impor-
tant bill.
Rosie the Riveters who are left in
this country deserve a Congressional
Gold Medal. In one of the most chal-
lenging periods of our American his-
tory, women stepped up to serve this
country. Six million women entered
the workforce for the first time during
World War II, offering to build weap-
ons, vehicles, and ammunition that
helped us win the war.
The critical contributions of Rosie
the Riveters changed the course of
world history and blazed a trail for to-
day’s working women. The Rosies
proved that they could work and suc-
ceed in jobs and industries that had
long been male-dominated. African
American women challenged stereo-
types and policies of discrimination to
contribute to the war effort. Because of
the Rosies, the U.S. Government
worked with businesses to develop sup-
port for working moms, like childcare
programs.
The famous image of Rosie the Riv-
eter, sleeves rolled up, muscles flexed,
and a bandanna in place, has inspired
generations of women and girls to em-
body the strength, patriotism, and ‘‘We
Can Do It’’ spirit that radiates from
the poster.
But even the iconic image can’t do
justice to the real-life Rosies who took
on the mantle of the war effort at
home, defied expectations, eradicated
barriers to women’s participation in
the workforce, and made victory pos-
sible. It has been one of the great hon-
ors of my career to work closely with
several of these women during my time
in Congress.
Phyllis Gould went to welding school
from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. every day for
weeks to get a job working at a ship-
yard in California. She was one of the
first women accepted into the boiler-
makers union. At 97 years old, Phyllis
still works tirelessly to make sure we
never forget the sacrifices and the hard
work that American women provided
during World War II.
Phyllis’ sister, Marian Sousa, went
to work at 17 years of age as a drafts-
man in the shipyards in Richmond,
California. Marian’s volunteer work at
the Rosie the Riveter World War II
Home Front National Historical Park
preserves the Rosie legacy for future
generations.
Mae Krier went to work at Boeing
Aircraft right out of high school, help-
ing to build B–17s and B–29 bombers.
Today, she is one of the foremost Rosie
advocates in the country, fighting for
recognition of the tremendous wartime
contributions of American women.
Betty Reid Soskin, park ranger at
the Rosie the Riveter World War II
Home Front National Historical Park,
worked as a file clerk in the boiler-
makers’ union hall. Today, she is the
oldest national park ranger in the
country, dedicated to bringing the
Rosies’ trailblazing legacy to life for
visitors.
These Rosies are true American
sheroes. It is long past time that they
and all the women who served on the
home front during World War II receive
recognition from the country for which
they sacrificed so much. I urge my col-
leagues to stand with us in honoring
our Rosie the Riveters with a Congres-
sional Gold Medal.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GAR-
CIA) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 1773, as amend-
ed.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

AMERICAN DIABETES MONTH
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize November as Amer-
ican Diabetes Month.
It is a personal issue for me, as I am
one of 30 million Americans living with
diabetes. This number is set to rise sig-
nificantly. There are an estimated 84
million Americans with prediabetes,
and it is the seventh leading cause of
death in the U.S. In addition, people
with diabetes are twice as likely to
have heart disease or a stroke.
The CDC estimates diabetes costs
this country almost $330 billion per
year.
I hope my colleagues can spread the
word about diabetes this month. We
need to do all we can to stop this dead-
ly disease.
f
NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP WEEK
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize this week as National Apprentice-
ship Week.
For over 80 years, the Registered Ap-
prenticeship system has been the gold
standard for workforce development
policy in the United States.
In 2017, President Trump signed an
executive order expanding the appren-
ticeship program, and since then more
than 500,000 people have entered the
program.
Apprenticeships that are registered
with the Department of Labor provide
participants on-the-job training and
classroom education, equipping them
with the skills needed to succeed in to-
day’s labor force.
With continued job growth in today’s
economy, I want to encourage more ap-
prenticeship opportunities. I intro-
duced H.R. 1774, the LEAP Act, which
incentivizes more employers to offer
the DOL Registered Apprenticeship
program through a new tax cut.
DOL registered apprenticeships also
come with incremental wage increases,
improved skills, career advancement,
enhanced retention, and increased pro-
ductivity.
I would like to thank all the busi-
nesses, employers, and the building
trades who have utilized these reg-
istered apprenticeships and encourage
more businesses in various fields to
participate.
f
CELEBRATING SIGMA GAMMA RHO
FOUNDERS’ DAY
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate
Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority’s Found-
ers’ Day.
Founded November 12, 1922, Sigma
Gamma Rho has been empowering
women to give greater service to their
communities and help bring about
greater progress in our society for
nearly 100 years.
We were first established at Butler
University in Indianapolis by seven il-
lustrious founders, all educators.
Today, we boast more than 100,000
members from more than 500 chapters
across the United States, Canada, Ber-
muda, the Bahamas, Korea, and Dubai.
Throughout our history, we have un-
dertaken work on many causes, includ-
ing Act Against AIDS; Operation
BigBookBag; the March of Dimes; St.
Jude; and Swim 1922, a partnership
with USA Swimming to increase diver-
sity and inclusion in the sport while re-
ducing drownings in our community.
I am proud to be the third Sigma
Gamma Rho elected to Congress,
alongside Congresswomen Lindy Boggs
and Corrine Brown.
Our membership also includes Alice
Dunnigan, the first Black female jour-
nalist accredited to cover the White
House and Congress; and Mary T.
Washington, the first Black female
CPA.
I want to give a special shout-out to
our International Grand Basileus,
Deborah Catchings-Smith.
Happy Founders’ Day, sorors. Greater
service, greater progress.
f
IN SUPPORT OF NATIONAL
APPRENTICESHIP WEEK
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, while
traveling across Pennsylvania’s 12th
Congressional District, our team con-
sistently hears from employers with
open positions about a skills gap of
trained labor.
Employers and individuals seeking
jobs should have every tool available to
fill open jobs needed with skills. That
is why celebration of National Appren-
ticeship Week is so important. Na-
tional Apprenticeship Week brings
awareness to the growing skills gap by
highlighting the benefits of apprentice-
ships.
Apprentices earn wages during on-
the-job training, while receiving in-
struction and having supervision from
a mentor. Apprentices also learn im-
portant soft skills like work attend-
ance, being a team player, and having
a positive work attitude.
Additionally, employers train stu-
dents in skills they need, often cre-
ating a direct pathway from training
to employment.
Apprenticeships have been working
across PA–12. Partnership opportuni-
ties exist between employers—includ-
ing energy developers and educational
institutions—to have apprenticeship-
like programs. Programs like these and
apprenticeships across the country
have proven to grow the economy,
lower student debt, and lead to family-
sustaining careers.
Please stand with me in support of
National Apprenticeship Week.

URGING SENATE TO SECURE DACA
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam
Speaker, over half of the people in my
district in Florida, including myself,
were born in another country. Over
8,000 of those immigrants are DACA re-
cipients who have lived here for many
years, some for decades, and have roots
in our community. They are entre-
preneurs, first responders, teachers,
community leaders, and servicemen
and -women. They are just as American
as any of us.
But today, DACA is at risk, leaving
our friends and neighbors terrified for
their future.
DACA recipients contribute billions
to our economy, and the economic con-
sequences for removing our working
DACA recipients would be cata-
strophic. But more importantly, we
would lose valued colleagues, friends,
and local business owners.
Protecting DACA recipients is not
just the right thing to do for our econ-
omy. It is the moral thing to do for us
and our country.
I urge the Senate to swiftly pass H.R.
6, the Dream and Promise Act, that we
sent them months ago to secure DACA
and our country’s future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8815
November 13, 2019
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, the
Founding Fathers understood the im-
portant role that our farmers and
ranchers would play in the construc-
tion of our great Nation, and Congress
has always played a pivotal role as a
friend to our agriculture community.
The USMCA is an agreement that
would strengthen trade relations with
two of our largest trading partners,
Mexico and Canada, and would give a
much-needed boost to the American
farmer.
In August of this year, I toured Mis-
sissippi with the Mississippi Farm Bu-
reau Federation. During these visits,
and in subsequent meetings, the Mis-
sissippi agriculture community has
consistently discussed the importance
of the USMCA and asked for its ap-
proval.
Unfortunately, the House majority
has chosen impeachment instead of
ratifying this trade agreement. The
majority is prioritizing a partisan po-
litical process over substantive policy
issues that would strengthen our coun-
try.
Madam Speaker, I ask that we focus
on the real work that needs to be ac-
complished this year and pass the
USMCA in support of our Nation’s
farmers and ranchers.
f
STANDING UP FOR DREAMERS
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of the thousands of
Dreamers in my district and the 800,000
Dreamers across the country threat-
ened with deportation due to the ad-
ministration’s decision to rescind
DACA.
It is unconscionable that our Dream-
ers are now at risk of being separated
from their families and removed from
the only country they know as home.
In addition to the sound economic,
educational, and moral arguments we
are hearing today, there is another ar-
gument for DACA, one that, as a doc-
tor, I know needs our attention. That
is the public health argument.
Doing away with DACA would mean
the U.S. could lose over 27,000
healthcare workers and support staff
around the country. At a time when we
can least afford it, we would lose
nurses, physicians, EMTs, and hospital
workers, people who have spent their
careers making our Nation healthier
and whose absence would bring our
public health great harm.
That is why I cosponsored, and the
House passed, H.R. 6, the American
Dream and Promise Act, so that 800,000
Dreamers who work, are in school,
have joined the military, or are work-
ing to improve our public health on a
daily basis can live without fear of de-
portation.
I urge Senate Majority Leader
MCCONNELL to stop playing games and
have a vote. Let’s get H.R. 6 passed.
SUPPORTING NATIONAL
APPRENTICESHIP WEEK
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support, as others have said,
of National Apprenticeship Week.
The Republican-led Congress and
President Trump jumpstarted Amer-
ica’s economy, making it the best in
the world. There has never been a bet-
ter time to enter the workforce. How-
ever, every time I am back in the dis-
trict, I hear about the need for skilled
workers.
That is why apprenticeships are abso-
lutely vital to developing America’s fu-
ture workforce. By connecting employ-
ers directly to their future workforce,
Americans have the opportunity to de-
velop technical skills while gaining
valuable work experience.
The numbers show just how success-
ful these programs are. Ninety-four
percent of those who complete an ap-
prenticeship program retain employ-
ment with an average salary of more
than $70,000.
I am proud that Georgia is leading
the way in career and technical edu-
cation and apprenticeships. For exam-
ple, in Lyons, Georgia, Chicken of the
Sea has invested millions in state-of-
the-art technology and helped train
our next generation of skilled workers
through their apprenticeship program,
creating even more jobs and promoting
economic opportunity throughout
Toombs County. We must continue
with this training.
f
MARKING 550TH ANNIVERSARY OF
BIRTH OF GURU NANAK
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker,
across central Virginia, our Sikh
neighbors are celebrating the 550th an-
niversary of the birth of Guru Nanak,
the first Sikh guru.
They are celebrating the man whose
teachings have shaped the core beliefs
of their families throughout the cen-
turies, and they are remembering Guru
Nanak’s unwavering commitment to
the plight of the poor, his push for
equality for all, and his fight against
discrimination.
Amid constant threats of invasion
and disease, Guru Nanak encouraged
his followers to focus on what united
their people, not what divided them. In
a world consumed by lies and deceit, he
taught them to pursue truth. While
others sought to destroy and disregard
the Earth’s resources, Guru Nanak
taught his followers to be responsible
stewards of the land.
In central Virginia, we have a warm,
vibrant, and strong Sikh community.
To them, I say happy Gurpurab.
I hope all of our district’s Sikh com-
munity members will have the oppor-
tunity to enjoy these special festivities
alongside family and friends, and I
thank you for your rich contributions
to our cultural, business, and faith
communities.
Together, we thank you for incor-
porating Guru Nanak’s principles of
generosity, grace, and compassion into
your daily lives. We are stronger be-
cause of you.
Madam Speaker, ‘‘Waheguru ji ka
Khalsa, Waheguruji ki Fateh.’’ Purity
belongs to the Creator, all victory be-
longs to Him.
f
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL
ADOPTION MONTH
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to call attention to National
Adoption Month.
On any given day in our country,
there are 440,000 children in the foster
care system, most for 2 to 5 years. This
holiday season, I encourage you to
open your heart to the possibility of
adopting a child. As an adoption attor-
ney, I can personally testify that you
can give no greater gift to a child with-
out a home than the security of a par-
ent.
Alternatively, foster care may be a
better option for you. My family had
the joy of fostering four beautiful chil-
dren over a 2-year period and simulta-
neously gave their birth parents the
chance to receive help to overcome
problems that led to their children’s
removal from their home.
Tampa Bay is blessed to have the
Gladney Center for Adoption, Catholic
Charities Adoption Services, Florida
Baptist Children’s Homes, Heart of
Adoptions Alliance, and others on the
front lines of this issue.
This National Adoption Month, think
of these kids as you sit at your
Thanksgiving table, when you shop for
Christmas, and, above all, when you
consider growing your family. They
need us.

RECOGNIZING JACK AND JILL OF
AMERICA EASTERN REGION
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
last month, I had the honor of meeting
with Jack and Jill of America’s East-
ern Region teen representatives.
For the past 80 years, the Eastern Re-
gion of Jack and Jill of America has
been impacting the lives of children by
making them civically engaged, chari-
table, and selfless leaders. The develop-
ment of this club allowed children to
come together in a close, social, and
cultural relationship with one another.
This organization provides a supportive
community for mothers, children, fa-
thers, and teens to assist in the posi-
tive transformation of not only the
communities but the country.

The Eastern Region is the largest in
the country with 56 chapters, and it
continues to provide innovative pro-
gramming in the new millennium. Be-
cause of the dedication of these indi-
viduals working with the region, the

STOP IMPEACHMENT SHAM
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker,
after several weeks in the secrecy of
the basement of this building, the im-
peachment process has moved upstairs,
and it doesn’t look a whole lot better
in the light of day.
Chairman SCHIFF has made it pretty
much a one-man show and continues to
deny a due process that you would nor-
mally see in a court of law, with bipar-
tisan input. In other modern impeach-
ment examples, you have seen input
from both sides. We are not seeing that
here. We have this really ugly display
going on of a partisan witch hunt
against President Trump.
Nothing has changed by coming up-
stairs. It doesn’t look any better under
the light of the cameras. The star wit-
nesses brought today, indeed, are not
stars at all. They weren’t even present
on the call between the President of
the United States and the Ukrainian
President.
Indeed, what we have is a sham. It
needs to stop because it is dividing our
country and dividing our ability to get
anything accomplished in this place for
the American people.
f
STOP PRACTICE OF TELE-
ABORTION
(Mr. WRIGHT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WRIGHT. Madam Speaker, the
right to terminate a pregnancy has be-
come framed as a woman’s health
issue, and yet, more and more voices
argue in favor of methods of abortion
that place a woman’s health at great
risk, such as tele-abortion, a means of
killing an unborn child by acquiring
abortion drugs and then being coached,
through telemedicine, on how to use
them.
Simple, except the woman taking the
drugs isn’t in a medical facility. No
medical personnel are present. If the
drugs don’t work as planned, and the
baby is not stillborn, it may still end
up in a dumpster, and the mother may
end up in an emergency room.
The obvious danger is why I have
filed the Tele-Abortion Prevention Act,
H.R. 4935. This is commonsense legisla-
tion, even more so when one considers
an FDA report that states that there
have been more than 4,000 cases of seri-
ous adverse events, including more
than 1,000 that required hospitaliza-
tion.
If the woman’s health argument is
really more than subterfuge that puts
dressing on a tragedy, please join me in
passing H.R. 4935, the Tele-Abortion
Prevention Act.

DREAMERS ARE AMERICANS
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs.
KIRKPATRICK). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the
gentleman from New York (Mr.
ESPAILLAT) is recognized for 60 minutes
as the designee of the majority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and include
extraneous materials in the RECORD on
the subject of my Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentleman from California
(Mr. COSTA).
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to talk about an important issue
affecting our country, and that is
Dreamers, many of whom are in Wash-
ington this week, fighting for their
lives in front of the United States Su-
preme Court.
Dreamers are Americans just like
you and me, and they should be treated
as such. When the Obama administra-
tion established the Deferred Action
for Childhood Arrivals, these were in-
fants from 6 months to 6 years of age
and anywhere in between. These
Dreamers came here through no choice
of their own, but for them, this is the
only country they have ever known.
They were qualified and granted,
under this program enacted by the
Obama administration, to be protected
from deportation and, thus, granted a
legal status.
Since then, these young people have
made immense contributions to our so-
ciety every day. They are our friends.
They are our neighbors.
But they have been betrayed by this
administration’s cruel policies toward
migrant communities, including the ef-
forts to repeal the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals, otherwise known
as DACA, and to dismantle the advance
parole initiative, which was a part of
this effort and allows Dreamers to visit
their loved ones in the event that there
is a wedding, a funeral, and some other
critical moments in their lives with
their families in the country that they
originally came from.
These cruel and shameless policies
have thrown the lives of these people,
most of them young, into chaos. They
live in fear every day, fear to see if
they will be removed, deported from
the only home that they have ever
known, from the only country they
really have ever known.
Living with this uncertainty is not
right. It is unfair, and it is unjust. It is
not the American way.
For 243 years, America has been a
beacon of shining light for immigrants
around the world. In this case, we made
promises to protect Dreamers. If the
Supreme Court rescinds these protec-
tions, I believe Congress must keep
fighting. I will keep fighting.
I know these Dreamers. I have visited
with them. They are in my schools, in
the community colleges, and in the
State universities.
b 1745
And so I want them to know, I want
you to know because these Dreamers
reflect and represent what? The Amer-
ican Dream.
What is the American Dream? The
American Dream is about immigrants
past and immigrants present, and it is
the embodiment of what Dreamers are
a part of.
So I ask my colleagues to join with
us this afternoon in standing up and
speaking out for those Dreamers.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I
yield to my colleague from California
(Mr. VARGAS).
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from New York
for yielding.
I rise today on behalf of hundreds of
thousands of Dreamers.
Yesterday, the Supreme Court heard
arguments over the future of Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals, or, as
you heard, DACA recipients. This deci-
sion will determine whether nearly
800,000 Dreamers will lose their legal
protections to live and work in the
United States.
The average DACA recipient came to
the U.S. as a young child and has
called our country their home for near-
ly 20 years. Denying their legal rights
or rescinding the promise made to
them 7 years ago would be immoral and
wrong. They are students, teachers,
first responders, entrepreneurs, and
community organizers who make our
country stronger and contribute to it
every day.
Approximately 27,000 DACA recipi-
ents are currently employed as
healthcare workers and support staff.
Rescinding DACA would be a direct
threat to the public health, as we heard
from our colleague, Dr. RUIZ. We rely
on these people. So, at this moment, it
would be a disaster to not give them
the legal status they need to remain in
our country.
DACA recipients and their house-
holds hold a combined $24.1 billion in
spending power each year. In addition,
DACA recipients boost Social Security
and Medicare through payroll taxes.
Many DACA recipients have com-
pleted high school, entered 4-year col-
leges and universities, and graduated.
College enrollment rates have dramati-
cally increased for DACA-eligible indi-
viduals, and completion rates have
skyrocketed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8817
November 13, 2019
Dreamers are our brothers and our
sisters and our neighbors. They don’t
know any other country as home. They
were brought here as children and,
many times, as infants.
They built their lives here since they
were little kids. They grew up here in
America learning our history and lov-
ing and celebrating our culture and
freedoms, just like any other Amer-
ican.
They work, they pay taxes, and, like
millions before, they dream of serving,
too. Turning our backs on them is
against our American values.
The choice is clear: We must keep
our promise to Dreamers. We must pro-
tect the dream and uphold DACA in the
highest court of the land.
We heard here very recently from a
friend on the other side how we should
open our hearts this holiday season to
children who need adoption, and he is
correct. At the same time, we should
open our hearts to these children who
came here, oftentimes, when they were
infants—no fault of their own; their
parents brought them here. They grew
up in our country. In fact, many of
them thought they were American citi-
zens until they became older.
Madam Speaker, in the words of our
great colleague who recently passed,
Elijah Cummings: We are better than
this. We are better than deporting
these children who have never known
another country other than our own.
We are better than this, and hopefully
the Supreme Court is better than this.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I
yield to my colleague from California
(Mr. CORREA).
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from New York
for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I want to correct
the record about Dreamers, who they
are in the United States.
I represent central Orange County,
home to the largest number of Dream-
ers in the United States. I will talk a
little bit about a few of the Dreamers
in my district.
The first one, Jose Angel Garibay,
who lived in my district in Santa Ana,
enlisted in the United States Marine
Corps. Jose was deployed to Iraq, and
in 2003 he was killed at the age of 21.
Jose was the first servicemember from
Orange County to make the ultimate
sacrifice.
Jose Angel Garibay, rest in peace.
Jose is a Dreamer.
Madam Speaker, I want to correct
the record about the Dreamers, who
they are.
Police officer Germain Martinez Gar-
cia grew up in southern Illinois. As an
intern, his hard work and positive atti-
tude set him apart and earned him a
slot in the local academy. Germain
Martinez Garcia is a valued member of
his team and his department. In the
words of his police chief: ‘‘He is part of
this community. He’s a good citizen.
He’s a good person. We need him.’’
Germain Martinez, a Dreamer.
Madam Speaker, I want to correct
the record about who Dreamers are.
They are lawyers.
Cesar Vargas grew up in Staten Is-
land in New York. He has served our
Nation in the Army. After law school,
Cesar passed the New York bar on his
first try in 2011. Then he applied for ad-
mission to the New York bar, but due
to his immigration status, he was de-
nied. It would take him 5 more years
before Cesar became the first Dreamer
admitted to the New York State bar.
Cesar Vargas, he is a Dreamer.
Madam Speaker, I want to correct
the record about Dreamers. They are
American soldiers.
John grew up in southern California.
John joined the U.S. Army, and on
March 18 of last year, he shipped out to
basic training. John wants nothing
more than to defend our country.
John is a warrior and a patriot. John
is a Dreamer. John, U.S. Army.
Madam Speaker, I want to correct
the record about Dreamers and who
they are: American soldiers.
James grew up in southern Cali-
fornia. James enlisted in the United
States Army. James’ goal is to protect
the United States of America because
he loves this country. James needs
DACA reform to ensure that he can
come home after being deployed to de-
fend our Nation.
James is a Dreamer. James is part of
the U.S. Army.
Madam Speaker, I want to correct
the record about who Dreamers are.
They are Harvard graduates.
Gloria Montiel grew up in the heart
of my district in Santa Ana. Gloria is
the first student from Santa Ana High
School to be accepted to Harvard. Glo-
ria was the first undocumented student
to receive a master’s degree from Har-
vard. Gloria was the first undocu-
mented Ph.D. candidate from Clare-
mont Graduate University.
Gloria Montiel is a Dreamer.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, as
the whip of the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus, I am pleased to lead this
monthly Special Order hour. It comes
at a critical time in America, a critical
time for our Nation and for the com-
munities that we represent.
Yesterday morning, Madam Speaker,
you may know that the Supreme Court
heard a case. They heard arguments on
Dreamers. This decision will determine
the lives of nearly 1 million young
Americans in the Supreme Court of the
United States, a million people who
were brought here at a very early age,
at a very young age, and have known
no other country but the United States
of America.
We have come to call them Dreamers
because they symbolize, in a quin-
tessential way, what the American
Dream stands for. They derived the
name from bipartisan legislation intro-
duced in 2001 by none other than the
former Republican president pro tem-
pore of the Senate, Orrin Hatch of the
State of Utah and DICK DURBIN of the
State of Illinois.
That legislation, which was reintro-
duced multiple times, would have
granted residency status to immi-
grants who came here as minors, as-
suming they had no criminal record
and had a high school diploma; and
they could become permanent residents
if they got a college degree or served
honorably in the U.S. military.
This proposal was seen as a critical
component of any comprehensive im-
migration reform and for many was
considered a low-hanging fruit, the
easiest thing we could all agree on,
both sides of the aisle. Opinion polling
of the American people bore that out.
In fact, we have seen poll after poll
after poll indicate that over 80 percent
of the American people, whether in red
States or blue States, support Dream-
ers.
In 2013, after the House Republican
majority flat-out refused to even con-
sider an overwhelmingly bipartisan
comprehensive immigration package
painstakingly negotiated, amended,
and, finally, approved by the Senate on
a healthy bipartisan vote, President
Obama looked at what his options
were, and he saw the very last deal was
this low-hanging fruit.
He used his administrative discretion
in enforcing immigration laws, a long-
standing authority used by Presidents
on both sides of the aisle, to create the
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
program, or the DACA program.
While the program couldn’t provide
permanent legal certainty, it did, es-
sentially, tell those who have been eli-
gible under the DREAM Act that, if
they came forward and followed var-
ious steps to ensure they met condi-
tions similar to those in the DREAM
Act, they would be granted relief from
deportation and issued documents al-
lowing them to remain and work le-
gally in the United States.
In essence, the Dreamers came for-
ward and shared their personal infor-
mation—their address, their date of
birth—they shared that with us, the
government. They were forward. They
were transparent in their approach to
share vital, personal, and confidential
information with the government.
The DACA program and the DREAM
Act were so popular and so important
because they are an example of who we
are and aspire to be as a nation, a na-
tion of immigrants, and it honors our
core principles such as basic fairness,
compassion, and common sense.
What is more, it is in our national in-
terest to keep DACA recipients here.
Between 2017 and 2027, DACA bene-
ficiaries are projected to contribute
$460 billion to the national GDP. They
pay $5.7 billion in Federal taxes and
$3.1 billion in State and local taxes, an-
nually.
Researchers estimate ending DACA
will cost the United States economy
anywhere from $283 billion to $460 bil-
lion over the next 10 years.
Our Nation also sees benefits from
the fact that many DACA recipients
are highly educated and skilled work-
ers. Ninety-six percent of DACA recipi-
ents are enrolled in school, and 75 per-
cent are pursuing a bachelor’s degree
or higher.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8818 November 13, 2019
27,000 DACA recipients are currently
employed as healthcare workers and
support staff. They are an integral part
of the healthcare industry across
America.
So it stands to reason that rescinding
DACA would do nothing but hurt the
economy, drain our businesses of
skilled and educated workers, and
threaten our public health system.
The reason the current case is mak-
ing its way through the courts is pre-
cisely because the Trump administra-
tion has been unable to substantiate
their reasoning for terminating the
program.
President Trump, himself, has said
on numerous occasions that he does
not want to deport DACA recipients or
so he says. In fact, two lower Federal
courts have placed injunctions in the
efforts to eliminate the DACA pro-
gram.
So there are a few things I believe we
must do. Most obviously—though, ad-
mittedly, unlikely—if the administra-
tion really does not want to send DACA
recipients to their place, a place that
they have never known, it should re-
scind its order or find other adminis-
trative means to give them certainty.
But even more importantly, Madam
Speaker, is that we change the law to
provide permanent certainty for these
young Americans.
And they are truly Americans: They
feel American; they have been here for
many years; and many of them, with
the exception of having their green
card, are very much part of the Amer-
ican fabric.
b 1800
I was proud to vote for the Dream
and Promise Act not too long ago when
it passed here in the House. And as the
only formerly undocumented immi-
grant in Congress, I was honored, deep-
ly honored to preside over its passage.
It is now on the Senate to act.
We heard the arguments yesterday in
the Supreme Court. We are hopeful
that the Court will be reasonable and
understand that these young people
have nothing but to give their sweat
and their work, their abilities to our
Nation.
Based on the vote just 6 years ago, it
is clear that H.R. 6 would pass if the
majority leader in the Senate, MITCH
MCCONNELL, brought it to a vote.
This legislation, a similar legisla-
tion, a lot more complex, more com-
prehensive in scope, was passed not too
long ago in the Senate in a bipartisan
way.
In the meantime, Democrats in the
House, we must continue to consider
other legislation that will help Dream-
ers. For example, the Education and
Labor Committee recently passed a
sweeping reform of our higher edu-
cation programs, the College Afford-
ability Act. That bill would make col-
lege more affordable and accessible to
Dreamers by making them eligible for
financial aid, Pell Grants, and other
kinds of financial assistance.
Besides, if we are encouraging
Dreamers to complete their education
in order to grant them legal status, the
least we can do is help them afford the
education.
There are numerous reasons to keep
Dreamers here and give them the cer-
tainty they need to succeed, the most
basic being that we have always been,
and will continue to be, a Nation of im-
migrants.
For the rest of this special hour, you
will hear from other colleagues in the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus who
will share their stories about why this
is critically important for the future of
America. In fact, I am compelled to
tell you that this is a fight for the soul
of America. But here I yield to them.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the
many groups who continue to serve our
constituents through their advocacy,
their legal assistance, their organiza-
tional skills, and their moral support,
groups like UnidosUS, United We
Dream, the Hispanic Federation, Make
the Road New York, faith-based
groups, labor unions, and countless
others. They are all shining examples
of what America stands for, and we
could not be successful in our work in-
side the Capitol without the work that
they do outside of the Capitol.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO), my
colleague.
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
ESPAILLAT), my dear friend, for yield-
ing.
You know, we had a rally a while ago
where I got to hear my dear friend
from New York talk about, as he was
addressing Dreamers, that they were
the tears of their grandparents, they
were the dreams of their parents, and
how generations led up to the moment
where their children can experience the
American Dream. And it really got to
me.
It was an emotional moment for all
of us, thinking about that story that
all of our families, other than our Na-
tive Americans, experienced at one
time or another, that someone had to
make a choice, someone had to cross
an ocean or a desert, or so many other
barriers to get here to the United
States.
You know, as we look at what the
Supreme Court, yesterday having their
oral arguments, is set to rule upon, it
is pretty clear that terminating DACA
would not be in the best interests of
the Sunshine State. It is pretty clear
that ending DACA would be bad for
Florida, President Trump’s new home
State.
When you look back, our State
passed in a bipartisan fashion in the
Florida legislature when I was there in-
state tuition for Dreamers. We also
passed a bill that I filed and was able
to pass to admit Dreamers to the Flor-
ida Bar, all defined as DACA recipients.
So in a State that many people refer
to as purple, being Democrats and Re-
publicans going back and forth on close
issues and in close elections, we came
together to protect our Dreamers.
So I hope as the Trump administra-
tion is examining their arguments and
working before the Supreme Court,
that they recognize that this wouldn’t
serve in Florida’s best interests.
In Florida, we have over 80,000
Dreamers, 30,000 of whom were DACA
recipients. I wanted to spend a few
minutes tonight talking about their
stories, about my constituents.
The first Dreamer I would like to
speak about, a DACA recipient, is Her-
man Younger, otherwise known as Her-
man to us affectionately.
Herman Younger grew up in the city
of Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Wanting to
give him and his sister a better life, his
family decided to migrate to Miami,
Florida, in 2002.
During this time, his parents in-
stilled in him a respect and curiosity
for the law. This led him to join the
Miami-Dade Police Explorers while in
high school.
In 2012, Herman applied for DACA,
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,
which allowed him to pursue edu-
cational opportunities post high
school.
After graduating, he moved to
Gainesville, Florida, where he studied
political science at the University of
Florida with a focus on ethics and
moral law.
During this time at UF, he joined the
College Democrats; prelaw fraternity,
Phi Alpha Delta; and Assembly for Ac-
tion, a conference that aims to build
community relations with local organi-
zations.
During his junior year, Herman in-
terned for our office in D.C., where he
helped draft a bill I introduced earlier
this year, the Artificial Intelligence
JOBS Act, otherwise known as AI
JOBS Act.
After his internship, Herman worked
not only on our campaigns, but
oversaw phone bankers and canvassers
as our district coordinator.
Herman has since graduated from the
University of Florida, receiving his
bachelor’s degree.
In May of this year, he spearheaded a
group advocating for restaurant work-
ers to unionize against unfair treat-
ment and pay, and now currently holds
a position with the Sierra Club as their
organizing representative for the
Wildlands Red Tide Campaign.
Herman continues to be an advocate
for other Dreamers and hopes to fight
the structural inequities and racism
stemming from colonization.
Another amazing DACA recipient, an
amazing Dreamer from my district is
Mariana Castro.
Mariana came to the United States
from Peru at the age of ten with her
mother, leaving her brothers and fa-
ther behind.
While her mother worked three jobs
to keep food on the table for her fam-
ily, Mariana excelled as a central Flor-
ida high school student. In tenth grade,
she realized that regardless of her ex-
cellent grades, involvement in hun-
dreds of community service hours, that

her undocumented status would impact
and potentially stop her academic ca-
reer.
Opportunity shined when DACA be-
came a reality a few months before her
graduation. She graduated from Cele-
bration High School in 2013, received
the highest academic scholarship in
the State, and chose the University of
Florida to be her home for the next 4
years.
At the time, even with DACA, she
was denied an in-state tuition rate in
college and her scholarship was re-
voked.
Mariana paused her education and
fought for the in-state tuition, that I
previously mentioned in my speech
here tonight, for undocumented stu-
dents in the State of Florida.
Her efforts came to fruition, as she
stood side by side with so many other
Dreamers when we finally passed the
in-state tuition bill for Dreamers 1
year later.
And what happens when we give
someone like Mariana an opportunity?
She returned to the University of Flor-
ida, where she graduated with a degree
in biological sciences this past May.
As a DACA recipient, Mariana was
unable to receive any state scholar-
ships, Federal aid, or loans.
While being a full-time student, she
worked 40 hours every week at res-
taurants to pay for her education out
of pocket.
During her college career, she in-
terned at my congressional office in
2018 and was later hired as a legislative
aid in the Florida Senate.
She also helped start university pro-
grams that provide visibility to un-
documented students, most recently
institutionalizing a training for profes-
sional staff about relevant immigra-
tion laws that affect the student body,
while raising funds for the Out of the
Shadows scholarship, a scholarship spe-
cifically for undocumented students in
Florida that she oversaw for 3 years.
Over the years, she received several
awards for her advocacy in the immi-
grant community, including being
named the only female Outstanding
Student Leader in her graduating
class.
Today, Mariana Castro serves as the
central Florida business manager for
Impact Fund, working to change public
policy around immigration through co-
alition building and bipartisan action.
Mariana plans to obtain a combined
JD and PP degree and continue to use
legislation and grassroots organizing in
order to fight for disenfranchised com-
munities in the Nation.
Also, as the Civil Rights Action Task
Force chair for the Congressional His-
panic Caucus, I wanted to talk a little
bit about the issues before the Supreme
Court.
We know, with the DACA program,
that the Federal Government created a
promise, a promise to these eventual
DACA recipients that their deportation
would be deferred, and it was for an ob-
vious reason: there are over 10 million
undocumented immigrants in the
United States, and these were the low-
est priority for deportation because
they were young people who came here
through no fault of their own, that
knew no other country other than this
one. And I can tell you, as we heard
from Mariana’s story and from Her-
man’s story, that they are indeed am-
bitious, and they are indeed contrib-
uting to our society.
So a promise was made to these
young people, and they relied on that
promise, to their detriment, by giving
their information to the Federal Gov-
ernment every 2 years periodically.
And then from there, the Federal Gov-
ernment should be estopped from being
able to use that to deport them, to sin-
gle them out in any way.
If the program is going to be wound
down, it should be wound down in an
ordinary and orderly fashion. And I
think those who are in the program
should at least be able to stay in the
program, or if not, not be targeted by
the Federal Government. So I think it
is right that the Federal Government
should be estopped from using this in-
formation to the detriment of these
young people.
Then we look at the reasoning, and it
is hard to see under either a rational
review or a higher scrutiny that the
court may apply, that there is enough
information to strike down this execu-
tive order. It was done through the or-
dinary process.
And now the reason they originally
proffered was simply that it was uncon-
stitutional. You know, that is the pur-
view of the Supreme Court. That is not
a reason for an administration to be
able to strike down a program. They
actually have to give a reason beyond
their own opinion that something is
unconstitutional. Of course, the Trump
administration didn’t do that in all
their procedures to try to end the law.
Then eventually in the appellate
courts, they tried to come up with
some statistics, come up with some
justifications after they had already
gone through the process, and now they
want to put the genie back in the bot-
tle. Now they want to say, ‘‘Well, our
rationale was given in the appellate
court, so we should be able to just use
that from the beginning,’’ and that is
not the way the process works.
Even then, it was the same
xenophobic misrepresentations that we
hear about these young people being
spouted to this day.
b 1815
Whether it is under estoppel or
whether it is simply under the court’s
scrutiny, I think it is pretty clear. We
hope the Supreme Court will decline to
end the program or, at the very least,
have an orderly termination of it, pro-
tecting these kids and stopping the
Federal Government from hurting
them any further.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BARRAGÁN), the second vice
chair of the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus.
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for having this
special hour and for all of his work.
As the Supreme Court deliberates
this administration’s attempt to end
the DACA program, it is easy for the
average American to see the term
‘‘DACA’’ as a case, a policy, a set of
immigration statistics, or a political
bargaining chip. But DACA is 700,000
living, breathing people who consider
America to be their home, the only
home most of them have ever had.
Over 8,000 of these DACA members
live in my district, and I consider them
amongst my most valued and vulner-
able constituents. They are our broth-
ers and sisters, our friends and school-
mates, our neighbors and workmates,
and, in my instance, my cousin. And in
my case, they are also dedicated and
talented interns working in both my
district office and right here in my
Washington office.
Irene Garcia-Brizuela is a DACA re-
cipient who has lived in the United
States since she was 10 years old. She
is earning her bachelor’s degree at Cal
State Dominguez Hills. She is a part-
time barista, as she is working hard in
my San Pedro office.
Even as a young girl, Irene dreamed
of working in our government. Very
sadly, she worries that interning for
me might be as close as she will ever
come because she can’t work for the
government she respects, reveres, and
pledges allegiance to without proof of
legal residency.
Juan Hinojos is an outstanding mem-
ber of my D.C. office as an intern. He
has lived in this country since he was 2
years old. Of course, it is the only
home he has ever known. When Juan
graduates Arizona State, he will be the
first in his family to do so.
Juan just spent two nights camping
out to be in line to get inside the Su-
preme Court so that he could witness
yesterday’s oral arguments, not only
as an observer wanting to witness his-
tory, not only as an appreciator of our
government in action, but as a partici-
pant whose fate may rest in the hands
of that moment.
These are just two examples of the
wonderful and meaningful contribu-
tions that all DACA recipients make to
our communities, our economy, our so-
ciety, and our American culture.
Our Nation made a promise to them
that if they work hard, study hard,
play by the rules, and follow the law,
they can become American citizens and
travel as far as their talents take
them. It is quite literally the promise
of America.
Madam Speaker, I want to say to
DACA recipients nervously awaiting
their fates: You are valued. You are ap-
preciated. You are loved. You belong
here.
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I
thank my colleagues for joining me
here today. I would like to reiterate
the important message that we are
here to support Dreamers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8820 November 13, 2019
This is not impossible, Madam
Speaker. In 2002, while I was a Member
of the New York State Assembly, the
lower house of the New York State
Legislature, we passed instate tuition
allowing undocumented college stu-
dents the ability to pay instate tuition.
We did that with a Republican Gov-
ernor and with a Republican-led Sen-
ate. Just last year, New York State
again passed the Jose Peralta Dream
Act.
So it could be done, Madam Speaker.
Just recently, I was speaking to a
group of Dreamers and advocates in
Battery Park, New York, having the
Statue of Liberty as a backdrop to our
rally. I told them to be cognizant of
what they are doing because, very
often, those who write history, those
who write the chapters and the annals
of history, are not aware that they are
doing it.
I asked them to pay close attention
to what they were doing because they
are, in fact, the protagonists. They are
the leaders of this movement. When
you see their faces, and you see what
they want to do for our country, it is
almost impossible to say no to them. I
told them to be very cognizant of their
effort because, in fact, they are an
army of goodwill.
They may not have weapons in their
hands, and they may not wear military
gear, but they are an army of goodwill
that I think is fighting every day for
the soul of America. And 20 or 30 years
from now, they will be able to tell their
children and grandchildren that they
were successful, that they were crit-
ical. They were the protagonists, the
leaders of a movement led by an army
of goodwill that saved America and
what it stands for.
Madam Speaker, we will continue to
call on our colleagues in the Senate to
take up and pass the American Dream
and Promise Act so that the lives of
over 800,000 Dreamers no longer hang in
the balance.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
f
IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. BYRNE) is recognized for 60
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader.
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, the
House of Representatives has been the
scene of serious chaos, not only today,
but for weeks.
Unfortunately for the American peo-
ple, we have nothing to show for it. We
have issued more subpoenas from this
House than we have had bills that have
actually been signed by the President.
We haven’t been working on the U.S.-
Mexico-Canada free trade agreement
that President Trump worked so hard
to negotiate. We haven’t been working
on funding the military or bipartisan
legislation to lower the cost of pre-
scription drugs. No, 100 percent of the
energy of this place has been devoted
to the impeachment of President
Trump.
There has been a lot of noise, a lot of
rumors, and a lot of confusion about
exactly what has happened and what is
going on, where we are and how we got
here. There is a reason for that.
You see, Madam Speaker, by House
rules, impeachment is under the juris-
diction of the Judiciary Committee.
The Judiciary Committee has a great
big hearing room just across the street.
That is where an impeachment inquiry
is supposed to take place. But we
aren’t holding hearings there because
Speaker PELOSI doesn’t want them
there.
Instead, the impeachment charade
has been taking place in a small, re-
stricted room, two floors underground,
below this Chamber, deep in the bowels
of the Capitol. That room is known as
the SCIF. The SCIF is a very impor-
tant room because it is where Members
of Congress hear about our country’s
great secrets. You can’t bring a cell
phone in there. You can’t bring a cam-
era in there. Most importantly, the
public can’t go in there.
Democrats made a big spectacle
about holding their first public hearing
today. They act as if they are making
some great, virtuous action to bring
forth transparency, as if they are oper-
ating with the utmost integrity. The
truth is that today’s hearing is little
more than a public showcasing of wit-
nesses they have already interrogated
and vetted in that little room to ensure
they will only say what the Democrats
desire.
You see, Madam Speaker, by con-
ducting impeachment in that little
room, Speaker PELOSI and ADAM
SCHIFF knew that the American people
wouldn’t know what was going on,
what was being said.
But right outside the SCIF, that tiny
room, you will find dozens of cameras
and news people. Here they are, you
can see, talking to ADAM SCHIFF.
ADAM SCHIFF and his staff have been
feeding these reporters bits of informa-
tion for weeks. For weeks, we have
been flooded with reports of so-called
explosive things that supposedly have
been said in this small, secret room.
Madam Speaker, there is a rule of the
House that every Member of Congress
has the right to at least watch a com-
mittee hearing. A couple of weeks ago,
some of my colleagues and I decided
that we wanted to know what was real-
ly going on in that small, little room.
So, we entered the SCIF, that little
room, simply to watch. ADAM SCHIFF
immediately stopped the proceedings,
and he refused to proceed until we left.
There is another rule of the House
that says the records of committees
are the property of the House, and
every Member is entitled to review
them. There is a reason for this rule.
Those records don’t belong to ADAM
SCHIFF. They don’t belong to Speaker
PELOSI. They don’t belong to me. They
belong to the American people.
So, again, I went back to the SCIF,
back to that little room. I showed
them that House rule and informed
them that I wanted only to read the
transcripts from these secret pro-
ceedings. But Chairman SCHIFF’s staff
said no. They would not follow the
rules of the House. They would not let
me read them. They said: You will get
them later, along with everybody else,
when we say so.
Finally, they started releasing the
transcripts—in a way that fit their
agenda. Madam Speaker, I have been
reading these transcripts as they come
out. I have also been reading what the
mainstream media has to say about
them. Would you believe it? The main-
stream media is saying exactly what
ADAM SCHIFF wants them to say. Al-
most none of them are talking about
the other side, about President
Trump’s defense.
To make sure the American people
have the facts, I felt compelled to come
down to the floor tonight to talk about
the things that, if you are not reading
these thousands of pages of materials,
you might have missed.
There have now been about 3,000
pages of testimony released. Despite
many different opinions of those pages,
there is universal agreement that
Ukraine is one of the most corrupt
countries on Earth. You see, Madam
Speaker, Ukraine, like many former
Soviet countries, is controlled by
oligarchs. These guys have almost all
the wealth, most of the industry, and
pretty much all the political power.
Corruption is so bad in Ukraine that
many American businesspeople refuse
to do business there because they don’t
want to deal with the notorious
oligarchs.
It has been the policy of Republican
and Democrat Presidents, for nearly 30
years, that Ukraine must end corrup-
tion, must adopt the rule of law, and
must take away power from the
oligarchs. You have had Ukrainian
Presidents come and go but, time and
time again, things seem to stay the
same.
During the 2016 Presidential election,
we know that senior members of the
Ukrainian Government were very much
on Secretary Clinton’s side. Don’t take
my word for it. You can pull this arti-
cle, which was written in the final days
of President Obama’s Presidency. You
can look at it yourself.
That is not some rightwing website.
That is Politico. It might be a little
hard to read, but here it says Ukrain-
ian ‘‘officials are scrambling to make
amends with the President-elect’’—
President Trump—‘‘after quietly work-
ing to boost Clinton.’’ The Ukrainian
Government was boosting Secretary
Clinton.
Thanks to ADAM SCHIFF’s Star Cham-
ber rules, we still have not gotten to
hear the President’s side of the story.
But it should come as a surprise to no
one, as some Democrats have pre-
tended, that President Trump did not
want to devote his valuable, limited

time by doing things like holding an
Oval Office meeting with the President
of Ukraine after facing stuff like this.
b 1830
Of course, a President not offering a
rare Oval Office meeting is not the
same thing as not providing United
States support. As most people know,
Ukraine has been at war with Russia
for about 5 years. Russia illegally in-
vaded Ukraine and still has forces
there today. President Obama rightly
began to give nonlethal aid to Ukraine
to help in that war. But President
Obama would not sell weapons to
Ukraine because he was scared that it
would upset the Russians.
It actually was, would you believe it,
President Trump who began selling
real weapons to Ukraine to help them
actually bring the fight to the Rus-
sians. That decision has had an enor-
mous positive effect on Ukraine. Even
those testifying in ADAM SCHIFF’s hear-
ings who don’t like the President have
praised President Trump for that.
But, again, it appears that most of
the issues that the Democrats are rais-
ing started with a few individuals in
the administration trying to convince
President Trump that we should forget
Ukraine’s past, embrace the new Presi-
dent of Ukraine, and put a serious
amount of his time into that country.
They began, in their own words, work-
ing to change President Trump’s mind
on Ukraine.
For weeks, we have been going back
and forth about what these individuals
may or may not have been doing. We
have a mound of bureaucratic gossip.
We have been calling it hearsay, but it
is gossip about what was going on, who
was doing what.
We have a lot of conflicting testi-
mony, speculation, and, yes, hearsay—
gossip—but the Democrats have pro-
vided zero, and I mean no, direct evi-
dence showing President Trump or-
dered some kind of quid pro quo. In
fact, they quit talking about quid pro
quo because they don’t have any evi-
dence of it.
With all of this testimony, with all of
these rumors, it is easy to forget that
this all goes back to the whistleblower.
Of course, we know that the whistle-
blower also lacked firsthand knowledge
of what he reportedly blew the whistle
on.
He was, according to the inspector
general, a partisan individual. So a
partisan individual who has no first-
hand knowledge filed a whistleblower
complaint and that is what we are
dealing with.
The whistleblower made allegations
that President Trump made demands
on President Zelensky in a phone call
that occurred in the White House on
July 25, but very few people in the
media have reported that President
Zelensky has publicly, clearly, and re-
peatedly denied any demands were
made on him.
They also have not reported that the
Justice Department, the Criminal Divi-
sion of the Justice Department, re-
viewed this allegation and declined to
pursue a criminal investigation. They
found no crime.
Nevertheless, President Trump took
the extraordinary step of releasing the
transcript of this supposedly extraor-
dinary call. You can read the entire
transcript online. I hope the American
people will do so because they won’t
find one demand in there. Not one.
Read the transcript.
Madam Speaker, the other issue that
has been swirling downstairs in that
little room is this hold that was placed
on security assistance to Ukraine and
apparently some other countries as
well.
We know that somewhere around
July 10, the Office of Management and
Budget placed a hold on certain foreign
aid going to Ukraine. That is not a
cancellation of funds. That is a process
allowing the funds to be reviewed.
Importantly, Madam Speaker, that
hold was placed before the phone call
that President Trump had with Presi-
dent Zelensky, the call that the whis-
tleblower raised.
But, Madam Speaker, something in-
teresting in the transcript was that
neither President Trump nor President
Zelensky said one word about the hold
on that call. One would think that if
President Trump were trying to use
the aid for extortion, he would have at
least mentioned it. One would have
also figured that President Zelensky
would have mentioned the issue him-
self, given how important this aid was
to his country.
The truth is, the reason President
Zelensky did not mention the funds
was because he did not know the funds
were on hold and President Trump
never told him.
Madam Speaker, this would be a very
strange quid pro quo where President
Trump did not tell President Zelensky
and President Zelensky did not know
that the funds were on hold.
In fact, it appears that the Ukrain-
ians first found out about the hold
when it was reported in the press on
August 29, over a month after the
phone call; never mind that the funds
were released 11 or 12 days later at the
latest, unconditionally.
But let’s talk about that hold. Many
of the witnesses have speculated about
why OMB placed a hold on the aid. But
when pressed, in all those thousands of
pages, they have all said some version
of: I don’t know why the aid was placed
on hold, or I think it was for this rea-
son, but I don’t really know.
Let’s just look at the facts. It seems
that most everybody has somehow for-
gotten that President Trump ran a
campaign on deep skepticism of foreign
aid. He asked some tough questions
that the American people appreciated.
Are we getting our fair share? Are the
Europeans freeloading off of us? Should
we be taking a second look at this?
So we have a new President, a new
parliament in Ukraine. Is it really that
surprising that an administration run
by President Trump would say: Let’s
take another look at this before we
send another $250 million out the door.
I think the American people would find
that pretty reasonable.
Again, Madam Speaker, we have a lot
of bureaucratic gossip here, a lot of
people standing around the water cool-
er somewhere in the White House; a lot
of speculation. But not one person has
testified they had any direct knowl-
edge that President Trump ordered the
aid be held in exchange for some kind
of political favor. Not one person.
In fact, the only witness who had any
form of serious contact with President
Trump, Ambassador Sondland, testified
that he called President Trump and
asked him what was going on with this
aid.
Almost nobody has reported it, but
here is a direct quote from that ex-
change. In this exchange, Sondland
talks about one of the Democrat wit-
nesses raising the rumor of quid pro
quo with him.
So Sondland called the President,
and here you see the President directly
told him: ‘‘There is no quid pro quo. No
quid pro quo.’’ That is the evidence
that is being introduced today and be-
fore today.
On top of that, we have Vice Presi-
dent PENCE meeting with President
Zelensky on September 1, and about 3
weeks later, you have President
Trump, seen right here in this picture,
you have President Trump with Presi-
dent Zelensky.
So, Madam Speaker, in closing, let’s
review. We have got a total sham proc-
ess, a real Star Chamber. The Star
Chamber, by the way, it actually was
something that grew up in the 17th
century in Great Britain, so that the
king, in order to squash his political
opponents, could have a closed hearing,
have his own rules, and then do what-
ever he needed to take the people who
were dissidents and squash them. That
is the Star Chamber that ADAM SCHIFF
has been running.
We have no evidence that President
Trump ordered any kind of quid pro
quo. None. No evidence. And the Demo-
crats have stopped talking about quid
pro quo because it isn’t working for
them. Because they don’t have the
facts.
The call transcripts show no demand.
President Zelensky says there was no
demand. And no evidence shows Presi-
dent Trump ordered a demand.
The Ukrainians got the aid money
within days of even finding out it was
on hold. And, finally, Madam Speaker,
they got the high-level meeting, not
only with the President of the United
States, but also with the Vice Presi-
dent that they wanted.
But here we are, Madam Speaker, so
many important issues falling by the
wayside with nothing getting done for
the American people.
We are going to run out of money to
run the government in about a week
and we have done nothing about it.
The Constitution makes clear that
impeachment is an acceptable redress

only for, let me quote it: ‘‘treason,
bribery, or other high crimes and mis-
demeanors.’’ Nothing less.
I think my friends on the other side,
unfortunately, they get up here in
Washington, and they forget that al-
though they may not like this Presi-
dent, he was chosen by the American
people as the leader of this country.
I am sorry, Madam Speaker, they
must do much better than offering the
American people some hearsay and bu-
reaucratic gossip if they want to take
this President down.
The truth is this about removing the
President: They know that the votes in
the Senate aren’t there for that. The
Senate is not going to remove Presi-
dent Trump from office. It is not hap-
pening.
This is about satisfying the Demo-
crat’s desire to play to their resistance
base, the people who said the day after
the election in 2016 that they wanted to
impeach Donald Trump.
The whistleblower’s lawyer wrote
that he wanted a coup in January of
2017.
This is also about trying to build up
a case for defeating President Trump in
the 2020 election. The impeachment
process is not supposed to be used for
that. We have campaigns for that. We
raise money to do that. We don’t use
this body for that.
This entire process from its very in-
ception has been a hypocritical, shame-
ful exercise in partisan political oppor-
tunism. There is no substance here.
None of President Trump’s actions
even approach anything remotely near
impeachable conduct.
But Democrats have made a critical
error in orchestrating their scheme. If
you watched what happened today,
most of it was boring, and the reason it
was boring is because there is no there
there.
The Democrats have misunderstood
and underestimated the resolve of the
American people that elected this
President. The facts are on the Presi-
dent’s side, and we will rise to the oc-
casion and fight back against this rad-
ical scheme to remove President
Trump.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

WE ARE THE HOPE OF THE SLAVE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) for
30 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And I rise tonight
with love of country and heart inspired
by ‘‘Harriet.’’ ‘‘Harriet,’’ the movie.
I saw the movie, ‘‘Harriet,’’ and I was
inspired to speak tonight because of
some of the horrors associated with the
movie. There were some high points in
the movie, but the movie is about a
person born into slavery, a person who
had been given the promise of freedom,
freedom that was denied.
Inspired by this movie, I rise. I also
would rise because I am inspired by the
poem Maya Angelou left us, the poem
that allows us to express some of the
reasons why I am here in this Congress,
if you will.
In this poem in the last stanza, she
leaves us these words:
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
The dreams and hopes of the
Harriets, the dreams and hopes of those
who were able to survive the journey
across the ocean; those who were able
to survive and not be lynched; those
who were able to survive Jim Crow
laws, and Bull Connor’s dogs.
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise.
I rise.
I rise.
I am proud that Maya Angelou gave
us this poem, because it gives us some-
thing to believe in. We are the hope of
the slave. There are many of us.
I am not the only one, but I rise to-
night. I rise because I am the bene-
ficiary of people who lived and died so
that I might have this moment.
I am not supposed to be in Congress.
People lived and died, people who sur-
vived German Shepherds, and high-
pressure water hoses.
b 1845
I am the beneficiary of people who
fought in a war, a war for freedom. And
in that war for freedom, some 600,000
Americans lost their lives.
Most people believe that World War
II claimed the most American lives—
not so. Nor did World War I, nor the
Vietnam war—not so. It was the Civil
War that claimed the most lives of
Americans, a war fought so that I
might have the privilege of standing
here today.
I don’t say to you that that is what
was in the minds of the people, but the
liberation of a people has metamor-
phosed into this opportunity.
So I rise understanding that, in that
war, there were some African Ameri-
cans. Then, they were known as col-
ored troops. Some 30,000 colored troops
died, and still I rise knowing that oth-
ers made a sacrifice.
And I am here tonight to talk about
the bigotry that still exists in this
country. Bigotry is on the rise in this
country, and we, the Members of this
House, have acknowledged it, and we
are responding to it. We have re-
sponded to it with hearings:
Tuesday, April 9, 2019, hearing styled,
‘‘Hate Crimes and the Rise of White
Nationalism’’;
Wednesday, May 8, 2019, hearing
styled, ‘‘Confronting the Rise of Do-
mestic Terrorism in the Homeland’’;
Wednesday, May 15, 2019, hearing
styled, ‘‘Confronting White Supremacy
(Part I): The Consequences of Inac-
tion’’;
Tuesday, June 4, 2019, hearing styled,
‘‘Confronting White Supremacy (Part
II): Adequacy of the Federal Re-
sponse’’;
Wednesday, September 18, 2019, hear-
ing styled, ‘‘Meeting the Challenge of
White Nationalist Terrorism at Home
and Abroad’’;
September 20, 2019, hearing styled,
‘‘Confronting Violent White Suprem-
acy (Part III): Addressing the
Transnational Terrorist Threat.’’
These are some of the hearings that
we have had in our response to the rise
of bigotry, to the rise of hate, white su-
premacy, anti-Semitism, all of the var-
ious invidious discrimination that we
find ourselves having to deal with—
Islamophobia, xenophobia,
homophobia, all of the invidious pho-
bias that we have to contend with.
We are responding, and we are re-
sponding because this hate has to be
dealt with. Those who ignore invidious
discrimination, those who ignore hate,
those who ignore racism—all of the
various phobias that I have called to
your attention—perpetuate these var-
ious forms of invidious discrimination.
We perpetuate when we ignore. When
we tolerate, we ignore. I rise tonight
because we cannot ignore the hate. We
have to stare it down. We have to take
it on. I must do so because I am the
hope of the slave, the many who suf-
fered.
I have been given this opportunity,
and it would be a waste, a wasted op-
portunity, if I but only came to this
Congress and took on the issues of our
day, the issues du jour, and ignore this
issue.
Other issues are important. I don’t
put them aside. But this issue cannot
be ignored. To ignore it would be a be-
trayal of those who suffered so that I
might be here. It would be a slap in the
face to those who died so that I might
have this opportunity.
So I take advantage of the oppor-
tunity that has been afforded me, not
necessarily because I want to, but be-
cause I have to. I don’t have a choice.
And as long as I am in this Congress, I
am going to be the reminder. I am
going to be the conscience for those
who have suffered. I will not back
down.
And tonight, I want to ask the ques-
tion: Why do more than 51 percent of
American voters think that the Presi-
dent is a racist?
This is printed. This is information
available.
Yes, in this country, the greatest
country in the world—the country that
stands for liberty and justice for all;
the country with government of the
people, by the people, for the people;
the country wherein no one is above
the law—in this country, 51 percent of
American voters believe that the Presi-
dent is a racist.
Why would 51 percent believe that
the President is a racist?
This makes people uncomfortable to
hear me stand in the well of the House
of Representatives and talk about the
racism emanating from the Presidency.
It makes people uncomfortable.
People want to get back to bigotry as
usual, when bigotry is something that

we confront on an as-needed basis, but
not anything that we seek to end, big-
otry being something that we read
about, that we hear about, but we don’t
have to do anything about.
No, we have to do something about
it.
So the question: Why would 51 per-
cent—more than 50 percent—of the
American voters believe that the Presi-
dent is a racist?
Could it be because at the time he
was promoting an immigration policy
he called countries in Africa, countries
where people of color are predominant,
could it be because he called them s-
hole countries?
I don’t use scatology. I never use pro-
fanity—I should correct myself. I never
speak profanity. There are times when
I do think it. And I am told that, as a
person thinks, so is the person, but I
never say it. I respect those around me
to the extent that I don’t use sca-
tology.
But the question is: Why do people
think that the President is a racist?
One answer is: Could it be because he
has infused bigotry into policy?
When he was negotiating this policy,
immigration policy, he made this com-
ment and thereafter promulgated a pol-
icy—or attempted to—that would limit
persons coming from countries of color,
would limit them access, and open ac-
cess to persons coming from countries
predominated by Anglos.
Could it be because he launched a
travel ban against Muslims? Is this
why more than 50 percent of the Amer-
ican public believe that the President
is a racist, a travel ban based upon reli-
gion?
In this country, we appreciate and
celebrate freedom of religion. If you
can ban one, where is the line? Where
must you stop?
The ban was initially shot down.
After some tweaking, this policy was
implemented.
This President is thought by more
than 50 percent of the American pub-
lic—that is my refrain—to be a racist.
Could it be because he attacked a
Muslim Gold Star family, the parents
of a Muslim who served in our mili-
tary, who gave his life for our country?
Could it be because he would attack
this family, a Muslim family?
Could it be because he claimed that a
judge was biased against him and said
that he is a Mexican? Could it be be-
cause he believes that he cannot get
justice from a person of color?
More than 50 percent of the American
voters believe that the President is a
racist. And if I said ‘‘people’’ before, I
correct the RECORD here and now. It is
voters.
Could it be because the Justice De-
partment sued his company twice for
not renting to Black people? The Presi-
dent of the United States, having been
sued for not renting to people of color,
maybe this is a reason that more than
50 percent of the American public be-
lieve that the President of the United
States of America is a racist.
Uncomfortable to hear, not pleasant,
but it is the truth. And it is written
that, if you know the truth, the truth
will set you free. I hope to free some
souls tonight.
Could it be because he refused to con-
demn the white supremacist who advo-
cated for him? He didn’t say: ‘‘White
supremacist, I don’t want your sup-
port,’’ didn’t condemn white suprem-
acy and white supremacists.
Could it be because he questioned
whether the only African American to
become President of the United States
was born in the United States? Could it
be because he carried that message
near and far?
He was almost proud to take on the
challenge of questioning the nation-
ality of the Black President of the
United States. And since he has be-
come President, it seems that he has
tried to undo the legacy of the African
American President.
Could it be because he took out a
full-page ad advocating the death pen-
alty for those who were charged in
what is known as the Central Park
Five, a horrible case? Someone did un-
godly things to a young woman in Cen-
tral Park. Five persons of color were
taken into custody. He took out a full-
page ad and was an advocate for the
death penalty.
Could it have been done because of
principle? Let’s give him the benefit of
the doubt for the moment. But later
on, it was proven that the five did not
commit the crime—not based on a
technicality; based upon DNA evidence.
The President never apologized—
stood his ground. As a matter of fact,
he hasn’t apologized for any of the
things that I have called to our atten-
tion tonight. He does not apologize. He
does not repent. He does not say ‘‘I am
wrong; I made a mistake’’—something
that I do more often than I would like
to, but I make mistakes. He doesn’t
apologize.
Five people incarcerated, but five
people liberated based upon evidence—
no apology, no retraction from the
President.
Could it be because he has condoned
the beating of a Black Lives Matter
protester?
Could it be because he has stereo-
typed Jews and shared an anti-Semitic
image created by white supremacists?
Could it be because he has been sanc-
tioned by the U.S. House of Represent-
atives for his racist comments directed
at Members of Congress?
There are many reasons to be dis-
cussed, but we have to acknowledge
that, with all of this evidence and with
our moving forward on impeachment,
with all of this evidence, should we not
consider the impeachment of this
President as the Radical Republicans—
as they were called, but they were Re-
publicans—did in 1868 with Andrew
Johnson?
b 1900
Republicans impeached Andrew
Johnson in article X—for those who
care to read the articles, article X of
the XI Articles of Impeachment
against him.
Republicans impeached Andrew
Johnson for reasons rooted in his big-
otry. He was the President Trump of
his time.
Andrew Johnson did not want the
freedmen and -women to have the same
rights and privileges as other Ameri-
cans. He fought against this. He fought
the Freedmen’s Bureau. He did not
want them to be accorded freedom—the
Harriet Tubmans of the world to have
their freedom.
Andrew Johnson was the bigot of his
time, but the Republicans took a
stand. The Republicans took the moral
high ground.
When you are standing on the moral
high ground, you have a moral impera-
tive to go forward. And they did. And
the Republicans impeached Andrew
Johnson. I admire the Republicans of
1868. I believe that what they did was
right. And, more importantly, it was
the righteous thing to do. I am a per-
son who stands with what they did.
There are those who would say,
‘‘Well, that was 1868.’’
Well, the Constitution hasn’t
changed. It was based upon the same
Constitution that we read, the same
Article II, Section 4 that we have used
for our impeachment going forward
currently—same articles. Nothing has
changed.
You can’t conclude that what they
did in 1868, when they were closer to
those who framed the Constitution
than we are today, had a greater sense,
perhaps, of what—if you measure your
sense of what was available by your
nexus to those who made it available—
they were following the Constitution.
We should follow the Constitution.
We have a duty and a responsibility to
the Harriets of the world to not allow
this level of bigotry to continue to em-
anate from the Presidency.
Impeachment is moving forward. I
had said months ago that the President
would be impeached. I repeat only what
I have said then when I close with: He
will be impeached. The hands of his-
tory will record that President Donald
John Trump was impeached by this
House of Representatives.
And for those who say that I have al-
ready made up my mind, you are cor-
rect. I have, because the evidence is ap-
parent, and there is no requirement
that I must wait until we have had sub-
sequent hearings.
He will be impeached. And I believe
that we ought to add articles that in-
clude his invidious discrimination
harmful to this society.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2019 No. 181
Senate
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal God, hear us when we cry to
You. You have been our help in ages
past and our hope for the years to
come.
You don’t keep a record of our trans-
gressions but shower us daily with
mercy and forgiveness. Great is Your
faithfulness.
As our Senators wait for the unfold-
ing of Your powerful providence, give
them Your peace. Lord, may they cling
to Your promises knowing that You
will lead them to a desired destination.
Give them the wisdom to trust Your
unconditional love and Your willing-
ness to save those who call on Your
Name.
We pray in Your mighty Name.
Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak for 1
minute as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, No-
vember is National Adoption Month.
This year, we have very good news.
In 2018, over 63,000 young people were
adopted from foster care. That is an in-
crease of 4,000 from the previous year.
However, the number of children wait-
ing for adoption also increased. That
number rose to 125,000. Unfortunately,
teenagers, sibling groups, and those
with medical challenges often wait
much longer to be adopted. Every child
deserves a safe, permanent, loving
home, so I want to commend all those
who have chosen to adopt children in
foster care.
If you wonder where I get the opinion
that it is unfortunate that people want
a permanent, safe, and loving home, all
you have to do is listen to the kids in
the foster care system, and you always
get this response: What I would like to
have is a mom and dad, and I would
like to have a home. In other words,
they get tired of being shuffled around
from one foster home to another foster
home, to another foster home. That is
where I come from in recognizing No-
vember as National Adoption Month.
I yield the floor.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
NOMINATION OF STEVEN J.
MENASHI
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President,
after we confirm Chad Wolf to serve in
a senior position at the Department of
Homeland Security, the Senate will
turn to President Trump’s nominee to
serve on the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals.
Steven Menashi’s nomination con-
tinues an already distinguished career
studying, teaching, and practicing law.
After earning degrees from Dartmouth
and Stanford, he clerked for Judge
Douglas Ginsburg on the DC Court of
Appeals and Justice Alito on the Su-
preme Court. Mr. Menashi has held a
research fellowship at the New York
University School of Law and taught
at George Mason University’s Antonin
Scalia Law School.
Even the American Bar Association’s
Standing Committee on the Federal
Judiciary, which has lately—lately
made headlines for treating President
Trump’s nominees in a less-than-even-
handed way, has rated this nominee
‘‘well-qualified.’’
Obviously, a majority of our col-
leagues on the Judiciary Committee
concurred, and now the entire Senate
will have the opportunity to confirm
yet another outstanding jurist to the
Federal bench.
I urge each of my colleagues to join
me in supporting Steven Menashi’s
nomination this week.
f
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now
on another matter, today President
Trump will host the leader of Turkey
at the White House. Although I have
expressed concerns about granting
President Erdogan such an honor in
light of his recent actions, I hope the
meeting produces better behavior from
this important NATO ally.
We recognize Turkey’s legitimate na-
tional security concerns about the de-
stabilizing conflict in Syria. Indeed, no
NATO ally has suffered more terrorist
attacks or hosts more refugees than
Turkey. Nevertheless, we have legiti-
mate national security concerns of our
own, and I know the vast majority of
my colleagues share my concerns about
Turkey’s recent behavior.
It is important for the region and the
fight against ISIS that Turkey’s incur-
sion into Syria not further jeopardize
the anti-terrorism campaign of the
Syrian Democratic Forces. It is impor-
tant for Turkey’s 80 million people
that Turkey’s Government moves to
restore its democratic traditions—free-
dom of the press, religious freedom, re-
spect for secularism and ethnic minori-
ties, and a robust space for civil soci-
ety. Despite the optimism from the

Obama administration and others that
Turkey, under President Erdogan,
would be a model democracy, in prac-
tice, these important values have suf-
fered under his tenure.
As the Turkish people’s concern con-
tinues growing, it is troubling that the
political space for them to express
those concerns has seemed to shrink
further. At the same time, the United
States must recognize that the path to
addressing our concerns involves work-
ing with this important NATO ally and
aligning its interests with ours.
Turning a cold shoulder altogether
would be a major strategic misstep and
would jeopardize our national security
and our interests. We do not need Tur-
key to fall further into Moscow’s orbit.
I know my colleagues are looking to
see whether a deal can be reached on
the S–400 air defense system.
I share my colleagues’ uneasiness at
seeing President Erdogan honored
down at the White House, but I urge
this body to remain clear-eyed about
our Nation’s vital interests in the Mid-
dle East and the fact that advancing
them will mean strengthening our rela-
tionship with this NATO ally, not
weakening it further.
f
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
one final matter, today, almost 3 years
in the House Democrats’ quest to im-
peach the President and 7 weeks into
the inquiry that Speaker PELOSI pro-
claimed in a press conference, House
Democrats will hold their first public
hearing on impeachment.
This hearing was mandated by the
strange resolution House Democrats
passed a couple of weeks ago. That res-
olution did not provide President
Trump with important rights, which
the House afforded to Presidents of
both parties during past impeachment
inquiries. It didn’t even afford their
own House Republican colleagues the
same rights that House Republicans
gave Democrats during the Clinton in-
quiry. No; House Democrats’ resolution
just codified their unfair approach: no
due process now, maybe some later, but
only if we feel like it. That is what it
establishes.
The American people know that
many Washington Democrats have had
their minds made up on impeachment
for years. It was clear on election day
2016, and it became undeniable by Inau-
guration Day. That is when the Wash-
ington Post, before he was sworn in,
ran this headline: ‘‘The Campaign to
Impeach President Trump has Begun.’’
The whole country saw a prominent
House Democrat state publicly in April
of 2017: ‘‘I’m going to fight every day
until he’s impeached.’’ That is the
chairwoman of one of the committees
the Speaker has given responsibility
for this inquiry, promising impeach-
ment 3 months into his Presidency.
It is hardly surprising that this par-
tisan journey is not yielding a neutral
process. Unfortunately, it is also
crowding out important legislation for
the American people. In the House,
Speaker PELOSI is more interested in
taking away President Trump’s job
than in creating 176,000 new jobs for
American workers by passing the
USMCA. She is blocking this landmark
trade agreement.
In the Senate, our Democratic col-
leagues have filibustered the funding of
our Armed Forces. Despite promising
to forgo the poison pills a few months
back, Democratic leadership has run
the appropriations process aground so
they can fight over immigration policy
with the White House.
Speaking of our Armed Forces, House
Democrats are also slow-walking the
National Defense Authorization Act.
That is an essential bill that Congress
has passed every year—every year
since 1961 like clockwork—every year,
on a bipartisan basis, for almost six
decades, but this year House Demo-
crats broke with precedent and passed
their own partisan version and are now
stalling the conference committee.
These are the priorities that are lan-
guishing as impeachment marches on.
f
MEASURE PLACED ON THE
CALENDAR—S. 2840
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
understand there is a bill at the desk
that is due for a second reading.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will read the bill by title for the
second time.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A bill (S. 2840) to authorize appropriations
for fiscal year 2020 for military activities of
the Department of Defense, for military con-
struction, and for defense activities of the
Department of Energy, and for other pur-
poses.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in
order to place the bill on the calendar
under the provisions of rule XIV, I ob-
ject to further proceedings.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be
placed on the calendar.

IMMIGRATION
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if mem-
bers of the American public came to
the Senate Chamber this week to wit-
ness legislative activity, such as a
piece of legislation on the floor,
amendments, debate, votes, delibera-
tion, or compromise, they are out of
luck. We don’t do that in the Senate
anymore. We are not going to do it this
week; we didn’t do it last week; and we
didn’t do it the week before.
Now, the Republican leader just said
the problem is impeachment. The prob-
lem is not impeachment. The problem
is the Senate is not a Senate anymore.
All we do in the Senate—all we do in
the Senate is this serial list of judicial
nominations, one after the other, after
the other, after the other. That is it.
We don’t take up legislation.
Yesterday there was a—right across
the street from this Capitol Building,
in front of the Supreme Court, hun-
dreds of people were there because of a
hearing in the Supreme Court on the
issue of DACA, which was created by
President Obama, where 780,000 un-
documented young people had a chance
to stay in this country and was abol-
ished by President Trump. Hundreds
came out yesterday. They wanted to
hear—at least try to hear the Supreme
Court deliberations on their future and
what would happen to them.
It is quite possible that the Court
will rule in the President’s favor. I
hope not, but it is possible, and the fu-
ture of these young people will be de-
portation. You can imagine how they
feel about this issue. They look back
over here at the Capitol and they won-
der: What are they doing in the U.S.
Capitol building to deal with an issue
of such grave importance for such a
large group of people in the United
States? Here’s what we are doing:
Nothing—nothing.
The House of Representatives passed
the American Dream and Promise Act
in the month of June, and the U.S. Sen-
ate and Senator MCCONNELL will not
let us bring it to the floor. Is he going
to blame the impeachment proceedings
for the fact that we have waited 5
months now with this critical bill, hav-
ing passed the House, not even being
considered in the U.S. Senate? Is that
the reason we haven’t been able to take
up serious legislation for weeks in the
U.S. Senate? Of course not. It is not
about impeachment; it is about a strat-
egy designed by the Senate Republican
leader not to entertain substantive leg-
islation—just to take up the issues of
nominations.
The nominations, of course, are an
issue themselves. I mentioned the judi-
cial nominations. Well, last week in
the Senate Judiciary Committee, we
had the ninth Trump nominee for the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6517
November 13, 2019
Federal bench who had been found un-
qualified by the American Bar Associa-
tion. That is nine so far. You say to
yourself, well, that must happen from
time to time. It never happened one
time under President Obama; not one
nominee was judged unqualified. There
are nine of them under President
Trump. Why? Because this administra-
tion, with the cooperation of Senator
MCCONNELL, is hell-bent to fill these
vacancies, regardless of the com-
petency of the individual who is being
nominated.
On the calendar today is another
nomination. Today the Senate is going
to vote on the nomination of Chad
Wolf. This is technically a vote for Mr.
Wolf to be the Department of Home-
land Security’s Under Secretary for
policy.
Let’s be clear. This is actually a vote
on whether Mr. Wolf would run the en-
tire Department of Homeland Security.
He would be the sixth Secretary in
charge of this critical agency, the De-
partment of Homeland Security—the
sixth one since President Trump was
elected. Talk about a fast-moving, re-
volving exit door. You can hardly get
your desk put together with a few pens
and computers on top of it; then, with
President Trump, you are out the door
if you are the Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security.
Next up is Chad Wolf. The President
has indicated he is going to appoint
him, not as the Secretary of Homeland
Security—no, the Acting Secretary of
Homeland Security. But he first has to
be confirmed as an Under Secretary.
The Trump administration has shown
in their immigration policy an ap-
proach to this issue that we haven’t
seen for decades in Washington or the
United States. The President has been
especially harsh when it comes to fami-
lies and children. President Trump’s
ineffective policies have made our
southern border much less secure than
when he took office. The situation has
even been worsened by this gaping
leadership vacuum in the Department
of Homeland Security. In less than 3
years, there have been four heads of
the Department. Wolf would be the
fifth person—I said six earlier, sorry—
to run it and the third Acting Sec-
retary. Every position at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security with re-
sponsibility for immigration is now
held by a temporary appointee ready to
be fired at a moment’s notice, and the
White House is not even submitting
nominations for those positions. This
is a conscious choice by the Trump
White House to increase their power
and to undermine the role of the U.S.
Senate, and the Republican majority
thinks it is just fine.
The President has boasted about all
of his Acting Secretaries. He even has
an Acting Chief of Staff. Donald Trump
said: I like acting. It gives you great,
great flexibility.
It sure does. You can just fire a per-
son and call the next up in a moment,
in a matter of days.
Stephen Vladeck, a leading expert on
the Senate’s confirmation process,
notes that the President’s approach is
‘‘depriving the Senate of its constitu-
tional role—and in the process, of op-
portunities to vet his nominees, to re-
ject those who are unqualified, and to
conduct meaningful oversight of the
executive branch.’’
So what does the Senate institution-
alists and the Senator from Kentucky
think about diminishing the roles of
the Senate? Just fine, Mr. President,
whatever you want.
Today, the Senate will actually have
a chance to vote on this individual,
Chad Wolf, to become an Under Sec-
retary on his quick path to become an
Acting Secretary on his even quicker
path to be in some way retired or fired.
So is Chad Wolf the right person to
run the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, one of the most important law en-
forcement agencies? His main quali-
fication appears to be that he was Chief
of Staff and top adviser to former Sec-
retary Kirstjen Nielsen.
I would say that arguably she may
have been one of the worst performing
Homeland Security Secretaries ever in
our history. It was Kirstjen Nielsen
who falsely claimed, ‘‘We do not have a
policy of separating families at the
border.’’ Then came along the Federal
judge in Southern California and de-
manded an accounting of what actually
was going on at the border. Do you
know what the judge found after he de-
manded that the Department of Home-
land Security under Kirstjen Nielsen
account for family separations? They
found that more than 2,800 infants, tod-
dlers, and children had been separated
from their parents at the border. Even
worse, there was no effort made to
trace where the parents were headed
and where the child was headed. At the
end, some of these children never ever
were reunited with their parents, sepa-
rated by Kirstjen Nielsen’s Department
of Homeland Security.
I have seen the results of these disas-
trous separations. At the immigration
court in downtown Chicago, in a Loop
high-rise building that you would never
pick out as a court, you take an eleva-
tor to one of the top floors and get out
on a crowded floor. There are people
standing four- and five-deep waiting for
the docket call for immigration court.
I went into the court just last year to
see what family separation was all
about. I found a good judge who had
been at it for almost 20 years, and she
said to me: Senator, please stay for the
docket call, at least the first group of
clients.
The first group of clients were called.
Marta was one of the clients. The judge
said: Would the clients please take
their seats. The problem—the problem
was, Marta was 2 years old. Marta had
to be lifted into her chair and handed a
stuffed animal that she was hanging
onto throughout this hearing, which I
am sure she never understood.
Hamilton was a little boy who was
also a client in the immigration court
that day. He was 4 years old—4 years
old in a U.S. immigration court be-
cause of the separation of children
from their parents. He did jump up on
the chair because he saw a Matchbox
car on the table that he could play
with while this hearing was deciding
his fate.
Do you know what happened? They
continued their cases for another 6
months. Fortunately, Marta was re-
united with her father in less than 6
months. Do you know what happened
when separated children were united?
Some of these children would not even
let their own mothers hold them. That
is what happens when you separate a 2-
year old from her mother for months at
a time. That is what happened over and
over again on the watch of Kirstjen
Nielsen, the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity. Mr. Chad Wolf, who is on our
calendar today, was her chief of staff
during this zero-tolerance policy.
These disastrous separations have
done permanent damage to countless
children. I saw two of them. Publicly
released emails show that Mr. Chad
Wolf, who will be voted on today in the
Senate, was deeply involved in the dis-
cussions that led to this policy. As far
back as December of 2017, Wolf was
Acting Chief of Staff to Secretary
Nielsen. He sent the Justice Depart-
ment a list of 16 options for deterring
undocumented immigrants. No. 2 on
the list was ‘‘separate family units.’’
His fingerprints are all over zero toler-
ance.
Mr. Wolf was also intimately in-
volved in the Trump administration’s
efforts to use Dreamers as bargaining
chips to advance the President’s anti-
immigrant agenda. After he repealed
DACA, President Trump rejected nu-
merous bipartisan deals to protect
Dreamers. I will not go through the
awful details of our bipartisan efforts
to come up with a bill, which the Presi-
dent time and again rejected. Instead,
he said: Here is my approach to the
Senate. Take it or leave it.
The Senate left. It received fewer
than 40 votes in a Senate dominated by
a Republican majority.
The administration said that it
would support the authorization of
Dreamers if the Congress passed his
plan, which included the largest cut in
legal immigration in almost a century.
The Senate rejected it. How do I know
that Mr. Wolf was involved in this ef-
fort? I sat in on a half dozen meetings
with Secretary Nielsen and Mr. Wolf,
just down the hall from here in the of-
fice of Republican Congressman KEVIN
MCCARTHY. He was there. Wolf was part
of the program.
In another administration, involve-
ment in family separation and DACA
repeal would be grounds for dismissal.
In the Trump administration, it is
grounds for promotion—promotion to
become the Acting Secretary and to
see if this flavor of the month as the
head of one of these key agencies can
actually gut it out for 6 months. It
might be a record if he did.

S6518 November 13, 2019
I urge my colleagues to oppose the
nomination of Mr. Wolf.
NOMINATION OF STEVEN J. MENASHI
Mr. President, on the subject of
nominations, last week every Repub-
lican member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee voted to report out the
nomination of Steven Menashi for a
lifetime judgeship on the Second Cir-
cuit. Every Democratic Member voted
the other way, and for good reason.
Steven Menashi lacks even the most
basic courtroom experience. He has
never argued in court, conducted a dep-
osition, or tried a case. He has written
dozens of incendiary editorials and ar-
ticles in which he showed a lack of
judgment and judicial temperament.
Let me give you a couple of exam-
ples. He said that ‘‘charges of racism
are typically overblown.’’ He went on
to say that gun control legislation is
‘‘pointless and self-defeating because
guns reduce crime.’’ Then he said, ‘‘The
animal rights crowd is, by and large, a
contemptible bunch.’’
Mr. Menashi currently works in the
White House. He works with Stephen
Miller. There is a name that may be fa-
miliar. He is pushing Stephen Miller’s
anti-immigrant agenda.
He spent several years advising the
Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos,
on some of the most anti-student meas-
ures that Department has ever under-
taken.
Mr. Menashi’s hearing before the
Senate Judiciary Committee was an
embarrassment. He refused to answer
basic questions from either Democrats
or Republicans, basically saying to the
Judiciary Committee: My experience—
what I have done, what I believe—is
none of your business.
It was a deeply troubling nomina-
tion, to the point where even Repub-
lican colleagues on the committee were
chiding him to answer a question if he
wanted a lifetime appointment to the
second highest court in the land. He
continued to refuse, but he still won all
of their votes when his nomination
came up last week.
Apparently, Mr. Menashi is hoping
that in this busy week, we are going to
hold this floor vote, and nobody will
notice. Well, a lot of Americans will
notice, especially the tens of thousands
of Americans who have been the vic-
tims of the for-profit college scams. Do
you remember those schools? You have
heard a lot about them, haven’t you?
All these schools that said they were
colleges and universities—they were in
it for a buck. Many of them turned out
to be frauds. They weren’t really col-
leges and universities.
Nine percent of high school students
in the United States go to for-profit
colleges and universities—9 percent—
and one-third, 33 percent of all the stu-
dent loan defaults are students at for-
profit colleges and universities. Why?
They overcharge the students; they
undereducate them; and they leave
them with a mountain of debt. When
these schools go out of business, we
have an opportunity to say to the stu-
dents: We are sorry you were de-
frauded, but it shouldn’t ruin your life.
We are going to make sure your stu-
dent loan at this bogus institution is
forgiven.
Months ago, we learned that the
DeVos Department of Education mis-
used private Social Security Adminis-
tration data to deny student loan relief
to thousands of students cheated by
the failed for-profit school, Corinthian
Colleges. Last week, we learned that
Mr. Menashi, the nominee we will con-
sider this week, was the architect of
this plan to deny these students full
and fair relief. He gave legal advice to
Secretary DeVos on how to carry it
out.
It was certainly bad advice. A Fed-
eral court ruled that the Menashi plan
illegally violated student privacy and
ordered the Department to stop put-
ting Corinthian borrowers into collec-
tion while they waited for relief. This
man, who wants a lifetime appoint-
ment to opine and rule and judge on
laws and statutes and the Constitution,
gave advice to the Secretary of Edu-
cation that turned out to be found in
violation of the law. In the months
that followed, the Department failed to
comply with the order of the court, re-
sulting in the judge’s holding Sec-
retary DeVos in contempt of court and
forcing her to pay a fine because of
Menashi’s advice. What a debacle. Yet
my Republican colleagues believe that
the appropriate response to this deba-
cle by Mr. Menashi is to promote him
to a lifetime appointment to a court
that is one step below the U.S. Su-
preme Court.
While Mr. Menashi is looking forward
to his lifetime job, the victims of Co-
rinthian Colleges’ fraud and Menashi’s
illegal scheme continue to suffer with-
out the relief they deserve—victims
like a man named Sheldon, one of my
constituents from Bloomington, IL. He
took out student loans to enroll in an
online criminal justice course from one
of the Corinthian schools, called Ever-
est College.
Corinthian may have gone bankrupt
in 2016 after it was revealed that it had
defrauded students into signing up, but
former students like Sheldon have had
no relief from the Department of Edu-
cation for their student loan debt from
this bankrupt school that defrauded
them. The collection agencies still
keep calling Sheldon’s home. He wrote
to my office and told me how he had
his wages garnished because he owes
$13,000 in student loans for enrolling in
this bogus Corinthian College program.
He said: ‘‘My checks have been taken
away from me for the past 3 years.’’
Mr. Menashi should be embarrassed
by the advice he gave to Secretary
DeVos to deny full and fair relief to
students like Sheldon and thousands of
others who were tricked and cheated
by for-profit colleges. He is not. Mr.
Menashi told me in writing after his
hearing: ‘‘I am proud of my work at the
Department of Education and of the
legal advice that I provided.’’
The Second Circuit is one of our most
important appellate courts. It hears
appeals coming out of the Southern
District of New York, where there are
multiple investigations underway of
national note.
The Senate should have grave res-
ervations about advancing a nominee
to the Second Circuit who currently
works in the White House but would
not disclose under oath what he does,
who has minimal courtroom experi-
ence, who has a record of giving trou-
bling legal advice, and who has a his-
tory of expressing views which were en-
tirely out of the mainstream.
I want to commend one Republican
colleague, Senator SUSAN COLLINS of
Maine, who said she is personally going
to oppose the Menashi nomination be-
cause in her words—I couldn’t say it
more clearly—‘‘I do not believe he is
well-suited to serve on the federal
bench.’’ Wouldn’t it be great if a few
more Senate Republicans felt the same
way?
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the Menashi
nomination.
I yield the floor.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise today in opposition to the nomina-
tion of Steven Menashi to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.
From 2017 to 2018, Mr. Menashi served
as the Acting General Counsel of the
Department of Education under Sec-
retary Betsy DeVos. Mr. Menashi has
stated that, in this role, he was ‘‘re-
sponsible for providing legal advice re-
lated to all aspects of the Department’s
operations, including litigation, rule-
making, regulation, and enforcement.’’
Before Mr. Menashi joined the De-
partment of Education, the Depart-
ment had found that thousands of stu-
dents had been defrauded by for-profit
colleges. The for-profit schools had lied
to students about job prospects, grad-
uation rates, and steered them into
mountains of debt. The Department
had concluded that these students were
entitled to relief from their student
loan debt.
But when Mr. Menashi arrived at the
Department, he took a different view.
He wrote a memo, which has since been
obtained by the New York Times, argu-
ing against full debt relief for the stu-
dents.
Many of these students found them-
selves unable to work in the fields that
they had pursued at the for-profit col-
leges because the colleges had either
suddenly closed or the degrees had
proven to be worthless. Nonetheless,
Mr. Menashi’s idea, which the Depart-
ment adopted, was to use the private
Social Security earnings data of the
defrauded students as a basis for lim-
iting their relief. Even if you put aside
the unfairness of Mr. Menashi’s plan,
there was another problem: It was ille-
gal.
Six months after Mr. Menashi’s plan
was implemented, and while Mr.
Menashi was still at the Department, a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6519
November 13, 2019
Federal court ruled that using stu-
dents’ private Social Security data vio-
lated the Federal Privacy Act. The
court ordered the Department to stop
using the students’ private information
and to stop collecting on their student
loans.
Even after this Federal court ruling,
the Department failed to comply. The
Department continued to illegally col-
lect on the student loans of at least
16,000 defrauded students. The Depart-
ment garnished wages, seized tax re-
funds, and wiped out some students’
credit ratings.
Less than 3 weeks ago, a Federal
court held Secretary Betsy DeVos in
contempt of court and fined the De-
partment $100,000. The Federal mag-
istrate judge who issued the contempt
order said, ‘‘[T]here have to be some
consequences for the violation of my
order 16,000 times.’’
Mr. Menashi should not be rewarded
for providing such bad legal advice
with a lifetime appointment to the
Federal bench.
While at the Department, Mr.
Menashi also helped push new rules on
campus sexual assault that the admin-
istration’s own analysis concluded
would dramatically reduce the number
of sexual assault investigations. Under
these new rules, a student who is the
survivor of sexual assault would be
subject to cross-examination by their
attacker’s representative at a live
hearing.
In 2018, Mr. Menashi joined the White
House Counsel’s Office, where he has
been a member of Stephen Miller’s
White House Immigration Strategic
Working Group. This working group
has helped push a number of extreme
anti-immigrant policies, including the
White House’s policy of separating
children from their families, a problem
that still has not been fully remedied,
despite a court order to do so.
At his hearing, Mr. Menashi refused
to answer numerous basic questions
about his work, including about his
role in the administration’s family sep-
aration policy. He also refused to an-
swer written questions about whether
he has worked or advised on matters
relating to the whistleblower com-
plaint and President Trump’s call with
Ukraine’s President. Importantly, none
of these questions asked Mr. Menashi
about the substance of his advice.
These questions simply sought to un-
derstand what matters he has worked
on. His refusal to answer makes it dif-
ficult for us to fulfill our constitu-
tional duty to advise and consent.
Mr. Menashi’s earlier career is equal-
ly troubling. He criticized ‘‘Take Back
the Night marches,’’ which aim to stop
campus sexual assault. He also wrote
that the Supreme Court’s decision in
Roe v. Wade had codified the ‘‘radical
abortion rights advocated by campus
feminists.’’ He wrote that gun control
legislation is ‘‘pointless [and] self-de-
feating, because guns reduce crime,’’
and he claimed that a major LGBT-
rights organization had ‘‘incessantly
exploited the slaying of Matthew
Shepard for both financial and political
benefit.’’ Mr. Menashi wrote that
‘‘charges of racism are typically over-
blown,’’ and he compared affirmative
action in college admissions to Nazi
Germany’s Nuremberg laws.
I want to close with a quote from a
letter of opposition submitted by the
Congressional Black Caucus. The CBC
rarely takes a position on judicial
nominees, but in this instance, felt
compelled to do so. The CBC writes:
‘‘Menashi’s writings show a willingness
to discriminate against minorities,
women and the LGBTQ community.
Menashi, who has consistently spoken
against diversity and inclusiveness,
does not deserve a lifetime position on
one of the most important appellate
courts in this country.’’
In light of Mr. Menashi’s record, it is
hardly surprising that there is bipar-
tisan opposition to his nomination.
I will vote no on Mr. Menashi’s nomi-
nation, and I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to do the same.
f
NOMINATION OF CHAD F. WOLF
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
rise to object to the nomination of
Chad Wolf to serve as DHS Undersecre-
tary of the Office of Strategy, Policy,
and Plans.
This nomination is yet another ex-
ample of the Trump administration’s
chaotic and inhumane approach to im-
migration issues. DHS is the third larg-
est Federal agency, and under the
Trump administration, it has had four
directors in less than 3 years. It has
been widely reported that Republicans
are rushing to confirm Mr. Wolf so that
President Trump can then appoint him
Acting DHS Secretary. He will be the
fifth DHS Secretary and the third Act-
ing. Rather than go through the nor-
mal channels of selecting a nominee
and allowing Senators to properly vet
and question the nominee, Republicans
are going along with Trump’s plan to
circumvent Federal law.
When asked directly by my col-
league, Senator ROSEN, about his role
in formulating the family separation
policy, Mr. Wolf denied any direct
knowledge of that policy. Leaked
emails later revealed that, as Sec-
retary Nielsen’s chief of staff, he pre-
sented her with a memo with options
to deter migrants coming to the bor-
der. Separating parents from their chil-
dren was the second option on that list.
The family separation policy is repug-
nant to our country’s values.
The timing of this nomination is es-
pecially concerning in light of the Su-
preme Court oral arguments this week
on DACA. The Trump administration
ended DACA and then rejected com-
promise legislation, written by a bipar-
tisan group of Senators, that would
have given over 700,000 Dreamers who
have grown up here stability and, ulti-
mately, a path to citizenship. When
those Senators were negotiating an im-
migration deal, in an unprecedented
action, DHS Secretary Nielsen sent a
letter lambasting the negotiations and
accused them of undermining U.S. se-
curity.
The Trump administration has
weaponized and poorly managed DHS,
and I cannot support this nominee.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1416
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I
am proud to be here to advocate on be-
half of a bill that has enjoyed, rightly,
bipartisan support: the Affordable Pre-
scriptions for Patients Act.
We all know that the astronomically
rising costs of prescription drugs are a
burden—in fact a bane for Americans
regardless of where they live, regard-
less of their party, race, religion, or
age, but particularly for our seniors.
The choice between paying the mort-
gage, putting food on the table, and
buying prescription drugs has become a
daily challenge for people across the
country.
This bill offers a positive, solid step
toward ending abuses in the use of pat-
ents—abuses that are called patent
thicketing and product hopping—that
all too commonly raise the cost of pre-
scription drugs and preclude access for
the people who need those drugs the
most.
This effort has been a bipartisan one
involving many of us in this Chamber.
It passed from the Judiciary Com-
mittee unanimously. It is a testament
to the still-possible bipartisan coopera-
tion on an issue of paramount concern
to the people of America that we have
reached this point of bringing it to the
floor of the Senate.
I am proud to have worked on this
measure with my colleague from Texas
who has really helped to lead this ef-
fort, Senator CORNYN, who is here on
the floor with me, and I am happy to
yield to him now.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank
the Senator from Connecticut for his
leadership.
At a time when people see bipartisan-
ship in short supply in Washington,
DC, this is one area where we can actu-
ally make some real progress for the
people we represent.
We all know that climbing
healthcare costs are keeping people up
at night. Many people reached out to
me in my office about the impossible
decisions they are required to make in
order to keep pace with rising prescrip-
tion drug costs—particularly the out-
of-pocket costs—whether they pay
some bills and have to defer or not pay
others; whether they cut their pills in
half or self-ration the medications,
which is dangerous to their health, or
don’t fill prescriptions altogether be-
cause they simply can’t afford the out-
of-pocket costs. No family should be
required to make those sorts of deci-
sions.
Sadly, I know my constituents in
Texas are not alone. The Kaiser Family
Foundation poll in September found
that the No. 1 healthcare concern of
the American people is prescription
drug prices. This is something the
President has said he wants to address,
the House has said they want to ad-
dress, and the Senate has said we want
to address, and this legislation we are
talking about will help move the ball
in the right direction.
A whopping 70 percent of people
think growing prescription drug costs
should be the top priority for Congress,
which should make it our No. 1 item on
our to-do list. The good news is, we are
making some progress. Here in the
Senate, we have taken a bipartisan ap-
proach, which is the only way to actu-
ally get things done in Congress. We
talked to every major player in the
supply chain, and we asked questions
about whether confusing practices that
are not transparent to outsiders are all
combining to drive up costs.
What I find seriously concerning are
the anti-competitive behaviors of some
of the drug manufacturers, the games-
manship, particularly when it comes to
our patent system. We know companies
pour a lot of time and money into the
research and development of new medi-
cations, and we don’t want to do any-
thing to stop that. We want to
incentivize that so that they are able
to recover their costs and perhaps
make a profit when the drug turns out
to be successful. But we don’t want
them playing games with the patent
system in a way that prevents others
at some point, after that period of ex-
clusivity, from being able to compete
with a generic alternative.
Ninety percent of the drugs we take
are generic, and that is why they are so
affordable and so inexpensive, but for
the top 10 percent of branded drugs
that people take, many of them simply
are unaffordable. These patents I refer
to do protect the intellectual property
for these key drugs and are an impor-
tant part of the incredible innovation
that occurs here in the United States,
but increasingly we are seeing compa-
nies using the patent system as a
shield for competition beyond the life
of the patent.
It is time to put a stop to that. We
can do that today. We can begin that
process today. That is exactly why I in-
troduced the Affordable Prescriptions

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6521
November 13, 2019
Connecticut. It targets two specific
practices used by drug companies to
keep prices high. First is product hop-
ping, which occurs when a company de-
velops a reformulation of a product
that is about to lose its exclusivity pe-
riod and then pulls that original prod-
uct off the market. This is done not be-
cause the new formula is necessarily
more effective but because it prevents
generic competitors for that product
that has now been pulled off the mar-
ket. The second phenomenon we are
trying to combat is something called
patent thicketing, which occurs when
an innovator uses multiple, overlap-
ping patents with identical claims to
make it nearly impossible for competi-
tors to enter the field.
This is not how patents were sup-
posed to be used, and we shouldn’t
allow these anti-competitive practices
to continue. In one case involving the
drug HUMIRA, the most popular drug
being prescribed today, there are more
than 120 separate patents for essen-
tially the same molecule. Meanwhile,
patients can’t get access to competi-
tive drugs that probably would be
cheaper here in America, while there
are four approved alternatives in Eu-
rope.
The American people simply should
not have to put up with this. We need
to stop companies from manipulating
the system and keeping competitors
tied up in courtrooms so that patients
can start to feel some relief.
Patients aren’t the only ones who
would benefit from this bill. The Con-
gressional Budget Office released a cost
estimate and found that it would lower
Federal spending by more than half a
billion dollars over 10 years. That is
not a whole lot of money in the grand
scheme of things, but when you con-
sider what the impact would be in the
private insurance market, too, that be-
gins to add up, and it adds up where it
counts the most when it comes to sen-
iors and other patients paying out of
pocket for their copays and deductibles
in order to get the drugs they need.
This bill really checks every box. It
protects innovation, increases competi-
tion, lowers prices for patients, and
saves money for taxpayers. Not sur-
prisingly, as the Senator from Con-
necticut pointed out, it has strong sup-
port on both sides of the aisle. The Ju-
diciary Committee, which ordinarily is
a pretty contentious place, unani-
mously voted this bill out of com-
mittee. Our friend from Illinois, Sen-
ator DURBIN, and Senator MURRAY from
Washington—two Members of the
Democratic leadership—are both co-
sponsors of the bill, which shows just
how noncontroversial this is.
I think it is time that we pass this
legislation and let our constituents
know we have heard their concerns and
we are committed on a bipartisan basis
to bringing down drug prices.
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 132, S. 1416.
I ask unanimous consent that the
committee-reported substitute be with-
drawn and the Cornyn amendment at
the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as
amended, be considered read a third
time and passed; and that the motion
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to
object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me
start by saying I support this bill, the
bill offered by Senators CORNYN and
BLUMENTHAL. It is bipartisan in nature
and passed the Judiciary Committee. I
not only voted for it, I cosponsored it,
and I think it should become the law of
the land. It will be helpful in reducing
the cost of pharmaceuticals.
I am offering a modification to the
bill. I believe this modification is one
that should be passed by the Senate as
well. In fact, it did pass the Senate last
year by a voice vote. Not a single Sen-
ator objected when it passed the Sen-
ate last year. We know—I have been
told by my colleagues—that they sup-
port the concept, but they are not
alone. The bill I am offering is also
supported by the American Medical As-
sociation; the American Hospital Asso-
ciation; 88 percent of the American
people, Republicans and Democrats;
President Trump; his health Secretary,
Dr. Azar; the AARP—a long list.
What could I possibly propose that
would have all of these people sup-
porting it? Simple. When the drug com-
panies decide to run an ad on tele-
vision—and you see a lot of them, don’t
you? The average American sees nine
every day. All we ask is that included
in the ad, they disclose the cost of the
drug.
How did I pick this as the cost for the
drug? I didn’t pick it; it was chosen by
the pharmaceutical company. That is
the list price of the drug. They can go
on to say ‘‘You will not have to pay
that amount,’’ but I believe the Amer-
ican people should know what the
drugs cost.
The most heavily advertised drug in
America today is HUMIRA. HUMIRA is
used for forms of arthritis and psori-
asis. But few Americans know, as they
watch people sitting by the swimming
pool with clear skin, that HUMIRA
costs $5,500 per month. The reason I
want to disclose this is because I think
consumers have the right to know.
Someone is going to pay that
amount—your insurance company.
Somebody is going to pay that amount.
When Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Il-
linois says that the No. 1 driver in
health insurance premiums is high pre-
scription drug prices, I think people
ought to know. It is not just a matter
of being in a bathing suit without a red
patch on your elbow; it is $5,500 per
month.
President Trump believes that disclo-
sure should be made, the Secretary of
Health and Human Services believes it,
the American Medical Association, the
Hospital Association, all the people I
mentioned, as well as almost 90 percent
of Democrats and Republicans. Who op-
poses this? Who would oppose dis-
closing the price of the drug? I will bet
you are guessing the pharmaceutical
industry, and you are right. They are
looking for one Senator who will object
to what I am offering. That is what
they need. They need just one Senator
to say no, and frankly I am afraid we
are going to face that this afternoon.
The bottom line is this: If you believe
consumers in America have a right to
know the cost of a drug, if you believe
the pharmaceutical companies have a
responsibility to disclose it, if you be-
lieve high prescription drug prices are
unfair and costing a lot more in our
healthcare system than they should,
then support this basic measure that
passed the Senate last year without
one negative voice. None. None whatso-
ever.
So having reserved the right to ob-
ject, I ask that the Senator modify his
request so that in addition to the pend-
ing request, the Finance Committee be
discharged from further consideration
of S. 1437 and the Senate proceed to its
immediate consideration; that the Dur-
bin-Grassley amendment at the desk be
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be
considered read a third time and
passed; that the Durbin-Grassley
amendment to the title be agreed to;
and that the motions to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the
table with no intervening action or de-
bate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would
the Senator modify his request?
Mr. TOOMEY. Reserving the right to
object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, first let
me say that I think Senator CORNYN’s
legislation is very constructive. I fully
support it. I think it would result in
lower costs for consumers. It is very
commendable. I think we should pass
it. I am sympathetic with the idea of
requiring greater transparency on
healthcare costs generally, but I have
significant policy concerns and process
concerns with the proposal from the
Senator from Illinois.
The policy concern, broadly, is that
what his legislation would do is it
would single out one industry and re-
quire a mandate that in their direct-to-
consumer advertising, they provide
systematically misleading information
to consumers. It doesn’t strike me, ob-
viously, as a good idea to mislead peo-
ple, including in this context.
Why do I say it is misleading? It is
because the legislation requires the list
price or the wholesale acquisition price
of a drug to be the price that is put in
the ad, despite the fact that almost no
one ever pays either of those prices.
There are huge rebates that are built
into the system.
We can have a good debate about
whether it is a good model by which

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6522 November 13, 2019
the government has created all of these
perversities in our healthcare delivery
system, but that is what it is. The
truth and the reality is almost no one
pays either the list or the wholesale ac-
quisition price. Think about it. If you
are on Medicaid, you pay zero. If you
are on Medicare, you often pay zero—
usually, nearly zero. If you have pri-
vate insurance, it varies enormously
from zero to something significantly
different, but almost no one pays the
price that the Senator from Illinois
would require to be posted in all direct-
to-consumer advertising.
Think about some of the unintended
consequences. The number that would
have to be in the ad is way higher than
what almost anyone actually pays.
Think of what could happen. I can
imagine senior citizens sitting there
watching an ad. Maybe they see a med-
icine they actually would benefit from,
and then at the end there is some huge
number that does not reflect—it
doesn’t come close to reflecting what
the actual cost would be, but it is a big
number so that a senior citizen would
understandably say: Gosh, I can’t af-
ford that. I guess I can’t pursue that
therapy, even though they might need
that. I am sure that is not the intended
consequence of this legislation, but I
am pretty sure it would happen.
It is also peculiar to me that the au-
thors of this legislation choose to sin-
gle out a small fraction of the
healthcare industry to impose this
mandate. Prescription drug spending is
about 10 percent of healthcare. Hos-
pitals are about 32 percent, but I
haven’t seen that we are going to im-
pose this. If you look at the rate of
price increases in various sectors of
healthcare, you see that actually pre-
scription drugs, over the last 20 years—
their increase in prices is considerably
less than hospital services and consid-
erably less than medical care services.
Then, of course, we have other sec-
tors in the economy altogether. Are we
going to put mandates on colleges, for
instance? The rate of tuition increase
in colleges is much greater than the
rate of increase of prescription drugs in
recent years. I haven’t heard a proposal
yet, but maybe one is coming that
would require this of other industries
as well.
If I didn’t know better, I would think
it seems part of a theme to vilify the
industry that has developed the thera-
pies that allow us to live longer,
healthier, and save lives. Most impor-
tantly, maybe it will not lower costs.
It is not going to lower costs for con-
sumers. The only way we are going to
do that is if we better align the incen-
tives of the consumer and the person
paying.
In contrast, by the way, the Finance
Committee and HELP Committee re-
ported out legislation that actually
would lower out-of-pocket costs for
prescription drugs. We have Senator
CORNYN’s legislation that I think abso-
lutely would lower the cost of con-
sumer prescription drugs. Yet that is
not what is on the floor today from the
Senator from Illinois.
Now, despite my policy concerns—
and they are serious—I actually think
we ought to debate these things. We
ought to put this kind of legislation on
the floor. We ought to have a debate.
We ought to have a vote, but this is
complicated, and it is fraud. We should
not be trying to just pass this by unan-
imous consent. This legislation has not
gone through committee, and contrary
to my colleague from Illinois—this ac-
tual piece of legislation has never had
a vote as a freestanding matter. A
version of it that is different from what
is being offered today was buried in a
larger legislation which passed. That is
not the same as scrutinizing this pol-
icy, subjecting it to amendments, and
deciding on it. That is what I think we
ought to do.
Unlike my colleagues on the other
side who have been consistently pre-
venting us from taking up legislation,
such as the approps bills they have not
allowed us to get on to or the SECURE
Act, on which I offered a unanimous
consent process for us to take up and
process, I think we ought to consider
this legislation, even though I don’t
think I would support the final prod-
uct.
What I suggest we do is let’s move on
to the Defense appropriations bill. Ar-
guably, the most fundamental respon-
sibility of Congress is to fund our na-
tional defense. Let’s make in order as
the first amendment after the man-
agers’ amendment the amendment of
the Senator from Illinois that he has
just described. I don’t support it, but I
support his right to have a debate and
have a vote. Let’s go on to an appro-
priations bill and let’s make his
amendment in order as the first
amendment. We can debate it; we can
vote it; and we will all live with the
consequences. I think that is what we
are here for. I think the purpose of the
Senate is to take on these issues, put
them on the floor, have a debate, and
have a vote. I am willing to live with
the outcome of that.
Mr. President, I ask that the Senator
from Illinois modify his request and
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of Calendar No. 132,
S. 1416. I further ask unanimous con-
sent that the committee-reported sub-
stitute amendment be withdrawn and
that the Cornyn amendment at the
desk be agreed to; that the bill, as
amended, be considered read a third
time and passed; and that the motion
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table; and finally, that
following disposition of S. 1416, the
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of H.R. 2740, and following
the offering of a substitute amendment
by Senator SHELBY or his designee, the
first amendment in order be an amend-
ment offered by Senator DURBIN or
Senator GRASSLEY, the text of which is
identical to S. 1437, as amended, which
is at the desk.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
Senator modify his request?
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to
object.
I am not a zoologist, so I don’t know
if crocodiles can cry, but I am very
concerned about the argument the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania made. He is ac-
tually standing here, in defense of sen-
ior citizens, by objecting to disclosing
the list price that the pharmaceutical
companies charge for these drugs. I
didn’t choose that price; they chose
that price.
Mr. TOOMEY. Will the Senator
yield?
Mr. DURBIN. I will not yield until I
am finished.
I said they could put a disclaimer on
that saying maybe you will not pay the
full list price depending on your insur-
ance or coverage, but to argue that you
are standing here in defense of senior
citizens and denying this information
to them and that the only way we can
consider this measure is call up the De-
partment of Defense appropriations
bill—from where I am standing, this
measure, which passed the Senate
without your objection last year,
should pass now with the underlying
legislation. Let’s get this done in a
comprehensive way to help seniors, and
let’s not stand in defense of pharma-
ceutical companies. They have plenty
of people to defend them.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
Senator object to the modification?
Mr. DURBIN. I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Is there objection to the original re-
quest from the Senator from Illinois to
modify his request?
Mr. TOOMEY. I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Is there objection to the Senator
from Texas?
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right
to object.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am
so glad to be out here today to deal
with the issue of reducing prices on
drugs for seniors and others. There are
so many things we must do. Some are
small. Some are large. We want to do
all of them.
We Democrats know how bad drug
prices are for seniors. We know how
bad the sabotage of our healthcare sys-
tem is for seniors. If you don’t have in-
surance, you probably can’t pay for the
drugs no matter what happens.
I would say to my good friend the
Senator from Texas that we have a
whole lot of legislative ideas, not just
his. He demands his. It is good, but it
is hardly large. There are millions and
millions who need help who are not af-
fected. The Senators from Illinois and
Iowa have a bill to lower prescription
drug costs. The HELP Committee has a
bill that would help community health
centers. The Senate Finance Com-
mittee has a good bipartisan bill to
lower costs for seniors who are very

strong supporters of allowing Medicare
to negotiate prices. That would do
more than anything else.
I ask my friend from Texas, Will he
get his leader and himself to allow us
to bring an amendment to a bill on the
floor that protects seniors who have
preexisting conditions from their in-
surance companies withdrawing from
them? Will he let us do that? That is
far more consequential than his well-
intended good but not largely effective
bill. The No. 1 thing—ask AARP—the
No. 1 thing that will protect senior
citizens and others from high drug
prices is to allow Medicare to negotiate
with them, something the Senator has
blocked repeatedly. Will he change his
position?
Let’s not have this charade, this ma-
nipulative charade, where my dear
friend from Texas comes to the floor
with a bill he proposes but blocks ev-
erything and his party blocks every-
thing that would have a far larger con-
sequence.
No. 1, allow Medicare to negotiate.
Every Member of our caucus is for
that. It will lower drug prices dramati-
cally. No. 2, stop the administration—
the administration the Senator from
Texas supports 95 percent of the time—
even my microphone is excited about
these remarks. I, once again, thank our
capable staff who always come to the
rescue.
We need Senator CORNYN to come to
the rescue of senior citizens and not
play a little game like this. Again, pre-
existing conditions are probably the
No. 1 bane of people. We want to bring
an amendment to the floor to protect
those people—a mom whose daughter
has cancer, and the drug company says,
‘‘You’re off,’’ and the insurance com-
pany says, ‘‘You’re gone.’’ Isn’t that
important? Let’s not make a compari-
son, but wouldn’t it do far more for the
health of the American middle class
and working people than this bill?
Let’s do them both, but we are not
going to cherry-pick one unless the
Senator from Texas walks across the
aisle and joins us in saying: I want to
help you get a vote on eliminating pre-
existing condition prohibitions. I want
to join you in seeing that Medicare can
negotiate with the drug companies and
greatly lower prices.
So, of course, I object. We Democrats
believe we should bring a bill to the
floor that has a debate and allows
amendments because there is so much
to be done here—not one small, de-
cently put together and decently in-
tended proposal but many more. We
know, if we allow our Republican
friends to just pass their little bills, we
will never get the big picture done.
That is how this place works. So let’s
come together and do it all.
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, like the
minority leader, I hope we are able to
pass a larger bipartisan package this
year. I serve on the Finance Com-
mittee—
Mr. SCHUMER. Would the gentleman
yield for a question?
Mr. CORNYN. After I am through.
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you.
Mr. CORNYN. I serve on the Finance
Committee and on the Judiciary Com-
mittee, where this bill came from, and
I know Senator MURRAY and Senator
ALEXANDER have a package out of the
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. I welcome the oppor-
tunity to have those bills come to the
floor and to offer amendments and de-
bate them and pass them because I
agree that the country would benefit
by bringing down healthcare costs, by
bringing down prescription drug costs,
and I believe that work is long overdue,
but my bill is not going to sink the
prospects of that larger package of leg-
islation.
What we have in front of us is an
uncontested, bipartisan bill that we
can pass today. Let’s pass it. Let’s not
let the perfect be the enemy of the
good. What I hear the minority leader
saying is that it is either everything or
nothing.
Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator
yield for a correction?
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will
yield for a question after I am through
talking.
When there is a statement, in effect,
of ‘‘I want everything to be done now
or there will be nothing done at all,’’
do you know what happens? Every sin-
gle time that argument is made and
that position is taken, nothing hap-
pens. Nothing happens. That is what
people hate about Washington, DC, and
when they look at C–SPAN, if they do
look at C–SPAN, and see these debates.
It is everything or nothing.
The Democratic leader, who has now
objected to the unanimous consent re-
quest to take up and pass a bill that he
has called good and well-intentioned
and has said is not large, has objected
to it. I think the only people who
would be rejoicing at this very moment
would be the very same people who are
gaming the patent system and who are
keeping the out-of-pocket prices of pre-
scription drugs high for seniors. Those
are the people who are popping cham-
pagne corks right now because this is
nothing more than a big, wet kiss for
the people who are gaming the patent
system right now to the detriment of
the American people.
Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator
yield for a question?
Mr. CORNYN. I yield to the Demo-
cratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator
support a unanimous consent request
so that we could protect people with
preexisting conditions, and would he
support bringing that to the floor in
the same way?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would
say to my friend the Democratic leader
that I support coverage for preexisting
conditions, and I am not aware of any-
one in the Senate who opposes it. If
such a bill is scheduled for a vote on
the floor, I will be more than happy to
participate in that process.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator sup-
port a proposal that is coming out of
the House to allow Medicare to nego-
tiate with the drug companies to great-
ly lower prices?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in
speaking through the Presiding Officer,
I say to my friend that nothing gets
done around here unless it is bipar-
tisan. Right now, the bill that the
House has sent us is one that divides
people along party lines, which means
it is unlikely we would build the bipar-
tisan consensus we would need to get it
done in the Senate. I am more than
happy to engage in that debate and to
vote on amendments on such a bill, but
I am not going to agree to price-fixing
by the U.S. Government, which will
make more scarce and less available
the lifesaving prescription drugs that
many people need. Yet I am happy to
engage in that debate, to vote, and to
let the Senate and Congress work their
will.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I
thank my colleague for his answers.
I would say this: Let him use his
power and position as leader to go to
the majority leader, who has prevented
any debate on anything on drugs to
come to the floor, including these two
most significant issues that I have
talked about. Let us put a package to-
gether of all three and have a debate on
each, a ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ vote on each, and
really make progress for those who are
paying too much in drug prices. I await
his working with me on that. Then we
could bring all three bills to the floor.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as al-
ways, I am happy to work with the
Senator from New York on things on
which we find our interests aligned.
Obviously, there are going to be things
on which we disagree. Frequently,
there are. Yet he and I have worked to-
gether on legislation on which we have
been able to find enough common in-
terest to be able to build a consensus
and get things done. They call that
‘‘legislating’’ around here.
There are other things that we
should be doing here on a bipartisan
basis. For example, taking up and pass-
ing the appropriations bills, including
the Defense appropriations bill, so our
U.S. military can remain the most
powerful, the best equipped, the best
trained, and the best led military in
the world. That is of overwhelming im-
portance. Yet our colleagues on the
other side have objected to and have
blocked, on at least two occasions, that

Defense appropriations bill. Now we
have a short-term continuing resolu-
tion that expires this November 21. I
am told or have read that there is like-
ly to be a follow-on continuing resolu-
tion that takes us up to December 20,
but that is important work, too, be-
cause none of us wants to see another
government shutdown. No one wins
with government shutdowns.
This sort of gamesmanship that oc-
curs by blocking bills that should have
support by overwhelming bipartisan
numbers in the Senate is important,
too—things like paying the military,
making sure that it maintains its read-
iness to fight and win the Nation’s
wars, and even more importantly, mak-
ing sure it keeps the peace.
I know the majority leader has a
challenge in trying to figure out how
to schedule legislation on the Senate
floor, but it certainly doesn’t help
when our Democratic colleagues re-
peatedly object to things like appro-
priations bills and put us into this dys-
function when it comes to paying the
Federal Government’s bills.
I would say to my friend from New
York that I am always happy to work
with him and with any other Member
in the Senate, no matter what one’s po-
litical party is and no matter what
one’s ideological persuasion is, because
I actually believe we were sent here to
solve problems and to get things done.
What I dislike and what I am dis-
appointed about is the dysfunction
that we see in the U.S. Senate, where-
by, even though it is less than a year
before the election, politics have over-
whelmed our ability to get things done.
I came to the floor to say that maybe
we can’t do all of this right now, today,
but we can do this, and let’s build on it
once we have gotten the bill passed.
I am disappointed that the Demo-
cratic leader has seen fit to object to
passing this bill that he himself called
good and well-intended and that is sup-
ported by organizations like the Amer-
ican Association of Retired Persons. I
do not understand it, but maybe some-
body else does. Their saying that we
can’t do something because it doesn’t
include everything we want to do here,
right now, is disappointing to me, and
I don’t think it is what the American
people sent us here to do.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I
thank my colleague for the inter-
change, and it will continue. We Demo-
crats will not rest until we get votes,
simple votes—not bring the house
down—on issues of great consequence
with regard to drug prices and the
American people while the other side
blocks them.
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. President, as we speak, the
House Intelligence Committee is con-
ducting the first day of public hearings
in its impeachment inquiry into Presi-
dent Trump.
The list of witnesses this week in-
cludes several key figures with knowl-
edge of the events in question. While
most of the witness requests from
House Republicans were non sequiturs,
or individuals who would have no
knowledge of the President’s actions
nor of the allegations against him,
three of the individuals requested by
the Republicans were agreed to and are
slated to testify next week. The idea
that the Republicans and the President
have no due process and can’t call wit-
nesses or influence the process is sim-
ply inaccurate.
As the impeachment inquiry in the
House begins a new phase today in its
pursuit of the facts, we have a serious
responsibility here in the Senate not to
prejudge the case but to examine the
evidence impartially. We have a re-
sponsibility to let all of the facts come
out and, as they do, to keep an open
mind and let ourselves be ruled by rea-
son rather than by passion or partisan-
ship. As public hearings in the House
begin, we would do well to remember
our constitutional duty to act as
judges and jurors in a potential trial
when and if it comes to one. That is
not to say we won’t even read the tran-
script, and that is not to say the vote
would come out this way. Yet, as ju-
rors, we will be as dispassioned as each
of us can be.
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mr. President, on another matter,
President Trump will roll out the red
carpet today for President Erdogan, of
Turkey, as he visits the White House
after everything that has transpired
over the last few months. This is after
President Trump green-lit Turkey’s
reckless and destabilizing invasion of
northern Syria, after Turkish troops
and their proxies committed atrocities
against civilians and the Syrian Kurds,
who are our former partners in the
fight against ISIS, and after Erdogan
cut a deal with our adversary President
Putin and threatened our allies in Eu-
rope with the release of ISIS’s detain-
ees.
The fact that President Trump will
reward President Erdogan with an Oval
Office meeting today is mind-boggling.
The meeting will serve as a very public
example of how President Trump has
mismanaged the situation in Syria
and, most importantly, how he has
complicated and slowed the effort to
secure the enduring defeat of ISIS. It is
ISIS that creates the greatest danger
to our American homeland. As al-Qaida
did before it, it will try to create huge
damage. We in New York know that
this can sometimes, unfortunately,
occur. God forbid it happens again.
Yet, holy mackerel, the President
has no plan for ISIS; detainees are es-
caping; and the Turks are far more
upset with the Kurds, who have been on
our side with ISIS, than they are with
ISIS. Erdogan suppresses free speech,
arrests opponents, and does so many
other terrible things to his country,
which was once a much more shining
example of democracy—and the Presi-
dent invites him here? Does the Presi-
dent have no sense of value? Does the
President have no sense of morals?
Does the President have no sense of
what affects American security? It is
appalling.
AGRICULTURE
Mr. President, on agriculture, a re-
port issued yesterday by the Demo-
cratic minority on the Committee on
Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
shed new light on troubling disparities
as to how the Trump administration
has treated farmers through the De-
partment of Agriculture’s Market Fa-
cilitation Program.
Farmers in need of Federal aid have
leaned on this program to offset losses
that have been caused by retaliatory
foreign tariffs. In an industry in which
margins are sometimes very thin, this
support makes a real difference for
struggling farmers across the country.
Yet, rather than helping those farmers
who are the most in need, the Trump
administration, through this program,
is picking winners and losers by using
a flawed methodology to favor certain
regions over others and wealthy agri-
cultural conglomerates over small
farmers.
The whole idea of the program is to
help small farmers throughout the
Middle West, particularly those farm-
ers with soybeans and corn and hogs.
The bulk of the program went to five
Southern States. Ninety-five percent of
the top payments defined as $100 or
more per acre all went to counties in
Southern States. Where did the lowest
payments go? They went to the coun-
ties in the Midwest even though the
Midwest has suffered greater losses
overall.
Instead of coming up with a strategy
to help smaller and less established
farms, which are often more vulnerable
during tough economic times, the
Trump administration has doubled the
payment caps for row crops while hav-
ing left other caps in place. This will
disproportionately funnel money to the
largest farms in America while it will
limit aid to smaller farms.
Most concerning, however, is that
our study shows the Trump adminis-
tration has awarded tens of millions in
purchase contracts to foreign-owned
companies, including a large beef fac-
tory in Brazil. Instead of ensuring that
aid goes to American farmers, the
Trump administration has been hand-
ing millions of taxpayer dollars to for-
eign agribusinesses.
This program was put together on
the spur because the President was
worried about political effects with,
particularly, soybean farmers but with
others, too, in the Middle West. Yet it
was put together so poorly—in such a
slipshod and unthought-out manner—
that cotton farmers do the best of all
even though their prices are not hurt-
ing the way soybean or corn or hog
prices are.

November 13, 2019
To my friends on the other side of
the aisle, the fiscal conservatives, we
need your voices.
If this program were going to the
urban areas or maybe to the poorer
people, we would hear an outcry from
certain Members on the other side, but
our farmers need the help too. When
you waste money on an ag program,
the people who are hurt the most are
our smaller and family farmers, par-
ticularly, in this case, in the Middle
West.
For years, my Republican friends in
this Chamber accused the Obama ad-
ministration—unfairly, in my mind—of
picking winners and losers in the mar-
ket. It was one of their favorite talking
points. Here, we have the Trump ad-
ministration literally picking winners
and losers among American farmers.
Sometimes the winners are not even
American. Oftentimes, the losers are
the small family farmers who need as-
sistance the most.
I am so glad that my Democrat col-
leagues on the Agriculture, Nutrition,
and Forestry Committee, especially
Ranking Member STABENOW, have
worked to inject some transparency
into the agriculture relief program.
The Trump administration should be
using the Market Facilitation Program
to help those farmers most in need—pe-
riod. The Trump administration needs
to stop picking winners and losers and
make sure all American farmers get
the help they deserve.
VETERANS
Mr. President, finally, on veterans—
this is another one—when I look at
what this administration is doing, and
if every American knew all these
things, Donald Trump wouldn’t stand a
chance. This one, I hope, will get out.
I talked a little bit about this yester-
day. We all know that so many of our
young men and women—my genera-
tion—went to Vietnam and risked their
lives. Many of them gave their lives for
our country. One of the worst aspects
of things is that they were not treated
as heroes when they came home.
I think America has made up for that
now, but here is a way that we are not
treating them well at all. Many of
them were exposed to Agent Orange,
and it became clear that many got sick
from exposure to Agent Orange while
fighting in Vietnam.
Well, what the VA has found is that
certain illnesses are caused by expo-
sure to Agent Orange, and they found
that there are four more illnesses that
have an Agent Orange link. But quietly
and secretly, the Trump administra-
tion denied payments to over 60,000
veterans who had these illnesses and
who received emergency care at non-
VA facilities in 2017.
It has missed deadlines to expand the
VA caregivers program to Vietnam and
Korean war veterans, and there are
some reports that the Trump VA hired
doctors on probation, but what is gall-
ing at the moment is this Agent Or-
ange situation and hiding the report.
Mulvaney, evidently, the Chief of
Staff, just said quietly: We are not
funding it. It took a Freedom of Infor-
mation Act action to reveal that they
were cutting the money off for these
folks.
They went to Vietnam. Some of them
volunteered. Some of them were draft-
ed. They got sick because of exposure
to Agent Orange, and the Trump ad-
ministration, which loves to have ral-
lies with veterans, cuts the money off
from them, saying that Mulvaney said
we couldn’t afford it.
These veterans could afford to risk
their lives for us. We can afford to help
them in their hour of need. I hope the
administration will reverse its deci-
sion.
I yield the floor.

ator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that I have the
right to yield to Senator COLLINS at
the end of my remarks.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING REDUCTION ACT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, polls
show a surprising interest of Ameri-
cans in the high cost of prescription
drugs. It seems to be an issue that
unites Americans. I often point out
that Washington is an island sur-
rounded by reality. Here inside the
Beltway, people are obsessed with par-
tisan impeachment proceedings. It
seems like morning, noon, and night,
the relentless effort to unseat the
President of the United States is a
toxic strain of Potomac fever infecting
Capitol Hill.
Now, if only Congress would channel
every waking minute to fix problems in
the real world, wouldn’t that be won-
derful? So let me provide a reality
check. For people living in the real
world, impeachment inquiry is not
what keeps Americans up at night. It is
not what wakes up moms and dads wor-
ried sick about paying for their child’s
insulin. It is not what drains the pock-
etbooks of seniors and takes a big bite
out of people’s paychecks. The issue
that unites Americans from Maine, to
Iowa, to Oregon is the sky-high prices
that Americans and the taxpaying pub-
lic are paying for prescription medi-
cine.
As chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, I am working in a bipar-
tisan way to fix what is broken in our
drug supply chain. In February, we
called the heads of Big Pharma to tes-
tify before the Finance Committee.
Next, we heard from the largest phar-
macy benefit managers to examine re-
bates and unravel the pricing supply
chain. There was an awful lot of finger-
pointing between the various interests
about the soaring drug prices that
Americans pay for pharmaceuticals.
That finger-pointing, we heard in our
committee. Finger-pointing doesn’t de-
crease drug prices because the real
problem is there is too much secrecy
and not enough accountability in the
industry of pricing drugs.
When drug prices grow by leaps and
bounds, year after year, it is time to
look under the hood. It is time to kick
the tires along the drug supply chain
and check the gauge on the competi-
tion. Why in the world is insulin, just
as an example—a drug that has been on
the market for nearly 100 years—dou-
bling or tripling in price for patients in
the United States? It is surely not that
way in Europe.
We have gotten lots of feedback from
patient advocates, healthcare pro-
viders, and free market proponents.
The pushback from Big Pharma reveals
that we are really on to something.
Congress needs to take its foot off the
brake. It is time to deliver real sav-
ings, and our bill will deliver real sav-
ings to consumers and to the tax-
payers. It is time to pass reforms that
will cut prescription drug costs for the
American people.
Now, some of my colleagues may re-
quire a more blunt call to action so I
want to use the two-by-four illustra-
tion. Join us and score a win for the
American people. Otherwise, do noth-
ing and risk being on the losing side of
the ballot box next November.
At my annual 99 county meetings
where I always hold a Q&A with what-
ever groups of constituents gather, I
hear the same message from people all
across the State of Iowa. They have
family members and they have neigh-
bors who struggle to pay for prescrip-
tion management, to manage chronic
health conditions, and to treat dis-
eases. Thanks to breakthrough treat-
ments and cures, Americans are living
longer and healthier lives.
Many are beating the odds of a diag-
nosis that would have been a death sen-
tence a generation ago. However, if a
loved one is diagnosed with MS or dia-
betes or cystic fibrosis, no miracle cure
will help if Americans can’t afford to
pay for their medicine. It will not help
seniors if sky-high prices drain tax-
payer-financed health programs like
Medicare and Medicaid. Soaring drug
prices are forcing too many Americans
to skimp on other necessities or even
ration their doses of prescriptions that
they take.
Now, I just mentioned, as an exam-
ple, cystic fibrosis. Last month, the
FDA approved a promising new treat-
ment for this progressive genetic dis-
order. Cystic fibrosis impacts about
30,000 Americans. There is nothing par-
ents will not do to advocate for their
child living with this condition. That is
how I met one family from Iowa a few

years ago. That is when I launched the
bipartisan Senate caucus on cystic fi-
brosis, to add our voices for awareness
and advocacy. Now, I am told the price
tag for the new drug is more than
$300,000 per patient, per year.
Without a doubt, this drug raises the
roof of hope for tens of thousands of
families, but it also raises a red flag
about drug prices. If prices keep going
through the roof year after year, how
will Americans who depend on prescrip-
tion medicines afford them? America’s
drug pricing regime is broken. It re-
quires reform to sustain fiscal sustain-
ability and also to steer incubation and
innovation forward. It needs more
transparency. It needs better incen-
tives. It needs real competition to
drive down prices. So all 100 of us have
our work cut out for us.
Big Pharma doesn’t want the pipeline
to the Federal Treasury tightened at
all, and they will spend big money to
scare people away from reasonable so-
lutions that will deliver real savings
and get the best deal for the taxpayers.
I referred to our working in a bipar-
tisan way. So, in July, Ranking Mem-
ber WYDEN and I secured broad, bipar-
tisan support in our Finance Com-
mittee—19 denying vote.
Our bill would save taxpayers more
than $100 billion. That is not this Sen-
ate saying that. That is the Congres-
sional Budget Office. The bill caps out-
of-pocket costs for seniors. The bill
saves their households more than $30
billion. We fine-tuned and improved
our bill to gain more momentum and
more support. Part of that support and
one of the outstanding advocates for
what we are trying to do doesn’t hap-
pen to be a member of the Finance
Committee, but it is my good friend
from Maine, Senator COLLINS, right
here on the floor. I will yield to her in
short time.
She is helping lead the fight to re-
duce drug prices. We have been work-
ing together on many issues. I am a
former chairman of the Special Com-
mittee on Aging, and she is the current
chair of the Special Committee on
Aging. We are committed to help older
Americans lead productive lives. We
also share a top priority not to miss a
vote. While I might have a stronger
voting streak, SUSAN hasn’t missed a
single vote. I hope Maine appreciates a
person who has been in the Senate
since 1997 and hasn’t missed a single
vote.
Senator COLLINS is one of those rare
lawmakers who doesn’t care who gets
the credit, as long as we are doing the
right thing. The name of this bill that
I am talking about—and I imagine she
will refer to—is the Prescription Drug
Pricing Reduction Act. That will be
the right thing to do, and it will do the
right thing. So it is time for Congress
to do the right thing.
Just in case I said anything different
about Senator COLLINS that is not ac-
curate, she can feel free to correct me,
but I now yield to Senator COLLINS, a
strong voice for this piece of legisla-
tion.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me
first thank and recognize Senator
GRASSLEY for his farsighted, coura-
geous leadership on this issue of vital
importance to the American people,
the escalating costs of prescription
drugs.
Under Senator GRASSLEY’s chairman-
ship, the Finance Committee has held
numerous hearings on drug pricing. His
diligence, his persistence on this issue
has produced the bipartisan Prescrip-
tion Drug Price Reduction Act, a bold
and effective set of proposals that I
strongly endorse and look forward to
seeing signed into law.
This past century could well be
called the age of miracle drugs, from
insulin and penicillin to pharma-
ceuticals that treat cancer, HIV, heart
disease, and so many other serious con-
ditions, modern drugs have been proven
to improve, extend, and even save lives.
In our time, however, we might define
a miracle drug as one that has not dou-
bled in price since the last refill. With
prescription drugs among the key fac-
tors driving up the cost of healthcare,
it is essential that we approve policies
that both encourage innovation and
protect consumers, particularly our
seniors.
Demonstrating the importance of
this challenge, three Senate commit-
tees—the Senate Finance Committee,
ably chaired by Senator GRASSLEY,
which I mentioned earlier; the Senate
HELP Committee, which is led by our
friend and colleague Senator LAMAR
ALEXANDER; and the Judiciary Com-
mittee, which is led by Senator GRA-
HAM—have advanced bills aimed at re-
forming our broken drug pricing sys-
tem.
In addition, the Senate Aging Com-
mittee, which I chair, has held eight
hearings on drug pricing since 2015 and
issued a major report in 2016 on Sudden
Price Spikes in Off-Patent Prescription
Drugs. Our report highlighted the ma-
nipulative schemes employed by Mar-
tin Shkreli, who increased the price of
a drug that was more than 63 years
old—a lifesaving medication—by 5,000
percent in just 1 day.
To paraphrase his words, he could
drive up the price of drugs like this one
on which he had not spent a dime in
the research and development because
he could. His price gouging caused real
hardships for patients.
Some of the most alarming testi-
mony we have heard on the Aging Com-
mittee has come from patients. They
describe the financial impact of their
prescription drug prices, the depths
they have gone to to access medica-
tions they need, and how this struggle
has affected their health and their
overall quality of life. They are truly
choosing between paying their electric
bill, buying the food they need, and
filling their prescription drugs.
An example is a young father from
New Gloucester, ME, who discovered
that the cost of a 90-day supply of insu-
lin for his 13-year-old son who has type
1 diabetes had more than tripled to
more than $900.
A woman from Falmouth, ME, saw
her out-of-pocket costs for the arthri-
tis medication Enbrel that she needs
soar from $10 to $3,800 per month when
she transitioned from her employer-
sponsored insurance to Medicare when
she retired. She had no choice but to
switch medications, which did not
work nearly as well for her, but she
simply could not afford that out-of-
pocket cost.
I will never forget standing in line at
the pharmacy counter in Bangor, ME,
where I live. The couple ahead of me
received their prescription drug and
the unwelcome news that their pre-
scription copay was going to be $111.
The husband turned to his wife and
said ‘‘Honey, we simply cannot afford
that,’’ and they walked away, leaving
that needed prescription on the phar-
macy counter.
I asked the pharmacist: How often
does this happen?
His answer: Every day.
The results of exorbitant increases in
the price of drugs are that needed pre-
scriptions aren’t filled, doses are
skipped, and pills are cut in half—all
harmful to the patient’s health. And
why? Because the patient simply can-
not afford the exorbitant costs, the
skyrocketing costs of these drugs.
This should not happen. We must join
together to combat the exorbitant pre-
scription costs that confront more and
more Americans every day. More than
half of all Americans and 90 percent of
our seniors take at least one prescrip-
tion drug each month. For many, ac-
cess to these medicines is not only crit-
ical to their well-being, but it can lit-
erally be a matter of life and death.
For children and adults with type 1
diabetes, insulin is not a luxury or
something that is nice to have; insulin
is essential to their ability to survive.
Insulin was first isolated nearly a cen-
tury ago in Canada. Yet its cost has
soared in recent years.
Another chairman in the Senate who
has worked very hard on this issue,
along with Senator GRASSLEY, is Sen-
ator LAMAR ALEXANDER. He has made
it a strong priority of the HELP Com-
mittee, on which I serve, to increase
transparency and competition in the
prescription drug market.
I don’t think there is any product
that we buy in this country where
there is less transparency in the price
than the price of prescription drugs
and where the supply chain is more rife
with conflicts of interest.
Last year, in response to my experi-
ence listening to this couple in Bangor,
ME, I authored a bill to block phar-
macy gag clauses. Under these contrac-
tual gag clauses, pharmacists were ac-
tually prohibited from volunteering to
a consumer that it might well be less
expensive to pay out-of-pocket rather
than use their insurance. A recent
study published by the Journal of the
American Medicine Association found

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6527

that this new law could help Americans
save money in nearly one out of four
prescription transactions in a phar-
macy.
Another bill I authored in 2017 to pro-
mote more competition from lower
price but equally effective generic
drugs is also showing results. To date,
the FDA has granted nearly 200 appli-
cation requests under the new expe-
dited pathway established by this law,
with 12 approvals. That is a much fast-
er pace than in the past.
In June, the HELP Committee re-
ported out the Lower Healthcare Costs
Act, which incorporates more than 14
measures to increase drug price com-
petition. I am pleased to say that it in-
cludes major portions of the Biologic
Patent Transparency Act that I au-
thored with Senator KAINE, and that is
cosponsored by Senators BRAUN,
HAWLEY, PORTMAN, SHAHEEN, STABE-
NOW, PAUL, and MURKOWSKI. It is in-
tended to prevent drug manufacturers
from gaming the patent system. It re-
quires earlier and greater disclosure of
the web of patents held by biologic
manufacturers, thus making it easier
for biosimilar competitors to develop
more affordable alternatives without
being stymied by the filing of last-
minute patents.
According to former FDA Commis-
sioner Scott Gottlieb, if all of the
biosimilars that have been approved by
the FDA were successfully marketed in
the United States in a timely fashion,
Americans would have saved more than
$4.5 billion in 2017.
The fact that a biosimilar version of
HUMIRA—the best selling drug in the
world—has been on the market in Eu-
rope for more than a year while Amer-
ican patients must wait until 2023 is a
clear example that the biosimilar mar-
ket is not working as it should.
The Lower Healthcare Costs Act also
includes the CREATES Act—a bill that
I know Senator GRASSLEY has been
very involved in. It addresses the anti-
competitive practices of companies
that delay or even block access to a
sufficient quantity of the brand-name
drug needed to conduct the bioequiva-
lency test required by the FDA as part
of the generic drug approval process.
This addresses one of the major prob-
lems identified by the Aging Com-
mittee when we looked at this issue
starting in 2016, examining the explo-
sion in prices of prescription drugs for
which there is no generic equivalent. I
am pleased that we are on the verge of
taking action to combat and stop this
unfair practice.
The HELP Committee bill also re-
quires significantly more disclosure on
the costs, fees, and rebate information
associated with PBM contracts; that is,
prescription benefit managers. I know
the Finance Committee bill does as
well.
As I mentioned previously, the Fi-
nance Committee passed the Prescrip-
tion Drug Pricing Reduction Act—
landmark legislation that would save
taxpayers more than $100 billion and
save seniors more than $30 billion in
out-of-pocket costs for their prescrip-
tions. I strongly support this bill be-
cause it strikes the right balance be-
tween reducing out-of-pocket costs for
consumers without hindering innova-
tion and investment in the next life-
saving medications.
The Finance Committee bill also
makes crucial improvements to Medi-
care Part D, such as protecting seniors
with an out-of-pocket spending cap—
another long overdue change that
would ensure that patients with high-
cost conditions, such as cancer, mul-
tiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthri-
tis, can get the medications they need.
Furthermore, the bill would protect
taxpayers from higher than inflation
increases in drug prices, while reducing
government spending, premiums, and
overall out-of-pocket costs.
The Judiciary Committee has also
advanced proposals that would em-
power the Federal Trade Commission
to take more aggressive action on anti-
competitive behaviors.
These are three worthwhile pieces of
legislation that should be brought to
the Senate floor. The work of the Fi-
nance Committee, the HELP Com-
mittee, and the Judiciary Committee
is a tremendous breakthrough that
would make such a difference to the
American people.
As we continue to find further con-
sensus and a path forward on each of
these bipartisan bills, I hope we can
also look for additional improvements.
For example, as cochairs of the Senate
Diabetes Caucus, Senator SHAHEEN and
I, along with Senators CRAMER and
CARPER, have introduced legislation to
address flaws in the system that have
allowed pharmacy benefit managers
and manufacturers to implement what
are truly unscrupulous price increases
on lifesaving insulin. I also support a
measure introduced by Senators KLO-
BUCHAR and GRASSLEY to prohibit
brand-name drug companies from com-
pensating generic drug companies to
delay the entry of a less costly but
equally effective generic into the mar-
ket. That is referred to as ‘‘pay for
delay.’’ I am amazed that it is not al-
ready illegal under our anti-trust laws.
This bill would make it clear that this
tactic is no longer permitted.
Congress has a tremendous oppor-
tunity to deliver a decisive victory in
both lowering healthcare costs and im-
proving healthcare for the people in my
State of Maine and throughout Amer-
ica. If we want new medicines to reach
consumers who need them, the compa-
nies that invest in research and take
the risks necessary must see a fair re-
turn on their investment, but at the
same time, we can no longer allow the
price manipulation and the market dis-
tortions to continue at the expense of
the most vulnerable Americans and
their families and ultimately at the ex-
pense of every American taxpayer.
We can act to make a real difference
in the lives of Americans whose health
depends on affordable prescription
drugs. The required policy solutions
will not come in the form of a miracle
but through hard work and continued
bipartisan cooperation.
Let us come together. I urge all of
my colleagues to join in supporting the
measures we have worked so hard on
and that the HELP Committee, the Fi-
nance Committee, and the Judiciary
Committee have all reported, on a bi-
partisan basis, recognizing the hard-
ships imposed on the American people.
Let us bring these bills to the Senate
floor expeditiously.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota.
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I come
down to the Chamber today to talk a
little bit and highlight the vast dif-
ferences in the priorities between the
two Chambers in the U.S. Congress
today.
Several of my colleagues will be
down here a little later today to talk
about and to encourage the passage of
the National Defense Authorization
Act—a bill, by the way, that passed the
Senate in a very strong bipartisan way,
reflective of strong bipartisan input, in
a vote of 86 to 8. The House also passed
their version of the National Defense
Authorization Act on more of a party-
line vote.
The point being, both Chambers have
passed it; the reconciliation of the two
bills has begun; the negotiations have
begun, but they have been stalled. I
think it is a strong reflection of the
differences between the two Chambers.
First, I will talk a little bit about
why it is important that we do this job.
First of all, there have been 58 years in
a row that the NDAA has passed the
House and the Senate and signed into
law. Why? Well, because it is the high-
est priority of the government—of all
the bills we do every year, apart from
and very close to appropriations, would
be authorization of our national de-
fense programs. That is why it has hap-
pened 58 years in a row.
It is important for a number of rea-
sons. One of the things that both the
House version and the Senate version
of the NDAA does is highlight the im-
portance of space with the creation of
a Space Force, as we call it the Senate,
and Space Corps, as they call it in the
House. Nonetheless, it is similar, and it
represents and recognizes the impor-
tance of space domain as a warfighting
domain going forward, a priority that
our near-peer allies have already recog-
nized in their policies.
Without NDAA passing, that goes by
the wayside for at least another year.
It also fully funds several national pri-
orities, not the least of which is, of
course, the largest pay increase in 10
years for our men and women who wear
the uniform.
On a more local level for me, it au-
thorizes the modernization of our nu-
clear fleet, including the ground-based
missiles known as the ICBMs that we
have 150 of in North Dakota at Minot.

S6528 November 13, 2019
It modernizes this system, which is
several decades old. If we need any-
thing, we need to modernize our weap-
ons systems again to keep pace with
our near-peer adversaries.
It also authorizes millions of dollars
in funds to the national Global Hawk
mission, which is headquartered in
Grand Forks, another very important
Air Force base in my State. It author-
izes funds for the MQ–9 program. MQ–9s
are flown by North Dakota Air Na-
tional Guardsmen in Fargo’s Happy
Hooligans. It also advances the mission
of the Cavalier Air Force Station in
Cavalier, ND, one of the very few space
radar stations, and it ensures that the
needs of all our Guard operations are
met.
The House bill, by the way, also does
something that is very important to
me. It is a bill I have introduced, along
with my colleagues from New York,
that honors the 74 sailors who lost
their lives in the Frank E. Evans 50
years ago during the Vietnam war.
These sailors’ names have been left off
the Vietnam Memorial Wall over a
minor technicality, a technicality that
probably shouldn’t be in the rules to
begin with, but certainly it has been
waived in many other circumstances
and needs to be waived in this NDAA. I
would love to get that House language
into the final bill.
None of these priorities are going to
be met if House Democrats—and I focus
on House Democrats—if they don’t
come to the table and act in good faith
and negotiate in good faith. Senate
Democrats have had a major part in
this, and I welcome every bit of in-
volvement they provide.
One of the joys of being on the Armed
Services Committee for me has been
being able to see a functioning com-
mittee that works well across party
lines. Obviously, Senate Republicans
are all on board. House Republicans are
all on board. For some reason, the
House leadership on the Democratic
side is focused on other priorities, and
the contrast could not be more clear.
While we have been working hard in
the Senate on appropriations, as well
as the Defense authorization, our
chairman has used his voice—Chairman
INHOFE—and used his incredible work
ethic and his wisdom in working with
Senator REED, the ranking Democrat,
on getting these priorities to the fore-
front. I can’t think of a better tandem
than those two gentlemen.
Chairman INHOFE is truly one of the
hardest working, most decent, and hon-
orable people I have ever worked with.
Chairman SMITH, the chairman in the
House committee, could learn a few
things from him.
Again, while we passed the bill with
overwhelming bipartisan support, the
House bill was a much more partisan
exercise. We want to prevent a govern-
ment shutdown. We want to prevent a
continuing resolution. So along with
the NDAA, of course, is the Defense ap-
propriations bill, and we have to get
both of them done. We want to give our
military a win-win situation, where
they get the pay raises, where they get
the modernization they need, where
new programs can be launched, and
where we can provide long-term cer-
tainty.
While we are trying to provide at
least a win for our military, Democrats
in the House are focused on trying to
win the 2016 Presidential election, not
even thinking so much about the next
one. They are involved in a kangaroo
court over there. I watched a half hour
of it today, and I could hardly believe
what I was seeing. Today’s political
theater in the House is unnecessary,
and 3 years into it, it is an outward
demonstration of the inward motiva-
tion of a party that is trying to undo
the Presidency of Donald Trump.
Instead of prioritizing our constitu-
tional responsibilities, they are en-
gaged in political theater in a kan-
garoo court. I am pleading, once again,
with my colleagues across the aisle and
especially across the Capitol, in these
last couple of days, while the nego-
tiators are together trying to figure
out a path forward, please come to the
table, please act in good conscience.
Please, please, please look for opportu-
nities where we can compromise, and,
for Pete’s sake, let’s at least pass the
things we all agree on.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico.
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NOMINATIONS
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, ear-
lier today, we were asked to vote on
the confirmation of Chad Wolf to serve
as the Under Secretary for Strategy,
Policy, and Plans at the Department of
Homeland Security. Mr. Wolf has been
serving in that role on an acting basis
since February.
Because of the way the Trump ad-
ministration functions, or fails to func-
tion, what we were really being asked
to do today was to confirm Mr. Wolf to
a position so the President can then
promote him to Acting DHS Secretary.
This comes on top of most appointed
positions at the agency going unfilled
or only filled with similarly temporary
acting roles.
Before we all throw our hands up in
the air and simply add this vote to the
growing list of broken norms and in-
competent actions on the part of the
Trump White House, I would like us to
consider what is at stake in this par-
ticular case. I beg us to take seriously
the human toll that has been incurred
because of this administration’s willful
chaos at the Department of Homeland
Security.
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is the Nation’s third largest Fed-
eral agency, behind only the Pentagon
and the VA. The agency oversees dis-
aster relief, transportation safety,
counterterrorism, and immigration and
border security. According to a report
in the Washington Post, Mr. Wolf is the
favored pick of senior Trump adviser
Stephen Miller to take over as Acting
Homeland Security Secretary. That
should tell us about everything we
need to know.
Stephen Miller has been the lead ar-
chitect of the White House’s immoral
and anti-immigration policies over the
last 3 years. The Senate should have
taken this vote as a reason to examine
how this administration has spent the
last 3 years flouting our Nation’s laws
and our Nation’s values through its in-
tentional chaos at the Department of
Homeland Security.
We should do our jobs and give an
honest accounting of this administra-
tion’s inhumane and, frankly, ineffec-
tive policies—policies, it should be
said, that Mr. Wolf has been right in
the middle of each step of the way. In-
stead, the Senate voted to confirm Mr.
Wolf in this sham process to a position
we weren’t even sure he will serve in.
This is shameful.
Now that the Senate has confirmed
Mr. Wolf to the Under Secretary posi-
tion and as we anticipate Mr. Trump
moving him into the Acting Secretary
role, I ask my colleagues to please con-
sider his record. We know Mr. Wolf
played a central role in authoring and
implementing the family separation
policy. We don’t fully understand how
much he did to implement President
Trump’s other harmful immigration
policies because the Department of
Homeland Security has stonewalled
and refused to provide key documents
to the Senate on his tenure before we
took the vote this morning.
However, given his major role with
Secretary Nielsen, it seems safe to as-
sume that Mr. Wolf was involved in
many of the administration’s policy
failures. Under these policies, thou-
sands of children, as young as infants
and toddlers, arriving at our Nation’s
southern border have been separated
from their families. We have seen mi-
grant families and children held in ap-
palling, overcrowded, some say
prisonlike—I would say prison facili-
ties—immigration detention facilities
like those in Clint, TX, that we saw in
the media.
The Trump administration has also
throttled major ports of entry where
refugees present themselves for asylum
as is actually dictated by current U.S.
law. This has resulted in huge groups
going instead to remote and dangerous
stretches of the southern border. We
have tragically seen that result in the
deaths of several children in New Mex-
ico near some of our remote ports of
entry that lack even the most basic
medical infrastructure.
We have seen President Trump play
politics with the lives of thousands of
refugees and asylum seekers, mothers,
fathers, and children who are des-
perately seeking refuge and the pros-
pect of a better life in this country.
We have seen the President even go
so far as shutting down the govern-
ment and stealing billions of dollars of

congressionally appropriated funds
from the military to pay for his waste-
ful and candidly ineffective border
wall.
Finally, President Trump’s decision
to terminate the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals Program, or DACA,
has thrown Dreamers across this coun-
try deep into fear and uncertainty. The
stakes of that decision have been
shown in oral arguments before the Su-
preme Court this very week.
Dreamers are among our best and
brightest—our best and brightest stu-
dents, teachers, and even veterans.
They only know this Nation as their
home in many cases, and today I am
meeting with a Dreamer named Sam-
uel, who lives in Las Cruces, NM.
Samuel came to the United States
from Mexico with his family when he
was 11 years old. He has called Las
Cruces his hometown for the last 13
years. As a DACA recipient, Samuel
was able to study accounting at New
Mexico State University and help pro-
vide for his family.
Dreamers like Samuel want to give
back to their communities and the
only Nation they know as home. They
are American in every way except on
paper, and because of President Trump,
Dreamers like Samuel face a deeply
fearful future.
Whenever we debate immigration,
frankly, it becomes a little personal for
me, and that is because, like most—all
of us in this Nation of immigrants—my
family’s story in America began with a
search for a better life. My father came
to the United States with his family
from Germany as a young boy. They
were fleeing the government of a rac-
ist, populist dictator who was first
elected democratically and then used
race and scapegoating to cement his
grip on power. I always wonder how dif-
ferent my own life would be if America
had turned my father away or sepa-
rated him from his family.
This is not some abstract question
for the mothers, fathers, and children
who are desperately seeking refuge and
the prospect of a better life in America
today. I know that so many Americans
watching this administration’s immi-
gration policies know in their hearts
what America truly stands for as a na-
tion built by many generations of im-
migrants like my father. That includes
local officials, first responders, and
volunteers in communities like
Deming, Las Cruces, and Albuquerque,
NM, who over the last year provided
shelter, food, and help to asylum seek-
ers who had nowhere else to turn. It in-
cludes the thousands of Americans who
marched in the streets and demanded
an end to family separation, and it in-
cludes millions of Americans who want
our leaders in Washington to finally af-
firm the incredible value that immi-
grants provide for our country.
I want all of you to know that I stand
with you. You are on the right and just
side of history.
I will keep calling on us to hold this
administration accountable to our
American values, and I will keep call-
ing on Congress to uphold our end of
the bargain and finally act to reform
our broken immigration system. That
should start by passing the Dream Act.
We also need to address the root
causes of migration from Central
America, including extreme poverty,
criminal gangs, and violence. We must
make smart investments in real border
security and economic development in
our border communities. We need to
provide the necessary medical and hu-
manitarian resources to our border re-
gion, particularly for the rugged, back-
country terrain we have in my State.
I will never stop fighting for policies
that respect the dignity of immigrants,
recognize the real needs of our vibrant
border communities, and live up to our
true American values.
Unfortunately, I don’t think we will
ever have a productive path forward on
any of these urgent matters with this
President and his administration. That
is true no matter who President Trump
ultimately shuffles into the role of
Acting Homeland Security Secretary,
but it is especially true if the President
chooses Chad Wolf.
When Senator ROSEN questioned Mr.
Wolf in the Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee
about the role he played in family sep-
aration and other cruel immigration
policies, Mr. Wolf said: ‘‘My job wasn’t
to determine if it was the right or
wrong policy.’’ In other words, folks,
he was just following orders.
I think it is clear that the Trump ad-
ministration has shown an appalling
disregard for basic human dignity. Now
the Senate has confirmed someone who
will simply rubberstamp the continued
failures of this administration.
I should also note that the current
pending vote on the floor is for a judi-
cial nominee, Steven Menashi, who has
also played a role in the administra-
tion’s shameful immigration policies.
As a counsel in the Trump administra-
tion, Mr. Menashi has acknowledged
that he advised Stephen Miller on im-
migration policy, and he has a long
record of opposing the basic human and
civil rights of people of color, women,
LGBTQ Americans, and immigrants.
As the general counsel at the Depart-
ment of Education under Betsy DeVos,
he played a leading role in trying to
deny debt relief to students defrauded
by for-profit colleges.
I can’t believe that we as the Senate
can allow these types of appointments
to keep going forward. We should not
let this go on. This is not who we are
as a country, and this is not the Amer-
ica that I know and love.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, we
just celebrated Veterans Day here in
the Senate, back home, and across our
great country in the States that all of
us represent. Everybody was cele-
brating our troops, our military, and
supporting their families.
You hear that word ‘‘support’’ a lot
when it comes to Veterans Day and our
military and their families, but I am
going to talk a little bit about that
rhetoric. That is great. Senators talk a
lot. But that is very disconnected from
what actually is going on in the Senate
right now and what is happening in
terms of the action of supporting our
troops.
I came to the floor a couple of weeks
ago to talk about this. I was pretty
fired up. I am someone who is very col-
legial with my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle, but the one thing I have
noticed is that there is talk on sup-
porting troops and then there is action.
The rhetoric, particularly with my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle,
doesn’t always match what is actually
happening.
I would like to explain to my con-
stituents at home, the American peo-
ple, and anyone watching what is hap-
pening right now with regard to sup-
porting our troops—the action, not
rhetoric—the action. Two weeks ago,
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle filibustered the Defense appro-
priations bill. That is the bill that
funds our troops. We had a big budget
deal. We all agreed to it.
It is hard to vote for it. I voted for it
because it actually supports rebuilding
our military pretty significantly after
the Obama-era cuts. I voted for that.
We are starting to bring up these
minibus appropriations. We had one a
couple of weeks ago. We debated and
voted on it. The plan was to bring up
the Defense approps bill. What did my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
do? They filibustered it. It was the
ninth time since I have been in the
Senate that my colleagues decided to
filibuster the spending for our troops.
There is no other bill in the body of the
Senate that the Democrats filibuster
more than the bill that funds our
troops. They don’t want you to know
that. They don’t go home and brag
about it because they should be
ashamed about it, but that is what
they did.
Despite this budget deal and despite
all of this great support for our troops,
right now, my colleagues, for the ninth
time since I have been a Senator,
which is 5 years—nine times they fili-
bustered the spending for the men and
women who serve in the military. I ask
the leaders to come out and explain
that to the American people. Explain
that to the press. Explain that to the
people watching on TV. They don’t. I
think most of my colleagues don’t
want to do it, but they are told to do it
because their leadership wants another
priority. That is what is happening.
They talk about supporting our
troops, but then the action is that we

are actually not supporting our troops
at all. We are keeping funding away
from them because we are trying to le-
verage the desire to support our mili-
tary and a Defense appropriations bill
for other political goals. This has hap-
pened nine times.
There is no other bill since I have
been elected to the Senate that my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
filibuster more. When they want lever-
age on a nonmilitary issue, they fili-
buster spending for the troops. I would
welcome some of my colleagues to
come and explain why they do that.
That is one issue.
Another issue is not my colleagues in
the Senate, but it is certainly the
Democrats on the other side of Capitol
Hill. We are now debating the National
Defense Authorization Act—the NDAA,
as we call it. This is the heartbeat of
the Congress. Why? It has passed this
body 58 years in a row. That is the clos-
est thing we have to a guarantee in
this body. Members—Democrats and
Republicans—come together, and we
set forward—coming out of the Armed
Services Committee, on which I sit—
the NDAA, which oversees, reforms,
and authorizes important programs for
our national defense and sets spending
authorization for the entire military.
Again, this process is normally very bi-
partisan, and it has been and continues
to be in the Senate.
I give Chairman INHOFE, the chair-
man of the Armed Services Committee,
my good friend from Oklahoma, and
Senator REED from Rhode Island, the
ranking member, enormous credit for
getting a bill that came out of com-
mittee 25 to 2. That is very bipartisan.
Then, when it came to the Senate
floor, it was 86 to 8. OK. That is the
Senate saying: Hey, this is really im-
portant. We are going to take care of
our military. We are going to lay out
the policies and the topline numbers
for rebuilding our military after the
massive cuts from 2010 to 2015. So that
is positive.
Why am I complaining about it?
Well, that bill right now on the House
side, as we have gone into conference,
is stuck. It is stuck. Many of the more
extreme Members on the House side,
who really aren’t big supporters of the
military—let’s call a spade a spade—
are now not allowing us to move for-
ward on any kind of compromise in the
broader NDAA as we move into con-
ference.
There are provisions that are very
important to the military that this
body strongly supported in a bipartisan
way, but right now, because of what is
going on in the House—the leadership
in the House, which seems to be a lot
more focused on other issues and not
the national security of our Nation, is
not moving forward on any com-
promise. Who does this benefit? Well, it
certainly doesn’t help our troops. It
certainly doesn’t help our military. It
certainly doesn’t help their families. I
can guarantee you, whether it is our
adversaries or potential adversaries—
Russia, China, North Korea, or Iran—as
they are watching the stalemate on the
NDAA, they are very pleased.
This is something we need to come
together and address. I am asking the
chairman of the Armed Services Com-
mittee over on the House side, Chair-
man ADAM SMITH, and others to work
with the Senate, work with Chairman
INHOFE, work with Senator REED on
getting to the compromises we all
know we need to move this bill for the
fifth year in a row to support our mili-
tary. We think that should be based on
the Senate bill.
When you have 86 Senators vote for
something—a superbipartisan major-
ity—that should be the basis for com-
promise. But it is stalled. The chair-
man of the Armed Services Committee,
Chairman INHOFE, has done a great job.
He is a very patient man. He and Sen-
ator REED, the ranking member on the
Armed Services Committee, are frus-
trated. We are frustrated. The troops
are frustrated. We don’t have much
time to waste.
Again, I would like to conclude by
saying that there is a lot of rhetoric
here. There is a lot of rhetoric about
supporting our troops. But what we
need is action. By the way, I think a
lot of times my colleagues are like,
well, you know the men and women in
the military are not really watching
this. They don’t really know that my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
have filibustered the funding for what
they need nine times in the last 41⁄2
years—nine times. It is disgraceful, in
my view. People think, well, they are
not really watching what is going on
with the NDAA, how the extreme ele-
ments of the Democratic Party and the
House side are making sure there is no
compromise so that we can’t move this
bill. Guess what. They are watching.
They know this.
When they don’t get support from the
Congress of the United States, it is a
problem for our military, not just in
terms of the resources they need but in
terms of morale. I am going to ask my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle:
The next time you go home and give
speeches about supporting our troops,
supporting our families, do me a favor.
Don’t come back to this body and fili-
buster their spending or, for the Mem-
bers of the House, don’t stake out such
obstinate positions that you know
there is going to be no compromise on
an NDAA bill that is really important
to our military and has strong bipar-
tisan support in this body.
I know some of my other colleagues
are going to be on the floor talking
about this NDAA issue, talking about
the Defense appropriations issue.
Again, let’s match the rhetoric we all
talked about with regard to Veterans
Day—about supporting our troops—
with action on the floor, not just hot
air and words.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Connecticut.
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am
here to speak about the topic of
healthcare, but while my friend from
Alaska is on the floor, I hope we can
bridge the policy disagreements we
have right now over the Defense appro-
priations bill, the appropriations proc-
ess and the authorization bill.
I have been in Congress long enough
to have heard this argument be trotted
out over and over again that if you
vote against a defense bill, then you
aren’t supporting the troops, even if
you have a legitimate policy disagree-
ment you are trying to work out. I
have heard that enough to know that it
just doesn’t match up with reality.
I was told that because I opposed the
Iraq war, I didn’t support the troops.
People in the 1970s were told that if
they didn’t support the Vietnam war,
they were opposing the troops. The fact
is, we have a legitimate policy dis-
agreement that we are trying to figure
out. Democrats don’t think we should
be taking money from defense con-
struction projects that are housing and
protecting our troops to be used to
build a border wall with Mexico that
doesn’t do anything, in our opinion, to
protect the United States compared to
the benefit of the spending on military
construction projects. We think that,
ultimately, we are serving our troops
by making sure those military con-
struction projects get funded instead of
this wall that doesn’t make sense if not
for the President’s campaign speeches.
So we have some policy disagree-
ments over the budget. I would hope
that my colleagues wouldn’t try to use
this tired argument that if anyone here
ever votes against a defense budget,
then they somehow are opposing the
troops. That is just irresponsible and
disingenuous rhetoric.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. President, I am here to talk
about a few patients from Connecticut.
We on the Democratic side are trying
to put a face to this campaign that the
President is engaged in to try to weak-
en and ultimately eliminate the Af-
fordable Care Act. Right now there is a
court case proceeding through the ap-
pellate courts that, if successful, would
immediately end the Affordable Care
Act, which provides insurance to 20
million Americans and makes sure that
everybody in this country with a pre-
existing condition doesn’t get charged
more. The President has weighed in on
behalf of that lawsuit. He hopes it will
succeed.
If it does succeed, we are going to
have a humanitarian catastrophe in
this country if 20 million people lose
their insurance and, once again, insur-
ance companies are allowed to charge
you more if you have a sickness or a
sick child. We want to make sure we
put a face on who is going to be af-
fected if President Trump’s sabotage
campaign against the Affordable Care
Act succeeds.
I know my colleagues have remarks
and are lined up to speak, so let me be
as brief as I can. I want to tell you the

make this ‘‘Patients of the Day.’’
These are folks who reached out to my
office to tell me their story.
Jason is from South Windsor, CT. He
says:
I am 54 years old and I have been pur-
chasing insurance since I entered the work-
force at 22 years old. I have arthritis that is
manageable with medication. Without that
medication and care from my physician, I
would not be able to function. I would have
difficulty with simple tasks like walking and
shaking hands.
There is no question that I rely on my in-
surance. If I were denied coverage because of
my preexisting condition, it would be dev-
astating.
Jason is one of the tens of millions of
Americans who, without the protec-
tions from the Affordable Care Act,
would likely not be able to get insur-
ance. He is perhaps months away from
that reality.
Lisa, from New Britain, writes on be-
half of her grandkids. Because some
young kids can’t speak for themselves,
their parents and grandparents speak
for them. Lisa is the proud grand-
mother of two little girls who were
born with cystic fibrosis. She worried
that if her son ever had to switch jobs
and change insurance plans or if the
preexisting condition clause was struck
down by the courts, he would be denied
coverage because of their preexisting
condition. She says:
The girls are doing so well and thriving
with the current treatment and medicine
they are on. People with cystic fibrosis are
now living longer than ever because of medi-
cine available to them. We’ve worked so hard
in keeping them healthy. If this policy of al-
lowing insurance companies to deny people
with preexisting conditions or capping life-
time maximums is allowed, you would be
taking the lives of our family members.
Finally, Giuseppina, who is a con-
cerned sister in Bridgeport writes:
My youngest brother was born 2.5 months
premature in 1977. He spent two months in
the hospital and reached his lifetime limit
from my father’s employer-provided insur-
ance before he left the hospital! In January
of 1978, he was diagnosed with hydrocephalus
due to underdevelopment or birth trauma.
Due to the massive medical debt accrued
from his multiple surgeries and hospital
stays, my family had to receive public assist-
ance. . . . My father used to cry when he
went food shopping.
I want you to remember that reality.
Remember the reality of millions of
families who went bankrupt, who lost
all their savings, who went on public
assistance because they had massive
medical debt due to the fact that they
lost coverage because of a preexisting
condition or lifetime or annual caps.
All of that can come back if the Af-
fordable Care Act is struck down. It is
important for us to come down to the
floor and remind folks about the
human face of healthcare repeal and
the consequences if we don’t stand to-
gether and at least try to make a plan
for what will happen if the lawsuit is
successful and the Affordable Care Act
is struck down by the court system.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, on that
topic, of course, all Members of the
Senate have said they are preserving
the coverage of preexisting conditions.
It is sort of like the same speech our
friend from Connecticut said he was
tired of hearing about supporting the
troops when you don’t do everything
you can to pass the Defense bill. It is
at least as old as that—maybe older—
and often as tiring.
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. President, in the shadow of Vet-
erans Day, we are here on our side of
the aisle to talk about why we are not
doing what we need to be doing to fund
the military. In my following Senator
SULLIVAN, there are multiple DAN SUL-
LIVANs who are in politics in Alaska.
The first time Senator DAN SULLIVAN
was on my radar, how could I tell them
apart? This one is Afghan Dan. There is
Afghan Dan because he was willing to
serve just like the Presiding Officer
was willing to leave law school and not
go to the JAG Corps but to go to the
Active, fighting forces of the country.
We are grateful for that. Both of them
speak with authority on these issues,
but the whole Senate and the whole
Congress would have a chance to speak
with authority on these issues if we
would just decide to do our jobs.
The way communities decide they
are going to honor Veterans Day, I
think, is unique among them. I had a
couple of events scheduled on Monday.
One was in Hartville, MO. Those in
Hartville were creating a wall of people
over the history of the country who
died in service. If you are in elemen-
tary school in Hartville today and you
look at that wall, I am confident you
will see some of the same last names of
the kids in your school.
I was at a high school event in
Camdenton at which we had about 20
World War II veterans on the stage. I
represent 500,000 veterans. My guess is
the chances of finding 20 in 1 county in
1 State is fairly hard to do these days,
but they were all there. We were also
talking about the beginning of a new
Junior ROTC Program at that high
school that will start in January.
There are 82 high school students who
are signed up to be part of that Junior
ROTC Program, which they have spent
10 years trying to put in place.
For those who have served and for
those who are willing to serve, the one
thing we can do in Congress is to pass
the two pieces of legislation that are
necessary to support that service. Un-
like in World War II and unlike in
many past conflicts, fewer than one-
half of 1 percent of the population
today serves in the military. The other
99.5 percent needs to stand up and do
what it can to be sure our military is
the best supported military in the
world. We never want an American sol-
dier, sailor, airman, marine, or a per-
son in the Coast Guard, in the National
Guard, or in the Reserves to be in a fair
fight. We always want them to be in an
unfair fight, wherein they have advan-
tages in that fight.
The only way you can be sure they
will have those advantages is to have
the training dollars, to have the equip-
ment dollars, and to have the command
structure that allows that to happen.
For 59 straight years, the Senate has
passed the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. This is the act that defines
what Congress believes should be the
guiding principles for the military for
that year—the places in which money
should be invested, the equipment that
should be bought, and the other
changes that need to be made.
The other bill we passed is the appro-
priations bill that takes that author-
ization bill and really puts the money
by it that allows it to happen. For 59
straight years, it is the only authoriza-
tion act we have passed every year. I
think we could have a really good de-
bate as to why it is the most important
of what we do and is the most impor-
tant thing the Federal Government
does. We have done it, but we can’t
seem to get it done this year. The bill
that will have the biggest pay raise in
a decade for the people in the military
has somehow been negotiated since,
roughly, June 27 of this year. It should
have been a 1-week effort, not a weeks’
and months’ effort. When somebody is
assigned to a new base, this bill will
have the money in it to encourage
spouses to go to work and do what they
do as quickly as they can possibly do it
by the bill’s facilitating and expediting
State certification.
In January, we had our first military
spouse sworn in as a member of the
Missouri bar. Her husband had come to
take a command position at Fort Leon-
ard Wood. During the first week she
was in Missouri, she was able to be
sworn in to the Missouri bar and go to
work. Whether as a therapist, a teach-
er, a truckdriver, an electrician, an en-
gineer, or a welder, if you have those
skills and if you have followed your
spouse to a new assignment, we should
make that a top priority.
That is what happens in this bill. It
supports the readiness center in
Springfield, MO. It supports the vehicle
maintenance facility at Whiteman Air
Force Base and the C–130 flight simu-
lator facility at the Rosecrans Air Na-
tional Guard Base. As a Senate, we de-
cided all of those things needed to hap-
pen. Now we need to decide as a Senate
and a Congress how to make them hap-
pen. Whether they be 24 F/A–18 Super
Hornets that the Navy wants that will
be built in St. Louis, MO, or 15 F–15s
for the Air Force, these things will not
happen unless they are authorized.
Let’s get them authorized. Let’s appro-
priate the money. We are already
weeks late. We don’t need to be months
late. It is better to have the money the
day you are supposed to have it if you
are going to spend it as wisely as we
would hope you would be able to spend
it.
I join my colleagues and, I know, the
Presiding Officer in saying we need to
get this work done. It is critical. It is

a priority. I am glad to join my col-
leagues on the floor in fighting for
those who fight for us.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PERDUE). The Senator from Arkansas.
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I join
the Senator from Missouri, the Senator
from Alaska, and the other Senators in
calling for the passage of the National
Defense Authorization Act.
This bill is the last of a breed. It is a
bill we have passed with a large bipar-
tisan majority in Congress every single
year for 58 straight years. It hasn’t
been derailed by petty, partisan poli-
tics or grievances between the parties.
It has gotten large bipartisan majori-
ties because Congress has understood
that for those 58 years, the national de-
fense must come before politics. It is
the definition of a must-pass act, but
time is short to get it right, unfortu-
nately, because of those very kinds of
petty, partisan politics.
This bill is an opportunity for us to
continue rebuilding our military after
8 years of stagnation and cuts by the
last administration. The bill would in-
crease funding to our troops by $22 bil-
lion—money that would be spent on
cutting-edge technologies, like new
vertical-lift jet engines, to give our
troops an edge in future conflicts.
This kind of investment is essential,
especially as storm clouds brew in the
Western Pacific from a rising China.
The Communist Party of China is not
derailed by petty, partisan politics;
therefore, it is investing huge sums to
transform its military into a world-
class force that will be capable of rival-
ing and, it hopes, ultimately, of defeat-
ing our own military. At the same
time, China is pursuing an aggressive
technology strategy to dominate the
next generation of military hardware.
Beijing’s ultimate goal, of course, is to
replace us not just as the most power-
ful country in the Western Pacific but
in the entire world. So we must invest
in our military right now or else we
will reap that whirlwind in the future.
There are many other important
measures that have been included in
this year’s Defense bill that will not
pass—that will not even see the light of
day—on the Senate floor if we fail to
pass the bill.
There is the Fentanyl Sanctions Act,
which is my bipartisan legislation,
that would crack down on foreign
criminals—mostly Chinese—who smug-
gle deadly poisons across our border.
Synthetic opioids kill tens of thou-
sands of Americans every year, and
that toll will continue to rise if we
don’t start to bust up the criminal net-
works that originate in China and then
come through Mexico to poison our
communities. Let’s pass the Defense
bill to give law enforcement the tools
of the Fentanyl Sanctions Act.
There is also the PCS Act, which is
my legislation that would help mili-
tary spouses transfer their occupa-
tional licenses across State lines. When
your husband or your wife is in the
military, you follow his or her career,
and if you are a lawyer or a nurse or a
teacher or any of the other hundreds of
jobs that require an occupational li-
cense in this country, you face barriers
to working and putting food on the
table for your family. This bill would
allow military spouses to continue to
pursue their careers uninterrupted,
which would therefore allow their mili-
tary servicemembers to focus on their
own missions and not worry about
their spouses’ jobs.
There is also our legislation to honor
the 241 American victims of the Beirut
marine barracks bombing that was per-
petrated by an Iranian suicide bomber
36 years ago last month. The Defense
bill would designate the anniversary of
that bombing as a national day of re-
membrance and strengthen our resolve
to fight the terrorist forces that car-
ried it out and that threaten our secu-
rity to this day.
There is also the opportunity to
strengthen trade restrictions on
Huawei by including in the Defense bill
the Defending America’s 5G Future
Act. Huawei is the eyes and ears over-
seas of the Communist Party of China,
so we must deny it access to our sen-
sitive networks and the networks of
our allies. There are 91 Senators who
voted to instruct the conference com-
mittee to include that legislation in
the Defense bill. They still hope it will
be included, but, first, we will have to
pass the Defense bill. If we don’t, then
China’s spy company stands to gain.
This is far from an exhaustive list of
the reforms that are or could be in-
cluded in this year’s Defense bill. It is
just a sample of the many valuable and
bipartisan measures that are under
consideration. They also underscore
the importance of passing the Defense
bill in the first place.
Consider the alternative to passing
the National Defense Authorization
Act—that being a terrible stopgap
spending measure that would include
zero reforms and that would degrade,
even as we face rising threats from
China and Russia every day, the fight-
ing capability of our military. A stop-
gap spending measure would freeze de-
fense spending at last year’s levels.
That is not to say that business would
go on as usual. No. Inflation would con-
tinue to erode the purchasing power of
last year’s funding levels, and the mili-
tary would have to tear up and renego-
tiate many of its multiyear contracts
with defense companies. Renegotiating
those contracts would cost billions in
administrative expenses that would
otherwise go to the pay and benefits of
our fighting men and women, to a new
aircraft, to new ships, to new guns, or
to new munitions. This so-called spend-
ing freeze would, in fact, cost tax-
payers an arm and a leg.
This is all the more reason for Con-
gress to act, once again, to pass the
National Defense Authorization Act, as
we have for 58 years, without being di-
vided by petty, partisan politics.
I urge my colleagues to put aside
their partisan objections on issues that
are really not even related to our mili-
tary. I urge them to make the hard
compromises necessary in order to pass
this bill and give our troops what they
need.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, the
world is more dangerous today than at
any time in my lifetime. We face five
threats across five domains: China,
Russia, Iran, North Korea, and ter-
rorism. The domains have gotten very
complicated—air, land, sea. Now we
have to deal with cyber and space.
But in that background, three times
over the last 50 years, this government,
under the leadership of three different
Presidents, has disinvested its military
significantly—under President Carter,
under President Clinton, and indeed
under President Obama. They cut the
military by 25 percent at least in each
one of those administrations.
The last one was extremely draco-
nian. We saw the impact of that on our
readiness, the fact that our moderniza-
tion program had been killed, and we
found ourselves falling behind what we
ought to now call near-peer competi-
tors. I would say they are peer com-
petitors now. When you look at the
money China is spending on their mili-
tary, when adjusted for purchasing
power parity, it is exactly the same as
we are spending. And they don’t have
the regulatory overhang and they don’t
have the legacy costs we have here in
the United States, so they can get
things done quicker and cheaper. In the
meantime, the world continues to be-
come very dangerous.
Yet here we are in the second month
of our fiscal year under a continuing
resolution. As we now are becoming
educated about, this is devastating our
military and has been. This is the 187th
time since the 1974 Budget Act was put
into place that we have executed a con-
tinuing resolution. It sounds really
easy. Well, we can’t get agreement on
how much to spend for the next year,
so we will just keep spending at the
same level. Some businesses do that,
but in this case with the U.S. military,
it is devastating because it locks them
into existing programs.
For example, we did an audit last
year. It was the first audit in the his-
tory of the United States of the De-
partment of Defense—the third largest
line item on our expense sheet. We did
an audit. In that audit was found and
identified by the Department of De-
fense $4 billion of obsolete programs
that nobody really wanted to keep and
continue spending on—$4 billion a year.
So right now, under this continuing

resolution, not only are we not able to
give a 3.5-percent pay raise—the larg-
est in 10 years—to our military, not
only are we not able to improve their
housing, but right now we are obliged
to keep spending $4 billion a year on
obsolete programs that the Defense De-
partment doesn’t even want. This is lu-
dicrous.
Right now, I would say we are in
gridlock. We had 88 votes here in this
Senate where we voted to approve the
National Defense Authorization Act
several weeks ago—very bipartisan, ne-
gotiating in committee. I was on the
Armed Services Committee, and we
took this very seriously. We debated,
and it was a definite fight, but we
reached compromise. We reached bipar-
tisan agreement to support and defend
our military and to make sure they are
able to do the things they want to do
to make us competitive and defend our
country. Yet here we are, 6 weeks into
this fiscal year, and we still don’t have
this year funded. We are under a con-
tinuing resolution that devastates the
military. For six decades—58 years—
each year we have been able to do that.
Yet, this year, we can’t seem to come
to an agreement because the House and
the Senate can’t get together in con-
ference and agree on exactly what it is
they want to do.
That is all window dressing. It is no
more complicated than this: The
Democratic brethren in this body and
in the House simply do not want to
allow this President to spend another
dime on building a wall around our
southern border.
Let’s put this in perspective. First of
all, we have seen on this floor just in
the last 2 hours two different com-
ments: Well, we all know that building
a border wall doesn’t really work. It
doesn’t change anything.
Well, that is absolute propaganda.
Barack Obama built 135 miles of wall.
This body approved that. And wherever
that wall was built, illegal crossings at
the southern border went down 95 per-
cent. That is not propaganda; that is
fact. It is another example of the ob-
structionism we have been witnessing
here since the day this President was
sworn in.
On Inauguration Day, January 20,
2017, the headline of the Washington
Post was ‘‘The campaign to impeach
President Trump has begun.’’ Since
day one, they have been obstructing
this President. We saw that in the con-
firmation process here. For the first
time in 230 years, we saw the minority
party not waive the 30-hour debate rule
and allow this President to get his
nominees confirmed. It has been the
slowest ever.
So we sit here today not being able
to build the space force that both sides
have agreed on. Eighty-eight people in
this body agreed that we need to go
ahead and start spending money and
doing that. We can’t do that. We can’t
put in the building blocks for the Ad-
vanced Battle Management System,
which is so important to deal with the
modern fight. We can’t rebuild our nu-
clear triad, which is in absolutely crit-
ical shape. We can’t seem to get at our
readiness right now because of the lock
we have, under this continuing resolu-
tion, on the existing contracts out
there. As was just mentioned a few
minutes ago, we have to go in and re-
negotiate all these contracts.
Last year was the first time we did
not have a continuing resolution, and
there was such a sigh of relief inside
our military because it was the first
time in a long time—over a decade—
that they didn’t have that for the first
quarter of the year.
This is devastating. It has become
habit, and we have to stop it. It is abso-
lutely insidious. It is killing our mili-
tary and keeping us from doing the
things that both sides want to do be-
cause of petty politics.
We need to modernize our force, and
we need to do it right now. This NDAA
allows us to do that. We need to ration-
alize our expenditures to make sure
that every time we are spending on our
military, it is exactly what we should
be spending it on.
We have a Volunteer Force, and we
can never take that for granted. We
have to take care of our people in uni-
form wherever they are in the world.
That means working on their mental
health, their physical health, and their
housing.
I come from a State that has nine
military installations. We take na-
tional defense very seriously in Geor-
gia and always have.
People are concerned that this grid-
lock is endangering our country. It is
time that we get together, pass this
NDAA, move on the appropriations
bill, and get this done. People back
home are watching, the people in our
military are watching, and more im-
portantly, our potential adversaries
are watching.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska.
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I want
to join my colleagues today and speak
on the importance of passing the fiscal
year 2020 Defense authorization bill.
As others have mentioned, the proc-
ess of negotiating the national defense
bill is one that has a long history on
Capitol Hill. For the past 58 years, the
Congress has found a way to come to-
gether and unite behind a bipartisan
bill that supports our servicemembers
and enables the defense of this Nation.
We must continue this tradition, and
that means recommitting to the prin-
ciples of bipartisanship and com-
promise upon which it is built.
Thanks in large part to the hard
work and the leadership of Chairman
JIM INHOFE and Ranking Member JACK
REED and the members of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, the Senate
passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan
version of this year’s National Defense
Authorization Act. The House of Rep-
resentatives, however, passed a very
different bill. The conference process is
ultimately about finding the best solu-
tion that supports our men and women
in uniform, but we have to be willing
to compromise and find consensus. We
cannot resort to political
brinksmanship.
As the chairman said last week and
as some of my colleagues have men-
tioned here today, we are running out
of time. It is essential that our col-
leagues in the House come to the table
to pass the fiscal year 2020 NDAA.
We live in a rapidly changing world
and unfortunately one that contains a
growing number of threats and chal-
lenges that our military must face
head-on. These threats demand that we
be ready, and our military can effec-
tively confront those threats only if we
provide our servicemembers with the
support they need to execute the mis-
sions, defeat the enemies of freedom,
and safeguard the Nation.
Providing for the common defense is
the highest responsibility this body
has, and that is why it is so essential
that we pass this legislation in a time-
ly manner.
As I said before, for 58 years the
NDAA has been the subject of a bipar-
tisan consensus in Congress despite all
of our other disagreements. No matter
what other issues arise, the one area in
which we must forge agreement is in
authorizing the resources our men and
women in uniform need.
Time and again, we have heard from
our senior military leaders that their
greatest obstacle is budget uncertainty
and unpredictable funding. If we do not
come together and pass this year’s
NDAA soon, we are at risk of damaging
our military capabilities and jeopard-
izing our ability to confront threats
from China, Russia, and other malign
actors.
It is essential that we work swiftly
to secure an agreement so that we do
not fail to provide the Department of
Defense with the predictable funding
they need. We must do our part and
honor the service of all our men and
women in uniform by moving this proc-
ess forward and passing the fiscal year
2020 National Defense Authorization
Act.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina.
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, first, I
want to thank Senator FISCHER for all
of her work on the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee and in so many other
areas. I am here to talk about the same
subject, the National Defense Author-
ization Act.
It may be difficult to understand the
difference between appropriating and
authorizing. We have two different
sorts of committees here. One focuses
on the resources funding their use, but
they can’t be used unless they are au-
thorized. So every year for 58 years, we
have come into the committee, we
have heard differing opinions on prior-
ities, but at the end of the day, the
amazing thing about the Senate Armed
Services Committee when it comes to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6534 November 13, 2019
the National Defense Authorization
Act is that we always reach a bipar-
tisan agreement. It passed out of the
Senate Armed Services Committee
with I believe unanimous support, and
then it got passed out of the Senate.
Normally, this happens in the June
timeframe, maybe the July timeframe.
Now here we are in November. Not only
have we not passed the National De-
fense Authorization Act, but we are at
risk of not passing anything. Now what
we are hearing about is a so-called
skinny bill that would just be the basic
authorities while we are leaving every-
thing else on the table.
I am going to talk a little bit about
the Personnel Subcommittee, which I
chair, but what do authorities mean? It
means research on new weapons sys-
tems. It means research for men and
women in a dangerous situation to
make sure the best possible technology
and training is available to make it as
safe as it can be in an unsafe environ-
ment. There are hundreds of authoriza-
tions in the National Defense Author-
ization Act that are at risk of sliding
another year for the first time in 58
years.
Now what I want to talk about is
what is at stake if we can’t reach an
agreement with Speaker PELOSI spe-
cifically in the Personnel Sub-
committee.
I actually requested the Personnel
Subcommittee because I wanted to
focus on the business of the Depart-
ment of Defense, and I wanted to focus
on military families and on the sol-
diers’ health and safety.
If we do not pass provisions that
passed out of my subcommittee and
that are in the National Defense Au-
thorization Act that passed out of the
Senate, here is what is at stake:
There is a pay raise for every soldier,
sailor, and marine—a 3.1-percent pay
raise that they could lose this year as
a result of not gaining agreement.
We have a lot of provisions in there
for military housing. I am from North
Carolina, and we have two very large
installations in North Carolina—Fort
Bragg, the home of the Global Re-
sponse Force, and Camp Lejeune, home
to a bigger population of marines than
any military installation in the world.
They are in housing today that needs
to be outfitted. They are in housing
that, quite honestly, is unsafe. This
National Defense Authorization Act
makes progress to make sure that the
families that are housed on bases are in
safe, clean settings, and quite honestly,
in some cases, they are not today,
which is why we have bipartisan sup-
port for the provisions we put into our
subcommittee mark.
Another thing that we are working
on—it is very difficult for one who
doesn’t come from a military back-
ground to understand how challenging
it is for a spouse to get a job for the
brief period of time that they may be
in one military installation or another.
This mark has provisions in it to make
sure that military spouses get employ-
ment opportunities as quickly as pos-
sible and to cut through a lot of the red
tape that they are dealing with today.
That provision is at risk.
We have also taken major steps and
tried to prevent or reduce military sex-
ual assault. Provisions in this bill, I
am convinced, because they were voted
out on a bipartisan basis, are at risk
because we can’t seem to get agree-
ment with Speaker PELOSI’s House.
Another very important area is in
places like North Carolina. In North
Carolina, Camp Lejeune alone experi-
enced over $3.5 billion in damages as
the result of the most recent hurri-
cane, and Fort Bragg is still trying to
recover from a hurricane that hap-
pened about 2 and a half years ago.
There are authorities in there to make
sure that we can rebuild these facili-
ties. Military housing, as well as of-
fices and other training facilities at
Camp Lejeune, could slip another year
if we allow what I think right now is
the impasse between the House and the
Senate to move forward.
These are all very, very important
provisions in the National Defense Au-
thorization Act. These are all provi-
sions that got bipartisan support from
this body. If you all have been watch-
ing Congress, you know that we can
have our disagreements. There are cer-
tain things that we just simply aren’t
going to see eye to eye on, but we see
eye to eye on the National Defense Au-
thorization Act. That is why I do not
understand how the House would not
come to the table and pass something
that we have successfully passed for
every year of my life.
I am 59 years old. This could be the
first time in 58 years that we run the
risk of not showing the respect that I
think the men and women in the mili-
tary, in uniform, deserve, to give them
the authority to be trained properly, to
not run the risk of working with old
authorities that could diminish train-
ing and readiness and capabilities. This
is about these folks that have sworn to
defend the Constitution and our free-
dom, and we can’t take the time to
bridge the gap and eliminate the other
reasons that divide us and at least
come together on something for 58
years we have seen our way clear to
passing and making progress, for men
and women in uniform, for soldiers,
sailors, and marines and for their fami-
lies.
So I am for the Speaker of the House
and the Members of the House to come
to terms and pass what we have done
successfully for decades. We owe it to
the men and women in uniform, and we
owe it to every American to under-
stand what is at stake if we all of a
sudden slide for a year while our adver-
saries continue to gain ground.
I hope that my colleagues will con-
tinue to come together and pass this
bipartisan legislation. It is within
reach and absolutely an expectation, I
think, of every Member of Congress to
show our men and women in uniform
respect by doing our job.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the
quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NOMINATION OF STEVEN J. MENASHI
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
am here to speak on the confirmation
of Steven Menashi to be a judge on the
United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit. We have grown accus-
tomed to the violations of norms
around here, kind of a dumbing down of
the institution. So by all of those
standards, I would ordinarily be oppos-
ing Mr. Menashi.
We have disposed of the blue slip con-
vention for Circuit Court nominees. I
just warn my colleagues, again, that
there is a price to be paid for that. The
blue slip for Circuit Court nominees is
the thing that connects a Circuit Court
nominee to a particular State so that
an Arkansas judge on the Circuit Court
of Appeals or the Rhode Island judge on
our Circuit Court of Appeals or the
Montana judge on their Circuit Court
of Appeals only is the Arkansas judge
or the Rhode Island judge or the Mon-
tana judge because we honor that blue
slip.
In another Presidency, when the shoe
is on the other foot, I don’t want to
hear any of my colleagues who have
thrown this Circuit Court blue slip out
complain when somebody who is not
even from their State gets appointed to
the so-called State seat on the Circuit
Court.
In addition, we have dealt with a lot
of unqualified candidates. I think this
administration has set the record for
ABA-designated unqualified can-
didates. This guy has never tried a
case, never taken a deposition. He ef-
fectively has not practiced law. When
he has tried to practice law, it has been
a disaster. He has been the counsel for
the Department of Education and man-
aged to have various programs that he
advised on all thrown out in court and
his Secretary held in contempt—so not
a guy who, when you get a mere legal
decision, comes up with a real winning
record.
Moreover, he refused, extremely arro-
gantly, to answer really basic ques-
tions, even to the point of frustrating
Republican members of the committee
when he was a witness before us, and
has refused to answer related questions
for the record as well.
So, for all of those reasons, this is a
pretty undesirable candidate for the
Federal bench, but it gets way, way
worse. If you look at what Mr. Menashi
has said over the years, it is quite an
astonishing window into his mind.
With respect to affirmative action, he
has compared universities—I am
quoting him here—he has compared
universities cataloging students ac-
cording to race on college applications

and official documents, which you ob-
viously do as part of any affirmative
action program, he has compared that
to the Nuremberg laws.
If you look at the issue of sexual vio-
lence, he has made fun of Take Back
the Night marches and described
women who are active and concerned
about sexual violence as—his words
here—‘‘campus gynocentrics’’—maybe
he pronounced it gynocentrics, I do not
know—campus gynocentrics. When you
are talking about sexual violence, that
is not just a normal word to use. When
you are talking about affirmative ac-
tion, reference to Nazi Nuremberg laws
is just not normal.
He has argued that gun regulations
are ‘‘pointless’’—I am quoting him
here—‘‘pointless and self-defeating be-
cause guns reduce crime.’’ Really? Ask
the victims of the firearms massacres
happening at such a horrifying rate in
this country how guns reduce crime.
With respect to the rights that have
been enshrined in our Constitution and
recognized in Roe v. Wade, giving
women the right, to some degree, of
self-determination about when to have
children, he described the rights codi-
fied in Roe v. Wade—I quote him here—
as ‘‘radical abortion rights advocated
by campus feminists.’’ Good luck, on
an issue related to a woman’s right to
choose, getting a fair hearing from this
character once he is enrobed.
He mocked the gay rights group
Human Rights Campaign, which he
said incessantly exploited the slaying
of Matthew Shepard for both financial
and political benefit. We engage in
some pretty acid rhetoric around here,
but about a young man who was mur-
dered about being gay, that is just ap-
palling. If you are in his court on an
issue in which the rights of LGBT folks
are involved, there is almost no way
that you could believe that a judge
that has thought or said anything as
vile as that could ever give you a fair
hearing.
With respect to the question of diver-
sity, which many of us consider to be
one of America’s greatest traits, social
scientists, he said, have found that
greater ethnic heterogeneity, i.e., so-
cial diversity, is associated with lower
social trust. Ethnically heterogenetic
societies exhibit less political and civic
engagement, less effective government
institutions, and fewer public goods.
First of all, I don’t think that is true.
I don’t think that stands to scrutiny.
But, second of all, it is just kind of a
creepy thing to be saying, that we
would be a better country if we mar-
shaled ourselves together into our eth-
nic enclaves, which ‘‘provide the
groundwork for social trust and polit-
ical solidarity’’—not in my world, not
in Rhode Island. That is not the way
we work. I don’t think that is the way
America works.
So whether you are looking at diver-
sity, whether you are looking at gay
rights, whether you are looking at a
woman’s right to choose, whether you
are looking at safe regulation of guns,
whether you are looking at sexual vio-
lence against women, whether you are
looking at affirmative action in col-
leges, you can find something truly
creepy that this individual has said.
That, on top of all the other disquali-
fying factors, makes him perhaps the
worst candidate that Donald Trump
has tried to put on the Federal bench—
by the way, that is in a crop of doozies.
The problem here is that people are
going to come into these courts and
they are going to have a feeling that no
American litigant should have and that
is that I have got a judge who is pre-
disposed against me, that it doesn’t
matter what my cause is. It matters
who I am.
And, sadly, I don’t think this is the
bug in these Trump judicial appoint-
ments; I think this is the feature. I
think it is the intention of the dark
money fueled apparatus that has got
this assembly line of unusual and pecu-
liar judges cranked on to our courts to
actually make sure that our courts are
more likely to rule for certain people
than others, that they are more likely
to rule for polluters, that they are
more likely to rule for gun companies,
that they are more likely to rule for
dark money political operators.
There are essentially, at this point,
with this nominee to a Circuit Court of
Appeals, no standards left—no stand-
ards left. I can’t imagine anybody
much worse.
It is a sad day.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Kansas.
S. 2330
Mr. MORAN. Madam President,
today in the Commerce Committee,
following an in-depth 18-month inves-
tigation to examine cultural and sys-
temic issues regarding abuse in the
Olympic movement, Senator
BLUMENTHAL and I introduced bipar-
tisan legislation, the Empowering
Olympic and Amateur Athletes Act of
2019. It was accompanied by an inves-
tigative report, findings, and, rec-
ommendations. I am pleased that the
Commerce Committee approved that
legislation today. This marks a signifi-
cant step forward to improving the pro-
tections and representations provided
to our amateur athletes.
The subcommittee that I chair exer-
cises jurisdiction over the U.S. Olym-
pic Committee and amateur sports at
large, and I remain fully committed to
ensuring the health and safety of all
American athletes. Our Empowering
Olympic and Amateur Athletes Act
would enact reforms to the U.S. Olym-
pic system by strengthening legal li-
ability and accountability mecha-
nisms, restoring a culture of putting
athletes first, and fortifying the inde-
pendence and capacity of the U.S. Cen-
ter for Safe Sports.
Our investigation, which led to the
foundation of the provisions in this
bill, included four subcommittee hear-
ings, interviews with Olympic athletes
and survivors, and the retrieval of
70,000 pages of documents. This was
also made possible by the supportive
leadership of the committee—the
chairman and ranking member, Sen-
ator WICKER and Senator CANTWELL—
and the contributions of the committee
staff, including the contributions of my
staff and those of former Chairman
THUNE and Ranking Member NELSON.
Also, I want to take this moment to
thank Mr. GRASSLEY, the Senator from
Iowa and the chairman now of the Fi-
nance Committee. For a portion of the
time we were dealing with this issue,
he was the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee. He, too, made contribu-
tions to our legislation, and his contin-
ued leadership on this issue in general
has helped to move this bill forward
and out of the committee today.
During our investigation, Senator
GRASSLEY indicated an interest in
working together to protect amateur
athletes. After we introduced the legis-
lation, I am pleased we were able to in-
clude provisions from his legislation
that was just introduced yesterday
here in the Senate. Specifically, the
substitute amendment included fund-
ing accountability language for safe
sports, clarification on mandatory re-
porting parties related to child abuse,
and new reporting requirements to im-
prove transparency. Senator GRASSLEY
was also successful in working with
Senator PETERS to include whistle-
blower protection language in the bill
during today’s markup.
Again, I thank Senator GRASSLEY for
his leadership and commitment to the
health and safety of our amateur ath-
letes.
Additionally, there were thoughtful
contributions to our legislation—most
recently, in the form of our substitute
amendment—from other members of
the Commerce Committee, including
Senator GARDNER of Colorado.
I also thank my colleague Senator
BLUMENTHAL, the ranking member of
the subcommittee, for his steadfast and
ongoing support and leadership that he
has shown throughout this long proc-
ess.
This investigation and legislative
process started out as a bipartisan ef-
fort to provide substantive policy pro-
tections to amateur athletes and has
remained as such. That bipartisanship
has continued and will continue to be
prioritized as we push for timely con-
sideration of this legislation on the
Senate floor.
Finally, I would be remiss not to ex-
press my sincere and humble thanks to
the survivors for their bravery in guid-
ing our policymaking with their testi-
monies and ongoing input throughout
the process. Their willingness to re-
count and relive their traumatic expe-
riences played a vital role in informing
Congress as it seeks to address key re-
porting, governance, and resource
issues within the Olympic system. This
critical legislation would not have hap-
pened without their active involve-
ment.
I will never forget the question that
was asked of me by one of the survivors

as we were gathered together in the
Russell Senate Office Building. The
question was this: Why was there more
than one? It is a question we would al-
ways hope to answer. There should
never be a victim or survivor of sexual
abuse. And if there is one, there should
never be a second.
The sad thing about this cir-
cumstance in which we found ourselves
and in which the athletes found them-
selves was that not only was there one,
but there were many more. We should
be able to take that call—why was
there ever more than one?—and make
certain that we do everything to keep
it from ever happening again.
I thank my colleagues in the Com-
merce Committee for their support on
this critical legislation. I look forward
to working with the leader and my
Senate colleagues as we push to enact
these necessary reforms.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana.
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, be-
fore I get into my comments on Agent
Orange, I just want to thank Senator
MORAN and Senator BLUMENTHAL for
leading the charge on making sure that
our Olympic athletes are protected.
There are some who say that govern-
ment has no business in this realm; I
couldn’t disagree with them more. The
fact is, this is a wrong that I think
Senator MORAN and Senator
BLUMENTHAL have tried to right. I just
want to thank them for their leader-
ship.
Mr. MORAN. I thank the Senator.
AGENT ORANGE
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I
stand here today because the Trump
administration continues to turn its
back on our Nation’s veterans, many
who are suffering from illnesses relat-
ing to Agent Orange.
Agent Orange is a very toxic defo-
liant that was used in Vietnam. Every-
body who was there was exposed to it
because it was used in such great vol-
ume.
By denying eligibility to the folks
who have suffered from that exposure
the benefits and care they need, they
are not doing right by our veterans.
The fact is, there is no logical reason
behind it except for the fact that they
don’t want to pay for it. They don’t
think the exposure to these toxic
chemicals in Vietnam are a cost of war.
Well, they are.
Today, we are telling Acting Chief of
Staff and Acting Office of Management
and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney
and other White House officials to do
their jobs and make sure these vet-
erans are taken care of.
It is time for this White House to do
right by the 83,000 veterans—that is
83,000—who are currently suffering and
dying from significant health condi-
tions associated with Agent Orange ex-
posure. This administration—the
Trump administration—needs to stop
ignoring the overwhelming scientific
evidence put forth by medical experts,
scientists, and veterans.
Internal documents obtained by a
veteran through the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act revealed that in 2017 Presi-
dent Trump’s first VA Secretary, Dr.
David Shulkin, tried to do right by
these veterans. At that time, the VA
proposed to expand the list of presump-
tive health conditions associated with
this toxic herbicide to include bladder
cancer, Parkinson’s-like symptoms,
and hypothyroidism so that these vet-
erans could become eligible for the
benefits they earned if they had these
conditions, but Mick Mulvaney and the
White House objected. They didn’t
want to spend the money. They said
they wanted more studies—studies that
would have effectively run out the
clock as more and more of these vet-
erans suffered and died.
Since then, the National Academy of
Medicine found evidence that hyper-
tension has even greater evidence of as-
sociation to Agent Orange exposure
than the conditions Dr. Shulkin at-
tempted to address. Yet the White
House still refuses to take care of these
veterans. They refuse to expand the
list to include these four conditions:
parkinsonism, bladder cancer, hyper-
tension, and hypothyroidism.
More have suffered and more have
died. These are Vietnam veterans who
are in their sixties, seventies, and
eighties. But this administration—the
same folks who are quick to beg for
nearly $20 billion for an ineffective bor-
der wall that Mexico was supposed to
pay for and who are happy to put a $1.5
trillion tax bill on the government’s
credit card—refuses to recognize that
this is a cost of war and that they need
to do right by the Vietnam veterans—
veterans who have already waited dec-
ades for the benefits and the care they
desperately need.
It is pretty simple. Do the right
thing. If you claim to be an advocate
for the veterans, no more excuses and
end the wait for these veterans and
their families. These veterans and their
families have already sacrificed great-
ly, and they should not be forced to
wait 1 minute longer. This issue needs
to be dealt with, and it needs to be
dealt with today.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NATIONAL HOMELESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH
AWARENESS MONTH
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I
rise today to talk about a resolution
that I have introduced with my fellow
Senator from Maine, SUSAN COLLINS,
and 11 other fellow Senators from both
sides of the aisle—truly bipartisan—to
designate November 2019 as National
Homeless Children and Youth Aware-
ness Month.
Specifically, this resolution high-
lights the issue of children and youth
homelessness and supports the efforts
of businesses, organizations, educators,
and volunteers who are dedicated to
meeting the needs of homeless children
and youth.
In the 2016-to-2017 school year, there
were 1.3 million children and youth—I
repeat, 1.3 million children and youth—
who experienced homelessness in the
United States.
In West Virginia alone, our schools
have identified more than 10,500 stu-
dents experiencing homelessness. This
is simply unacceptable, and we must do
more to support our future genera-
tions. That is why I am a firm believer
that there are five promises—five
promises—we, as adults, should make
to every child.
No. 1 is every child must have an un-
conditionally loving and caring adult
in their life. That is the first. Every
child must know that someone loves
them unconditionally. No matter what
you do and no matter what mistakes
you make, at the end of the day, that
person loves you. It could be your mom
or dad; it could be a grandma or
grandpa; it could be an aunt or uncle;
or it could be a neighbor, someone who
knows they have your back no matter
what.
No. 2 is every child must have a safe
place to call home where harm cannot
enter. I would hope it is the home they
live in. Sometimes it is not always the
case. Sometimes it might be a school.
It might be an after-school program. It
could be a church. It could be a neigh-
bor’s home. Every child growing up has
to have somewhere safe in their life
where harm cannot enter and they are
protected.
No. 3 is every child must have a
healthy start and access to a nutri-
tious diet. I think that is why you have
seen in our school systems that we
have expanded our nutrition programs
from breakfasts to lunches. When I
went to school way back when in rural
areas, we had no cafeterias and no
lunches, but for some reason, I could
always tell when my mom or other par-
ents had put an extra sandwich in the
lunch pail knowing that we couldn’t
eat it but somebody could. There were
always those who kind of stepped in
and helped others.
Now we have that. Every child has to
have a healthy start and access to a
nutritious diet if they are going to
grow and be engaged and, basically, be
productive.
No. 4 is every child should be taught
a livable skill so that they can make
their own way through life. Primary
and secondary education is free in
America. It makes us different from
every other country in the world. We
commit to every child that they can
get an education to be literate—every
child. That is why education should be
held to a higher standard to make sure
that they have a skill set.
There should be no child graduating
from high school who is not ready to

work or ready to learn more. We should
be able to identify in 7th, 8th, or 9th
grade what their interests are going to
be, whether they are going to be skill-
set driven or whether they are going to
be academically driven. Both are need-
ed, and we should not make them feel
like failures if they don’t go to college
because a lot of people aren’t desiring
to go to college. A lot of them want to
work with their hands. They want the
skill sets; they have that ability, and
we should identify that very early.
No. 5 is the hardest promise because
you cannot teach it. You can’t teach
this promise that you should keep to
every child—that that child should
grow to be a loving, caring adult and
give something back. They can learn
that fifth one only by how you conduct
your life, how that special adult in
their life—mom, dad, aunt, uncle, cous-
in, neighbor, after-hours group,
school—someone in their life has given
them hope: Hey, I can be that person; I
can give something back; and I can
help somebody like me.
Those are the five promises. If we
can’t keep those, then God help us all.
We owe that to every generation. To
have one child homeless in this coun-
try is wrong. Homelessness means you
have no stability; you have no func-
tional family; and you have no biologi-
cal mom or dad to go home to. You are
either couch surfing or basically living
with another relative—whatever it
may be—and this is something we have
to intervene in and make sure we can
correct.
We must keep these promises to our
children so that our future generations
will grow up to be the best they pos-
sibly can and meet all their expecta-
tions. We expect our children and
youth to care about their education,
but if they don’t have a roof over their
head or a place to sleep, if they don’t
have adequate nutrition and meals,
they can’t focus on learning as they
should be able to.
I heard one child say: I am just try-
ing to survive. I am just trying to
make it through the day and survive. I
would love to get the education you
want me to get, but when it becomes
basically survival tactics or edu-
cational tactics, survival will kick in
first.
That is what they are dealing with.
This crisis is affecting not just these
students in their homes, but it affects
their school life, too, and we must do
better to ensure that they can learn
and give back to their communities.
Speaking of doing more, there is a lot
of great work being done in my State
of West Virginia and nationally and, I
am sure, in all the States. One wonder-
ful example is the Children’s Home So-
ciety in West Virginia. I know they are
watching and are gathered for their an-
nual conference today. I want to thank
them for the incredible work they have
been doing. They have been strong
leaders in helping children and families
who experience homelessness in West
Virginia. We truly appreciate their
leadership on this issue in our State
and hope that their work can be used
as a standard for the other States to
combat this issue.
Recently, I visited South Charleston
Middle School to see the work they are
doing to address the child and youth
homelessness crisis facing our State
from the perspective of a student’s life,
much of which is spent at school. They
use Federal funding to help correctly
identify students who are homeless so
that they can provide services to those
who need them.
I hope my resolution will help raise
awareness on this issue so that more
schools can use the funds available to
support the students who are experi-
encing homelessness. In West Virginia,
the child and youth homelessness crisis
is intensified by the opioid crisis that
has ravaged our State. The lasting ef-
fects of the epidemic on our children
and future generations are terrible,
from the increase in children and
youth homelessness to a rise in youth
substance use disorder.
This crisis will continue to affect
communities like those all across West
Virginia for decades to come, which is
why we must begin to combat and ad-
dress issues like child and youth home-
lessness now.
In the middle of this crisis, there are
success stories, too, like Hannah’s.
Hannah’s parents could not care for her
because of substance use issues, so she
went to live with a family friend, who
subsequently removed all support. A
high school counselor referred Hannah
to the Youth Services System Transi-
tional Living Program, which helped
her finish high school and go on to col-
lege. She is a recipient of the YSS Ron-
ald Mulholland Futures Scholarship
and attends West Virginia University,
where she is now a junior studying
chemistry. Last summer, she com-
pleted an internship in Tennessee.
The Youth Services System is a won-
derful national organization that
works to provide shelter for children
and youth across America. Organiza-
tions like the Youth Services System
and the Children’s Home Society de-
serve recognition for their incredible
work because, without them, success
stories like Hannah’s and so many oth-
ers wouldn’t even exist. This is why we
must raise awareness of this issue so
that we can support the wonderful
work being done across the United
States every day.
I am so proud to be here today to ad-
vocate for those 1.3 million children
and youth across our Nation who need
our help and deserve our help. We must
do better for them, and I believe
strongly that this resolution is the be-
ginning to work toward solving this
major crisis our Nation has with broad
bipartisan support. If there is one thing
that brings us together, it is the chil-
dren. It is not a Democrat or Repub-
lican problem. It is a problem for all of
us. It is an American problem, and we
have to face it.
With the support of 23 national orga-
nizations, I hope this resolution will
pass quickly. I look forward to working
with my colleagues who have signed on
to this resolution and those on both
sides of the aisle to bring us back to-
gether to combat child and youth
homelessness.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana.
5G TECHNOLOGY
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I
will talk for a few minutes today about
5G technology and taxpayer money. We
have all heard the term ‘‘5G.’’ 5G
stands for fifth generation—fifth gen-
eration technology. In short, what 5G
means is incredibly fast data trans-
mission—data going from my cell
phone to the President’s cell phone, my
internet to your internet, and the abil-
ity to connect a lot of different devices
at the same time.
Through 5G technology, which is
wireless technology, we will be able not
only to transmit data very quickly, but
we will also be able to transmit huge
amounts of data—almost breathtaking
amounts—and it is going to have a
huge impact on American society. It is
going to have a huge impact on the
world.
In some respects, it is going to
change the world. If technology has
changed the world thus far—and indeed
it has; among other things, it has made
the world smaller—5G is going to
change it even more. For example, you
will be able to use your smartphone to
open your garage door. You will be able
to use your smartphone and be a mile
away but turn on your coffee maker.
We will be able to do surgery by inter-
net. Surgeons will be able to be in one
place 1,000 miles away from a patient,
and that surgeon, through robotics and
other means, will be able to transmit
the data to operate on that patient.
Driverless cars are going to change
the world dramatically—not only the
way we get around. It is going to
change our need for roads; it is going
to change our tax base; and it is going
to change the insurance market.
5G is going to allow farmers to be
prewarned about encroaching diseases.
Farmers will not have to wait to see
their crops attacked by certain dis-
eases; through 5G technology, they will
be able to know and predict that those
diseases are coming. It is going to help
us feed the world.
5G technology is going to allow our
young people to have virtual appren-
ticeships. If you are a young woman or
a young man and you are right out of
school and you are offered an appren-
ticeship or an internship, let’s say in
San Francisco, and you are living in
Duluth—say you are a student and you
say ‘‘I don’t have the money to move
to San Francisco, and I don’t have the
money to live in San Francisco,’’ you
will be able to do an internship
through technology.
It is going to be 100 times faster. In
terms of the amount of data, I don’t
know how to quantify that, but it is
going to have an extraordinary impact
on wireless technology.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6538 November 13, 2019
What are we talking about here?
When my phone calls the President’s
phone, what are we talking about?
Really, we are just talking about radio
waves. We are talking about radio
waves. A radio wave is nothing more
than electromagnetic radiation. I don’t
want to get off the subject here. When
my phone talks to the President’s
phone, we are just sending radio waves
through the air. Sometimes you might
have heard that referred to as a spec-
trum. That is basically how a cell
phone and the internet works, except
with 5G, the speed with which that
data is transmitted and the amount of
data will be substantially larger.
Who owns those radio waves and the
air through which those radio waves
travel? According to Federal law—the
Federal Communications Act of 1934—
we do. We all do. The American people
do.
The Federal Government, through
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion and other agencies, including but
not limited to Congress, regulates
those radio waves going through the
air, which we call spectrum, but those
radio waves and the air through which
they pass are owned by the American
people. Just like a national park, just
like the oil and gas offshore in Federal
waters, just like the Rocky Mountains,
they are owned by us, the American
people.
Now there are certain types of radio
waves that are owned by the American
people that are perfect for 5G tech-
nology. These radio waves and this
spectrum, if you will—I will use the
term ‘‘spectrum,’’ but remember, I am
just referring to radio waves moving
through the air. This particular spec-
trum that is perfect for 5G technology
is called the C-band. I don’t know why
they call it that, but that is what they
call it. It is between 3.7 gigahertz and
4.2 gigahertz. Don’t worry about what
that means; just know that this part of
the overall spectrum is perfect for 5G.
It is perfect because it strikes a bal-
ance between coverage and capacity.
And this C-band, if you will, is not too
hot, not too cold. It is just right for 5G.
It is critical to our development of 5G
technology.
Since the American people own this
C-band and since many of our wireless
companies want to develop and offer 5G
technology to the American people,
given those facts, the FCC is going to
play an integral part. The FCC licenses
spectrum to companies that want to
use it. In other words, if you are a wire-
less company and you want to use a
portion of the spectrum—the radio
waves going through the air that are
owned by the American people—you go
to the FCC and say: I want to license
that spectrum, and I want to pay for it.
By law—not by custom; by law—the
FCC says: OK. To be fair, we are going
to hold an auction, and everybody who
wants to bid on this portion of the
spectrum can submit a bid.
In the last 25 years, the FCC has done
an extraordinary job, by the way, of
getting spectrum out to the private
sector and getting the American tax-
payer paid for its property interest. In
the last 25 years, the FCC has con-
ducted over 100 of these auctions. The
FCC has brought in $123 billion for the
American people—billion. That is nine
zeros. I have met with folks at the FCC
who handle the public auctions. They
are incredibly experienced. They know
what they are doing.
Let me get back to the C-band. When
we left off, we were talking about the
C-band being perfect for 5G. We have a
lot of wireless companies that want to
lease it, if you will—want to license
it—and the FCC is there in the middle.
You would expect that what we would
do in this instance is what we always
do—we hold a public auction.
It has been estimated that if we hold
a public auction, if the FCC holds a
public auction and tells all the wireless
companies that want to bid to come on
down and bid, it will bring in $60 billion
for the American people—$60 billion.
Do you know what we could do with $60
billion? With $60 billion, we could put 1
million kids through college for all 4
years. With $60 billion, we could hire 1
million new cops for a year. With $60
billion, we could build 7,000 miles of
interstate. With $60 billion, we could
make sure that broadband reaches
every crevice and corner of America
because right now it doesn’t.
If you are in a rural area right now—
I don’t want to overstate my case, but
in many instances, if you are in a rural
area, you don’t have the same
broadband both in terms of reach and
coverage and speed that people have in
a large city, and that is true even be-
fore we get to 5G.
We could even give the money back
to people. We have 140 million tax-
payers in America. If we gave $60 bil-
lion back to 140 million taxpayers, that
is about $430 for every taxpayer in
America. I am not suggesting we do
that. That is above my pay grade, mak-
ing that decision. For a lot of people,
$430 isn’t that much money, but I have
a lot of friends who would say $430 is a
lot of money.
But in the middle of what I just de-
scribed, we have a hair on the biscuit.
We have three companies—and I am
not disparaging them. Two of them are
headquartered in Luxembourg, and one
is out of Canada. They are foreign sat-
ellite companies. They have gone to
the FCC and they have said: Look, we
are going to make you a deal. We know
we need to get this 5G, this C-band
spectrum, into the market as quickly
as possible. We will do the auction for
you.
It doesn’t matter that the FCC has
already done 100 auctions and brought
in $123 billion. These three foreign
companies have gone to the FCC and
said: Let us do the auction for you be-
cause we can do it better and quicker
even though we have never done a pub-
lic auction.
Then they told the FCC: By the way,
we want to keep the money. We can do
it faster than you, FCC. Even though
you have done 100-plus auctions and we
have never done one, just trust us. We
can do it faster than you, and we want
you to give us the spectrum and let us
keep the $60 billion.
The FCC is considering doing it.
My State has a lot of oil and gas. The
Federal Government—the American
taxpayer—owns the seabed of much of
the Gulf of Mexico. Periodically, on be-
half of the American people, the Fed-
eral Government leases that seabed to
oil and gas companies to explore for oil
and gas. When the Federal Government
leases the land, the Federal Govern-
ment takes an upfront cash payment
and a portion of any oil and gas that is
found.
Can you imagine what would happen
if I went to the Federal Government
and said: Even though I have never
done an oil and gas auction, I can do it
faster than the Federal Government
even though the Federal Government
has done thousands of them. So I want
you to give me all the minerals in the
gulf and let me do the auction and keep
the money.
Can you imagine the reaction if I ap-
proached the Federal Government? The
people in charge of those oil and gas
leases would do one of two things. I
would end up in either handcuffs or a
straitjacket. But that is what is being
proposed here, and for the life of me, I
do not understand why the FCC is tak-
ing this seriously.
An article just came out a couple of
days ago. I will read the first sentence
of it. It came out of a periodical called
Market Watch on November 11, just a
few days ago.
It starts: ‘‘A big step in the U.S. de-
ployment of 5G wireless could take
place by year’s end as the Federal Com-
munications Commission is expected to
back a plan from the satellite industry
for auctioning off radio spectrum.’’
They called a couple of investment
bankers. One investment bank group is
called Height Capital Markets, and an-
other one is called Beacon Policy Advi-
sors. I don’t know where they are get-
ting their information, but they are
saying that the FCC has already agreed
not to do a public auction but to let
these foreign companies have the spec-
trum and get the $60 billion.
The article goes on to explain that
these three companies—these three for-
eign companies, the two Luxembourg
companies and the Canadian com-
pany—spent $515,000 lobbying regu-
lators and lawmakers on its auction
plan.
Then I go back and I look at another
article that came out not too long ago,
and it talks about one FCC Commis-
sioner. It sounds like he is already
sold. He was asked about the idea of
just giving the spectrum to these for-
eign companies and letting them keep
the money.
Here is what he said: ‘‘Most of the
criticism of what is known as the CBA
proposal’’—that is the proposal by the
private companies—‘‘shows a lack of

understanding of how the Internal
Commission works. . . . [D]on’t let
anyone try to lecture me on the com-
mission’s . . . efficiency and timeli-
ness.
This Commissioner goes on to say:
If someone or some entities make a profit
for being at the right place at the right time,
I will live with that outcome. In the grand
scheme of things, if it is a contest between
speed and government trying to extract a
significant piece of the transaction through
a lengthy process, I’ll take the speedy reso-
lution.’’
Are you kidding me? What planet did
he just parachute in from? This is a
current member of the FCC. Somebody
needs to tell him about the President’s
Executive order, right here: ‘‘Buy
American and Hire American.’’ It
doesn’t say ‘‘hire Luxembourg compa-
nies.’’ I have nothing against Luxem-
bourg companies; I just prefer Amer-
ican companies. It doesn’t say ‘‘buy Ca-
nadian companies and hire Canadian.’’
I can tell you what is going to hap-
pen if the FCC does this. First of all,
the American people are going to lose
$60 billion. No. 2, they are going to get
sued. They say they can do it faster—
I don’t believe them—but I know this
much: I know a little something about
litigation. I used to do it for a living.
They are going to be tied up in court
for about 10 years—I can tell you
that—because the Federal Communica-
tions Act requires a public auction.
I can tell you what else is going to
happen. The people who live in rural
communities are going to get the little
end of nothing because we won’t be
able to control who gets this C-band. I
will bet you that the companies that
end up with it start—and I hope I am
wrong—and remain in the cities. So if
you live in the country, where I was
raised, you won’t get the benefit of 5G.
Also, if we give it to these three for-
eign companies and they get to decide
who gets the C-band, how do we control
who ends up with our spectrum? What
if they give it to Huawei? What if they
give it to a company that violates our
national security and our national in-
telligence?
This is a really bad idea, folks. There
is a bill that has been offered. It is a bi-
partisan bill in the House. I am going
to sponsor it in the Senate. It is offered
by two Republicans and two Demo-
crats. The bill is very simple. It says:
Do the right thing. This spectrum be-
longs to the American people. This C-
band belongs to the American people.
That $60 billion belongs to the Amer-
ican people. I am asking my friends at
the FCC to do the right thing. Do what
you have done 100 times already, and
let everybody bid. Let everybody bid.
Take the $60 billion that you get from
the American people, and let’s spend it
on something the American people
need.
I thank you for your time and atten-
tion.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S.R. 420
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, ear-
lier this week, we celebrated Veterans
Day, a day we honor the sacrifice and
the service of those who fought in Nor-
mandy and Pearl Harbor and Inchon, at
Khe Sanh, Somalia, Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Kandahar, Mosul, and ev-
erywhere else where veterans work to
protect our country. We owe them and
their families a debt that we often fall
short in repaying. That is what this is
about today.
For years, the VA has been presented
with scientific information from the
National Academy of Sciences making
it clear that the list of the conditions
stemming from Agent Orange exposure
is extensive. It includes hyper-
thyroidism, bladder cancer, Parkin-
son’s-like symptoms, and hypertension.
In the late iteration of the Veterans
and Agent Orange Exposure Update 11,
published a year ago, the National
Academies recognized that those ill-
nesses—hypothyroidism, bladder can-
cer, Parkinson’s-like symptoms, and
hypertension—all have suggestive or
sufficient evidence associated with
Agent Orange.
Historically, the VA added illnesses
in those two categories to the list of
presumptive medical conditions associ-
ated with Agent Orange exposure. On a
bipartisan basis, this Congress has
done the right thing time after time.
We are all on the same side when it
comes to helping veterans who were ex-
posed to Agent Orange in Vietnam.
We recently found out that former
VA Secretary Shulkin decided to add
three of these conditions to the list of
presumptive medical conditions associ-
ated with that exposure only to have
OMB—the Trump administration—
block his decision. In an email to Di-
rector Mulvaney, Secretary Shulkin
said adding these conditions was ‘‘im-
perative.’’ Yet no action took place.
There are 83,000 veterans living with at
least 1 of the presumptive medical con-
ditions—83,000. They are in Tennessee.
They are in Georgia. They are in South
Dakota. They are in Ohio. In a discus-
sion with blue water Navy veterans
last week, I learned that since the De-
partment put a stay on adjudicating
their Agent Orange claims earlier this
year, 12 veterans have died. Time is
running out. Some might accuse this
body of waiting until they all die. As
hard as it is to say that and hear that,
we are waiting until they all die before
we move.
For whatever political reason the ad-
ministration seems to place on this, we
need to ensure that veterans receive
the healthcare and the compensation
they earned. They shouldn’t have to
fight these one at a time when there
are sick men and women veterans of
Vietnam. We did this to them. The
American Government decided to spray
Agent Orange. We knew it was harm-
ful. We know it is harmful. We knew it
then, and we know it now. The chem-
ical companies knew and the govern-
ment knew. Why does the administra-
tion now think it is OK to abandon our
commitment to these veterans? If you
are exposed to poison while serving our
country, there should be no question
that you deserve the benefits you
earned. Period. No exception.
Madam President, as in legislative
session, I ask unanimous consent that
the Senate proceed to the immediate
consideration of S. Res. 420, encour-
aging the President to expand the list
of the Department of Veterans Affairs
of presumptive medical conditions as-
sociated with exposure to Agent Or-
ange to include parkinsonism, bladder
cancer, hypertension, hypothyroidism,
which was submitted earlier today; I
further ask that the resolution be
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to,
and the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table
with no intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. ISAKSON. I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Georgia.
Mr. ISAKSON. Reserving the right to
object, I want to say to my committee
member how much I appreciate his
dedicated work. In the committee, we
work on a lot of things, including the
diseases in here, getting presumptive
conclusions done so we can cover as
much as possible, but medicine is not
exact. Diseases are not exact. Cir-
cumstances are not exact. When you
make a decision to include a benefit for
our veterans, you are making a com-
mitment to spend that money from the
taxpayers of the United States of
America.
In the committee—and the Senator is
part of it, and he knows this because I
helped him a lot—we just approved
blue water Navy funds, which is going
to be one of the largest increases in the
history of benefits going to our vet-
erans. We are circumventing into that
some of the due diligence—which you
really ought to do before you make a
presumption of the diseases caused in
all cases.
I am an alumni of the Georgia Air
National Guard and a veteran. I am
chairman of the committee. I think the
world of the Senator from Ohio. What
he is trying to do is great and right,
just as he wanted to lead us to help get
us where we got to on the blue water
Navy funds, but I object to this motion
as one who would benefit because I
have Parkinson’s. I went into service
during the 1960s, during a year that
would be considered the Vietnam era. I
didn’t serve in Vietnam, but I served in
that era, so I would have consideration
if I got Parkinson’s disease—which I
have Parkinson’s. Then they can use
that as a conclusion to find out if it

was presumptively caused or not by the
exposure I had.
I am just telling you as one who, if I
wanted to, could take a benefit from
this end run. I am not going to do it be-
cause I think it is time, as chairman of
the committee—that it is time we
make sure that every benefit we prom-
ise veterans, that we have the money
to do it so we don’t spend too much
money on other benefits and leave our-
selves short for theirs.
I object to the motion.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Senator ISAKSON knows
this is no sort of false kind of flattery.
He knows how much I think of him. He
runs the most bipartisan committee in
the Senate. I have been honored to be
on it my entire 13 years in this body.
No Ohioan ever served on this com-
mittee as long as I have. I consider
that a privilege, No. 1, and an oppor-
tunity to pay people back.
I didn’t serve in the military. I know
Senator ISAKSON did. President Trump
had deferments from Vietnam. He
didn’t serve in the military. I think
that maybe perhaps, because I didn’t
serve in the military, I should work a
little bit harder to make sure those
people, most of whom are older than I
by a little bit, during the Vietnam
war—that they be treated better than
they were by the country and by the
public upon their return from Vietnam;
that they, in this case, get the benefit
of the doubt and the history of what
happened with Agent Orange.
You may remember years and years
ago, veterans—people who had fought
in Vietnam and had been exposed to
Agent Orange—had to prove, initially,
case by case, why they got sick, which
was darn near impossible, especially
when you are sick, trying to do that
and go through that pain.
Congress, on a bipartisan basis, did
the right thing back then. They put a
list of these illnesses together that ex-
posure to Agent Orange was likely re-
sponsible for. If you had one of these
illnesses and you were boots on the
ground in Vietnam, you automatically
qualified. You didn’t have to fight in
court. You didn’t have to get lawyers
or do any of that. That was then.
Now, even though Secretary
Shulkin—and I don’t know how many
Secretaries have come and gone. The
President can’t seem to keep Secre-
taries of the VA or staff of the VA be-
cause of the erratic policy he follows
with veterans. The President of the
United States goes to New York and
makes a great speech about veterans,
and we all applaud that, but then he is
not willing to give them the benefit of
the doubt. These are four illnesses Sec-
retary Shulkin thought—you heard the
term I used earlier, which is the term
he used—he used the term about these
conditions that it was ‘‘imperative’’
that we do something.
I understand as well as anybody how
important it is to protect taxpayers. I
also remember less than 2 years ago
that Congress gave a tax cut—hundreds
of billions of dollars, and 70 percent of
it went to the richest 1 percent of peo-
ple in this country—and we can’t come
up with a few billion dollars to help
veterans who are dying from these four
illnesses? We can’t expand this list and
give them healthcare as we try to com-
fort them at the VA in Cleveland and
Dayton and Cincinnati and Columbus
and in Atlanta—all over? This is no end
run around process. These aren’t four
illnesses I heard somebody talk about
in Steubenville or Cleveland that ought
to be covered. These are four illnesses
the VA has looked at, the scientific
community has looked at, the medical
community has looked at, and Sec-
retary Shulkin—who served as Sec-
retary of the VA, appointed by Presi-
dent Trump, initially was acting under
President Obama—we can’t give them
the benefit of the doubt? This is no end
run. We can’t give them the benefit of
the doubt and say, yes, we should cover
this. I hope the chairman of the Vet-
erans’ Committee—that at some point
we can sit down and talk and he can re-
consider.
Why do we think we need to protect
President Trump, who, like me, didn’t
serve in the military? For me, it—I will
not get into that. But why can’t we
help these veterans and give them the
benefit of the doubt, cover these ill-
nesses, and move forward with the VA
taking care of people the way we
should?

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, it has
now been 13 months since the adminis-
tration concluded negotiations on the
United States-Mexico-Canada Free
Trade Agreement. It has been 13
months of uncertainty for U.S. farmers
and ranchers, manufacturers, small
businesses, digital firms, financial in-
stitutions, and many others. It has
been 13 months of wondering what the
rules of the road on trade are going to
look like going forward.
We should have passed the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
months ago. The Republicans in the
Senate have been ready to take up this
agreement for a long time, but trade
agreements have to be considered by
the House of Representatives first, and
the House of Representatives is con-
trolled by the Democratic Party, which
is far more interested in partisan pur-
suits than in actually doing any mean-
ingful legislating.
While the House Democrats are
happy to consider far-left messaging
bills that have no chance of going any-
where, they have no interest in work-
ing with the Republicans to actually
get something signed into law. Why?
The Democrats have convinced them-
selves that partisan posturing is more
important than securing a bipartisan
legislative victory, like a strong, new
trade deal that will benefit the Amer-
ican economy. So they are currently
opposing a trade agreement that would
benefit millions of American workers.
Let’s be very clear. The Democrats’
decision to prioritize partisan politics
is having real consequences for the
American people. Right now, the mem-
bers of our military are unable to fund
new priorities because the Senate
Democrats are blocking the consider-
ation of Defense appropriations. Farm-
ers and ranchers in my home State of
South Dakota and around the country
are struggling, but the House Demo-
crats refuse to move forward on a trade
deal—the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement—that would bring them re-
lief.
Thanks to low commodity and live-
stock prices, natural disasters, and
protracted trade disputes, farmers and
ranchers have had a tough few years,
and one of the biggest things we can do
to help them is to take action on trade.
Our Nation’s farmers and ranchers de-
pend on trade.
When I talk to farmers and ranchers
at home in South Dakota, they empha-
size that the most important thing
Washington can do to boost our agri-
cultural economy is to take action on
trade agreements. Farmers and ranch-
ers need access to new and expanded
markets for their products, and, just as
importantly, they need certainty about
what international markets are going
to look like going forward.
The United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement would help to meet those
needs. It would preserve and expand
farmers’ access to two critical export
markets, and it would give farmers cer-
tainty about what these markets will
look like long term.
I am particularly pleased with the
improvements the agreement makes
for dairy producers. South Dakota has
experienced a major dairy expansion
over the past few years, and this agree-
ment will benefit U.S. dairy producers
by substantially expanding market ac-
cess in Canada, where U.S. dairy sales
have been restricted. In fact, the U.S.
International Trade Commission esti-
mates the agreement will boost U.S.
dairy exports by more than $277 mil-
lion.
The agreement will expand market
access for U.S. poultry and egg pro-
ducers, and it will make it easier for
U.S. producers to export wheat to Can-
ada.
Of course, the benefits for the agri-
cultural industry are just one part of
this agreement. From manufacturing
to digital services, to the automotive
industry, virtually every sector of our
economy will benefit from the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The
USMCA breaks new ground by includ-
ing a chapter specifically focused on
small and medium-sized businesses. It
is the first time that a U.S. trade
agreement has ever included a dedi-
cated chapter on this topic. Roughly,
120,000 small and medium-sized busi-
nesses around our country export goods
and services to Mexico and to Canada.
The USMCA will make it easier for
these businesses to successfully export
their products.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6541
November 13, 2019
It would be nice if the House Demo-
crats woke up tomorrow and decided
that 13 months was long enough to
make America’s farmers and ranchers
and manufacturers and small business
men wait for the United States-Mex-
ico-Canada Agreement, but my hopes
of seeing action from the House grow
dimmer each day.
The Democrats in the House should
be addressing the American people’s
priorities. American workers shouldn’t
be sacrificed for the Democrats’ par-
tisan political goals. I hope that
enough of my Democratic colleagues in
the House of Representatives will urge
their House leadership to bring up the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment in the very near future. Ameri-
cans have waited long enough.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate Senator THUNE’s comments about
the USMCA. Some might call it
NAFTA 1.6. It just doesn’t do very
much. I was not in this body when
NAFTA passed. I was down the hall in
the House of Representatives. I voted
against it.
I saw what NAFTA did to my State
and what it did to our country in the
number of lost manufacturing jobs.
States in the industrial Midwest still
have not recovered from that legisla-
tion, from that trade agreement—the
North American Free Trade Agree-
ment. During the Clinton administra-
tion, I opposed the President of my
own party on this. In the Bush admin-
istration, the other party pushed the
one for Central America. There was one
after another after another of these
trade agreements, and we see the lost
jobs. President Trump made a huge
campaign promise that he was going to
do something about it, and this agree-
ment simply doesn’t do it.
We have talked to the U.S. Trade
Representative repeatedly about en-
forcing labor standards. The whole
point of fixing this agreement is so
that companies will not shut down in
Mansfield, in Zanesville, and in Lima,
OH, and move to Mexico to build plants
there and sell the products back to the
United States. Yet do you know what
is happening? Even the USMCA has no
language in it that is going to stop the
outsourcing of jobs. So, if this Congress
moves on the USMCA, you can bet that
month after month after month, we are
going to lose manufacturing jobs, that
the business plan of shutting down pro-
duction in Ohio, in Rhode Island, in
North or South Dakota, or in Montana
will continue, and that the USMCA
will not do anything about it.
This is the same President who went
to Youngstown, OH, as Lordstown was
about to shut down, and said: Don’t sell
your homes. We are going to bring
those jobs back.
No, we aren’t. GM moved more and
more jobs to Mexico at the same time
it shut down the GM plant in
Lordstown, OH. There were 4,500 jobs
lost. This USMCA is simply a
wallpapering over of an agreement. It
doesn’t do what you have to do to stop
the outsourcing of jobs.
I look at trade agreements in one
way. Does it mean more jobs in our
country or does it mean fewer jobs?
The USMCA will do nothing to stem
the tide of jobs that are moving to
Mexico. That is why we should go back
to the table and include the Brown-
Wyden amendment on labor enforce-
ment—language that will, in fact,
mean there will be more prosperity in
both countries.
I thank Senator WHITEHOUSE for
yielding the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
am not going to be that long. I ask
unanimous consent to speak for up to
half an hour as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
TRIBUTE TO ADENA LEIBMAN
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President,
today is my 258th ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’
speech, and I want to use this occasion
to take us back to our oceans.
Before I get into the substance of my
remarks, I note that this will be the
last ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ speech during
which Adena Leibman will be with me.
She has been closely involved in all of
my office’s oceans work. She has, in-
deed, led it. She came to my office as a
Knauss fellow.
We loved Dean Knauss in Rhode Is-
land. He was the dean of the Graduate
School of Oceanography at the Univer-
sity of Rhode Island. In working with
Senator Pell, he helped to launch
NOAA, helped to start the Sea Grant
Program, and was extremely signifi-
cant in the ocean work of our govern-
ment. So one being a Knauss fellow—
one of the Knauss legacies—is a really
big deal and is a particularly big deal
in Rhode Island.
Adena has been coordinating the
oceans work now for 4 years and has
also been coordinating our appropria-
tions work. In the time that Adena has
been working on this, the bipartisan
Oceans Caucus, which Senator MUR-
KOWSKI and I established, has grown to
40 Members. It is very bipartisan. It is
very effective. We set it up as a work-
ing caucus, and it is working.
Adena helped us get the Coastal Re-
silience Fund passed into law. It is now
producing tens of millions of dollars in
grants for coastal communities that
need the support as sea levels rise.
She helped to get the Save Our Seas
Act passed. That was a unanimous ef-
fort. DAN SULLIVAN, of Alaska, was a
remarkable partner in all of that. The
participants in that included leaders
from landlocked States. Senator
INHOFE was a real leader on that bill.
We had such a good time with it that
we are now working on Save Our Seas
2.0, which today came through the
Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation Committee after having passed
the Foreign Relations Committee
unanimously and the Environment and
Public Works Committee unanimously.
We are hoping that soon we will be able
to organize the floor consideration of it
and, perhaps, pass it by unanimous
consent in the way we did with the
Save Our Seas Act. The work of all of
that progress in those committees and
the negotiating of Save Our Seas 2.0
was led by Adena.
Lastly, this week, I started going
around to collect cosponsors for Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI’s and my BLUE
GLOBE Act, which is the ocean data
monitoring bill that we have worked
on and are now ready to launch. An
enormous amount of preparatory work
goes into getting that ready—getting
supporters lined up and doing all of the
work of cross-referencing the different
points of view—and getting a bill that
we also hope stands a good chance of
passing this body by unanimous con-
sent. So I give the speech with grati-
tude to Adena for her work.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. President, the oceans send a
clear and consistent signal about cli-
mate change, and it is a signal that has
been untainted by fossil fuel industry
propaganda attacks that have been
problematic in other areas. The signals
are untainted for good reason, because
it is hard to dispute sea level rise
measured with tide gauges all around
the country. It is hard to dispute acidi-
fication that is measured with the kind
of pH test kit that a middle school
science classroom has, and it is hard to
dispute rising ocean temperatures that
are measured with that complex, ana-
lytical device—the thermometer. Even
the fossil fuel industry has trouble
fouling the climate signals from our
oceans.
The recent ‘‘Special Report on the
Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing
Climate’’ confirms through grim data
that the health of our oceans is in
rapid decline, and it confirms that
these changes are caused not by nature
but by man. Headlines extracted from
the report are pretty alarming.
These are quotes: ‘‘The global ocean
. . . has taken up more than 90 percent
of the excess heat in the climate sys-
tem.’’
‘‘ . . . the rate of ocean warming has
more than doubled.’’
‘‘Marine heatwaves . . . are increas-
ing in intensity.’’
‘‘ . . . the ocean has undergone in-
creasing ocean acidification.’’
‘‘ . . . mean sea level is rising. . . . ’’
‘‘Increases in tropical cyclone winds
and rainfall . . . increases in extreme
waves . . . extreme sea level events and
coastal hazards.’’
‘‘ . . . multiple climate-related haz-
ards. . . . ’’
As if that is not enough, ‘‘the ocean
is projected to transition to unprece-
dented conditions.’’
It is a grim warning.
Look at acidification. Ocean acidifi-
cation is a chemical phenomenon. It is
not deniable. You can replicate it in a
middle school science lab. You can
demonstrate it with your breath and a

glass of water and an aquarium bubbler
and a pH strip, as I have done from this
desk.
The oceans absorb around 30 percent
of our excess CO2 emissions in a chem-
ical interaction that takes up the CO2
but acidifies the seawater. Off our west
coast, the humble pteropod is a build-
ing block in the oceanic food chain.
Studies show the pteropod suffering
‘‘severe shell damage,’’ worsened by
acidification. It is hard to make and
maintain a shell in acidifying seas.
Coral reefs are dying from acidifica-
tion. The great ocean die-offs in geo-
logic eras before humans existed were
signaled by ocean acidification. So
that is serious.
Look at heat. The oceans absorb over
90 percent of the excess atmospheric
heat—not 30 percent like the CO2—that
we have trapped in our atmosphere
with greenhouse gas emissions.
So think about it. All the terrestrial
effects that we are already seeing from
climate change come from less than
one-tenth of the excess heat that we
have trapped. The heat going into the
oceans is sparing us humans a real ca-
tastrophe, but all that heat is changing
the oceans. It is four Hiroshima-size
bombs’ worth of heat energy added to
our oceans every second—four Hiro-
shima explosions worth of heat energy
per second is the rate of ocean heating.
The rate of this ocean heating has al-
ready doubled, and the ocean is pro-
jected to absorb from five to seven
times more heat by 2100. So it is heat-
ing at the rate at which its heating is
accelerating.
What does that mean? Well, warming
seas expand—that is a basic law of
physics—and along with melting gla-
ciers and ice sheets, that means seas
rise: so far, about 6 inches globally; on
Rhode Island shores, already nearly a
foot. On our current trajectory, that is
more than 3 feet globally by 2100 and
more than 6 feet along our shores in
Rhode Island.
This is northern Rhode Island. This is
Narragansett Bay, and all of these
areas that you see that are blue are
land now. They are peoples’ homes.
They are peoples’ businesses. There are
roads and infrastructure—all projected
to disappear, all projected to be swal-
lowed by rising seas by the end of the
century if we keep fiddling around here
and not paying attention.
The First Street Foundation cal-
culates that coastal communities like
these along our east coast and in the
Gulf of Mexico States have already lost
more than $15 billion in relative prop-
erty values as the insurance and mort-
gage markets start to look at sea level
rise and flooding, and it affects housing
prices.
In Rhode Island alone, they estimate
about $45 million in relative property
value lost. Predicted ahead is a coastal
property values crash. That is not com-
ing from an environmental organiza-
tion. That is coming from Freddie Mac,
the great American mortgage corpora-
tion.
And it is global. The New York Times
recently reported new research ‘‘that
some 150 million people are now living
on land that will be below the high-tide
line by mid-century’’—150 million peo-
ple.
A UK study warns global sea level
rise could cost $14 trillion annually by
2100.
This is what Freddie Mac has to say
about this coastal property values
crash: ‘‘The economic losses and social
disruption of the coastal property val-
ues crash may happen gradually, but
they are likely to be greater in total
than those experienced in the housing
crisis and Great Recession.’’ For those
of us who lived through the 2008 melt-
down, we don’t want to go there again.
Freddie Mac is forecasting that it is
going to happen because of coastal
property values.
Look here to the Pacific. A new Cli-
mate Central study shows that ‘‘chron-
ic coastal flooding or permanent inun-
dation threatens areas occupied by
more than 10 percent of the current
population of nations including Ban-
gladesh, Vietnam, and many small is-
land developing states.’’
Here is the southern part of Vietnam,
swallowed up by high tide in 2050. That
was the projection just a few years ago
with the flooding that was going to
come into the Vietnam delta area, up
here, in Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon.
This is the new projection for 2050—all
of it under water, including a good part
of Saigon City.
As one of the authors of the report
said, ‘‘most sea level rise here between
now and 2050 is already baked in.’’ Dec-
ades more of sea level rise means the
fate of many coastal communities here
and around the world is already sealed,
which may explain the 2013 warning by
the commander of our U.S. forces in
the Pacific that upheaval related to
climate change ‘‘is probably the most
likely thing that is going to happen
. . . that will cripple the security envi-
ronment.’’ He said:
You have the real potential here in the
not-too-distant future of nations displaced
by rising sea level. . . . If it goes bad, you
could have hundreds of thousands or millions
of people displaced and then security will
start to crumble pretty quickly.
Well, here it is, as predicted by our
Navy in 2013.
Thankfully, countries around the
globe are awakening to the problems in
our oceans. In 2015, I fought to protect
a mention—a mention—of oceans in
the Paris climate agreement. This
year’s original host, Chile, christened
the entire upcoming climate meeting a
‘‘Blue COP’’ with a blue vision of re-
pairing ocean health.
I attended, as a U.S. congressional
delegation of one, this year’s inter-
national Our Ocean conference in Oslo,
where advocates, corporations, and
governments from around the world,
even the helpless Trump administra-
tion, made national and corporate and
regional ocean commitments.
Norway leads a panel of 14 nations—
14 heads of state and the United Na-
tions Special Envoy for the Ocean, ad-
vised by people like our own former
NOAA Administrator, Jane Lubchenko.
A recent panel report outlined five
major ocean initiatives that could re-
duce 20 percent of global emissions by
2050.
The United Nations also declared the
2020s the ‘‘Decade of Ocean Science for
Sustainable Development.’’ The world
has turned toward action on oceans.
Now, usually, in confronting threats
of this magnitude, the United States
sets an example of leadership. We are
abandoning that tradition. In conversa-
tions about climate change and ocean
challenges, the United States is, at
best, absent. At worst, we are the ob-
struction. That is a mistake. The
United States should not lose its place
as an international leader, not if we
care about our vaunted role as the in-
dispensable Nation and not if we care
about the security and prosperity of
our democracy.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Other
ocean threats have prompted Congress
to do what is right. We passed inter-
national fisheries treaties and the Port
States Measures enforcement law. We
did it unanimously here in the Senate,
and now satellites are seeking out and
tracking pirate fishing ships to bring
them to justice.
We passed our first marine plastics
legislation unanimously, and a bigger,
better marine plastics bill is moving in
the Senate right.
Now Senator MURKOWSKI and I are
moving the biggest ocean data bill
since NOAA was founded through our
bipartisan Oceans Caucus.
So, yes, we can do better, and we
must.
Henry Kissinger once told me that
the great revolutions of the world have
come about from what he called a con-
fluence of resentments. Well, the poor-
est—those who depend most closely on
the oceans, those who lead subsistence
lives—will suffer most the brunt of the
coming crisis, and they will resent it.
Look at fisheries. The poorest starve
when their fisheries collapse. Others
are distressed when fisheries collapse
but have the resources to migrate or
find alternative food sources. For
wealthy nations, like ours, the fish in
our air-conditioned supermarkets may
cost a bit more, but our lives aren’t se-
riously affected. But when the poor and
distressed are hurt like that, they will
resent it. That is human nature, and if
you turn the pain up high enough, well,
good luck defending to them the sys-
tems of parliamentary democracy and
market capitalism that countenanced
their suffering.
Years ago, Daniel Webster described
the work of our Founders as having set
the world an example. He went on to
say that ‘‘the last hopes of mankind,
therefore, rest with us.’’ From Jona-
than Winthrop to Ronald Reagan, we
have called America ‘‘a city on a hill,’’
set high for the world to witness. Presi-
dent Clinton argued that ‘‘people . . .
have always been more impressed by

the power of our example than the ex-
ample of our power.’’
We still tout our system of democ-
racy and capitalism as a beacon of suc-
cess and progress, but we have aided
and abetted the failure of our system
to address the climate and oceans cri-
sis. Worst of all is the reason for it—
the fossil fuel industry’s menacing cli-
mate denial apparatus. That apparatus
may have won the day influencing Con-
gress for now, but it will surely fail the
test of time. History will judge harshly
an American generation that let its de-
mocracy be corrupted by this industry.
The voice of the oceans is more last-
ing than the greed and folly of man,
and it warns of consequences driven by
laws of chemistry, physics, and biol-
ogy. These stern natural laws cannot
be repealed or vetoed. Propaganda can
manipulate people, passions, and poli-
tics, but propaganda cannot change the
immutable laws of nature. The data are
the voice of the oceans, and if data
could scream, the oceans would now be
screaming.
So to paraphrase a poem, let us be
the ‘‘voice the sea would have if it had
not a better one: as it lifts . . . its rum-
bling, deep-structured roar.’’ Let us
wake up and get to our duty.
‘‘Slap Nature,’’ Pope Francis said,
‘‘and she will slap you back.’’ We have
a hell of a slap coming if we don’t get
ahead of this, and we better wake up to
it.

NOMINATION OF STEVEN J. MENASHI
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have
come here before to call out Senate Re-
publicans and their unwavering sup-
port for President Trump’s efforts to
pack our courts with partisan and ideo-
logically driven picks, but the nominee
I am speaking against today is truly
uniquely unfit to serve a lifetime ap-
pointment—a lifetime appointment—
on a Federal court: Steven Menashi.
Mr. Menashi has a deeply disturbing
history of disparaging comments
against women, communities of color,
immigrants, and the LGBTQI commu-
nity.
He unabashedly helped to roll back
protections for vulnerable commu-
nities. He defiantly refused to answer
basic questions from U.S. Senators,
both Democrats and Republicans,
about the policies he worked on while
advising the President. He has time
and again put extremism and ideology
ahead of the rule of law, and he has
proven himself incapable of serving as
a fair and impartial judge.
As if his record of extremism and
partisanship wasn’t bad enough, we
now know that Steven Menashi not
only helped but was the key architect
in Secretary DeVos’s efforts to ille-
gally deny relief to student borrows
who were cheated by predatory for-
profit colleges. These policies that Mr.
Menashi provided ‘‘legal advice’’ for
were subsequently ruled to be in viola-
tion of Federal law.
Secretary DeVos’s policy on borrower
defense led to her being held in con-
tempt of court. Whether Mr. Menashi
did not understand Federal law or
whether he advised the Secretary of
Education to blatantly ignore it at the
expense of students, the fact is that
this latest revelation undoubtedly and
unequivocally disqualifies him from
serving a lifetime appointment on a
Federal court—or, at least, it should.
Tomorrow, the Senate will take a
critical vote. This is a vote on whether
the Senate once again rubberstamps
President Trump’s unprecedented ef-
fort to remake the Federal judiciary on
a partisan ideological basis. It is a vote
that shows whether Republicans are
willing to support a judicial nominee
whose actions—his own actions—have
been found to violate the law as re-
cently as just a few weeks ago.
I implore my Republican colleagues
to consider not just Mr. Menashi’s
record of bigotry and the harm he
helped cause to cheated and defrauded
students, but also his blatant disregard
of the rule of law.
When casting their vote, I ask my
colleagues not to worry about what the
President might say on Twitter, but to
worry about the rule of law and to
worry about the idea yet another par-
tisan nominee getting a lifetime on the
Federal bench who doesn’t. It is that
simple.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.

ator from New Hampshire.
SURVIVORS’ BILL OF RIGHTS IN THE STATES ACT
OF 2019
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am
pleased to join Mr. GRASSLEY from
Iowa on the floor today to talk about
important legislation that we are co-
sponsoring that built upon previous ef-
forts that both of us were engaged in to
protect survivors of sexual assault in
the criminal justice system. The ef-
forts to extend rights to sexual assault
survivors across the country is criti-
cally important, and I am hopeful that,
once our legislation is known to our
colleagues, that they will join us in
passing this important bipartisan bill.
Amanda Nguyen of the Rise organiza-
tion initially contacted our office in
2015. I know she also worked with Sen-
ator GRASSLEY. When she came to us
and detailed her harrowing story of
sexual assault, she was raped, and then
she felt like she was raped again by a
criminal justice system that was not
responsive to the challenges of sur-
vivors of sexual assault. Amanda de-
scribed the system that further trau-
matized survivors and provided scarce
protections for their rights.
Evidence of assault was being de-
stroyed without survivors’ consent, and
survivors were forced to periodically
follow up with law enforcement to pre-
serve that evidence. The broken proc-
ess that survivors were forced to en-
dure resulted in a system where they
were often re-victimized. Instead of a
process that helped them move forward
with their lives as they pursued jus-
tice, survivors were confronted with
the trauma of reliving their attack
each time they sought to preserve evi-
dence or gather information about
their case.
Well, because of Amanda’s efforts,
the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Rights
Act was created. It was legislation that
provided for the first legally recognized
set of rights for survivors that could be
enforced in a court of law. Senator
GRASSLEY took that legislation, he in-
cluded it in the Adam Walsh Reauthor-
ization Act, and it was signed into law.
It has provided survivors with greater
protections in Federal cases because of
focus on notice, on access to evidence,
and on the preservation of sexual as-
sault evidence collection kits.
By creating this set of court enforce-
able rights at the Federal level, Con-
gress established a model for the
States to adopt similar legislation to
protect the rights of survivors. So far,
21 States, including my home State of
New Hampshire, have adopted that leg-
islation to guarantee survivors certain
basic rights in the criminal justice sys-
tem.
Now, unfortunately, we are trying to
figure out how to encourage other
States to follow the lead of Congress,
States that have not yet adopted legis-
lation protecting survivors. That is
why the bill that Senator GRASSLEY
and I are here to discuss today is so
critically important. The Survivors’
Bill of Rights in the States Act, the
legislation we are cosponsoring, would
establish a grant program accessible to
States that have in place a law which
guarantees the rights contained in the
Sexual Assault Survivors’ Rights Act.
The grand amount would be a per-
centage of the funding that the State
receives under the Stop Violence
Against Women Formula Grant Pro-
gram. States could then use the funds
to implement survivor rights, preserve
sexual assault evidence collection kits,
reduce the backlog of kits, and provide
support for victim services.
Congress has previously passed legis-
lation using the Stop Formula Grants
to incentivize States to adopt legisla-
tion, and this is the perfect example of
why that kind of an approach would be
successful. No survivor should be com-
pelled to bear the indignity of peti-
tioning law enforcement merely to en-
sure that they are given a fair shake in
the criminal justice process. It is my
hope that this legislation will lead to
an increase in States passing bills to
protect survivors’ rights.
I think it is important that Congress
again show survivors that we are be-
hind them, that we will stand up with
them for their rights. The Survivors’
Bill of Rights in the States Act would
do just that.
I am so pleased to be joining Senator
GRASSLEY in this effort. I think, with
this bipartisan support, we can get sup-
port from all of our colleagues to enact
this follow-on legislation into law and
provide the additional support that
survivors need.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6544 November 13, 2019
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield to my colleague, Senator
GRASSLEY.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first
of all, it is a pleasure to work with
Senator SHAHEEN on this bill. I am
very happy to work together. We have
the same goals in mind. For the cyn-
ical people outside of Washington, DC,
that say there is never any Republican
or Democratic cooperation, there is
kind of a rule around here that Senator
SHAHEEN and I are examples of, but it
applies to all 100 Senators.
If you really want to get something
done, you have to seek bipartisanship
in this body. I can quantify that in this
way. There are 53 Republicans. There
are 47 Democrats. But if there were 53
Democrats and 47 Republicans, the
same rule would apply.
About 99 percent of the legislation
that gets done around here has to have
60 votes to stop debate before you can
even vote on the bill. So obviously,
even if all 53 Republicans were voting
together—and that doesn’t happen very
often—you still wouldn’t get the 60
votes to pass a piece of legislation. So
that is why almost every major piece
of legislation that gets through here—
and this example of Shaheen-Grassley
is just another example—it is because
you seek bipartisanship, and it is just
nice that it has to be that way.
So addressing this issue, I can say I
associate myself with the remarks of
Senator SHAHEEN and sit down, but
there is kind of a rule around the Sen-
ate. Everything that has been said on
this bill has been said, but I haven’t
said it yet, and I am going to say it.
I recently introduced S. 2770, known
as the Survivors’ Bill of Rights in the
States Act of 2019, with Senator SHA-
HEEN and Senator TILLIS. This measure
is a companion to what Congress-
woman SPEIER developed and intro-
duced in the other Chamber. It builds
on legislation entitled the Survivors’
Bill of Rights Act that we adopted in
2016.
As chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee in the last Congress, I
worked closely with a young woman,
Amanda Nguyen, on the development
of that 2016 measure prior to its intro-
duction. Amanda, a survivor of sexual
assault, found and leads the nonprofit
organization known as Rise, R-I-S-E.
She also worked with Senator SHA-
HEEN on the same legislation, intro-
ducing the final version in this Cham-
ber. We incorporated that 2016 package
of rights into an amendment that I of-
fered to another measure before the
Senate Judiciary Committee. In May
2016, that legislation passed this Cham-
ber 89 to 0. In October 2016, the House
version, which was introduced later,
was signed by the President.
The bills that we introduced this
month on the 2016 Survivors’ Bill of
Rights, it makes each State eligible to
receive a Federal grant to implement a
similar package of rights for victims of
sex crimes at the State level. Such
rights include, for example, the right
to know the results of your forensic
exam, the right to have evidence pre-
served for a certain period, and the
right to notice before your forensic kit
is destroyed.
A State also may use its Justice De-
partment grants to preserve sexual as-
sault evidence kits, reduce the number
of kits awaiting testing, and extend ad-
ditional assistance to crime victims
under our legislation. Finally, the
measure we introduced authorizes 20
million annually for each of the fiscal
years 2021 through 2024 to support the
implementation of the new grant pro-
gram established by this bill. I urge my
colleagues to join us in cosponsoring
the Survivors’ Bill of Rights in the
States Act of 2019.
I thank Senator SHAHEEN for joining
in this effort and leading this bill and,
most importantly, to compliment her
over a long period of time in the Sen-
ate—and probably even before she came
to the Senate—her commitment to
working with me and with people gen-
erally on the issue of increased protec-
tion for victims of sexual assault.
Again, I thank Congresswoman
SPEIER and her staff for initiating this
measure in the House and for working
so hard to develop a bicameral, bipar-
tisan measure, and I thank Senator
SHAHEEN once again.
I yield the floor.

f
SAFESPORT ACT OF 2019
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this
week I introduced S. 2838 with Senators
ERNST, BLACKBURN, SULLIVAN, MUR-
KOWSKI, and PERDUE. This legislation,
which we have titled the SAFESPORT
Act of 2019, includes funding account-
ability, antiretaliation protection,
child abuse reporting, and other reform
measures.
I want to take this opportunity to
thank the Commerce Committee mem-
bers who lead the Senate subcommittee
with jurisdiction over the Ted Stevens
Act, along with Commerce Committee
Chairman WICKER, for including so
much of my SAFESPORT Act as an
amendment to a larger package that
they developed. That measure is S.
2330, the Empowering Olympic and
Amateur Athletes Act of 2019, spon-
sored by Senators MORAN and
BLUMENTHAL.
Senators MORAN and BLUMENTHAL
worked closely with me to secure the
inclusion of multiple provisions of my
SAFESPORT Act in their bill, which
cleared the Commerce Committee this
morning with unanimous bipartisan
support. Every one of these provisions
is designed to ensure that the U.S. Cen-
ter for SafeSport, which is tasked by
Congress with investigating abuse of
athletes in amateur sports, continues
on its current track of excellence. I ex-
tend my sincere appreciation to both
subcommittee leaders for their hard
work on S. 2330 and for collaborating
with me to improve their bipartisan
bill.
First, the SAFESPORT Act would
enhance child abuse reporting, by en-
suring that the Center for SafeSport is
subject to the same mandatory report-
ing requirements as other professionals
who work with children, under the Fed-
eral Victims of Child Abuse Act. By
law, this center is tasked with receiv-
ing and investigating complaints of
sexual abuse in amateur sports, which
is why its personnel should have to re-
port suspected crimes against children
to the authorities.
Second, this bill ensures that the
Center for SafeSport, a private organi-
zation that already receives millions
annually in revenue from the Olympic
community—and which would receive
$20 million annually, at the direction
of Congress, if the Moran-Bhimenthal
bill is enacted—is subject to an annual
audit by an independent auditor. Such
an audit is highly recommended by
charity watchdog groups for the high-
est functioning nonprofit organiza-
tions. It is also a standard requirement
for almost any nonprofit charitable or-
ganization receiving Federal grant
awards of more than $750,000 annually.
My legislation also calls for the Center
for SafeSport to implement any correc-
tive actions recommended by the audi-
tor each year or explain why it dis-
agrees with the recommendations.
Third, this legislation subjects the
Center for SafeSport to certain trans-
parency requirements, ensuring, for ex-
ample, that this organization reports
to Congress annually with a detailed
account of its activities, any changes
in its financial standing, and a correc-
tive action plan to implement auditor
recommendations, if any. We are enti-
tled to know how many complaints the
organization investigates and resolves
using the millions of dollars it receives
from the U.S. Olympic community
each year. Such information would be
made available to the public, under the
SAFESPORT Act.
The Commerce Committee included
all of these accountability, trans-
parency, and child abuse reporting pro-
visions, as well as the antiretaliation
language of my SAFESPORT Act in
the package it approved today. That
antiretaliation language, on which I
collaborated with Senator PETERS, pro-
tects whistleblowers who come forward
and report abuses in amateur sports. I
thank Senator PETERS for his collabo-
ration on that language. I am delighted

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6545
November 13, 2019
we made this progress and look forward
to working with the committee to en-
sure it is enacted.
The only language that the com-
mittee did not accept, due to jurisdic-
tional concerns raised by Senators
BLUMENTHAL and MORAN, was the grant
accountability language in the
SAFESPORT Act. One section of my
bill, which bars nonprofits receiving
Justice Department grants from stash-
ing funds in offshore accounts for tax
avoidance purposes, among other re-
quirements, has cleared the Judiciary
Committee with bipartisan support on
multiple occasions. Chairman GRAHAM
approved its inclusion in the Com-
merce package, and Ranking Member
FEINSTEIN has cosponsored similar lan-
guage on multiple occasions. So I am
disappointed that these reforms were
omitted from S. 2330 today. Senators
BLACKBURN and SULLIVAN, who joined
with me in seeking the inclusion of
that grant accountability language in
that Commerce Committee package
today, have called for adding it to S.
2330 before its floor consideration.
I look forward to working with the
leaders of the Commerce Committee to
achieve that goal. The only other key
provision of my SAFESPORT Act that
was not included in S. 2330 would en-
able the Attorney General to seek the
removal of officers and directors of the
Center for SafeSport, in the event
these individuals engage in serious
misconduct or material violations of
the Ted Stevens Act.
I urge my colleagues to join me in co-
sponsoring S. 2838, the SAFESPORT
Act, which is so important to ensure
that the organization tasked by Con-
gress with protecting amateur athletes
retains its current, high standard of ex-
cellence. I, again, thank Senator
PETERS as well as my cosponsors, par-
ticularly Senators BLACKBURN and SUL-
LIVAN, for helping me negotiate for the
inclusion of so many provisions of the
SAFESPORT Act in the bipartisan
measure that cleared the Commerce
Committee. I also want to thank my
committee staff, including Kolan
Davis, Evelyn Fortier, Rachael
Soloway, and Dario Camacho for their
hard work on this measure. Finally, I
thank the organizations, such as Fair-
ness, Dignity & Respect for Crime Vic-
tims & Survivors Project, which en-
dorsed this legislation, as well as the
Athletes Advisory Council, which
worked with us on the antiretaliation
provisions.

REMEMBERING THOMAS M. OWENS
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Sep-
tember 29, Thomas Owens of Chicago
passed away, leaving a legacy of faith,
philanthropy, and friendship. He was
an innovator and an advocate for help-
ing people. Tom was dedicated to the
biblical proverb, ‘‘To whom much is
given, much is expected.’’
Tom used to joke that he entered
philanthropic ventures because he
spent too much time hovering around
the kitchen with his wife, Mary. In
truth, he just believed in helping those
less fortunate. Tom and Mary founded
the Owens Foundation in 1985, inspired
by the work of Saint Mother Teresa of
Calcutta. Tom and Mary enjoyed a
friendship with Mother Teresa and
were instrumental in supporting Mis-
sionary of Charity projects in Chicago,
Arizona, and Tijuana, Mexico, to al-
leviate poverty and provide hope to
those in need.
In the early 1990s, Tom retired from a
successful business and having spent 20
years as an IBM executive. Many peo-
ple would have considered slowing
down after that, but not Tom. That
same year he retired, he founded Cara
Chicago.
Tom started Cara out of the back of
his car. He drove shelter to shelter,
connecting women with business col-
leagues and contacts he had accumu-
lated over the years. Nearly 30 years
later, Cara is a world-class job training
and placement program, helping more
than 6,000 people into more than 10,000
jobs.
Cara is the Gaelic word for friend,
and this program helps give people a
professional friend when they need it
most.
Tom earned numerous awards like
being one of the Streetwise Founda-
tion’s 20 Most Inspirational
Chicagoans. He also was Leo High
School’s Lifetime Achievement Award
winner in 2018. Leo High School’s
motto is Facta non Verba, meaning
Deeds not Words. Tom’s work as one of
the most caring people I have known
speaks for itself.
Tom liked to say, ‘‘Don’t just make
it a good day . . . make it a great day!’’
Many people have great days because
of his work.
Tom is survived by his wife, five chil-
dren, 22 grandchildren, and the thou-
sands of people who have better days
because of Tom.
f
NOMINATION OF STEVEN J.
MENASHI
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I
rise today to join many of my col-
leagues who have come to the floor to
express my opposition to the nomina-
tion of Steven Menashi to U.S. circuit
judge for the Second Circuit.
I am disappointed that Mr. Menashi’s
nomination has moved forward even
though he lacks the support of his
home State senators. In the rush to
confirm judges like Mr. Menashi, the
Senate has chipped away at the tradi-
tions that allow us to properly advise
and consent on nominations, which is
our responsibility under the Constitu-
tion.
Today, we are considering a nominee
whose record has raised several con-
cerning issues. While working as Prin-
cipal Deputy General Counsel and as
Acting General Counsel at the Depart-
ment of Education, Menashi advised
Secretary DeVos on the Department’s
efforts to withhold debt relief for stu-
dents who were defrauded by their col-
leges, reverse the Obama administra-
tion’s regulations on campus sexual as-
sault, and delay the enforcement of
rules designed to ensure that students
of color with disabilities are treated
fairly. And while at the White House
Counsel’s Office, Mr. Menashi has ad-
vised on the administration’s efforts to
end the deferred enforced departure
program for Liberians and to restrict
access to asylum.
I am also concerned that, despite a
request from all of the Democratic
Senators on the Judiciary Committee,
Mr. Menashi has refused to provide in-
formation about his knowledge or in-
volvement in the events related to the
telephone call between President
Trump and Ukrainian President
Zelensky on July 25, 2019.
It is for these reasons that I am un-
able to support Mr. Menashi’s con-
firmation.

following statement was ordered to be

NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT
∑ Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I
join my fellow Senate Armed Services
Committee subcommittee chairs in ex-
pressing my serious concerns with the
possibility that congress might not
pass a National Defense Authorization
Act, NDAA, for fiscal year 2020.
For more than five decades, the
NDAA has been signed into law with
bipartisan support. We had our dif-
ferences, but if we fail to pass the
NDAA this year, what kind of message
does that send to the men and women
who, in many cases, are risking their
lives for our national security? Fur-
ther, they will receive this message at
a time of heightened strategic competi-
tion with China and Russia and a con-
tinued need to support our allies and
partners. Meanwhile, we must continue

to rebuild the readiness of our Armed
Forces and take care of our troops and
their families.
With regard to rebuilding our readi-
ness, I remember the recent and sig-
nificant dip in the readiness of our B–
1B bomber fleet at Ellsworth Air Force
Base in South Dakota. While the Air
Force has reversed that trend, it re-
mains an example of the wear and tear
on our forces after 18 years of war. Now
is not the time to go backward by fail-
ing, for the first time in 58 years, to
pass a National Defense Authorization
Act.
NDAA is must-pass legislation, as it
has been every year for over half a cen-
tury. That is why Chairman INHOFE in-
troduced his ‘‘skinny’’ NDAA. The
NDAA is typically bipartisan, and it
should stay that way. I am hopeful we
will find a final agreement.
This is about more than the NDAA.
It is also about Defense appropriations.
In that regard, I will not vote for an-
other continuing resolution with its
distinctive impact on our national se-
curity.
As chairman of the Cybersecurity
Subcommittee of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, I am particularly
concerned about what failure to enact
NDAA 2020 would mean for our cyberse-
curity. Some vital cybersecurity meas-
ures in the NDAA passed by the Senate
include the following: critical funding
for United Stated Cyber Command,
CYBERCOM, infrastructure develop-
ment. In a sense, CYBERCOM is at war
every day, operating in our enemies’
backyards to negate or at least reduce
their ability to attack the United
States. It is not a coincidence that
there was no successful interference in
our 2018 mid-term elections. We can
thank the men and women of
CYBERCOM for that. Now is not the
time to deny them what they need to
boost their capabilities. Our adver-
saries and enemies will surely boost
theirs; development of a consistent,
comprehensive framework to enhance
the cybersecurity of the U.S. defense
industrial base after disastrous theft of
critical defense information relating to
development of an important new
weapon system. I am concerned there
may be other ongoing such instances of
which we are not even aware; a consor-
tium of universities, to include Dakota
State University in Madison, SD, to ad-
vise and assist the Secretary of Defense
on cybersecurity matters; authoriza-
tion for the armed services to use oper-
ation and maintenance funds for the
rapid creation testing, fielding, and op-
eration of new cyber capabilities; and
completion of the work of the Cyber-
space Solarium Commission charged
with evaluating divergent approaches
to defending the United States in
cyberspace and driving consensus to-
ward a comprehensive strategy.
These are just some of the cybersecu-
rity related measures that will have to
wait another year, unless Congress
passes NDAA 2020. When added to the
concerns noted by my fellow chairs, it
should be clear to all that now is the
time to put aside partisan obstruc-
tionism and enact this must-pass legis-
lation.∑

Authority: 50 U.S.C. 4801–4852; 50 U.S.C.
4601 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; E.O. 13222, 66

(e)(1)(ii) as Note 2 to paragraph (e)(1)(ii);
e. Revising paragraph (h); and
f. Adding paragraph (i) to read as follows:
§ 743.4 Conventional arms reporting.
(a) * * * This section does not require re-
ports when the exporter uses the alternative
submission method described under para-
graph (h) of this section. The alternative
submission method under paragraph (h) re-
quires the exporter to submit the informa-
tion required for conventional arms report-
ing in this section as part of the required
EEI submission in AES, pursuant to
§ 758.1(b)(9). Because of the requirements in
§ 758.1(g)(4)(ii) for the firearms that require
conventional arms reporting of all conven-
tional arms, the Department of Commerce
believes all conventional arms reporting re-
quirements for firearms will be met by using
the alternative submission method. The De-
partment of Commerce leaves standard
method for submitting reports in place in
case any additional items are moved from
the USML to the CCL, that may require con-
ventional arms reporting.
Note 1 to paragraph (a): * * *
(b) Requirements. You must submit one
electronic copy of each report required under
the provisions of this section, or submit this
information using the alternative submis-
sion method specified in paragraph (h) of this
section, and maintain accurate supporting
records (see § 762.2(b) of the EAR) for all ex-
ports of items specified in paragraph (c) of
this section for the following:
(c) * * *
(1) * * *
(i) ECCN 0A501.a and .b.
* * * * *
(2) * * *
(i) ECCN 0A501.a and .b.
* * * * *
(h) Alternative submission method. This para-
graph (h) describes an alternative submission
method for meeting the conventional arms
reporting requirements of this section. The
alternative submission method requires the
exporter, when filing the required EEI sub-
mission in AES, pursuant to § 758.1(b)(9), to
include the six character ECCN classifica-
tion (i.e., 0A501.a or 0A501.b) as the first text
to appear in the Commodity description
block. If the exporter properly includes this
information in the EEI filing in AES, the De-
partment of Commerce will be able to obtain
that export information directly from AES
to meet the U.S. Government’s commit-
ments to the Wassenaar Arrangement and
United Nations for conventional arms re-
porting. An exporter that complies with the
requirements in § 758.1(g)(4)(ii) does not have
to submit separate annual and semi-annual
reports to the Department of Commerce pur-
suant to this section.
(i) Contacts. General information con-
cerning the Wassenaar Arrangement and re-
porting obligations thereof is available from
the Office of National Security and Tech-
nology Transfer Controls, Tel.: (202) 482–0092,
Fax: (202) 482–4094. Information concerning
the reporting requirements for items identi-
fied in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this sec-
tion is available from the Office of Non-
proliferation and Treaty Compliance

§ 748.12 Firearms import certificate or import
permit.
License applications for certain firearms
and related commodities require support
documents in accordance with this section.
For destinations that are members of the Or-
ganization of American States (OAS), an FC
Import Certificate or equivalent official doc-
ument is required in accordance with para-
graphs (a) through (d) of this section. For
other destinations that require a firearms
import or permit, the firearms import cer-
tificate or permit is required in accordance
with paragraph (e) of this section.
(a) Requirement to obtain document for OAS
member states. Unless an exception in § 748.9(c)
applies, an FC Import Certificate is required
for license applications for firearms and re-
lated commodities, regardless of value, that
are destined for member countries of the
OAS. This requirement is consistent with
the OAS Model Regulations described in
§ 742.17 of the EAR.
(1) Items subject to requirement. Firearms
and related commodities are those commod-
ities controlled for ‘‘FC Column 1’’ reasons
under ECCNs 0A501 (except 0A501.y), 0A502,
0A504 (except 0A504.f), or 0A505 (except
0A505.d).
* * * * *
(e) Requirement to obtain an import certificate
or permit for other than OAS member states. If
the country to which firearms, parts, compo-
nents, accessories, and attachments con-
trolled under ECCN 0A501, or ammunition
controlled under ECCN 0A505, are being ex-
ported or reexported requires that a govern-
ment-issued certificate or permit be ob-
tained prior to importing the commodity,
the exporter or reexporter must obtain and
retain on file the original or a copy of that
certificate or permit before applying for an
export or reexport license unless:
(1) A license is not required for the export
or reexport; or
(2) The exporter is required to obtain an
import or end-user certificate or other equiv-
alent official document pursuant to para-
graphs (a) thorough (d) of this section and
has, in fact, complied with that requirement.
(3)(i) The number or other identifying in-
formation of the import certificate or permit
must be stated on the license application.
(ii) If the country to which the commod-
ities are being exported does not require an
import certificate or permit for firearms im-
ports, that fact must be noted on any license
application for ECCN 0A501 or 0A505 com-
modities.
Note 2 to paragraph (e). Obtaining a BIS
Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser
pursuant to § 748.11 of the EAR does not exempt
the exporter or reexporter from the requirement
to obtain a certification pursuant to paragraph
(a) of this section because that statement is not
issued by a government.
30. Supplement No. 2 to part 748 (Unique
Application and Submission Requirements)
is amended by adding paragraph (z) to read
as follows:
SUPPLEMENT NO. 2 TO PART 748—UNIQUE

and 758.4);’’
(B) Provide to U.S. Customs and Border
Protection an invoice or other appropriate

(4) Exports of Firearms and Related Items.
This paragraph (g)(4) includes two separate
requirements under paragraph (g)(4)(i) and
(ii) of this section that are used to better
identify exports of certain end item firearms
under the EAR. Paragraph (g)(4)(i) is limited
to certain EAR authorizations. Paragraph
(g)(4)(ii) applies to all EAR authorizations
that require EEI filing in AES.
(i) Identifying end item firearms by manu-
facturer, model, caliber, and serial number
in the EEI filing in AES. For any export au-
thorized under License Exception TMP or a
BIS license authorizing a temporary export
of items controlled under ECCNs 0A501.a or
.b, or shotguns with a barrel length less than
18 inches controlled under ECCN 0A502, in
addition to any other required data for the
associated EEI filing, you must report the
manufacturer, model, caliber, and serial
number of the exported items. The require-
ments of this paragraph also apply to any
other export authorized under a BIS license
that includes a condition or proviso on the
license requiring the submission of this in-
formation specified in paragraph (g) of this
section when the EEI is filed in AES.
(ii) Identifying end item firearms by
‘‘items’’’ level classification or other control
descriptor in the EEI filing in AES. For any
export of items controlled under ECCNs
0A501.a or .b, or shotguns with a barrel
length less than 18 inches controlled under
ECCN 0A502, in addition to any other 39 re-
quired data for the associated EEI filing, you
must include the six character ECCN classi-
fication (i.e., 0A501.a, or 0A501.b), or for shot-
guns controlled under 0A502 the phrase
‘‘0A501 barrel length less than 18 inches’’’ as
the first text to appear in the Commodity de-
scription block in the EEI filing in AES. (See
743.4(h) for the use of this information for
conventional arms reporting).
Note 2 to paragraph (g)(4): If a commodity de-
scribed in paragraph (g)(4) is exported under Li-
cense Exception TMP under § 740.9(a)(6) for in-
spection, test, calibration, or repair is not con-
sumed or destroyed in the normal course of au-
thorized temporary use abroad, the commodity
must be disposed of or retained in one of the
ways specified in § 740.9(a)(14)(i), (ii), or (iii).
For example, if a commodity described in para-
graph (g)(4) was destroyed while being repaired
after being exported under § 740.9(a)(6), the com-
modity described in paragraph (g)(4) would not
be required to be returned. If the entity doing
the repair returned a replacement of the com-
modity to the exporter from the United States,
the import would not require an EAR authoriza-
tion. The entity that exported the commodity de-
scribed in paragraph (g)(4) and the entity that
received the commodity would need to document
this as part of their recordkeeping related to this
export and subsequent import to the United
States.
* * * * *
33. Add § 758.10 to read as follows:
§ 758.10 Entry clearance requirements for
temporary imports.
(a) Scope. This section specifies the tem-
porary import entry clearance requirements
for firearms ‘‘subject to the EAR’’ that are
on the United States Munitions Import List
(USMIL, 27 CFR 447.21), except for firearms
‘‘subject to the EAR’’ that are temporarily
brought into the United States by non-
immigrant aliens under the provisions of De-
partment of Justice regulations at 27 CFR
part 478 (See 740.14(e) of License Exception
BAG for information on the export of these
firearms ‘‘subject to the EAR’’). These fire-
arms are controlled in ECCN 0A501.a or .b or
shotguns with a barrel length less than 18
inches controlled in ECCN 0A502. Items that
are temporarily exported under the EAR
must have met the export clearance require-
ments specified in § 758.1 of the EAR.
(1) An authorization under the EAR is not
required for the temporary import of
‘‘items’ ’’ that are ‘‘subject to the EAR,’’ in-
cluding for ‘‘items’ ’’ ‘‘subject to the EAR’’
that are on the USMIL. Temporary imports
of firearms described in this section must
meet the entry clearance requirements spec-
ified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) Permanent imports are regulated by the
Attorney General under the direction of the
Department of Justice’s Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (see 27
CFR parts 447, 478, 479, and 555).
(b) EAR procedures for temporary imports and
subsequent exports. To the satisfaction of U.S.
Customs and Border Protection, the tem-
porary importer must comply with the fol-
lowing procedures:
(1) At the time of entry into the U.S. of the
temporary import:
(i) Provide one of the following statements
specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A), (B), or (C)
of this section to U.S. Customs and Border
Protection:
(A) ‘‘This shipment is being temporarily
imported in accordance with the EAR. This
shipment will be exported in accordance
with and under the authority of License Ex-
ception TMP (15 CFR 740.9(b)(5));’’
(B) ‘‘This shipment is being temporarily
imported in accordance with the EAR. This
shipment will be exported in accordance
with and under the authority of License Ex-
ception RPL (15 CFR 740.10(b));’’ or
(C) ‘‘This shipment is being temporarily
imported in accordance with the EAR. This
shipment will be exported in accordance
with and under the authority of BIS license
number (provide the license number) (15 CFR
750.7(a) and 758.4);’’
(ii) Provide to U.S. Customs and Border
Protection an invoice or other appropriate
import-related documentation (or electronic
equivalents) that includes a complete list
and description of the firearms being tempo-
rarily imported, including their model,
make, caliber, serial numbers, quantity, and
U.S. dollar value;
(iii) Provide (if temporarily imported for a
trade show, exhibition, demonstration, or
testing) to U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion the relevant invitation or registration
documentation for the event and an accom-
panying letter that details the arrangements
to maintain effective control of the firearms
while they are in the United States;
(iv) Provide (if temporarily imported for
servicing or replacement) to U.S. Customs
and Border Protection the name, address and
contact information (telephone number and/
or email) of the organization or individual in
the U.S. that will be receiving the item for
servicing or replacement).
Note 1 to paragraph (b)(1): In accordance
with the exclusions in License Exception TMP
under § 740.9(b)(5) of the EAR, the entry clear-
ance requirements in § 758.1(b)(9) do not permit
the temporary import of firearms controlled in
ECCN 0A501.a or .b that are shipped from or
manufactured in a Country Group D:5 country;
or that are shipped from or manufactured in
Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Moldova, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, or Uzbekistan
(except for any firearm model controlled by pro-
posed 0A501 that is specified under Annex A in
Supplement No. 4 to part 740;); or shotguns with
a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled in
ECCN 0A502 that are shipped from or manufac-
tured in a Country Group D:5 country, or from
Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Moldova, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, or Uzbek-
istan, because of the exclusions in License Ex-
ception TMP under § 740.9(b)(5).
Note 2 to paragraph (b)(1): In accordance
with the exclusions in License Exception RPL
under § 740.10(b)(4) and Supplement No. 2 to
part 748 paragraph (z) of the EAR, the entry
clearance requirements in § 758.1(b)(9) do not
permit the temporary import of: firearms con-
trolled in ECCN 0A501.a or .b that are shipped
from or manufactured in Russia, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova,
Turkmenistan, Ukraine, or Uzbekistan (except
for any firearm model controlled by proposed
0A501 that is specified under Annex A in Sup-
plement No. 4 to part 740;); or shotguns with a
barrel length less than 18 inches controlled in
ECCN 0A502 that are shipped from or manufac-
tured in Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan,

or Uzbekistan, because of the exclusions in Li-
cense Exception RPL under § 740.10(b)(4) and
Supplement No. 2 to part 748 paragraph (z) of
the EAR.
(2) At the time of export, in accordance
with the U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion procedures, the eligible exporter, or an
agent acting on the filer’s behalf, must as re-
quired under § 758.1(b)(9) of the EAR file the
export information with CBP by filing EEI in
AES, noting the 43 applicable EAR author-
ization as the authority for the export, and
provide, upon request by CBP, the entry doc-
ument number or a copy of the CBP docu-
ment under which the ‘‘item’’ subject to the
EAR’’ on the USMIL was temporarily im-
ported. See also the additional requirements
in § 758.1(g)(4).
34. Add § 758.11 to read as follows:
§ 758.11 Export clearance requirements for
firearms and related items.
(a) Scope. The export clearance require-
ments of this section apply to all exports of
commodities controlled under ECCNs 0A501.a
or .b, shotguns with a barrel length less than
18 inches controlled under ECCN 0A502, or
ammunition controlled under ECCN 0A505
except for .c, regardless of value or destina-
tion, including exports to Canada, that are
authorized under License Exception BAG, as
set forth in § 740.14.
(b) Required form. Prior to making any ex-
port described in paragraph (a) of this sec-
tion, the exporter is required to submit a
properly completed Department of Homeland
Security, CBP Form 4457, (Certificate of Reg-
istration for Personal Effects Taken Abroad)
(OMB Control Number 1651–0010), to the U.S.
Customs and Border Protection (CBP), pur-
suant to 19 CFR 148.1, and as required by this

Summary of Revisions to USML Categories
I, II, and III
In 2009, the interagency began a review of
the U.S. export control system, with the goal
of strengthening national security and the
competitiveness of key U.S. manufacturing
and technology sectors by focusing on cur-
rent threats, as well as adapting to the
changing economic and technological land-
scape. This review determined that the then-
current export control system was overly
complicated, contained too many
redundancies, and, in trying to protect too
much, diminished our ability to focus our ef-
forts on the most critical national security
priorities.
To this end, the Departments of State and
Commerce have been reviewing and revising
the two primary lists of controlled items,
i.e., the United States Munitions List
(USML) and the Commerce Control List
(CCL). A key strategy in the reform effort
has been to construct the lists so they posi-
tively identify the items they control. Thus,
for example, the USML lists the specific
types of parts, components, accessories, and
attachments that warrant control under the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations
(ITAR) rather than all generic ‘‘parts,’’
‘‘components,’’ ‘‘accessories and attach-
ments’’ that are in any way ‘‘specifically de-
signed, modified, adapted, or configured’’ for
a defense article, regardless of military sig-
nificance (as is currently the case for
unrevised USML categories). All other ge-
neric parts, components, accessories, and at-
tachments and the technology for their ‘‘pro-
duction,’’ ‘‘development,’’ or ‘‘use’’ that are
‘‘specially designed’’ for an item formerly on
the USML but not specifically identified on
the USML will become subject to the juris-
diction of the Export Administration Regu-
lations (EAR) and identified on its CCL.
In connection with this effort, the Depart-
ment of State has published 26 final, or in-
terim final, rules revising 18 of the 21 USML
categories. In May 2018, the Department of
State published proposed revisions of the re-
maining three USML Categories, including
Category I (firearms and related articles), II
(guns and armaments) and III (ammunition
and ordnance), which follow this model of
utilizing a ‘‘positive list’’ for controls. Arti-
cles that are not positively identified on the
USML will continue to be controlled, albeit
under the jurisdiction of the EAR.
In February 2019, the Department of State
formally notified Congress of the transfer of
jurisdictional control of certain classes of
items in Categories, I, II, and III. The De-
partment of State is submitting a new notifi-
cation to Congress because the Department
of Commerce has amended certain controls
in its draft companion rule. In particular, in
order to address concerns raised by some
members of Congress and the public regard-
ing certain access to 3D printing technology
and software for firearms, the Department of
Commerce has revised its draft final rule to
make certain technology and software capa-
ble of producing firearms subject to the EAR
when posted on the internet under specified
circumstances. The Department of State has
not made any changes to the classes of items
in Categories I, II, or III that it is proposing
to remove from the USML from the time
that the Department of State notified Con-
gress in February 2019.
Category I—Firearms and Related Articles
Paragraph (a) is revised by limiting the
scope of the control to firearms using
caseless ammunition. Non-automatic and
semi-automatic firearms that do not use
caseless ammunition will be controlled in
Export Control Classification Number
(ECCN) 0A501 on the CCL, except for firearms
manufactured prior to 1890.
Paragraph (b) is non-substantively revised.
Paragraph (c) is revised by limiting the
scope to firearms specially designed to inte-
grate fire control, automatic tracking, or
automatic firing (e.g., Precision Guided Fire-
arms). Other weapons that were controlled
here will be controlled in ECCN 0A501.
Paragraph (d) is revised by limiting the
scope to fully automatic shotguns. Other
shotguns that were controlled here will be
controlled in ECCN 0A502.
Paragraph (e) is revised by removing flash
suppressors and moving certain parts and
components for the remaining items in para-
graph (e) to paragraph (h)(3). Flash suppres-
sors will be controlled in ECCN 0A501.
Paragraph (f) is reserved. Riflescopes with
night vision or infrared were moved to
USML Category XII(c)(2) in 2016 through 81
FR 70340. All other rifle scopes that were
controlled here will be controlled in ECCN
0A504.
Paragraph (g) is revised to more clearly de-
lineate the major components of USML fire-
arms that are controlled. The major parts
and components of firearms that transition
to the CCL will be controlled in ECCN 0A501.
Paragraph (h) is revised by adding four
subparagraphs to specifically enumerate the
articles controlled. The parts, components,
accessories, and attachments of firearms
that transition to the CCL will be controlled
in ECCN 0A501, as will any parts, compo-
nents, accessories, and attachments of
USML firearms that are not listed in para-
graphs (g) or (h).
Paragraph (i) is revised to add control for
the classified technical data directly related
to items controlled in ECCNs 0A501, OB501,
OD501, and 0E501 and defense services using
the classified technical data.

USML control are moved to paragraphs (j)(9)
and components therefor to (j)(10) and the
rest will be controlled in ECCN 0B602.
Paragraph (j) is revised by adding seven-
teen subparagraphs to specifically enu-
merate the articles controlled. The parts,
components, accessories, and attachments
that are not listed in paragraph (j) will be
controlled in ECCN 0A602.
Paragraph (k) is revised to add control for
the classified technical data directly related
to items controlled in ECCNs 0A602, 0B602,
0D602, and 0E602 and defense services using
the classified technical data.
A new paragraph (x) has been added to
USML Category II, allowing ITAR licensing
on behalf of the Department of Commerce
for commodities, software, and technology
subject to the EAR, provided those commod-
ities, software, and technology are to be used
in or with defense articles controlled in
USML Category XII and are described in the
purchase documentation submitted with the
application.
Category III—Ammunition and Ordnance
Paragraph (a) is revised by adding ten sub-
paragraphs to specifically enumerate the ar-
ticles controlled, including adding a control
for DOD-funded development ammunition.
Ammunition not described will be controlled
under ECCN 0A505. Black powder guns and
armaments manufactured between 1890 and
1919 will be controlled under ECCN 0A602, ex-
cept for black powder guns and armaments
manufactured earlier than 1890.
Paragraph (b) is revised to more specifi-
cally describe the items warranting control
under this paragraph by identifying those
items in two subparagraphs. Items that were
controlled in this paragraph but do not meet
the more specific description will be con-
trolled in ECCN 0B505.
Paragraph (c) is reserved. The items that
were controlled in this paragraph will be
controlled in ECCN 0B505.
Paragraph (d) is revised by adding fifteen
subparagraphs to specifically enumerate the
articles controlled. Parts and components of
USML ammunition that are not described
will be controlled in ECCN 0A505.
Paragraph (e) is revised to add control for
the classified technical data directly related
to items controlled in ECCNs 0A505, 0B505,
0D505, and 0E505 and defense services using
the classified technical data.
A new paragraph (x) has been added to
USML Category II, allowing ITAR licensing
on behalf of the Department of Commerce
for commodities, software, and technology
subject to the EAR, provided those commod-
ities, software, and technology are to be used
in or with defense articles controlled in
USML Category XII and are described in the
purchase documentation submitted with the
application.
A new note is added to Category III to pro-
vide that ammunition crimped without a
projectile (blank star) and dummy ammuni-
tion with a pierced powder chamber are not
on the USML. These items will be controlled
in ECCN 0A505. An additional new note is
added to provide that grenades containing
non-lethal or less lethal projectiles are not
on the USML. These grenades will be con-
trolled in ECCN 0A505.
For items that have transitioned to the
CCL in a 600 series entry, transactions des-
tined for countries subject to a U.S. arms
embargo will not be eligible for license ex-
ceptions, except for License Exception GOV
under EAR § 740.11(b)(2)(ii). Multilateral re-
gime-controlled items moved from the
USML to the CCL will retain their regime
control parameters and reasons for control.
The Department of Commerce has created
a License Exception Strategic Trade Author-
ization (STA, § 740.20), which authorizes the
export, re-export, and transfer (in-country)
of certain items on the CCL to ‘‘countries of
least concern’’ without a license (i.e., Argen-
tina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria,
Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lat-
via, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Ro-
mania, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the
United Kingdom). Parts, components, acces-
sories and attachments controlled under sub-
paragraph ‘‘x’’ of the relevant ECCNs will be
automatically available for this exception.
However, end-items that will be controlled
under the new ECCNs will be subject to a
‘‘first time’’ license requirement. Exporters
will be able to request a determination on
STA eligibility for these items concurrent
with a license request. If the Departments of
State, Defense, and Commerce all agree, the
end-item would be separately posted, by
model number, as eligible for STA in the fu-
ture. If the departments cannot reach con-
sensus, the end-item would continue to re-
quire a license to all destinations except
Canada.
Existing License Exceptions LVS (§ 740.3),
TMP (§ 740.9), RPL (§ 740.10), and GOV
(§ 740.11(b)(2)(ii) or (b)(2)(iii)) will be eligible
for use for items controlled by these ECCNs.

NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE
MONTH
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, every No-
vember, the Senate observes Native
American Heritage Month to recognize
the contributions of American Indians,
Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians
to the United States.
Today, the promise of Native
achievement burns brighter than ever.
Just a few months ago, Joy Harjo, a
member of the Muscogee Creek Nation,
became the Nation’s 23rd Poet Lau-
reate. The first Native American ap-
pointed to the laureateship in the his-
tory of the Library of Congress, Ms.
Harjo is an inspiration to the next gen-
eration of Native American writers,
poets, and artists to share their diverse
and powerful voices with the world.
In this spirit, I am proud to have
worked with Ms. Harjo, the Library of
Congress, the Institute of American In-
dian Arts, and the Boys and Girls Club
of America to host an exhibition of Na-
tive student poetry in the rotunda of
the Russell Senate Office Building this
month. The display showcases Ms.
Harjo’s poetry alongside original works
written by Autumn Abeyta, Ambrosia
Morning Gun, Jewel Palmer, Paige
Hannan, Lindsey Toya-Tosa, Delaney
Keshena, and Rebekkah Autaubo—Na-
tive students attending schools in my
home state of New Mexico and rep-
resenting Tribes in New Mexico, Mon-
tana, New York, Wisconsin, and Okla-
homa.
This year’s inaugural exhibit rep-
resents the countless ways Native peo-
ples have harnessed their strength, re-
silience, and unique perspectives to
shape nearly every facet of our na-
tional identity.
As the vice chairman of the Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs, I work every
day to achieve Indian Country’s prior-
ities and uphold the Federal Govern-
ment’s trust and treaty responsibilities
to Indian Country. I hope this month
will serve as an opportunity for this
entire body to reexamine how we can
strengthen our commitment to Native
peoples and recommit to our shared re-
sponsibilities.

D-Day operations at Tarawa Atoll in
the Pacific. On November 22, 1943,
Whitaker was killed in action during
the effort to secure Betio Island in the
Tarawa Atoll. He was 18 years old. Dur-
ing this battle, over 3,000 U.S. marines
and sailors were killed or wounded.
After the war was over, there were ef-
forts to repatriate all of the fallen;
however, almost half of the known cas-
ualties were not recovered.
In March of this year, thanks to the
efforts of History Flight, Inc., the Re-
public of Kiribati, and the Defense
POW/MIA Accounting Agency,
Whitaker’s remains were identified. On
November 22, 2019, 76 years after he
gave the last full measure of devotion
in service to his country, Channing
Whitaker will be buried with full mili-
tary honors in Des Moines, IA.
Our country owes a debt of gratitude
to all who have served in defense of our
country and especially to those who
killed in action. I am grateful that this
Iowan is finally coming home and that
his service and sacrifice will always be
remembered.

REMEMBERING MISTER FRED
ROGERS
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President I rise
today to pay tribute to the legacy of
one of our Nation’s most treasured edu-
cators and performers and a native
Pennsylvanian, Mister Fred Rogers.
Many are recognizing today as World
Kindness Day and are performing acts
of kindness toward their loved ones,
neighbors, and even strangers. Perhaps
no American embodies the spirit of
kindness more than Fred Rogers.
Affectionately known by children
and adults alike as ‘‘Mister Rogers,’’
Fred McFeely Rogers was born in La-
trobe, PA on March 20, 1928. From an
early age, Fred Rogers demonstrated
an interest in learning, making art
through creative expression, and serv-
ing other. He graduated with a degree
in music composition from Rollins Col-
lege in Winter Park FL., in 1951 and
earned a degree in divinity from the
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary in
1962. A year later, he became an or-
dained minister of the Presbyterian
Church.
Mister Rogers began his television
career shortly after college, working
on the sets of NBC in New York City.
He then moved back to Southwestern
Pennsylvania to work for the first
conmmunity-owned, public television
station in the country, Pittsburgh’s
WQED. He gained a firsthand view of
the transformative power of television
and the impact that educational pro-
grams could have on adults and chil-
dren. At WQED, Mister Rogers worked
with Josie Carey on a program called
‘‘The Children’s Corner’’, where many
of his now-familiar characters were
first given life. Additionally, he sought
the expertise of Dr. Margaret McFar-
land, the director of the Arsenal Fam-
ily and Children’s Center in Pitts-
burgh, to integrate best teaching prac-
tices into his work.
In 1963, Rogers appeared on camera
for the first time to host a children’s
program called ‘‘Misterogers’’. The pro-
gram was filmed by the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation in Toronto
and aired until 1967. Rogers returned to
Pittsburgh and WQED, where he cre-
ated and filmed ‘‘Mister Rogers’ Neigh-
borhood’’. By 1968, the Public Broad-
casting Service was broadcasting Mis-
ter Rogers to thousands of households
throughout the country.
For three decades, Mister Rogers
brought love, kindness, generosity,
grace, laughter, and cheer into the
lives of countless children and their
families. His lessons and performances
on ‘‘Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood’’
taught children about respect, safety,
perseverance, civility, and caring for
others. He did not shy away from issues
that face almost every child, including
intolerance, disagreement, and bul-
lying. Because he could connect with
children in a way few adults could,
Mister Rogers helped children to cope
and understand difficult emotional
issues like anger, death, and divorce.
Mister Rogers was a friend to all chil-
dren and played an important role in
the lives of many by reminding them of
their self-worth.
Mister Rogers was bestowed with nu-
merous accolades, including the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom, which was
awarded by President George W. Bush
in 2002. Since his death on February 27,
2003, scores of people have paid tribute
to Mister Rogers’ life and legacy. This
year, Pennsylvania celebrated the first
1–4–3 Day—the number of letters in the
word ‘‘I love you’’, as Mister Rogers
would note—in Rogers’ honor. Last
month, the city of Nashville, TN, pro-
claimed November as Thank You, Mis-
ter Rogers Month. The arts industry
has payed tribute to Rogers’ body of
work through collaborative music
projects, biographies, and feature
films. The outpouring of support is a
testament to Rogers’ impact on the
Nation. Even today, millions of chil-
dren continue to benefit from Mister
Rogers’ work through programs like
the cartoon ‘‘Daniel Tiger’s Neighbor-
hood,’’ which is made and distributed
by Fred Rogers Productions.
Fred Rogers will be remembered as a
trailblazer in television, master educa-
tor, model citizen, and most notably,
an inspiration to children and commu-
nities across the Nation. His legacy
lives on through his art and can be
found in acts of kindness being done in
every neighborhood across the country.
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues
to join me in celebrating the life of
Fred Rogers, a friendly neighbor and
model citizen for whom every day was
beautiful.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO LEE GIBSON
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President,
I come forward today to recognize the
executive director of the Regional
Transportation Commission of Washoe
County, Lee Gibson, who after over 10
years of dedicated service, announced
his retirement this year.
Since his appointment to chief direc-
tor of the RTC in 2009, Mr. Gibson has
worked tirelessly to improve customer
service and promote collaboration with
the local community. During his ten-
ure at the RTC, he has reduced agency
operating costs by over 30 percent
while delivering the largest
multimodal construction program in
the agency’s history. His dedication
and pragmatism has helped guide the
RTC of Washoe County through tumul-
tuous economic times as well as the ex-
ponential growth of the Reno-Sparks
area.
The RTC, under the management of
Mr. Gibson, adopted a sustainability
policy that has led to a multitude of
successful projects, including earning
national recognition for the SouthEast
Connector. The RTC has also been rec-
ognized for achieving LEED certifi-
cation for two recently opened transit
centers and obtained recognition for
the development of Complete Streets
and sustainable highway design
throughout the Truckee Meadows. The
region was even designated as a bicy-
cle-friendly community by the Amer-
ican League of Bicyclists.
Mr. Gibson did not just focus on re-
structuring the transit system during
his time as the Director of the RTC; his
emphasis on customer service and time
performance led to improved customer
satisfaction with the transportation
services. This is due to the RTC’s im-
plementation of innovative services,
such as the RTC RAPID bus rapid tran-
sit project. Mr. Gibson also succeeded
in delivering a broader community out-
reach program and successfully col-
laborated with other agencies to plan
and deliver efficient and effective
transportation services.
Mr. Gibson made sure to give back to
his community beyond his impressive
service in the RTC. He is a founding
member of Northern Nevada Transpor-
tation Collaborative, NNTC, a coalition
of business and government leaders,
academic researchers, transportation
professionals, and citizens committed
to promoting transportation as a key
tool for economic revitalization, qual-
ity of life, and sustainability. In 2012 he
became the chairman of the Nevada
Executive Committee for Transpor-
tation Safety. There, he works with
State and local agencies to promote
safety policies for all modes of trans-
portation. He is also a member of the
TRB Planning Applications Committee
and the APTA Planning and Policy
Committee.
Today, I celebrate the many con-
tributions of Lee Gibson to the Reno-
Sparks metropolitan area and Washoe
County as well as to the Northern Ne-
vada community. We owe Mr. Gibson a
debt of gratitude for his service and his
leadership will be missed.∑

RECOGNIZING A & J AUTO REPAIR
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home
State of Idaho. However, in honor of
Veterans Day on November 11, this
month I will honor a veteran-owned
small business for each of the 10 days
the Senate is in legislative session. The
personal sacrifices made by America’s
veterans have protected the very free-
doms and values that give each of us
and our children the ability to achieve
the American dream. The skills vet-
erans learn as members of the military
are invaluable and undoubtedly con-
tribute to Idaho’s flourishing veteran
business community. I am proud of the
sacrifices veterans have made to pro-
tect our country and that they are
choosing Idaho to call home when they
complete their service in the military.
As your U.S. Senator from the great
State of Idaho, it is my pleasure to rec-
ognize A & J Auto Repair in Twin Falls
as the veteran-owned Idaho Small
Business of the Day for November 13,
2019.
A & J Auto Repair is owned and oper-
ated by Charles ‘‘Abe’’ Abrahamson,
who served in the United States Marine
Corps, and his wife Robin. Abe is an ac-
tive member of the American Legion
and was recently recognized as the 2019
American Legion National Recruiter of
the Year for his work recruiting more
than 700 new members in 2018.
In 2013, the Abrahamsons opened A &
J Auto Repair to provide automotive
maintenance and repair services to the
Magic Valley. Factory trained and cer-
tified technicians at A & J Auto Repair
service all makes and models of cars,
trucks, and sports utility vehicles. Abe
Abrahamson is certified to service
Volkswagen and Audi vehicles. The
company prides itself in providing cus-
tomers with accurate and timely re-
pairs. A & J Auto Repair technicians
and staff work hard to provide excep-
tional, personalized services at afford-
able prices.
Congratulations to Abe and Robin
Abrahamson and all of the employees
at A & J Auto Repair for being selected
as the veteran-owned Idaho Small
Business of the Day for November 13,
2019. You make our great State proud,
and I look forward to your continued
growth and success.∑

S. 2843. A bill to reauthorize the Vio-
lence Against Women Act of 1994, and
for other purposes; to the Committee
on the Judiciary.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President,
today, along with every other Senate
Democrat, I am proud to introduce the
Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2019.
This bill passed the House by a vote
of 163–158, with 33 Republicans sup-
porting it.
It was written by the people on the
front lines helping victims. It is not a
Democratic bill or a Republican bill, it
is a bill crafted by and for survivors
who know exactly what’s need in the
real world. In other words, it is the sur-
vivors’ bill. As I stated before, any re-
authorization of the Violence Against
Women Act must do two things.
First, it must preserve the advance-
ments made when it was last reauthor-
ized in 2013. And second, it must in-
clude meaningful improvements to the
law.
The meaningful legal improvements
in this bill are particularly important,
and I would like to highlight three.
First, this bill preserves the anti-dis-
crimination protections that were
made in 2013. These protections are
particularly important to the LGBT
community. According to the Center
for Disease Control, along with 35 per-
cent of heterosexual women, 44 percent
of lesbian women, and 61 percent of bi-
sexual women experience rape, phys-
ical violence, or stalking by an inti-
mate partner.
Similarly, the 2015 U.S. transgender
survey found that 47 percent of
transgender people have been sexually
assaulted. Simply put, these protec-
tions are important and we should not
only be preserving them, we should be
doing more to strengthen them. This
bill also makes meaningful improve-
ments to the law to address domestic
violence in Indian country. For exam-
ple, it expands jurisdiction over non-In-
dians for crimes against children, el-
ders, and law enforcement.
A 2016 Justice Department report ex-
plained that ‘‘more than four in five
American Indian and Alaska Native
women have experienced violence in
their lifetime.’’
The report also found that 56 percent
have experienced sexual violence, 56
percent have experienced violence at
the hands of an intimate partner, and 9
percent have been stalked. For me,
these numbers are even more upsetting
because California has the largest Trib-
al population in the United States. We
must continue to respect Tribal sov-
ereignty and ensure that we are doing
the most to protect the most vulner-
able among us, particularly children.
Finally, this bill also keeps guns out of
the hands of domestic abusers.
Guns are the most likely way for do-
mestic violence to take a woman’s life.
Women in the United States are eleven
times more likely to be murdered by a
firearm than in other high-income
countries. The presence of guns in do-
mestic violence situations increases
the chances that a woman will be mur-
dered by 500 percent. This bill makes
modest, but necessary, improvements
to the law to keep guns out of the
hands of domestic abusers.
For example, the bill amends current
law so that people convicted of stalk-
ing cannot possess firearms.
Yet, the National Rifle Association
opposes it. 33 Republicans still voted
for the House bill, and I hope my Re-
publicans colleagues in the Senate will
do the same. It’s the right thing to do.
The different parts of the Violence
Against Women Act are all linked.
For instance, preserving the non-dis-
crimination advancements made when
VAWA was reauthorized in 2013 will
help protect the LGBT community, but
keeping guns out of the hands of do-
mestic abusers will help protect LGBT
victims as well.
This bill takes this sort of com-
prehensive approach by, for example,
preserving the advances made to non-
discrimination protections and improv-
ing the law in the areas of Tribal pro-
tections and gun safety. There is no
simple way to stop domestic violence,
but we have a duty to do all that we
can.
I thank the president, and I yield the
floor.

SENATE RESOLUTION 420—ENCOUR-
AGING THE PRESIDENT TO EX-
PAND THE LIST OF THE DE-
PARTMENT OF VETERANS AF-
FAIRS OF PRESUMPTIVE MED-
ICAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED
WITH EXPOSURE TO AGENT OR-
ANGE TO INCLUDE
PARKINSONISM, BLADDER CAN-
CER, HYPERTENSION, AND
HYPOTHYROIDISM
Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. TESTER,
Ms. HIRONO, Mr. DURBIN, Mrs. MURRAY,
Ms. STABENOW, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr.
SANDERS, Mr. PETERS, and Mr. SCHU-
MER) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs:
S. RES. 420
Whereas veterans have sacrificed so much
for the United States and have proudly
served the United States to secure and pre-
serve the freedoms inherent in the Constitu-
tion of the United States;
Whereas veterans and their families de-
serve the benefits that they have earned;
Whereas members of the Armed Forces
sprayed millions of gallons of Agent Orange,
a tactical herbicide, and other tactical herbi-
cides on trees and vegetation during the
Vietnam War, from 1962 to 1975;
Whereas 58,220 members of the Armed
Forces died in combat during the Vietnam
War, and veterans are still dying from dis-
eases related to exposure to Agent Orange;
Whereas approximately 83,000 veterans are
currently living with at least one of the pre-
sumptive medical conditions associated with
exposure to Agent Orange;
Whereas the report set forth by the Na-
tional Academy of Medicine in 2018 entitled
‘‘Veterans and Agent Orange Exposure: Up-
date 11’’ recognized—
(1) hypothyroidism and bladder cancer to
have a limited or suggestive evidence of as-
sociation to exposure to Agent Orange; and
(2) Parkinson-like symptoms, also known
as Parkinsonism, and hypertension to have
sufficient evidence of association to exposure
to Agent Orange;
Whereas, due to exposure to Agent Orange,
veterans and their families are facing monu-
mental hurdles with respect to financial
stress, mental health, substance addiction,
and physical health issues; and
Whereas internal documents obtained by a
veteran under section 552 of title 5, United
States Code (commonly referred to as the
‘‘Freedom of Information Act’’), determined
that the Director of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget and other White House offi-
cials objected to the recommendation by
former Secretary of Veterans Affairs David
Shulkin to add bladder cancer,
Parkinsonism, and hypothyroidism to the
list of diseases related to exposure to Agent
Orange: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate encourages the
President—
(1) to take care of members of the Armed
Forces, veterans, and their family members
who have given so much, including the ulti-
mate sacrifice, in defense of the United
States; and
(2) to take action on behalf of thousands of
veterans across the United States who are
living with chronic health conditions by ex-
panding the list of the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs of presumptive medical condi-
tions associated with exposure to Agent Or-
ange to include Parkinsonism, bladder can-
cer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

this subsection shall be construed to mean
that the funds transferred by the national
governing bodies and paralympic sports or-

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA
TRADE AGREEMENT
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I
come to the floor today to shine a spot-
light on our strong, healthy, and grow-
ing economy. Specifically, my focus is
on how this record-setting economy is
helping and could continue to help all
Americans.
Since Republicans took over and
passed tax relief, there has been no end
to the boon in jobs in our country. Re-
publicans have put the U.S. worker in
the driver’s seat. The October jobs re-
port again beat all expectations. U.S.
employers added a solid 128,000 jobs
last month alone.
Even better, American workers are
noting that their wallets are thicker
and fatter. Wages are up 3 percent year
over year. It is the fastest growth—
faster than inflation.
We also continue to see record-low
unemployment across the country. At
3.6 percent, the U.S. jobless rate is near
a 50-year low. African-American unem-
ployment is at a 50-year low. In fact, 3
years of Republican pro-growth policies
have produced more than 6 million new
jobs—actually, 6,700,000 new jobs.
Today, the United States has nearly 160
million people working. That is an-
other record high. Median household
income is the highest in 20 years. No
wonder a new poll by Gallup shows
Americans are planning to spend more
than ever this holiday season because
they have the money. They have
earned it, and they have kept more of
their hard-earned money as a result of
tax relief.
The U.S. stock market continues to
set new highs, and that is welcome
news for people when they look at their
pensions, their retirements, and their
401(k)s.
Notably, trade optimism has been a
major factor in the stock market’s
climb to record highs, which brings me
to my next point: How do we start the
next chapter of the United States in
terms of our success story? I believe it
is through America-first trade vic-
tories.
Without question, the most impor-
tant trade deal we need to pass right
now is USMCA—the United States-
Mexico-Canada trade agreement. In my
view, it is vital to continuing our
American prosperity. The U.S.-Mexico-
Canada trade agreement was signed by
all three countries’ leaders more than a
year ago, so you would think, well, it
should be in place. But it takes more
than that. Mexico gave its final ap-
proval to USMCA in June. Canada is
waiting for us—for the House and the
Senate—to give the approval as well.
Without a doubt, USMCA is the best
trade upgrade in 25 years. It is going to
expand market access for a host of U.S.
products, and it is going to sharpen
U.S. exporters’ competitive edge.
Above all, USMCA is a big benefit for
American workers. It will protect and
produce millions of U.S. jobs, and that
is critical.
I predict it will pass the Senate with
strong bipartisan support. So it has to
get here. Yet we have not crossed the
finish line. There is a roadblock, and
the roadblock is at the other end of

this building. The roadblock is Speaker
NANCY PELOSI. She has not and will not
yet allow a vote in the House of Rep-
resentatives. It seems to me the Speak-
er is too obsessed with impeaching the
President instead of being focused on
fighting for American workers. She
stopped all progress on USMCA in its
tracks.
The stakes, meanwhile, could not be
higher. Passing USMCA will save
American jobs. Twelve million current
American jobs are on the line. The deal
will create 180,000 new U.S. jobs.
USMCA is a boon for the entire econ-
omy. It will boost our economy by $70
billion. So what exactly is the Speaker
waiting for?
Canada and Mexico are our top trad-
ing partners. U.S. producers don’t need
impeachment chaos or an impeach-
ment circus; what we need is trade cer-
tainty.
Not only is the deal essential for U.S.
manufacturers, our ranchers and farm-
ers are counting on it as well. Canada
and Mexico are the top export markets
for American farmers. Last year, U.S.
agriculture exports to the two coun-
tries totaled $40 billion. For the past 5
years, Mexico has consistently ranked
second or third for U.S. wheat imports.
USMCA is a huge win for Wyoming
wheat growers. My State is going to
reap enormous benefits from this deal.
Wyoming foreign trade has increased
nearly 20 percent in recent years. Wyo-
ming farmers—the Presiding Officer
knows this, coming from an agri-
culture State—play a key role in our
economy. This Friday, I will be hon-
ored to attend the 100th annual meet-
ing of the Wyoming Farm Bureau. It
will be in Laramie. Our farmers add
billions to the State economy every
year, and trade is a big part of it.
Wyoming’s annual agriculture ex-
ports total $300 million. The export
market supports 2,600 jobs in our State.
Our State not only produces livestock,
seeds, and crops, but we are exporting
essential chemicals that farmers every-
where need to grow their crops.
Wyoming farmers and ranchers are
counting on expanded export markets
for future growth. New markets mean
new opportunities, and Wyoming is
poised to seize them.
In coming years, we plan to add to
our high-quality beef, our grain, and
our hay exports. Future State exports
will include gluten-free products, as
well as craft beer and distilled spirits,
just to name a few.
That is why the USMCA agreement is
so essential for the people, not just in
Wyoming but for people all across
America. To keep our record-setting
economy on track, we need to pass this
‘‘America First’’ trade deal, and we
need to do it now.
It is time to put partisan politics
aside. It is time to pass USMCA.
f
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on a
different topic, I come to the floor
today to discuss the Democrats’ par-
tisan campaign against President
Trump.
The Democrats have been obsessed
with impeaching him since day one of
his Presidency, and I absolutely mean
day one. As the President was taking
the oath of office, sworn in to the Pres-
idency, the Washington Post ran this
headline: ‘‘The campaign to impeach
President Trump has begun.’’ It was
posted, actually, at 12:18, the day he
took the oath of office. The minute he
took the oath of office, that headline
was posted.
So 3 years have passed, and impeach-
ment is still taking up all the Demo-
crats’ time, all their efforts, and all
their energy. They are fixated on it,
and they are obsessed with it. As a doc-
tor, in my opinion, the Democrats have
a bad case of impeachment fever, and it
seems that there is no cure for them.
We all know that Democrats deeply
dislike this President. They have from
the moment he was elected in Novem-
ber 2016. Let me ask you: Does that
mean they get to overturn the last
election? That is what they are trying
to do, not to mention interfere with
the upcoming election. That is really
what it is—a bitterly partisan process.
Remember, it is being controlled by
one political party. This is totally par-
tisan, and up to now, at least it has
been conducted, prior to today, in total
secret, in the cellar, behind closed
doors, and in the shadows. That is the
way they have done it. It is not a fair
process—no transparency and no ac-
countability.
I think President Trump has a right
to be treated fairly, yet his rights have
been completely ignored. The process,
in my opinion, is rigged against the
President. The outcome is predeter-
mined and fixed. The Democratic
House wins; the American public loses.
Democrats are so obsessed, they
can’t work. The people elected them to
do a job, to work for them, and they
are nowhere to be found. The Demo-
crats, for example, will not pass de-
fense funding, funding our military,
protecting our borders, protecting our
Nation, and they will not approve trade
deals or lower drug costs. They will not
even help fix our aging roads and
bridges.
Well, that is all bad news for the
American people. All of this is tied up
in the impeachment obsession that is
grinding the Democrats in the House to
a halt. The good news is, Republicans
are highly resistant to this fever, and
so are most Americans.
We are not going to join the Demo-
crats’ impeachment campaign. Repub-
licans prefer to work on the issues we
were elected to address—jobs, the econ-
omy, national security—and we are
going to continue to work for the peo-
ple who elected us.
I yield the floor.

ator from New Jersey.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—
S. RES. 150
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, over
104 years ago, the Ottoman Empire
launched a systematic campaign to ex-
terminate the Armenian population
through killings, forced deportation,
starvation, and other brutal means.
Every year I join the Armenian com-
munity in honoring the memory of the
victims who made invaluable contribu-
tions to sustain the Armenian people
and preserve Armenian history and cul-
ture before their cruel, inhuman
deaths.
At the time of the genocide, U.S. dip-
lomats who witnessed it knew that the
tragedy they were seeing was an inten-
tional choice. Henry Morgenthau, the
then-U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman
Empire, said that the Turkish Govern-
ment’s deportation order for the Arme-
nians was ‘‘a death warrant to a whole
race.’’ Those are his words. They are ‘‘a
death warrant to a whole race,’’ and an
aim which ‘‘they made no particular
attempt to conceal’’ in their discus-
sions with them.
We know what to call such an inten-
tional, highly organized effort to de-
stroy a people on account of their iden-
tity alone: genocide. In other cir-
cumstances, no one questions this defi-
nition.
U.S. foreign policy must reflect an
honest accounting of human rights
abuses, crimes against humanity, eth-
nic cleansing, and genocide. We cannot
turn our backs on the Armenian vic-
tims of genocide nor on any victims of
genocide anywhere or anytime it oc-
curs. If we do, we only empower those
who seek to use genocide as a weapon
of war for their own malevolent pur-
poses.
The Government of Turkey has fund-
ed lobbyists willing to trumpet lies and
make excuses for these atrocities. The
Turkish Government and its sympa-
thizers have advocated for restrictive
laws on expression and against legisla-
tion that recognizes the Armenian
genocide, initiated prosecutions and
smear campaigns against those who
study the Armenian community’s expe-
riences at the hands of the Turks, and
even resorted to violence and harass-
ment of journalists and human rights
activists who bravely speak the truth.
These actions are unacceptable and
speak volumes to both the crime and
its coverup.
Thankfully, there are also voices
speaking up against Turkey’s efforts to
silence the truth of the Armenian
genocide. I have long worked in the
U.S. Senate to push for this honest ac-
counting and to ensure that anyone
who represents the U.S. Government
does the same. In every session of Con-
gress since 2006, I have introduced or
cosponsored resolutions affirming the
facts of the Armenian genocide. When I
was chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, I was proud to
preside over the passage of an Arme-
nian genocide resolution out of com-
mittee for the first time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6575
November 13, 2019
The U.S. Congress cannot stand idly
by and let the truth of genocide be si-
lenced. We must commit ourselves to
learning the painful history of the Ar-
menians as we seek to build a better
world for our own and future genera-
tions. We must stand up unequivocally
for truth, justice, and peace. Only then,
with that hard work and advocacy and
recognition of the truth, will we then
confidently be able to say ‘‘never
again.’’ Never again.
I have heard many colleagues come
to the floor when we talked about the
Holocaust and say ‘‘never again.’’ In
Rwanda, we said ‘‘never again.’’ In the
Armenian genocide, we should say
‘‘never again’’ as well. Genocide is
genocide, and we should recognize it as
such so we can move forward at the end
of the day.
I am proud to have worked with Sen-
ator CRUZ and 23 other Senators in
leading a resolution recognizing the
horror of this genocide. I thank them
for their efforts on this important reso-
lution and appreciate their standing up
for the truth.
This is not an issue of historical dis-
pute. I listened to President Erdogan’s
press conference with President Trump
where he suggested they are reviewing
this history. They are going to review
it until there isn’t one more Armenian
genocide victim alive. Historians from
across the world, the most noted histo-
rians, and genocide observers and ex-
perts and ethicists have said that this
was a genocide.
I want to thank my colleagues for
forwarding this important resolution
and appreciate their standing up for
the truth. I hope the full Senate will
join us and send a clear message to the
world that the United States stands by
the truth, stands by justice, and stands
with victims of genocide wherever they
may be. This passed overwhelmingly
with strong Republican support in the
House of Representatives. We are one
step away from finally recognizing this
historical fact.
Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee be discharged
from further consideration of S. Res.
150 and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I further ask that
the resolution be agreed to, the pre-
amble be agreed to, and the motions to
reconsider be considered made and laid
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from South Carolina.
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, No. 1,
there is nobody I admire more on for-
eign policy than Senator MENENDEZ. He
has been a champion of this cause. My
objection will not be to sugarcoat his-
tory, nor to rewrite it. I just met with
President Erdogan and President
Trump about the S–400 purchase and
about the problems we face in Syria
from the military incursion by Turkey,
and I do hope Turkey and Armenia can
come together and deal with this prob-
lem. But given where we are in Syria
and some hope that maybe we can re-
solve things, I object, not because of
the past but because of the future.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President,
needless to say, I have great admira-
tion for the Senator from South Caro-
lina and consider him a friend, but our
problem with Turkey—and I know my
colleague has asked me several times:
What are we doing about Turkey? And
I know it was meant in the context of
sanctions, which I obviously do support
for a variety of reasons—violations of
CAATSA, purchase of the S–400, what
they did in Syria, and the list goes on
and on. But in our desire to see Turkey
become that which we would want it to
be, which it is not, under President
Erdogan, we continue to become
enablers of the types of actions that
are undemocratic. More journalists are
jailed in Turkey than in any other
place in the world. Imagine that—a
NATO ally. More lawyers are jailed in
Turkey than in any other place in the
world. And the simple recognition of a
historical fact—the simple recognition
of a historical fact of the Ottoman Em-
pire and the cruel persecution of the
Armenian people cannot be recognized
by the U.S. Senate the way the House
of Representatives recognized it in an
overwhelmingly bipartisan vote? Are
we so afraid to stand up to history and
the truth? Are we so afraid about Tur-
key? Who is the superpower? Who is
the superpower? I am beginning to
wonder because every time Turkey
threatens to do something, we cower.
Well, as far as I am concerned, they
don’t get to dictate the views of the
Congress of the United States. They
don’t get to dictate the views of this
Senate. This Senate should rise up and
recognize the historical truth as docu-
mented by historians and as docu-
mented by our own diplomats. I will
not cease continuing to come to the
floor to prick the conscience of the
Senate and to ultimately reveal who
supports recognizing the Armenian
genocide and who does not. Otherwise,
the words ‘‘never again’’—they are just
hollow.
With that, Mr. President, I yield the
floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I always
appreciate Senator MENENDEZ standing
up for human rights all over the world,
and this is one of the worst human
rights violations the world has seen in
the last 150 years. I thank my friend
from New Jersey.
f
NOMINATION OF STEVEN J.
MENASHI
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, judges
make decisions around the country.
They are making them right now on
workers’ rights, voters’ rights, wom-
en’s rights, civil rights, LGBTQ
rights—decisions that would limit
those rights for a generation.
We used to be able to rely on judges
to expand human rights and civil
rights and all rights of humankind.
Today, we cringe so often because of
judges who get selected by this Presi-
dent who put their thumbs on the scale
to support corporations over workers
and health insurance companies over
patients and Wall Street over con-
sumers.
These same judges make decisions on
healthcare and sentencing and cor-
porate power. That is why we can’t af-
ford to have Steven Menashi on the
Federal bench. On all of these issues,
his record makes it clear that he is not
on the side of the people we were sent
here to serve.
There is a simple rule for under-
standing where Steve Menashi stands
on any issue: If a policy helps ordinary,
hard-working Americans, Menashi op-
poses it. He argued that gun safety reg-
ulation is ‘‘pointless and self-defeat-
ing.’’ We are talking about common-
sense background checks that 85 per-
cent of the American public supports,
all blocked by the gun manufacturers.
Tell that to the people of Dayton
whose lives were torn apart and ended
in some cases by gun violence. Tell
them background checks are pointless.
Menashi also advised Stephen Miller
on immigration policy—the man who
stands in the way of comprehensive im-
migration reform and helped orches-
trate the separation—the ripping of
children from their parents’ arms.
Menashi refused to answer any ques-
tions about whether he worked on the
Trump family separation policy with
Stephen Miller.
He has been a senior adviser to Betsy
DeVos at the Department of Education,
where we have seen one disastrous de-
cision after another. The headline in
the New York Times says it all: ‘‘Ap-
peals Court Nominee Shaped DeVos’s
Illegal Loan Forgiveness Effort.’’
Menashi devised the scheme to ille-
gally use people’s Social Security data
to deny them debt relief after they
were scammed by for-profit colleges. It
seems that the Department of Edu-
cation with Menashi there always sided
with the for-profit schools against
Denison or Ohio State or the Univer-
sity of Toledo or Lourdes or Case West-
ern or any of the traditional, excellent
schools of higher education in this
country.
We have seen how shady schools like
Corinthian used deceptive and even il-
legal tactics to trick Ohioans into tak-
ing out huge loans, only to then close
up shop and leave them with meaning-
less degrees or credits—often falling
short even of that but always with
mountains of debt. We need to hold
these for-profit schools accountable,
but, of course, we learned not to hold
our breath when it comes to the Trump
administration holding any of the elite
in this country accountable.
Instead of figuring out how to pro-
vide relief for students, DeVos and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6576 November 13, 2019
Menashi went to work figuring out how
to let the schools that scammed them
off the hook. Be clear—it was not
Menashi just doing his job advocating
for someone else’s bad policy; he wrote
the memo. It is clear that he actually
supported and supports Betsy DeVos’s
radical agenda.
Now they want to put him on the
Federal bench so he can put his thumb
on the scales of justice for shady for-
profit schools over students and cor-
porations over workers and, as I said,
for Wall Street and insurance compa-
nies over patients. We have seen that
from judge after judge after judge with
President Trump, but even by those
Trump standards, Menashi is particu-
larly bad.
It always comes down to whose side
you are on. Are you a judge who will
stand on the side of workers or stand
on the side of corporations? Will you
stand on the side of students—strug-
gling students, moderate-income and
sometimes low-income students trying
to build better lives for themselves—or
on the side of failed sham schools? His
record is clear.
The stakes for Ohio are too high to
give Steve Menashi a lifetime appoint-
ment on the Federal bench.
f
PENSIONS
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, yester-
day we got another reminder of the ur-
gency in the pension crisis facing more
than 1 million workers and retirees
with the news that Dean Foods is filing
for bankruptcy. The company is part of
the Central States Pension Fund. The
bankruptcy puts the pension fund that
much closer to insolvency, that much
closer to having to turn to the PBGC
for help, and that much closer to
knocking down the dominoes that
could bring down our whole multiem-
ployer pension system and potentially
and even likely trigger a recession. We
have to act now for the sake of our
economy, for the sake of thousands of
small businesses, and for the sake of a
million Americans who are on the
verge of facing massive cuts to the pen-
sions they earned.
This crisis affects thousands of Ohio-
ans. It affects the massive Central
States Pension Plan, the United Work-
ers Pension Plan, the Ironworkers
Local 17 Pension Plan, the Southwest
Ohio carpenters, the bakers and confec-
tioners, and many others. It touches
every State in this Nation. If the sys-
tem collapses, it won’t be just retirees
who will feel the pain. Current workers
will be stuck paying into pensions they
will never receive. Small businesses
will be left drowning in pension liabil-
ity they can’t afford to pay. That will
have ripple effects throughout the
economy. If we do nothing, this can
trigger a recession on par with the
housing crisis. We know who gets hurt
the worst. It is the small businesses,
workers, and the retirees who are
counting on these pensions to survive.
People in this town so often don’t un-
derstand the collective bargaining
process. People give up dollars today at
the bargaining table for the promise of
a secure retirement with good
healthcare and a pension. These work-
ers’ lives and livelihoods will be dev-
astated if Congress doesn’t do its job.
I think about the words of Larry
Ward at a hearing in Ohio last year. He
said:
I don’t understand how it is that Congress
would even consider asking us to take a cut
to my pension or to see it going away, when
it had no problem sending billions to the
Wall Street crooks who caused this problem
in the first place. They used that to pay
themselves bonuses. We use our pensions to
pay for medicine and food and heat.
Think about that. Wall Street uses
this pension money for bonuses. Mr.
Ward and his other workers and retir-
ees use their pensions to pay for medi-
cine and food and heat. There is some-
thing wrong with this picture. It is bad
enough that Wall Street squandered
workers’ money; it is worse that the
government, which is supposed to look
out for these folks, is ignoring the
promise to these workers.
I know there are Senators in both
parties working in good faith to fix
this, but this bankruptcy is a reminder
that we are running short on time to
come up with the bipartisan solution
we need.
It comes back to the dignity of work.
When work has dignity, we honor the
retirement security that people earned.
When work has dignity, we fight for
those workers, we honor workers, and
we respect workers.
I urge my colleagues in this body,
let’s pass a solution that honors their
work, that honors the dignity of work,
and that keeps our promise to the peo-
ple who make this country work.
I yield the floor.

PRESIDENT ERDOGAN
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, the
United States is always grateful to re-
ceive heads of State from around the
world. Heads of State from around the
world come to the United States be-
cause they know we are 25 percent of
the world’s economy. We are the most
powerful military in the world. We are
the most moral Nation in the world in
how we manage freedom of the press,
freedom of speech, and freedom of op-
portunity for all people within our
country. When we see a problem in our
country, we work to address that.
So with that, we are welcoming an-
other head of State to the United
States today, President Erdogan of
Turkey. Turkey has been a long-stand-
ing NATO ally. NATO was formed in
the late 1940s. Turkey and Greece were
the first two countries that came into
NATO after its formation in the 1940s.
Turkey has been a member of NATO
since 1952. We have a very important
military base based in Turkey, Incirlik
Air Force Base. It is key in the war
against terror in that entire region.
Turkey hosts the largest Syrian ref-
ugee population. Turkey has been very
engaged in NATO, filling all of its bil-
lets and all of its requirements. They
have worked to be a good partner. They
have partnered with us in not only the
War on Terror in multiple different
countries in the regions, but they have
been very faithful to engage with
NATO as a whole.
But something is happening in Tur-
key that I hope President Trump and
President Erdogan had a very frank
discussion on because since 2016, Presi-
dent Erdogan of Turkey is shifting
Turkey away from NATO toward Rus-
sia, toward a more authoritative re-
gime, changing their Constitution to
give more power to Erdogan and to
whoever his successor is—if there is a
successor to Erdogan, if he doesn’t
maintain power and keep it forever
from here on out.
There was a mayoral election in
Istanbul that Erdogan didn’t agree
with, and so he declared it null and
void and forced another election in
Istanbul, hoping to get the outlook he
wanted, but the Turkish people actu-
ally voted even more so against
Erdogan in the next election in
Istanbul, putting in someone who di-
rectly opposed Erdogan and his party.
President Erdogan recently impris-
oned an American pastor who had
served more than 20 years in Turkey,
serving people of all faiths and all
backgrounds in the beautiful city of
Izmir. He rounded up Andrew Brunson
with tens of thousands of other people
whom President Erdogan and his gov-
ernment considered a threat, and most
of them they have been held without
charges for years now. There are thou-
sands of people right now who are still
awaiting their day in court from the
2016 coup. Not knowing if any of these
folks were actually connected to the
coup, they rounded up teachers, jour-
nalists, law enforcement individuals—
just everyone they could round up that
they had any suspicion of and impris-
oned them and said: We will bring
charges to you later. Thousands are
still waiting for ‘‘later.’’
I happened to be in Turkey in Decem-
ber of 2016 to personally meet with the
Ministry of Justice in Ankara to talk
about Andrew Brunson, an American
swept up in that time period who had
nothing to do with the coup that hap-
pened in 2016. President Erdogan solely
had the ability to get him released but
held him for years with all kinds of
wild accusations against an American
missionary who had been there for dec-
ades.
Turkey continues to be able to focus
on the Kurdish Syrians just south of
their border. I have to tell you, there
are a group of the Kurds whom I under-
stand President Erdogan should be at-
tentive to. There is a certain group
called the PKK. The United States also
considers that Kurdish group terrorists
and have for decades. That particular
group of Kurds who are in Syria have
traveled into Turkey and carried out

car bombs and have killed hundreds of
people in terrorist attacks in Turkey.
President Erdogan has every reason to
pay attention to that particular group
of Kurds, and I understand his frustra-
tion that the United States partnered
with them to take out ISIS, but the
fact was, Turkey would not come
across the border to help us take out
ISIS, and so we found partners who
would take on ISIS with us—and they
did.
Now Erdogan wants to push those
folks back. His methods are quite bru-
tal in the process. When we went into
Afghanistan, we understood that all
Afghan people were not our enemy—
the Taliban was, al-Qaida was. That
was our enemy, and they found their
way among the populations. We were
exceptionally careful when we went
into Afghanistan to protect the Afghan
people, yet find ways to take the bat-
tles to the Taliban and to al-Qaida.
Erdogan’s methods were to come across
the border with tanks and heavy artil-
lery and start shelling cities in Syria,
knowing there were some PKK in those
villages, and so they just shelled them
all. Erdogan and some of his thugs also
came across with some of the other
groups who were working with the
Turks. We also have footage of them
taking prisoners and shooting them be-
side the road and leaving their bodies
there. These people had already surren-
dered. They were people who had al-
ready been handcuffed, and they exe-
cuted them beside the road. That is a
war crime that we should follow up
with, and I hope President Trump had
a very frank conversation with Presi-
dent Erdogan about following up on
war crimes.
Just to add to all of our difficulties
right now with President Erdogan, in
the past couple of years, he has shifted
his attention toward Russia and has
now completed a purchase of a Russian
air defense system. They are the very
first and only NATO country ever to
purchase Russian military equipment.
That equipment is not interoperable
with the rest of NATO. This is Russian
equipment that is specifically designed
to take the fight to the F–35. Turkey
believes it is going to purchase the F–
35 from the United States, and they
also believe they can purchase the S–
400 from Russia and have them side by
side. Well, they are wrong. Years ago,
Congress passed the Countering Amer-
ican Adversaries Through Sanctions
Act, commonly known as CAATSA. It
was a very clear message to anyone
who buys Russian military equipment
that there are sanctions coming to
your country, and it is clear. We have
applied those sanctions in the past, and
those sanctions need to be applied to
Turkey now.
In addition to that, Senator SHAHEEN
and I have partnered together to pass a
bill to block Turkey from taking any
of the F–35s—not trained in the equip-
ment, not simulators, no F–35s can go
to Turkey. If they are interested in
buying Russian air defense systems,
they understand clearly what that
means because we have made it clear
to the Turks for 2 years now: If you
buy Russian equipment, you cannot
also have the F–35. President Erdogan
was aware of that. His administration
was aware of that, and I hope President
Trump made it clear to him today, as
clear as this Congress has made it
clear, on a bipartisan basis, that Tur-
key cannot have the F–35 and also have
Russian military equipment at the
same time. That is incompatible. We
will continue to make that very clear
in the days ahead in our legislation,
and I believe a vote will not even be
close to send a message to Turkey that
we are interested in maintaining our
friendship and our NATO ally, but our
NATO ally needs to make a decision if
they are a NATO ally or if they are a
Russian ally because those two are not
congruent.
I hope that was the conversation that
happened today. We will find out in the
days ahead, but even if it was not, I
hope President Erdogan and the Turk-
ish Embassy hears it clearly now. This
Congress would look forward to
partnering with Turkey again in the
future, as we have for decades in the
past. We have had an economic rela-
tionship, a military relationship, and a
genuine friendship with Turkey, but we
do not know who Turkey is anymore.
We don’t recognize the Turkey of today
from Turkey 5 years ago. We would
never come to your country and beat
up protesters in the street as President
Erdogan’s security thugs did last year
in the United States. We would never
do that to your country. We would
never counter NATO just to spite you,
and we would certainly stay aligned
with a friend who has been a friend for
decades.
To the Turkish people, our beef is not
with you. Our frustration is with the
regime that is currently directing your
country away from its traditional al-
lies. We continue to reach our hand out
to the Turkish people, and we continue
to say to President Erdogan: This can
be different in the days ahead, as it has
been in the past, but some things need
to change, and we are not the ones who
walked away.
I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING DANIEL FLYNN FOR
THE 2019 MONTANA CONGRES-

TION
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Daniel Flynn of Belgrade, a
recipient of the 2019 Montana Congressional
Veteran Commendation for his service to his
country and leadership in his community.
Mr. Flynn has served in the United States
Army for over 15 years. In that time, he has
earned a total of 12 medals and awards in-
cluding the Bronze Star and Joint Service
Commendation Medal, attaining the rank of
Chief Warrant Officer III.
In his service to both his country and the
state of Montana Mr. Flynn has completed
three tours of duty in the Middle East for Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring
Freedom and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel.
During his tours, he travelled thousands of
miles where he routinely put himself in danger
to protect others. Today, we honor and thank
Mr. Flynn for his bravery.
In the community Mr. Flynn has even
helped the police apprehend a shoplifter. He is
a father of two and his family is proud of his
commitment and sacrifice to our great country.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in
commending Daniel Flynn for his dedication
and service.

HONORING REGISTERED APPREN-
TICESHIP PROGRAMS IN COLO-
RADO
HON. JASON CROW
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, in honor of
National Apprenticeship Week, I rise today to
recognize the importance of Registered Ap-
prenticeship Programs.
Since 1937, the Department of Labor’s Reg-
istered Apprenticeship Program has been a
model for recruiting and developing well-
trained workers in highly-skilled occupations.
Registered Apprenticeship Programs play a
vital role in setting robust training, pay, and
safety standards that are nationally recognized
and credentialed.
Programs that are given the registered ap-
prenticeship designation are subject to strin-
gent requirements that mandate progressive
wage increases, quality assurance assess-
ments by the government, comprehensive
safety training, and workplace rights protec-
tions. These standards and protections also
include important equal opportunity measures
and equity outcomes such as requiring tar-
geted outreach to previously underserved pop-
ulations for recruitment into apprenticeship
programs, diversifying the workforce and pro-
viding rewarding career opportunities for
women, veterans, and people of color.
Furthermore, I’d like to take a moment to
highlight the Colorado Building and Construc-
tion Trades Council, comprised of 24 craft
local unions who belong to 14 national and
international unions. These local unions make
represent 30,000 skilled working men and
women in the Colorado. The Building Trades
Union has, and continues to, exemplify the
gold standard of the Registered Apprentice-
ship system. Building Trades Registered Ap-
prenticeship programs represent over two
thirds of all the registered apprenticeships in
the U.S. and, together with its contractor part-
ners, invest over $1.5 billion annually in a na-
tionwide network of over 1,600 training cen-
ters.
The Building Trades’ Apprenticeship Pro-
grams are proven alternatives to a four-year
college degree and provide apprentices with
opportunities to learn portable skills and re-
ceive a debt-free education while earning liv-
able wages. I congratulate the Colorado Build-
ing and Construction Trades Council on their
success and implore my colleagues to join me
in protecting and expanding upon the DOL’s
Registered Apprenticeship Program.

PEACHMENT INQUIRY RESOLU-
TION
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of H. Res. 660, a resolution
establishing procedures for the House of Rep-
resentatives Committees investigating Presi-
dent Donald John Trump to continue their on-
going impeachment inquiry.
No one is above the law, and the President
must be held accountable for his actions. I first
called for an impeachment inquiry in May, and
witnesses have revealed even more evidence
of wrongdoing. The President withheld Con-
gressionally appropriated foreign aid money
while asking a foreign government to inves-
tigate a political rival, former Vice President
Joe Biden and his family. Congressional com-
mittees, including the House Permanent Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence, the Oversight
and Reform Committee, and the Judiciary
Committee, have been leading investigations
into the President’s actions, and the Adminis-
tration has obstructed those investigations at
every turn. My colleagues on the committees
of jurisdiction have been diligently working to
bring the truth to light. It is clear from the evi-
dence already uncovered, along with the
President’s own remarks, that he has betrayed
his oath to the Constitution and threatened our
national security. The investigation must con-
tinue.
The resolution on the floor today outlines
the procedures for the next phase of the im-
peachment investigation. The next phase of
the inquiry will allow Oregonians and people
across the country to witness the process de-
signed by our Founding Fathers to uphold our
values and maintain the checks and balances
that are essential to a functioning democracy.
Although we do not know the breadth of the
evidence that the inquiry will uncover, it is
clear that this is a grave time for our democ-
racy. We must use all the tools at our dis-
posal, including this impeachment inquiry, to
uncover the full scope and significance of the
President’s actions.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize James Geiger of Conrad, a
recipient of the 2019 Montana Congressional
Veteran Commendation for his service to his
country and leadership in his community.
Mr. Geiger was a member of the United
States Army Air Corps during World War II.
He served from 1942 to 1948 in the 303rd
Bomb Group and 360th Squadron and earned
the Air Medal with six oak leaf clusters along
with Service Medals in the European, Asiatic
and American theaters. Mr. Geiger attained
the rank of First Lieutenant.
Mr. Geiger was a B–17 pilot during World
War II. During one of his crew’s missions, the
navigator and turret gunner were wounded.
During the chaos, Geiger turned the controls
over to his co-pilot and went to give first aid
to his crew. Mr. Geiger kept them from bleed-
ing out and saved their lives. He is a true hero
who went above and beyond the call of duty
to serve his fellow man and country.
Mr. Geiger has served on the Church Coun-
cil for the United Methodist Church, the
Pondera Medical Center Hospital Board and is
a member of the American Legion. He is a
well-respected and adored member of his
community.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in

IN RECOGNITION OF THE TWEN-
TIETH ANNIVERSARY OF
MCCOWNGORDON CONSTRUCTION
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, today I
proudly rise to celebrate the twentieth anniver-
sary of McCownGordon Construction and its
numerous contributions to the Kansas City
community. As a significant cornerstone of the
community, I am truly honored to have this es-
tablishment in the Fifth Congressional District
of Missouri.
McCownGordon Construction began as an
idea between two friends and eventual co-
founders, Pat McCown and Brett Gordon, who
dreamed of starting their own construction
company. Their main priority was to create a
workplace that would prioritize their employ-
ees, better serve their clients, and give back
to the community. They made this dream a re-
ality through dedication, perseverance, and
hard work in July of 1999. During the labor
shortage of recent years when many construc-
tion companies struggled to find employees,
McCownGordon Construction managed to en-
dure by investing in the development of its
team. The business tripled its training budget
in order to be prepared for business growth
when the economy bounced back. Due to this
training initiative, McCownGordon is consist-
ently hiring qualified and strong candidates in
order to continue providing the best for its cli-
ents.
In 2013, McCownGordon Construction was
named Business Philanthropist of the Year by
Nonprofit Connect because of its consistent
commitment to giving back to Kansas City.
The company devotes at least 10 percent of
net profits to worthy causes in the commu-
nities it serves. The company’s craftsmanship
and involvement in the Ronald McDonald
Longfellow House aided in providing tem-
porary housing for families with sick children
receiving medical treatment. Along with the
R.A. Bloch Foundation, McCownGordon col-
laborated in renovating a portion of the Cancer
Survivor’s Park as well. Multiple projects for
one of Kansas City’s treasures, the
NelsonAtkins Museum of Art, have also been
completed by McCownGordon Construction.
Thousands of visitors and Kansas City natives
can view priceless and rare works of art in the
newly renovated exhibits. Beautiful places like
these are preserved and enjoyed by many be-
cause of the unwavering support of companies
like McCownGordon Construction. These con-
tributions and collaborations demonstrate how
McCownGordon Construction has proven to
be an invaluable part of Missouri’s Fifth Con-
gressional District.
Today, McCownGordon Construction em-
ploys around 400 staff, all of whom contribute
to the company in various ways. Construction
workers, architects, management, and admin-
istrative staff all work together in order to cre-
ate meaningful projects and buildings.
McCownGordon is entirely employee-owned,
so all employees have a stake through the
Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The com-
pany’s innovative and ambitious vision for the
future and for the community drives
McCownGordon Construction’s success.
McCownGordon sets itself apart by focusing
on growing positive relationships between em-
ployees and clients, while adhering to its core
values. The company’s positive and commu-
nicative workplace environment prompted it to
be named one of the best places to work by
Fortune, the Kansas City Business Journal,
and others.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
McCownGordon Construction and its employ-
ees for their hard work, perseverance, and
commitment to their community. Together,
they have made it possible to achieve this
monumental twentieth anniversary.

Billy was an honorable public servant, serv-

omy of our State. He was the champion of the
1987 infrastructure plan that established a
four-lane highway system across Mississippi,
which brought more businesses into the State
that created thousands of jobs for Mississip-
pians. Billy is directly responsible for bettering
the lives of thousands of people.
Billy was respected by all lawmakers across
the aisle as he lived his life true to Jesus’
words: ‘‘love thy neighbor as thyself.’’ Left to
cherish his memory is his wife, Edith, his two
children, Sam and Kim, as well as all of the
people who had the pleasure of working with
him. Billy’s life was one of service, grace, and
love for his community. He will be greatly
missed by all whom he encountered.

HONORING MICHAEL MERY
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in memory of West Marin community
leader Michael Mery, who passed away on
September 28, 2019, at the age of 80, after a
lifetime of service.
Mr. Mery was raised in Inverness, where his
family ran the post office, and he attended
local schools through his graduation from
Drake High School. As a youth, he spent
many days exploring Tomales Bay and the
area that would become the Point Reyes Na-
tional Seashore. The experiences left him with
a lifelong love for the region’s natural beauty
and rural character.
Mr. Mery was a deeply rooted advocate for
his beloved West Marin community and lived
in Point Reyes Station at the time of his pass-
ing. He was instrumental in the creation of the
West Marin Fund and a key figure in the cre-
ation of the fund’s community grants and Giv-
ing Through Youth programs. The community
grants program has disbursed nearly $3 mil-
lion to local nonprofits thanks in large part to
Michael’s vision and leadership. The Giving
Through Youth program was a particular pas-
sion of his; the program teaches local students
how to research organizations for grant oppor-
tunities.
Michael’s activism served to sustain and
nurture the agricultural community he called
home for most of his life. He worked variously
as a carpenter and as an organizer with the
International Development Exchange, and ably
brought his life experiences to bear as a de-
voted advocate for economic and social jus-
tice. He helped launch the West Marin Clinic

health and well-being of West Marin’s resi-
dents and natural wonders.
Mr. Mery’s passing leaves some very big
shoes to fill, but thanks to his commitment to
youth empowerment, a new generation of
West Marin youth have come to the fore to
bring his community message into the 21st
Century. Michael is survived by Connie, his
wife of 35 years, his sister Megan, and numer-
ous stepchildren, grandchildren, nieces and
nephews.
Madam Speaker, the depth of Mr. Mery’s
service to his community has left a positive
legacy across Marin County. He will be pro-
foundly missed. It is therefore appropriate that
we pay tribute to him today and honor his

RECOGNIZING THOMAS GOYETTE
FOR THE 2019 MONTANA CON-
GRESSIONAL VETERAN COM-
MENDATION
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Thomas Goyette of Butte,
a recipient of the 2019 Montana Congres-
sional Veteran Commendation for his service
to his country and leadership in his commu-
nity.
Mr. Goyette is a veteran of the United
States Navy. He served from 1967 to 1970
during the Vietnam War earning the National
Defense Service Award, Navy Unit Com-
mendation, Vietnam Service Award and RVN
Gallantry Cross Unit Citation, and attained the
rank of Petty Officer 3rd Class.
Serving his community as a volunteer for
the American Legion, his local VFW and the
United Veterans Council, Mr. Goyette has
dedicated in his life to helping others. He’s
spent more than 20 years serving rural com-
munities working as a registered nurse and
volunteering with the local ambulance serv-
ices. It’s hard to find a rural community Mr.
Goyette hasn’t volunteered in. He’s also pro-
vided many hours in continuing education
services for ambulance crews around the state
of Montana.
Mr. Goyette also has been the coordinator
for his local Honor Guard for several years
where he communicates with funeral directors
and personnel to make sure fallen officers and
retired officers are given the respect they de-
serve.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in
commending Thomas Goyette for his dedica-
tion and service.

IN HONOR OF ROGER PENSKE
HON. MIKE KELLY
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor a man who has achieved
greatness in motorsports, business, and in his
community. On October 24th, Roger Penske
was awarded the highest honor a civilian can
receive, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
This award is not given lightly. According to
the White House, to receive such an honor
one must either contribute ‘‘to the security or
national interests of the United States, world
peace, cultural or significant public or private
endeavors.’’ It is fair to say, that Mr. Penske
has done much in his life to grow his commu-
nity into a better place and his business into
the global industry leader it is today.
Mr. Penske has had significant success in
both auto racing and business for more than
50 years. After forming his own auto racing
team in 1965, Team Penske has won over
500 races and 36 national championships.
The team’s most recent wins include the 2018
NASCAR championship and 2019 Indianapolis
500, which marks a record breaking 18 Indian-
apolis 500 victories for a team owner.
Since starting his own car dealership in
1969, Penske Corporation has expanded into
a company that generates $32 billion in reve-
nues and employs approximately 64,000 peo-
ple. However, Mr. Penske is not only a man
with a mind for business, he is also a man
with a generous heart. In 2005 he was named
Michiganian of the Year after vowing to spend
$35 million, in order to revive and restore
neighborhoods in Detroit. Just as Penske Cor-
poration is an exceptional example of a great
American business, so also is Roger Penske
an outstanding example of an American cit-
izen. Our country is fortunate to have Roger
Penske as a role model for generations to
come. I offer Mr. Penske my sincere congratu-
lations on this prestigious honor.

a recipient of the 2019 Montana Congres-
sional Veteran Commendation for his service
to his country and leadership in his commu-

Mr. Longfellow is a veteran of the United

with distinction on the USS Coral Sea CV 43
aircraft carrier. During his enlistment Dale
earned nominations to the United States Naval
Academy and the Merchant Marine Academy
and attained the rank of Petty Officer Second

Mr. Longfellow has served his community in
many ways. As a volunteer emergency med-
ical technician, as mayor of Hobson, and as a
dynamic businessman who for many years
employed numerous people in the community.
Mr. Longfellow is known as the person you
go to for advice and the one you call if you’re

use words like upright, moral and compas-
sionate to describe him. He is a role model to
his children and everyone else in his commu-

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my friend from Tennessee and my good friend
from California for their leadership of our Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. They are a dynamic
duo.
Their visits to Little Rock, Arkansas, both as
Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Com-
mittee, gave local Arkansans a direct voice to
leaders in Congress to discuss many of the
issues they deal with on a daily basis.
It was a pleasure to host them, and the ac-
cessibility they have shown to hear from peo-
ple in Arkansas and across the Nation speaks
to the type of leadership both provide atop the
House Veterans Affairs Committee.
I appreciate their kind words about Arkan-
sas and my veterans team in the district,
which works tirelessly to ensure the brave
men and women who serve in our armed
forces receive the benefits and care they de-
serve.
I appreciate the opportunity to be on the
floor to be in support of this list of good bills
tonight.
Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to thank my
friend from New Jersey, Mr. KIM, for his hard
work and collaboration on this important bill for
our veterans.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1434 November 13, 2019
Mr. Speaker, in the last 5 years I have
served in this House, I have had over 3,200
cases completed and closed for veterans in
my district.
As a former community banker, when I look
at those cases and I listen to these stories,
this too often is a challenge for our veterans.
It is a crazy challenge. Mr. Speaker, that with-
holding a payment can have severe con-
sequences for our brave veterans who are out
there just doing their job, through no fault of
their own and through a computer mess up or
an IT problem, our veterans receive an over-
payment and then suddenly get a letter a few
weeks later saying, ‘‘Oh, hey, we made a mis-
take. You owe us $5,000 back.’’
Well, the normal American, Mr. Speaker,
doesn’t have that kind of financial planning ex-
pertise, and relies on the quality of our VA
services to not make mistakes like that.
So, it is a pleasure to work with Mr. KIM on
this measure to try to improve that situation
and answer the IG’s own report at the VA that
this is a serious problem affecting over 1.5
million veterans.
This bill tries to tackle this issue by improv-
ing Veterans Administration IT systems, which
are often the cause of this challenge, and of-
fers veterans that unknowingly are forced to
go without their earned benefits for extended
periods of time some recourse on being a vic-
tim of an overpayment and have their credit
impaired.
I am proud to represent veterans from
Camp Robinson and Little Rock Air Force
Base in our central Arkansas area. I am proud
to work on something that rectifies a common
problem across this country.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New
Jersey for his work and for the leadership of
the committee for bringing this bill to the
House floor.

RECOGNIZING MCMILLAN ELEMEN-
TARY AS AN AWARDEE OF THE
NATIONAL BLUE-RIBBON
HON. BEN McADAMS
OF UTAH
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, parents,
teachers and students in the Murray City
School District are celebrating the 2019 Na-
tional Blue-Ribbon Schools award to McMillan
Elementary School. This award brings public
attention to the best schools in America. Fit-
tingly, it was the brainchild of a former Utah
Commissioner of Higher Education—Terrel H.
Bell—who served as Education Secretary
under President Ronald Reagan. Dr. Bell be-
lieved that through the real action of teaching
and learning, families and educators could
work together to articulate a vision of excel-
lence. He believed that by holding everyone to
high standards, local schools could become
the best at preparing their students for aca-
demic success.
The 498 students of McMillan Elementary,
their teachers, Principal Joy Sanford, and par-
ents, have risen to the challenge. The school
is named for a family who formerly owned the
property around the school. It is the only
school in the Murray School District to be
named after a local family. Education is vitally
important to this community. Home to the Mur-
ray District Gifted and Talented Program, Mc-
Millan Elementary held its first Science, Tech-
nology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Night,
featuring local business professionals who
spoke about rewarding careers in those fields.
Public schools nominated for the National
Blue-Ribbon Schools award must be top-per-
formers in the state on English and math as-
sessments and must meet their state’s per-
formance targets such as attendance and
graduation rates for all student groups. The
National Blue-Ribbon School award acknowl-
edges and validates the hard work of stu-
dents, educators, families and communities.
McMillan Elementary now serves as a model
of effective school practices. Others will look
to them for how to achieve academic success.
Dr. Bell would be very proud. Principal San-
ford should be very proud. Everyone associ-
ated with education in Utah salutes McMillan
Elementary School’s success and congratu-
lates them on receiving this prestigious award.

a recipient of the 2019 Montana Congres-
sional Veteran Commendation for his service
to his country and leadership in his commu-
nity.
Dr. Madill served in the United States Army
from 2004 to 2013 as a member of the med-
ical corps attaining the rank of Major. He is a
veteran of the 101st Combat Aviation Bridge
for Operation Enduring Freedom where he
earned the Air Medal with Valor Device, the
Bronze Star, and the Meritorious Service
Medal.
While serving in Afghanistan during the Bat-
tle of Want, Dr. Madill extracted the wounded
Staff Seargent General Ryan Pitts on July 13,
2008. Staff Seargent General Pitts was later
the recipient of the Medal of Honor for his ac-
tions. Dr. Madill was a guest of the President
of the United States at the Medal of Honor
ceremony.
Since returning to Montana, Dr. Madill works
as an emergency physician in Great Falls
where he’s delivered care to thousands of
Montanans. He continues to create special
bonds with his patients both veteran and non-
veteran where he receives numerous thank
you cards for his care and compassion.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in

INTRODUCTION OF THE WOMEN
WHO WORKED ON THE HOME
FRONT WORLD WAR II MEMO-
RIAL ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Women Who Worked on the
Home Front World War II Memorial Act, which
would authorize the establishment of a memo-
rial on federal land in the District of Columbia
commemorating the efforts of the 18 million
American women who kept the home front
running during World War II. Women are dra-
matically underrepresented in our memorials.
A 17-year-old constituent, Raya Kenney, the
founder of the non-profit Women Who Worked
on the Home Front Foundation, came up with
the idea to honor the women on the home
front who supported the World War II effort.
Raya wondered why the women on the home
front, whose efforts were so instrumental in
maintaining the stability of the country during
World War II, have not received much recogni-
tion for their contributions, compared to the
men who fought bravely in World War II. This
bill would authorize the Women Who Worked
on the Home Front Foundation to establish the
memorial to honor these women. The memo-
rial is designed to be interactive and to edu-
cate visitors on the important roles women
played during World War II.
Between 1940 and 1945, the percentage of
women in the workforce increased from 27
percent to nearly 37 percent, and by 1945 one
in four married women worked outside of the
home. The work done by women on the home
front opened doors for women in the work-
place generally and had a profound effect on
the job market going forward. As a result of
their efforts, women on the home front rede-
fined many occupations that were previously
considered ‘‘men’s work.’’
Just as women were working on the home
front, many played critical roles in support of
the war effort. More than 10,000 women
served behind the scenes of World War II as
codebreakers. Due to the classified nature of
their work, they did not receive recognition for
their tireless efforts until recently. Women
were also trained to fly military aircraft so male
pilots could leave for combat duty overseas.
More than 1,100 female civilian volunteers
flew nearly every type of military aircraft as
part of the Women Airforce Service Pilots
(WASP) program. WASP flew planes from fac-
tories to bases, transported cargo and partici-
pated in simulation strafing and target mis-
sions. These women were not given full mili-
tary status until 1977, and it was not until
2010 that they were recognized with the Con-
gressional Gold Medal.
Women have largely been ignored in the
memorials on federal land in the nation’s cap-
ital, even though they played a key role in

World War II. Millions of American women
took jobs to support their families and the
country at large during World War II, rede-

of these contributions, it is important that
women who worked on the home front be
properly recognized in the nation’s capital.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING THE 5TH ANNUAL
NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP WEEK
HON. MARK POCAN
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, during the
5th annual National Apprenticeship Week, I
recognize the success of the Registered Ap-
prenticeship system, which has been the
model workforce development policy in the
United States for over eight decades.
Over the next decade, 45 percent of all jobs
will require more than a high school diploma,
but won’t necessitate a bachelor’s degree.
Registered Apprenticeship programs hold the
key to preparing a new wave of working peo-
ple for these jobs and ensuring all people
have the adequate resources for economic
stability. The Registered Apprenticeship pro-
gram model has proven success in skilled
trades and service industries for both workers
and employers, with every dollar invested in a
craft apprenticeship yielding up to $3 in return
for employers.
My state of Wisconsin has been a leader in
Apprenticeship training since 1911, when we
established the nation’s first apprenticeship
law. That first year, Wisconsin had 625 ap-
prentices, and its state law became a model
for the National Apprenticeship Act in 1937—
the first federal apprenticeship law. Building on
a century of success, Wisconsin now has over
11,000 active apprentices and 2,500 employ-
ers in construction, industrial trades, utilities,
healthcare, service trades, and IT.
Congress should continue to build on the
Registered Apprenticeship system to extend
workforce training opportunities to more work-
ers—especially women, people of color, and
those from disadvantaged communities. Con-
gress should also seek to integrate appren-
ticeship readiness programs, secondary and
post-secondary education systems, and sup-
port services to ensure that more workers and
employers can participate successfully in Reg-
istered Apprenticeships. Most importantly,
Congress must uphold the strong standards
for Registered Apprenticeship so that appren-
tices have confidence that they will have their
rights protected and receive transferable, na-
tionally recognized credentials.

Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Thirty years ago, Bernard, alongside Nat
Adkins and Cynthia Barrett, helped form
OCuSoft, a ground-breaking company in my
district specializing in the research, develop-
ment and supply of skin and eye care prod-
ucts. They are a pioneer in their field, inno-
vating many new products including the first
commercially available eyelid cleanser.
Mr. Halloran embodies everything that’s
great about America—entrepreneurship, inno-
vation and job creation. It’s inspiring to think
about all the advances that will take place
within the building bearing his name in the
years to come.
I had the pleasure of speaking at the dedi-
cation ceremony, where I asked who was in
favor of naming the new building after Ber-
nard.
Needless to say, the ‘‘EYES’’ had it.
Congratulations to OCuSoft and Bernard T.
Halloran on this tremendous achievement.

Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Dale Daniels as she is honored
by the Center for Holocaust, Human Rights &
Genocide Education (Chhange) at its 2019
Testimonial Dinner. Ms. Daniels’ exemplary
leadership and contributions to Chhange are
truly deserving of this body’s recognition.
Since 1979, the Center for Holocaust,
Human Rights & Genocide Education has
striven to educate the public, eradicate preju-
dice and serve as a resource to the commu-
nity on Holocaust, genocide and other human
rights issues. Its efforts to bring attention to
human and civil rights violations and to honor
the victims and survivors of genocide are truly
commendable. Ms. Daniels’ nearly 25 years of
service to Chhange are indicative of her dedi-
cation to the organization and its mission to
create change.
Joining Chhange (then the Center for Holo-
caust Studies) as a volunteer in 1995 after
hearing a Holocaust survivor’s story, Dale
Daniels quickly found her passion. Soon after,
she served as a member of the Board of Di-
rectors and an interviewer for the Survivors of
the Shoah Foundation. In 2000, Ms. Daniels
became the first Executive Director of the or-
ganization, and under her leadership,
Chhange has grown immensely and expanded
its programs and outreach.
With her direction, Chhange has produced
exhibits, books, films and installations that
educate and engage the public while paying
tribute to the victims. It has also created and
maintains the first and only Holocaust and
genocide archives in New Jersey and offers
training for law enforcement, clergy and juve-
nile hate crime offenders. Its work with
schools, organizations and communities en-
able individuals to better understand historical
and present-day atrocities and human rights
abuses and foster a more tolerant and inclu-
sive society. Ms. Daniels’ vision and connec-
tion to the issues she promotes have made
Chhange an invaluable resource that has an
extraordinary impact on the community.
Madam Speaker, please join me in leading
this body in recognition of Dale Daniels for her
tireless dedication and advocacy.

HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN
OF RHODE ISLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, as a co-
chair of the Congressional Career and Tech-
nical Education Caucus, I’m pleased to recog-
nize the fifth annual National Apprenticeship
Week.
For over 80 years, the Registered Appren-
ticeship system has helped train the next gen-
eration of skilled workers. By combining paid
on-the-job training with related classroom in-
struction, apprenticeships allow students to
earn while they learn, preparing them for high-
skill, high-paying jobs in in-demand industries.
This model has been particularly successful
in the building trades, which have used reg-
istered apprenticeships to train their skilled
workforce for decades. Moving forward, as we
make investments to rebuild our nation’s infra-
structure, it will be even more important to
support registered apprenticeships in the
building trades and other related industries.
I’m a proud cosponsor of Congressman
POCAN’s legislation, the Leveraging Effective
Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills Act,
which would establish a national apprentice-
ship advisory council and support the develop-
ment of pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship
programs that lead to postsecondary degrees.
In my home state of Rhode Island, appren-
ticeships culminating in postsecondary de-
grees are very successful. At Quonset Point,
Electric Boat operates an apprenticeship pro-
gram in partnership with the Community Col-
lege of Rhode Island. Electric Boat appren-
tices training in the maritime pipe and struc-
tural trades will finish the program with both a
certificate and an Associate’s degree, ready
for a high-paying career.

CELEBRATING POLAND’S HISTORIC
DEMOCRATIC BREAKTHROUGH
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker,
today we continue celebrating Poland’s his-
toric democratic breakthrough 30 years ago
that led to its matriculation from dictatorship to
democracy.
Today, we honor the bravery, tenacity, dis-
cipline and innate goodness of Nobel Peace
Prize Laureate Lech Walesa and Solidarity.
Some time ago, I read Lech Walesa’s pow-
erful and riveting autobiography, ‘‘A Way of
Hope.’’ Filled with insight and brutally honest,
the book walks the reader through a series of
volatile events—personal and public—that
have literally transformed the world.
In the book, we get a glimpse into Lech Wa-
lesa’s deep faith—and the role his beloved
mother, and her Catholic beliefs had on him;
‘‘Neighbors came to our house to say the ro-
sary,’’ he tells us in the book. The book is
filled with remembrances of family—and his
love for his wife.
On leadership he tells us: ‘‘I’ve never
wished or prepared for a leadership role: para-
doxically, it’s because I never really wanted it,
absorbed as I was by quite different concerns,
different problems which needed solving, that
I found myself out in front, leading the oth-
ers—‘leading the flock,’ I call it with a smile.’’
He tells us of the strike of 1970. ‘‘All we
wanted was to free our fellow workers, we
wanted no violence.’’ And that his worst fears
were realized: ‘‘Poles had fired against Poles.’’
In the chapter ‘‘The Strike and the August
Agreement’’ he tells us how the movement
had matured:
‘‘Until then I had been talking, bluffing,
playing ‘on credit.’ Although we pretended
to be holding all the high cards, our oppo-
nents knew our game inside out, they’d been
playing against us for years! But what they
didn’t know was the nature of our very last
card: the determination that had been ma-
turing for ten years now, since the death of
three of our colleagues right in front of the
second entrance to the shipyard.’’
When His Holiness Pope John Paul II made
his historic trip to his homeland in 1979, he
counseled his flock and his country men and
women, ‘‘Be Not Afraid.’’ But Lech Walesa
gave us additional insight into how Solidarity
and Pope John Paul II were ‘‘inextricably
bound together’’ and how it almost ended in
1981:
‘‘It was in Japan that we heard of the dra-
matic attempt on the Pope’s life. The news
broke in the middle of the night May 13–14,
1981. We were in my hotel room in Nagasaki,
discussing the events of the day, and our
visit the next day to the museum set up in
memory of the victims of the atomic bomb.
The first news flash was terrifying: the Pope
was dead! The next news flash retracted it:
no, the Pope was still alive, he was fighting
for his life. I was overcome by a feeling of
immense loneliness; the whole world seemed
to have turned upside down; with our
lodestar gone, some of us were wandering in
a wilderness without hope. The tragedy of
the Polish Pope was also the tragedy of Po-
land and of Solidarity: they were inex-
tricably bound together; this was just the be-
ginning. Then the news changed, became less
alarming; there was still hope.’’
In his chapter ‘‘Martial Law,’’ Lech Walesa
tells us how they decided that if the militia in-
vaded the shipyard during the night, they de-
cided on passive resistance: ‘‘Our greatest
strength is precisely our weakness—our living
bodies and empty hands confronting tanks
and nightsticks.’’
His wife Danuta writes in the book how she
was discouraged when he was locked up dur-
ing marital law but ‘‘he seemed rather pleas-
ant, . . . we had to be dignified about it all,
become even in a place like this, we still had
the upper hand; we not they were making his-
tory.’’
By 1989, Solidarity leaders sat across the
table from General Jaruzelski, the same Gen-
eral who had imposed martial law in 1981.
And they negotiated what had seemed to most
of the world impossible: the peaceful transition
from communism to free and fair elections. In
August of 1989, less than a decade after the
Gdansk shipyard strikes that gave birth to Sol-
idarity, Poland would elect its first non-com-
munist Prime Minister since the communist
takeover.
Then Lech Walesa himself became Presi-
dent.
Lech Walesa tells us in the book that in his
school years ‘‘history was my weak point.’’
Studying history does not matter when you
are the one who makes history by bringing
freedom, respect for human rights, and endur-
ing democracy not only to your own country,
but many other nations as well.

RECOGNIZING HAROLD RIENSCHE
FOR THE 2019 MONTANA CON-
GRESSIONAL VETERAN COM-
MENDATION
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Harold Riensche Senior of
Reed Point, a recipient of the 2019 Montana
Congressional Veteran Commendation for his
service to his county and leadership in his
community.
Mr. Riensche is a veteran of the United
States Marine Corps. He is a Vietnam veteran
who served in the 3rd Tank Battalion, 3rd Ma-
rine Division earning awards like the Navy
Cross, and attaining the rank of Master Gun-
nery Sergeant.
During the Vietnam War, Mr. Riensche and
his crew were assigned to recover a disabled
tank. During this mission, their vehicle deto-
nated a mine. While repairing their vehicle, the
Marines came under heavy fire. In an instant,
two of Staff Sergeant Riensche’s crew were
killed and two others were wounded leaving
him alone to defend his injured crew and dam-
aged vehicle. With the help of a few grenades
and unmatched bravery, Mr. Riensche was
able to fight off the Northern Vietnamese sol-
diers by himself until backup arrived. His quick
action and heroism saved the lives of his two
fellow Marines.
After completing his military service, Mr.
Riensche served as a member of the Still-
water County Weed control Board and Presi-
dent of the local community landowner’s asso-
ciation. His friends and neighbors say Mr.
Riensche never hesitates to help when asked
upon.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in
commending Harold Riensche Senior for his
dedication and service.
